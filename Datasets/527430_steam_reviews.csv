I have so many offline games to play on the rare occasion my connection goes out, I'm willing to look past it for a game I really enjoy.

(Update: offline mode will be added soon)

The connection has been 100% smooth so far and it runs well.  I have all the settings maxed and resolution at 2160p, and it looks quite nice for a 4.5 year old indie game (better than I was expecting).

More important than the visuals though, as a fan of both Diablo-style ARPGs and 40k, this game rocks!  The classes seem diverse and unique.  The itemization and potential for build variety seems great.  There are nice QoL features, UI design, and cleanly presented info to manage it all.

Love the soundtrack too, especially its subtle tone during missions.  The music, sound effects, and art-style fit the 40k setting very well.

The cover system and destructible environments are features I've never seen in a Diablo-style game.  I haven't used the cover system much, but it seems to be implemented well, and it's interesting to see the enemies using it too.  The destructible environments and effects are very cool, including physics-based debris.

You are going to have a hard time enjoying it in the long run.

The game offers a different perspective to the 40k universe. The game offers players the opportunity to play as an ""inquisitor"" who can come from different backgrounds. You can play as a tech-adept (techpriest / skitarii), a crusader (arbites / imperial guard), an assassin (officio assasinorum operative), or as a sister of battle (adepta sororitas; chamber militant of the ecclesiarchy. Fluff-wise this gives a unique and rather personal insight as to how the lesser known militant factions within the imperium operates. Moreover, the weapon mechanic in the game is a rather good depiction as to how the weapons work on tabletop; i.e. melta ignores armor and cover, plasma overheats quickly, etc. etc.

The game is best enjoyed with a friend / a group of friends because you will need to coordinate a lot in higher difficulties. And of course, as the usual ARPG goes, the good loots come from these type of contents.

 [*]Optimalization. If I compare it to Diablo IV, for example, this is poorly optimized. One time it goes 130 fps avg with 99 - 1% on top, then halfway through the mission it goes 45 fps avg with 42 -1%.
 [*]Mission content - Kill everything, kill something, capture VIP, take points, destroy something, collect information.
 [*]Necessity to buy DLC for a complete experience (fortunately, there are often different Bundles with a significant discount)

All around a very pleasant game from the world of W40k. Yes, it has its faults. The optimization could have been better, the content of the missions would need processing. But you slaughter legions of enemies, shoot traitor Astartes in the head, and serve the mighty Inquisition. Yes, it could have been better, but it's still fun.

This game has grown and grown and grown. I think it has easily cemented it's place in my heart as my favourite ARPG of all time. That's right, even more than Diablo 2.   

This to me, now, is the Diablo 4 I always wanted.  Diablo IN SPACE!    And it's a million times better than that garbage blizzard pumps out. 

  There are still dozens of problems and irk points riddling the game, but by god, it's nit picking. Some examples tho;
The missions with the Imperial Knight and the Tank are a great idea, but they are implemented SO poorly, as such a tacked on after-thought; they just suck.  What good is a giant walking war machine that can't shoot anything more than 20 meters away?  It can walk through walls that are supposed to be made of super-future-concrete as if they were styrofoam, but gets stuck on a lamp post?  Why are the bad guys calling this giant machine ""Inquisitor""?  Why would a couple rebel guardsmen alone and on foot run at a giant unstoppable killing machine?  How come for a game that talks about fear so much, not a single soul ever even so much as hesitates in the face of absolute impending doom?  Anyway, those missions had so much potential, but fell so flat.  

But goodness me, I LOVE the level design and the mission variety       

 This game is FUN.   The weapons are hella satisfying, and cleaving through hordes of demons  or machine gunning mutants or burninating the heretics or eviscerating a cult of liberals..I mean chaos worshippers, is just pure delight.  

Late game grind is... for a different kind of person than me.  I understand it is very good for those that are into that sort of thing, where as I would rather bring 10 characters up to level 50, than grind more than one up to 100, but i aint there and aint looking to go there, so whateves.

It's a little repetitive, as are most hack and slash games, the character progression is convoluted by using separate menus for separate passive abilities.

The game won't connect to the server, and I'm not the only one with this problem.

The discussion forums here on steam have quite a few entries about this issue. I have contacted Neocore in the past through email, asking if there was anything that could be done, after a few trial and error file patches sent by email, I was told that I would have to uninstall and reinstall every once in a while to see if it improves the problem, since they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the connection. While I can't say that I wasted my money here, I will state that I'm disappointed that the team couldn't fix a problem they created, maybe instead of pouring time into making more costly DLC, they should seriously get to the bottom of the problem, before the customers of this game who can't use it decide not to by anything from Neocore again.

This is one of my favorite Diablo-esque games. Beating out its current namesake and other popular options like Path of Exile. The reason is really quite simple. It’s not subject to the whims of continuous balance changes. The missions and difficulty are straightforward so you can tailor your experience to reflect your desired difficulty with each mission.

Are there bugs? Yes. Are there some janky things? (Imperfect animations and textures?) Yes. At its root it’s a fun game in the WH40k aesthetic, and while I would prefer less imperfections it’s fun. The developers have been honest about their income streams and nothing you can get as DLC could influence their balance choices or game design. Some DLC is cosmetic, some are extra missions, some story or classes. It’s all basically what it says on the tin, and the developers couldn’t make more money by screwing with drop rates (filling stash tabs with junk). They also haven’t shown any interest in changes for the sake of “balance”. Every class is fun in its own way, but I do have my preferences.
Some weak points in the game include the story, and weapon/stat diversity. Don’t get me wrong it feels like there’s a fair amount of variety in the game, and the choices are impactful. That being said, more is always better and I do wish that more enemy types and map tiles were being dropped.

While this game is still supported, I would like to see some more bug squashing and performance improvements. They aren’t terribly impactful at this point, and frankly I’d like to see more discussion about a sequel that could be more focused and improve upon this title.

I do want to state that the classes are fun and I did enjoy the campaign content. The end game and seasonal goals are where things break down.

During this season I put in over 195 hours across all of my characters. On my main character, I put in 123 hours. During that time, I never did find the armour I needed to complete my basic build. Even if I had, the enchant on it would have to roll at least a 15%, and I could have easily had one drop with say 14% modifier, which would have still been useless. The chances of getting what you need to drop is astronomical, and I don't know how they calculate loot drops. If they changed how the crafting system worked, then I wouldn't have had to experience that kind of torture and still end up fruitless after that many hours. 

 There is a tarot card upgrade system that is important for end game progression. One of the season goals was to upgrade one to rank 3. If you don't know how the system works before you start upgrading them; which is likely most players as it requires research outside of the game, then you've just inadvertently added, weeks or months of randomness to the rank 3 goal in mere moments. 

After a total of 195 hours I finally completed tier 3 of the season goals. I thought that was it, but then to my horror, tier 4 popped up on my screen with the season ending in one day. I looked at the goals for that one and my eyes nearly popped out of my head. Most players will never be able to complete them. You'd have to make this game your job or to become an addict to be able to put that kind of time into it to complete what is required. I played excessively, far more than most people have the luxury or patience for, and still didn't accomplish it. 

In the end, I don't know how they do the maths to determine that the numbers that they have settled on in the game are reasonable, but I can assure you they aren't.

Highly customisable difficulty for missions. Decent progression and build system. When its working, you really feel like an Inquisitor, some offkey overpowered as hell Space Marine kind of character.

It also looks quite beautiful on the maximum settings, largely due to the insanely ridiculous scale and aesthetic of the architecture in 40k lore.

This is one of the best ARPGs out there gameplay wise, the only set back in my opinion is the kind of uninteresting loot and item system that sees you just collecting copy paste items with different stats, for the most part, all the way to max level.

There are some unique items and you can customise how they, and your character looks to such a degree that it negates a lot of the badness of the items, but the game still does not have the same draw that games like Diablo 2 do because of it.

Overall, I recommend this game, especially seeing as they KEEP WORKING ON IT, have been releasing new content for years and have just.... made it all free?

Story is entertaining. I didn't have much prior experience with the WH40k universe, but I still enjoyed all the characters talking funny in High Gothic.

There is no open world; the game consists of small missions, 5-10 minutes long. This makes it perfect for short gaming sessions. You can also control the difficulty for every mission individually. When playing alone, the game pauses when you hit escape or open the inventory.

During the campaign, there are a couple of missions where you have to pilot some giant robot or tank, and these missions suck because of poor controls.

If you don't have friends to play with, multiplayer is pretty much dead: you can find maybe 1 active party per session, and it's usually a high-level character helping to power level someone. I was playing 3 months into the current season, so it could be better at the start of the next one.

There is a bunch of stuff to do (void crusade, assignments, warzone missions, an endless mode, wave survival mode, random missions) after the campaign is over, but they all boil down to the same short missions you did during the campaign. This is actually better than D2 Baal runs, similar to PoE mapping but with almost no meta-progression. The only interesting mode is Void Crusade, where you kind of have to complete some 10-20 missions consecutively, and your choices and actions affect rewards in the final mission. However, these Void Crusades are pre-generated, and you will end up running the same path over and over again; there are guides with the most optimal farming routes.

End game gearing is fun because you have options to target farm gear using mission modifiers (seals or tarot cards). And then you have a way to reroll stats on gear, even increase items level (not to the max level though) and add sockets via crafting systems. The sockets system is really nice; you can insert and remove socketables for free. The game has a great implementation of runes / runewords as Psalm Codes and Psalm Doctrines: you can actually play with the best ones because of target farm and the ability to craft top-tier Psalms from lower tiers.

There is seasonal stuff, very similar to Diablo 3; it's fun to complete it once. The game is near its end of life, and devs decided to make all the seasonal stuff available starting later in Jan 2024, which is a nice move.

You can buy (at least some of) DLCs with in-game currency, which is also nice.

[h3]Playing on Steam Deck[/h3]
Works well in handheld mode, but on the first launch, you have to enable the controller by using KBD + Mouse. You can't reassign skills shortcuts for some classes (Crusader for example), which is really dumb; there is no way to reassign a skill from X to RT without messing up in-game menus as well.

Earlier in the game, performance is good; you can probably play through all the campaign missions (something up to character level 40-50) with high settings, 50 fps locked on 2560x1080 resolution (btw, you can't set it that high in-game, need to go to Steam's game properties).

But the endgame is full of large enemy groups, AoEs, and other visual clutter, and the game starts to stutter on it. I had to switch to low settings and disable almost everything, and still, performance is not great, 30-40 fps, occasional half-second freezes when some huge AoE goes off or some boss dies and the game calculates all the drops.

To enable an additional controller, you need to activate Steam Input in the game properties. After that I was able to connect my Deck to TV and play with another controller.

Some text is unreadable; to workaround it, I configured the left touchpad as a magnifier (on-click = System / Toggle Magnifier, and the entire touchpad to behave as a mouse).",1705180645,1706942930,True,18,0,0.69126051664352417,0,True,False,False

You can only join coop campaign missions with characters that have actually completed the campaign manually. This is just silly.

On the plus side, much of the desync lag seems to have been sorted.

However, this is still a thumbs down if you love coop. You should avoid this as another really strange design choice by the devs that limits playing together.

----------------------------------------------

I came back this 2 years later, and it is nice to see that the developers are still making changes, updating, and running seasons, but this is thumbs down, if you want to play the Tech Adept, or play coop, both of which I did!

The tech-adept has been added in such a way that you can't play through with your friends in the main campaign. That's right, for the tech-adept, you instead get a handful of missions that don't even level you up to the same place and you miss half the campaign, before you can join up with your other friends for the Prophecy campaign and end game only.

Coop is also janky - players de-syncing and not moving for the host (and not being able to damage anything as the joiner), and most importantly forced end of a level when the last objective is met - so you can't explore and WILL be forced out before you've picked up all of the loot and clues from the level (which you can't go back for in Campaign missions) - great choice devs! Oh, and there is a coop timer for reading things, which is far too fast to actually read anything in full - another great feature that means you will have no idea what's going on.

Ridiculous!

Outside of that, this is an okay SOLO game, set in the grimdark 40k universe with varied weapons and classes and slotable skills tied to these. The developers clearly love 40K and have tried to do it justice, but it's just not a very good game, with terrible coop.

Level design is uninspiring - wherever you are just seems to just use the same tiles.

My character is also clearly retarded - and thinks it a good idea to charge into a group of hostiles and have a conversation with the big boss, which then ends and you getting totally mullered and not being able to prep for it. You can try to start some psycher skills before he charges in like a moron, but these then end when the dialog starts and are put on fucking cooldown - come on? Seriously?

Oh, and random lag spikes even on a good pc - usually when loot drops or you use a pretty skill - again, really? Come on!

There is also a weird cover mechanic and something called suppression, that the game definitely doesn't need.

Individual missions are generally short and quite linear, but this makes for a more distilled and less 'explory' game, which is neither a negative or a positive.

Endgame looks good so far, with random assignments, warzones and void crusades to lengthen the experience.

See you in another 2 years again, to see if they removed the stupid timers and tidied up the

Although some report issues with the Co Op system, I'm happy to report that I've had absolutely ZERO issues with the system aside from a very rare crash. Connecting to a friend has to be done in game, and, the only way to play with a Tech Priest is to have any other Tech Priest, or a character who is on Chapter 6 in the story and on the same mission AS the Tech Priest.

(It could be Chapter 8, but because the Tech Adept starts later on in the campaign, any other class must be at that chapter after their tutorial to play with them and their missions on a campaign)

Besides that, all the classes are entertaining to play. Personally I've been a totally unhinged Psyker and the damage buffing is stupid high. I've also been playing the game up to four friends almost consistently.

There is also a Network Certification Fix/exemption written by the creators in the Steam Guides for anyone who can't connect to the Game Servers.... outside of all that, they're adding in a re-playable Seasonal Event system which is insane, and they're even making an update for an OFFLINE mode on top of it all.

I bought the game on sale, it's absolutely worth it and becomes a Diablo-like DarkTide, at least according to my friends and me, and has given us a strong amount of replay-ability with all the different classes to try.

I'd personally purchase the Definitive Edition, which I had done myself, but the only thing of genuine value is the DLC Classes, including the Tech Adept which is stupid fun

(But I SERIOUSLY wish you could play the Tech Adept at chapter one with friends, since the Tech Adept is stupid fun and I'd love to run the ENTIRE story with my friends as one.)

It's Diablo-style gameplay in a faithful Warhammer 40K setting. Absolutely nothing negative to say at the moment.

All Larping aside, with the developers releasing the seasonal journey, a new class coming this year and the Definitive Edition on a steep sale, this is the perfect time to start. Inquisitor: Martyr is really worth your time and money.

It's A LOT of game and A LOT of fun for the price. If you played any of the Diablo's or Path of Exile, this this is the game for you. 

If you are new to this like I was a wee 200 hours ago, don't worry. There is an active and thriving community. There are many video's and guides on Youtube for builds if you find character development a little daunting. I've followed two, one for the Psyker and one for a fire-based Sororitas and they are really paying off in the higher levels.  Be advised: leveling slows way down in the 80's and the grind is real. But that's the norm for these types of games.

My only regret is not playing this game sooner. However, in this hyper-saturated game market, it's easy for jewels like this one to fall between the cracks. 

This is a review in progress, so I will be updated this as I progress through the seasonal journey. I hope this helped someone.",1703350413,1706714989,True,2,0,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

+ They have added the ability to start a new character in the seasonal content and made all 7 seasons available to choose from. All that loot is available for you! So many builds waiting to get made. They also announced a new class that specializes in working as a squad of soldiers. Truly amazing news!

- But.... you have a seasonal stash and regular one. So your old characters are toast. All those things you farmed, the unlocks in the skilltree have fun doing those again.

+ You unlock skilltrees by performing certain actions during gameplay.

Check the passive skilltree for what those are and there are 3 perkslots which you can choose from, after unlocking them through leveling and also performing cerain actions or reaching specified goals

> New characters will gain access to these (some are restricted to a specific base charactertype) and you will be able to customize your character and playstile through them

+ This a topdown game and is controlled through mouse for movement and attack, keybind for gearabilities or pickups

+ One interesting thing is that there are characterspecific weapons and some gear which will only drop if you are using a character of that type, that way you are not overwhelmed with useless items

+ There are a lot of interesting item effects and possibilties for combinations with the skilltrees and abilities

> Every item has mutliple abilities which can be used to gain the upper hand in combat or hinder enemies from attacking you indiscriminately for example: the heavy flamer can spray holy punishment in front while moving toward or away from a target, it can set the ground on fire with another ability and knock weakened enemies to the ground
> Every item comes with a damagetype and other possible effects on their abilities, in order to check what those are leftclick an item in inventory and you are able to inspect an items abilites by hovering over it! You even get a handy desciption of the effects to the side of the screen. Praise the emporer!

+ There is a massive amount of missions and even chained missions where you take care of a whole investigation and make decisions, also moral decisions

> Be careful with those currently there is a radical path, nearly only usefull if you do warp damage and then there is a puritan path
/ check the passive skilltree for some information on those and then choose wisely, the devs might be reworking those soon
> There are also some other mission types and voidcrusades which you can take on (those an be hard, therefore be prepared!)

+ In order to spice things up you can apply tarotcards to missions which will give you certain effect like + exp, + gold, better loot, more loot, etc but these also make the game harder with crazy effect, like one nasty one I have succeded against was: Enemies gain + 20% damge for every passing minute, be aware! the emporer protects

+ It has a crafting system, so if nothing nice drops and you have the blueprints you can craft stuff with the right ressources and also change or enhance the effects on items if you have the research done for it

+ 6 playable charactertypes, I recommend to play the Tech-Adept later as his campaign plays after the maincampaign, yes there are 2 whole storycampaigns as of now and many sidemissions that add lorecontent!

- while there a lot of available mission- and enemytypes / factions to battle, the map variety is something that leaves things to be desired. I for one wish for more maptypes and also more diverse enviroments to purge the unclean in.

One idea I had is that it would also be nice with maps that follow after one another (investigations or warpath) if you could see the former map or one future maplocation, it would make the world feel much more alive!

Perhaps I got you interested in purging some foul xenos and chaosworshippers, yes? Have I mentioned that you can burn them alive? Or or...

Leveling up, unlike in PoE or Diablo, isn't going to change gameplay at all — the only things that change are your stats (since weapons are way too similar too each other), and also you gain new passive abilities and perks, that just... change your stats, but never your playstyle.

Maybe game dramatically changes somewhere at the high level?

Something i didnt realize since the first time playing is that the game is ALWAYS ONLINE, if you disconnect, tough shit, you. are. restarting. There is also ""maintenance time"" which prevents you from playing the game.
The install size is a ridiculous 80 GB, nothing you see, hear or experience warrant that massive install size, and the loading screens even on SSD, are loooong.
Controls are clunky at best, if this game controlled like Shadowgrounds, that would lift gameplay up massively, but would that still be worth it? Loot is everything in a game like this, but the loot you get is the same since lvl 1, the only difference i can think of is that the weapons get a little bit higher damage as you level up (ie the loot is boring).
Basically, find the weapon you find the most fun, and then replay the same missions over and over, the variety is minimal at most.

Enjoyment score is 49%
The clunkyness of the gameplay and the absolute booooring loot drags the score down.
Occasional fun with some of the weapons, but the vehicle missions dont give you XP or Loot which makes them pointless gimmicks. and then ofc, the online part..... eurgh!

************************
Its kinda boring. controls are messy. And a story you dont give a damn about.
The game has no clear ending, credits seem to roll in the middle of the campaign.
You never feel like you accomplished anything. There seem to be only 1 boss, a greater nurgle demon.
You dont have enough quests to fill either side of the morality bar, so something seems missing here.
the loot is boring, its the same items dropping over and over but with occasional different color class.

Now more on the subject, on the good side, well, W40K Diablo style, what more could you ask. Solid gameplay, different classes are fun to try out and it's fairly easy to respec so you can try different playstyles and skills, there are some nice builds you can put together to purge the xenos and the heretics and the like. The passive skills can be a bit overwhelming as they offer an abundance of options, I like this and not really, to be honest, there are just too much to choose from and not very intuitive.

Unfortunately the biggest negative about this game in my opinnion is the gameplay itself. It doesn't take long to become repetitive and tedious, it's fun maybe up until you reach level 50 or so. After finishing the main campaign and trying out a few other map types, void crusade etc, I can't justify wasting time on this game. Maps are samey, not very large and you just jump from one to another. Gear drops are rather garbage, there's rarely a good piece of gear that you get, the best gear you can get is from a void crusade. There are some mission modifiers, like tarrot cards, that make things a bit more interesting but nothing major.

This game gets deeply discounted regularly so I would still advise to pick it up, but don't expect a long term fun grind here.",1705364109,1705364109,False,14,2,0.568948209285736084,0,True,False,False

Will change to positive if they fix it.

Hit or miss. Sometimes youll start a game with a friend and rock 200+ ping for no reason, other times a comfortable 50.

The devs are releasing an offline mode to preserve the game, and are opening all the seasonal content for everyone.
I Hope they'll add some p2p coop variant, because the game is far more fun with friends.

Overrall, get on sale, fun diablo 2 like looter shooter/slasher.

I want to like this game, I want to tell you this is diablo but better with a 40k skin but I can't this game sucks it just sucks. Not because the story is bad, not because the characters suck not even because I have some shady bs political agenda. It sucks cause it's a poorly optimized glitchy mechanically awful and broken piece of crap on a technical level.

This game should be a visual feast the level design should be immersing you and sucking you in but it can't because on a pc that exceeds the minimum requirements to play it by a large margin with a perfect internet connection it will be a laggy because frame rates can't keep up with you moving so the whole map turns into an ugly blurr you cant see clearly. If I was the art team for this game I would be livid cause they were shafted on a technical level and all their work was ruined.

Meshing issues with objects are common and they can F*** up your field of vision and slipping up for 3 seconds is more than enough time to die in this game. multiplayer both co op- and pvp is 100% dead no one is in the lobbies at all so its only a multiplayer if you're friends have the game too.

Worst of all since the game ticks and frame rates suck total A** you will frequently die because nothing will happen when you press the heal button since the ticks seem to fail to register things frequently but especially when the fighting is heavy so this typically means when you need to heal the most is when you can't heal at all. Even spamming the heal key will let you down often and I've moved keys around to see if it was something wrong with my H key and spoiler no there wasn't.

This game is broken and poorly optimized so badly that I can run 40K darktide on the highest graphics setting but I can't run this 3rd person dungeon runner?

Let me get right to it: 40k fan or not, this game IS NOT WORTH $50. The gameplay is average and no where near up to modern ARPG standards. There's a reason it got a 6/10 at release. It's the wish.com version of Lost Ark or PoE. 

On sale? And I'm talking $20 or less... sure. If you're a big 40k fan like me, it's probably worth it for the setting and story (but still not for the gameplay).",1705077414,1705077414,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False
527430,155817755,76561197994893654,0,15,7610,0,7432,1706928898,"I've enjoyed this game for over a hundred hours and have not reviewed it. That changes today. Inquisitor is an extremely fun Diablo-style Isometric action RPG that drips with things to do. There's a story mode, endless dungeon challenge mode, random missions, side missions, and even a PVP arena if you're so inclined. I am not a PVP person, so I cannot speak of that but everything else here is really good. Weapons selection is varied and while most characters have similar weapons, there are a couple unique weapons to each class. A couple of classes turn the whole game around, playing like something entirely different. The Pysker class and the Tech-Adept class really play differently than the other 3 gun-heavy classes. Each have Nuances, like Assassins ability to cloak with benefits, or the Crusaders shields, but Psyker adds magic that will kill you, or spawn enemies, or spawn random explosions as it's used. The Tech-Adept adds a whole new story to experience and plays quite different with his abilities as well. In all, There's so much to enjoy here game-play wise.

Speaking of how the game plays, the missions do their best to be varied and unique. In the end, it will come down to kill specific targets, kill everything in the area, gather items, or activate checkpoints. Due to the nature of ARPGS, and games in general, there's only so many ""objectives"" you can do before it starts to be the same. Still, they vary it really well here and while the game can feel ""Samey"" for some people, I think it's the nature of the beast and something to be enjoyed. 

A special call out goes to the story mode, which actually has a few moments that vary pretty differently. I don't want to spoil anything, but there are a couple parts where they change the game play a bit to take control of super weapons and pilot them. It wasn't a major change, but enough to feel different in the scheme of things. 

The game is not perfect, and some of my gripes may be overlooked by others. I'm not one to dislike a game or even mention graphics because having played old school games a long time, I know graphics don't make a game. Some of my fondest memories are on older systems and games. That said, this game does not look pretty. I don't mean that from a ""war torn hell of the 41's century"" way. I mean this game isn't graphically great. It's serviceable and gets the job done, but even for the day it was made (As it is an aged game) this game didn't look the greatest. Now, it shows it's age and even the cutscenes are far from great. Hell, i'm pretty sure the original Final Fantasy 8 cutscenes back on PSX looked as good.

The UI is another point of contention. This UI is just jumbled and difficult to read at times. Lots of modifiers and check boxes to tick, info all around the screen, and in general a bit of a mess. It takes getting used to, and certainly isn't a deal breaker, but it is a noticeable flaw in this games design. It's forgivable when you see how much they've crammed into this game, but I do feel if a sequel was made, it would be better due to the advancements in UI design over the years. 

Sound design is fantastic for the weapons, screams, and destruction. The music is great when it's there, but there are quiet moments frequently that will instead have you reaching for your Spotify if possible. The guns thump hard with the sound of bolters and auto guns slamming hard. Lasers pew with a wonderful sound, and in general, it all fits greatly into the design.

The modes are all really well done (I cannot speak for PVP however). The main story carries along nicely, and as expected, it is a convoluted tale of confusion, betrayal, and herasy. Everything you would expect in Warhammer 40K. The choice elements of the game are a nice touch, not incredibly in depth, but they are there. Some storyline elements change based on whom you spare and who you eliminate. The Crusade mode allows you to attack a set of randomly generated dungeons with increasing difficulty and a couple elements of rewards scattered about. Hidden keys and codes allow you to unlock better rewards at the tail end, and a few hidden pathways unlocked on the crusade map can speed you to the end faster. The DLC missions provide additional stories and every now and again a side mission will come up that needs completing in the main story. There's also the season objectives that you can complete within the story and side missions (But not crusade mode, I believe) that will net you rewards at the completion of each week. There's a whole lot to do and a universe of randomly generated levels to do it in. 

With game-play that can vary as much as it can on this type of game, loads of weapons and armor to discover, missions to complete, and heretics to purge, I recommend this game to anyone who has a Diablo sized itch to scratch. Forgive the graphics and take some time to learn the UI, and honestly, this game will keep you entertained for a long while.

A special note should be give to why I decided to review this finally. With recent announcements, there was a new class (Sororitas) that dropped. I didn't buy it because there was some talk this game would go offline soon. It would be understandable, as it's been around a long time. Still, with a persistent online game, it was looking to be doomed to eventually be unplayable. Neocore Recently made an announcement that every single game developer that makes online games should pay attention to. They announced all seasons (previous years gone by) will be made available as a selection when picking your seasonal character, and they are going to be designing the game to play offline so when it inevitably shuts down the online servers, everyone can enjoy this game well beyond that. I'll now be buying the Sororitas class, and completing my collection, with the full knowledge that I can enjoy this gem whenever I want. Neocore did the right thing so many other games as a service fail at. They let us enjoy their game that we paid for and supported. It was a class act on their part and deserves nothing but praise from a community all too often screwed over by predatory ""always online"" practices. 

Overall, a great game with some notable flaws that can easily be overlooked for a great Diablo style Warhammer 40K experience. Honestly, even without being a Warhammer fan, there's a lot to enjoy as a futuristic ARPG as well. Crafting, Random Missions, Story, Crusade mode, PVP, Looter Shooter, Co-op, You can enjoy all of that and not know a damn thing about Warhammer.

Despite snagging ""Warhammer 40k: Martyr"" on sale, the supposed silver lining doesn't quite manage to overshadow the disappointments that pervade this title. What should have been the Warhammer 40k universe's first foray into the action RPG genre turns out to be a lackluster experience, characterized by excessive ease, mind-numbing repetition, and an overall sense of tedium.

Sure, the discounted price may seem like a saving grace, but it's quickly overshadowed by the game's fundamental flaws. The first and most glaring issue is the lack of challenge. Martyr's difficulty level is akin to a walk in the park rather than a grueling journey through the grim darkness of the 41st millennium. For a Warhammer 40k game, renowned for its brutal and unforgiving lore, the lack of difficulty feels like a betrayal to the fan base.

The repetitive nature of the gameplay is another letdown. Missions quickly devolve into mindless button-mashing, with little variety in objectives or enemy encounters. The lack of innovation in mission design and the absence of compelling narrative twists make every mission feel like a monotonous grind. In a universe as vast and rich as Warhammer 40k, the missed opportunities for engaging storytelling and varied gameplay are particularly disheartening.

It's genuinely sad that ""Martyr"" represents the Warhammer 40k fan base's first taste of the action RPG genre. The potential for an immersive, gritty experience set in the expansive Warhammer 40k universe has been squandered on a game that fails to capture the essence of the lore. The absence of depth, both in terms of difficulty and engaging content, leaves players yearning for a more fulfilling experience.

In conclusion, the discounted price might make ""Martyr"" seem like a tempting entry point into the Warhammer 40k universe, but the superficial allure quickly fades. The lack of challenge, coupled with the mind-numbing repetition, makes it difficult to overlook the missed potential of what could have been a stellar ARPG.

Very dungeon a la Diablo immortal (that sort of 3D from above view) and sooo gloriously Warhammer like in the detailed intricate gothic architecture with a decent amount of gore and blood and weird monster tentacles and stuff. Love the variety of enemies.

Menu is a bit challenging to navigate as i'm keyboard based and this is strictly controller based game - and holy hell the menu is rich and complex for a noob that comes from easy peasy grandma pie Borderlands 3 type of menu.... but it's neat exploration i suppose. 

Overall, I really enjoy it though ! (And I could watch tutorials on youtube to get acquainted with menus and skills points and stuff).

I have played 50 minutes and half of that was walking through empty rooms. How can I cleanse the galaxy of heretics when they are not outside lining up to get beheaded? Hm?

The idea of you playing as an Inquisitor and not, as someone put it, a discount space marine as the gameplay suggest, is actually consistently integrated into the writing, so thumbs up for that. The story is above-average for a game. The mission scripting however is laughably bad - listen to a brief exchange with mission control, go from point A to point B, encounter villain, exchange threats, kill each other, repeat. In between A and B you kill a bunch of enemies. Sometimes they are cultists, sometimes rebels, sometimes aliens. But once you have done one mission in this game, you have done them all.

Another complaint would be that since skills depend on equipment, and there are only four types of equipment that actually do something (belt, armor, weapon set 1 and weapon set 2), you will very quickly have settled into  a combination of those four and from then on the gameplay will not evolve mechanically. All that comes beyond this point is slathering on more and more passive modifiers to make numbers bigger, but what you do no longer changes. And mind you, this point can come as quickly as within the first five minutes of gameplay.

It's possibly less of an issue in co-op, where you can set up synergies between characters, but in solo this really is nothing but a highly repetitive though well-made grind.

There's also a dearth of cosmetic options.

And, as others have noted, it's always-online. If your internet connection ever craps out, expect to be ejected from the game.

Still, if what you want is to just relax and purge xenos and cultists, here you go. This is one of the few actually decent warhammer games.

Edit: I haven't played it in a while because of how repetitive it is, but I decided to give it another shake. Then I realized that it's 77 GB in size. For a top-down ARPG. Haha, no, not going to reinstall. Okay, tried it again, and performance is horrible. No idea why.

I actually enjoyed it more the Grim Dawn/Diablo - the missions seem more interesting but it is also more linear - you don't run a round you go from your ship to the mission and once completed you return to your ship.  There is a set campaign of missions but you can also do many side missions.

I switched characters after 5 levels and was really happy to see that they have different campaigns - at leas for the early missions.

The problems for me -started today.  It just gets boring and repetitive.  You get lots of upgrades and lots of items but in the end the differences they make are so small it becomes a pain having to make sure you've got your best items in use.

If you like that style of top down, click-to-go/smash game and you like Warhammer, then you will absolutely like this game. The story is good and long with lots of side missions. You feel like you are accomplishing something as you progress. You can play random missions which aren't story driven, that is just something to do to just play. You can do what the game calls ""Void Crusades"" as a way to farm great loot for leveling up your character. Like any game, if you have friends to play it with that will magnify the greatness of this game. The game supports a 4-player party. There are 5 classes to choose from so good variety there, though some equipment is shared across classes (similar to Diablo) like Signum rings, neural implants, etc.

Downside
The UI is pretty poopoocaca and shockingly, there are no mods for this game for whatever reason. Having played it for 50 hours now, there are a dozen simple quality of life improvements that could be made if modding was supported. Warhammer Darktide supports modding and that was a brilliant move as the modders unarguably made that game better and by a lot. There are bugs but minor and infrequent, the most prominent being one where you are locked in place and can't move after using a ""come back to life on being killed"" skill. I called it a Phoenix Down skill but none of my buddies could appreciate the reference. The largest flaw in the game is the disconnecting. If you are in a mission, you cannot invite friends until the mission is over and you are back at the command ship lobby. That sucks. Bad feature. 

Long story short, would recommend.

Why haven't I heard about this before, like I did about Grim Dawn/Torchlight, etc?"" - that's what you're thinking? At least I did. And man, this is a really something of an ARPG/Diablo-like game.

Most obviously - if you expect it to be something like your regular hack'n'slash Diablo clone - you'll get disappointed instantly: the game itself is a bunch of missions, where 1 mission = 1 location. You have own hub with various NPCs (trader, upgrader, etc) from where you operate and teleport to new missions.
MIssions vary from ""disable the artillery"" to ""find information"" to ""kill everything"" on map. But to tell you the truth - all of them are a variation of ""kill everything"". You run around, you see bad guys, you purge the unclean. That simple.

There are multiple classes to choose from when creating the character and melee/range specializations/skills/weapons.

There are tons of loot with various rarity gradation, dismantling, crafting and socketing. Each weapon feels different and for example - firing shotgun is one of the most satisfying shotgun experiences ever. It goes BOOM!

I've complete 3 chapters so far and I can't say there are bosses or anything. Yeah, you'll meet elite enemies and commanders that have more health/armor/damage. But nothing in terms of epic battles (Yes I met the corrupted ****** in one of the Void missions, still doesn't count as 1 of a kind enemy fight). 

Where the game really blooms is in complexity of systems and difficulty settings. Yep, you read it right. When selecting a mission you can select how hard you want it. The reward scales appropriately. And I find it strangely satisfyin for some reason. Accompanied by the vast and diverse upgrade/reward/loot/god know what else (there's literally a ton of things to discover in the game) - despite the combat part is repetitive and not really creative - I give this game a thumbs up. 

No, this shouldn't cost 50 Euros by the end of 2023, going up to 90.00 with all DLCs. I bought the full pack for 17.99 and that's a fair price for this game. 

So if you want something with lots of buttons, cranks and whistles for 20+ hours - give it a try when this is discounted. If you don't know what Warhammer is all about - this is a nice starting point.
If you do know what Warhammer is all about - what are you doing in this section of the page? Are you a heretice? Buy the game fo thah Emperah!!1",1703344131,1703344131,True,34,4,0.77227330207824707,0,True,False,False

At the current 90% (!) discount it is absolutely worth the price even just to check it out.
Weapons are horribly balanced against each other but there's a lot to try, with each weapon giving different skills, on top of your class skills. If you want an easier time, you can certainly choose an easier weapon and almost cheese your way through. If you want a harder time, you can choose to make things harder on yourself.
And you won't be using just one favourite weapon as different bosses might require different types of weapons to not have a stupidly hard time against them.
Every class plays very differently.

Missions are mostly about kill-everything but there are a few that require rushing around to complete the mission before time runs out, if you like the extra challenge.

Many missions scale so you can deliberately choose a really high difficulty with damage taken/damage given modifiers.

Compared to contemporary games the graphics are grossly inferior when you look at your model up close (e.g., on the gearing screen) but at the distance you view them during actual gameplay, it is decent.

Based on the Warhammer 40K unvierse, there are not a lot of playable female characters. You are basically limited to Battle Sister and Assassin. Classes are gender-locked.
Your customization is also very limited at the start. The basic way to customize your look is changing your armor type, but that will also change the skill that comes with the armor.

The main quest story and sidequests were intriguing as you go through it but only OK in the wrap-up. After you finish those, the remainder of the game is basically just grind and repeat, like the other big titles in looter shooters, with seasons where you restart progress from scratch to get rewards.
That said, a lot of progress is account-wide instead of specific to each character, which reduces grind quite a bit.",1696524113,1703264310,True,5,0,0.570838391780853271,0,True,False,False

It was fun - at first. But once I got to the highest levels things went south fast.  The whole game seems to be centred around endlessly grinding machine god sparks. 

I grind void crusades to get gear I don't want. 
Then mulch it into sparks. 
Then waste those sparks on rerolls of enchantment values, only to accidentally change the enchantment because the screens for enchantments and enchantment rerolls are identical. . 
Now I waste 100 sparks trying to get back the enchantment I want. 
I run out of sparks and it's back to grinding void crusades for gear to salvage. 

Rinse repeat.

This game was alot of fun for the actual story, but completely face-planted on the endgame. Unless you can get it for like 90% off, don't bother.


EDIT: played to the end, got everything I wanted gear-wise. Still have the same issues. I wanted to give it a fair shake but I still feel the same way. The design is too grindy for me.

And the passive skill tree looked expansive (though I'm not sure yet how impactful the choices are). But for some of the classes, the skills are mostly determined by gear, so there may not be a lot of buildcraft, depending on the class you choose.

But the loot isn't very interesting. I had lots of storage, but I didn't need it because there weren't a lot of loot choices to be made. Whereas games like Diablo have you sorting through pallets of gear, this game drops about a dozen pieces of gear per mission. Mostly you just choose the one with the bigger number. If it were possible to inspect loot before picking it up, I'd probably leave most of it on the ground.

Every map is pretty linear and all kinda same-ish looking. It's cool that there's lots of cover for you to get behind (or destroy), but there was never a feeling of exploration or of getting pulled into the world through the environment. Everything looks kinda flat. The voice acting is pretty mediocre. I didn't feel drawn in.

I felt like they also don't do a good job of explaining Warhammer 40k to those of us who don't really know anything about Warhammer, 40k or otherwise.

In short, if you think Diablo 3 is shallow, this isn't even in the same pool. It's a kiddie inflatable pool. It's OK on a sale, but a ""meh"" overall for this Grim Dawn fan.

It's also confusing that Prophecy is a separate game, with separate Steam achievements, but is an expansion.

But I'll also say this game is unusual in that I find myself re-installing it and playing a bit before getting bored again. The setting and fun to be had in shooting things keeps pulling me back, before I eventually get bored and uninstall again.",1625871236,1702054570,False,0,0,0.498687654733657837,0,True,False,False

The game doesn't have a transcendent story, nor vastly compelling loot and some of the game play mechanics are imbalanced but, ultimately, for Diablo and Warhammer40K fans, this game is worth a pick up on discount.

Graphics are very detailed artistically. and quite impressive-looking for a Top-Down ARPG. The aliasing is pretty bad though, so it needs 1440p and upward resolutions to not hurt the eyes (result of high polygon-count mixed with bad in-game anti-aliasing). It's made for high-resolution monitors. The game can feel quite laggy for some reason too, even when it runs at 60-120FPS.

The in-game Vsync is also problematical, cutting the framerate down while not using full computing resources. Frame Limiter needs to be enforced through drivers ideally, and if you're on Nvidia, you need to not have the original game folder's name, and install it without the special characters(""), otherwise it won't be detected in your drivers' control panel.

That's a few examples of the sort of jank I was talking about.

Gameplay-wise, it is pretty repetitive, but the shooting action is great and the environmental & body dismemberment physics are awesome.

Don't approach this game as your typical hack-and-slash, but as a top-down shooter with optional melee, and mild-to-heavy ARPG elements.

Character building is mostly stats, attributes and perks. Skills themselves are weapon-based.

Very unique game overall that feels janky at first, but once you tweak it and get used to the controls, it grows on you.

Pretty good story too. Nothing epic, but pretty good for a W40K video game story. W40K games in general aren't renowned for their stories. This one is above average. Sweet Hero and NPC one-liners too.

Manual turrets in the game are mostly useless. I think it was an afterthought. Good to play against when the enemy controls it, but controlling it yourself is pointless vs playing your character as usual. Also, teleport galore instead of dropping with pods? What's up with that?

Still a very good and unique ARPG overall. You can feel the same jankiness of the engine of Val Helsing's ARPG, but it's way more refined now, and this game is way better. Val Helsing was weird. You could see how Neocron tried to do different, but in the end it was not super enjoyable gameplay-wise, although having a lot of content and good-looking visuals.

But they took experience from their past work, and improved with this game, by A LOT.

Solid 7.5/10 Remove the jank and always Online, and it's a solid 8.5/10

Other notes:

Always Online is lame for users, only purpose is DRM. And also a dishonourable mention to their publishing of the Definitive Edition separate from the Complete Your Collection option Steam gives the publishers.

In other words, they released the Definitive Edition for customers who didn't buy anything prior on a huge discount, and as an original or late customer who paid more yourself, had to pay about the same price as they did if you wanted the missing Sororita DLC.

I've seen Dying Light's publishers do it, and also Tekken 7 was the same scenario. Sadly expected from bigger publishers nowadays, but unexpected from a smaller studio like Neocron and their publisher.

As a game collector like myself, take note. Either boycott these publishers in the future, or at least NEVER buy pseudo-complete collections. Use patience and wait for Definitive in the title, and pay pennies on the dollar. These studios don't deserve much financial support because they pull this kind of stunt on their customers.

I was the kind of guy who would buy ""complete"" collections in the 20-to-60$ range depending on the game.

Now I learned my lesson. I wait for 10-20$ sales on Definitive editions. Being dishonest shouldn't be rewarded dear publishers and shareholders.",1700392183,1701241769,True,2,1,0.448806226253509521,0,True,False,False

The result is stuttery and a lot of movement like a car rather than a person. You can disable click to move and use WASD with the right mouse button to rotate camera which again, sounds good until you notice the camera rotation is very clunky and not smooth. This has nothing to do with frame rate. It just all feels wrong, like it was made for a controller and keyboard was an afterthought that they implemented 5 min before launch. Also movement and shooting at the same time is nearly impossible so there is a lot of move, stand still, shoot at each other, move, etc which destroys any sense of immersion.

Graphics are good and a grim and dark theme to it (only makes sense as it is 40K).
Sounds are great, weapons sound (and are) powerful.
Music is good.
Crafting system for weapons and armour which in itself is huge feature and allows you to make a truly custom build for your character.
Big amount of perks to choose from that allow you to create almost any kind of build.
Tons of missions to go on with Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, Rebel Imperials, Tyranids (Those are the enemies I've encountered thus far).
Special boosting cards that improve your rewards for crafting materials and loot drops for missions, but also increase mission difficulty ranging from mild to hardcore.
Mailing system so you can exchange items with friends that are playing too. Another big feature.
Gameplay is smooth and well developed and employs the use of cover if you are a ranged fighter (cover is optional, but does offer advantages if you are starting as a new player or facing a Tarrot Card buffed mission).
Painter so you can customise the look of your weapons and armour.
All missions have a difficulty selection that range from casual to brutal.
Full co-op support and you can even make your own cabal which has added benefits of more rewards.
Friendly and helpful developer that support's their community.

Reason: It feels routine and not much of a in game dynamics to expect. Exploring similar looking maps and landscape. Poor camera angle.... Weapons, amours, seals bonuses are repetition....

Graphics: 6/10
Reason: Not much of special effects within the game and many other games give better captivating graphic effects.

It was so promising. It really was, and it played so well for the first ten hours of doing so, but now it's completely nonfunctional,  constantly crashing on mission loading screens, during missions, on the startup screen, wherever it can find an excuse to. It's effectively unplayable because it's just not a functioning game, clearly. And apparently this has been a constant issue that the devs vehemently refuse to address, let alone fix.

I was really enjoying it, but now I basically can't because the game just doesn't work anymore. It's really a pity because otherwise it was very satisfying to play and would be an incredible experience if it wasn't plagued with an absolute inability to just function.

It took me 3 attempts to get to the game and accept it for what it is and appreciate some of the design elements, that game has taken.
It's in no way perfect game or one, that will last you till the end of the days - and it's fine. It's janky if some spots but it does excell in most important parts, that recent release of d4 made me realise that are important.
First and foremost, game respect your time. You're not held hostage by any season pass, you're not obligated to play if you not want to. Return whenever, play whenever.
Game doesn't have open world, which at start was weird for me... untill I realised how pointless is open world in most hns games anyway. Pretending that in most of those games mobility to move with lightning speed through levels and teleporting to the objective is not what players so would be short shighted - and this game does adress it by instancing everything. Teleport to the map where you have to do stuff, clear as much you want and then get out of it via single button press. Convinient and not pretending there's anything else to that matter.
Then there's crafting and stats rerolling system, which isn't infinitely cost increasing behemoth. Hell, you can even see in compendium all affixes item can get by inserting it in the slot. Something that some other games have problems with doing so :)
Then there are talent trees, that due to non-linear approach allow you to build whatever you want really... unlike in some other games.
Game has fleshed out activities that are meant to be repeatable, with loot at the end, which is kinda a standard nowadays for hns genre. Nothing out of the ordinary.
Maps and locations ain't really something outstading but they don't really strike as bad - they serve the purpose of being your arena to fight enemies and that's it.
Storywise game is kinda a ""Inquisitor goes on adventures"" kind of the deal instead of having one set storyline you have to follow. Of course, for finishing said stories you get your rewards. It's nothing you'll be remembering for years go come.
Voiceacting is... well, it is. Sometimes it's extremely weirdly fitted for characters, sometimes it's so weird that it comes out of the other end of the spectrum and becomes fitting. Sometimes VA sounds like a Laura Bailey and you're puzzled why she is not listed, only to realise there's no Laura in this game.

It's good experience overall. It makes sense once you start looking at it from the perspective of other games - and that's basically it. Grab game on sale, see if it fits. Might take one or two attempts.

That was my original review and the point still stands.
I've played more however, and I can say I'd probably give this a negative review even if not for the single player being online only.
The story is kinda cool, however the gameplay its self is uninspired. Basic, boring quests. I'm struggling to get through the main storyline just cause I'm so bored playing it. It's not a difficulty thing. You can make it harder if you want to. It's like... every mission is almost exactly the same. Smash some goons, get to the objective. after 50 missions or whatever it's just... I'm falling asleep playing it. I wanna go to bed now lmao.
The daily quests and stuff are boring pointless objectives. The loot drops are meaningless crap constantly. There's no sense of ""oh my god I got this item"" it's ""let me sort through the mountain of garbage I got this mission to see if even one of the items is marginally better than my current gear...""
Then there's the level up system. Missions scale in difficulty based directly on your level. It's in 100% constant lock-step with your level. It takes all the joy of leveling out of the game. There's no point. You get a level up, or sometimes two every mission, but it doesn't feel like anything changed because the next mission you take is harder by the same amount you got stronger. It's as if you didn't level up at all.
It's all very uninspired bland gameplay. I would like the game more if all the gameplay was removed and it was just a graphic novel.",1696535835,1699220303,False,14,2,0.572462081909179688,0,True,False,False

I avoided this game for years because it was an aRPG, but after what Blizzard did with diablo 3, immortal and 4... The thought of anything even remotely close to diablo left a horrible taste in my mouth. I tried it on my PS5 through PS Plus and discovered this to actually be fun. Unlike diablo, I actually want to play this game for longer than 10 minutes at a time (3-4 hr game sessions in this game). Unlike diablo, the gear/weapons are actually fun to play with and each weapon is very unique. Unlike diablo, I have kept this game installed on my PC for longer than a couple hours. I even have the PS5 version still installed so I can play while laying in bed.

If you're a 40k fan, you will thoroughly enjoy the lore; even if GW ends up ret-conning the lore due it being pretty spicy..... I personally think the lore in this game will be showing up in a 40k novel in the near future. The dialogue is great and does a great job of feeling like it's in the grim dark future. The audio is superb and is ripped right out of the 40k universe. They do need to work on the audio for some NPC scenes, because again the dialogue is great and you want to listen to it. I found myself clicking through all of the conversations on my first play through and on my 3rd play through, I am actually letting them all play out. How many games are there out there, that provides that type of a result?

I have only had 1 crash so far, and as of right now I've got almost 55 hrs in after purchasing it a little over a week ago.

Not every action RPG has to be a diablo clone to be fun and every reviewer downvoting the game because it's not following the common aRPG formula needs to be cum dumped by all slaneeshee daemons into every orifice.

This game is a combination of a top-down shooting style with aRPG mechanics. Despite its flaws, like any other games, if you're open-minded, it's highly recommended.

-----Long review below-----

Setting: the game uses the warhammer 40k setting and this can be both an advantage and a drawback, imo. It can surely pull a lot of W40K fans but also prevents the game from becoming a pure aRPG, which is not what many aRPG fans out there want. W40K is not a place where one individual can really fight hordes of enemies, unless you're the emperor himself, whereas in aRPG you're basically becoming a fucking god who can obliterate armies. It's very difficult to combine the 2 ends of a spectrum without any compromise and I think the devs have done a great job, trying to preserve the core aspects of the 2 genre.

Lore: honestly, I don't like inquisitors in W40K. My 1st char is the assassin and I fucking want to feed her to slaneesh every time she opens her mouth. But to have full authorization for travel and exploration to progress the story, being an inquisitor has its convenient perk. I think the story is good, not at baldur 3 level of story telling, but decent. You won't just see good vs evil but there are many people trying to accomplishing different goals. There are conflicts within the inquisitor ranks as well as within the other factions. The side characters also show their unique characters rather than just being an NPC.
The stories you have discovered are also saved and you can look back at them at any time.

Exploration: you're in the 41st millennium, meaning you don't travel on foot but on a fucking spaceship. There's not really discovery like in Diablo or Grim Dawn because most places are charted and going there is just a matter of going through a wormhole. This approach makes the game more granular and you go through missions to progress the story. It's like you're playing Halo from top-down. Some people may not like this approach but again, the game is not trying to be another diablo clone. For me, it's good enough, because if I have only 30m to play, I can just launch a mission, burn some heretic and call it.

Combat: there are many enemy types and this is where the game deviates from official W40K lore because the game makes an inquisitor close to a god while other superhuman units of W40K are like a weak guardsman. Apart from this, I think the devs have woven the aRPG elements with their own tweaks in a clever way. The skills are mostly taken from weapons and this provides easy playstyle change. One downside is on some classes, you can't re-arrange skills and there are very few active buffing skills. Each class has its own combat mechanics and so there is a good replayability value.
I don't think you need a build guide. Just go in, explore and have fun.
You can configure the key binding to navigate your character with WASD and the game becomes more like a shooting game.
Skill animations are quite slow, compared to other aRPG and it seems there is only one death animation of all enemies. When they're hit, they explode, which is quite ludicrous. Many gun skills look quite the same. Many close combat skills are also very similar.
Another minus point is mob density is relatively low. You won't feel much of an adrenaline rush because an encounter ends very quickly and you're on foot to find other mobs to fight.

Graphics: the game captures the W40K atmosphere very well. However, there is almost a glitch in every cutscene. The environment can be destroyed but there's no weight when a wall or column collapses and this makes the structures feel like paper. Overall, whenever something is destroyed, mob or environment, it explodes.

Sound: skill sound effects aren't really impressive. They are there but I think they need to be more impactful. Background music is fitting. Voice acting is also great.

Itemization: you have different types of item but they I'd say most of the dropped items are quite trash once you reach level 40 and above.

Crafting: this is where you can get the most powerful items of the game. You farm for the dropped items and salvage them into components to create new items. You can increase item level, reroll item stats values, add sockets to items. The game does allow high level of item manipulation. But I find that this process is also very costly.

Quality of life: the game does explain very well important concepts and there is an in-game tutorial page. I think this game and Last Epoch have the best tutorials so far. There are still some concepts not explained. I hope they will add them soon.
One downside is the game has no item filter.

End game content: there is a main end game content. There are also other types of content for exploring after completing the main story. I'm not a guy who likes hours of grinding but the end game content can be challenging and quite rewarding. That said, I don't really play much of the end game content.
This game has been out for a long time and the devs are still supporting the game by introducing seasons every few months.

Bugs: there are some bugs, mostly during cutscenes. For me, the game used to crash after a few play through but the frequency is reduced nowadays.

Overall, I think the game deserves more credits than what people give. If you're feeling fed up with all the aRPG with the same mechanics, diablo, last epoch, poe, then I think this is a good chance for you to explore something new.

::: UPDATE, 13.10.2023 :::

Somehow the charme of Inquisitor Martyr becomes more and more apparent over time, as you gradually get better, develop a deeper understanding of all the items and progress your Warrior's skills and perks further. I found myself going after new missions and i even find myself more intrigued with the grind than i thought i could be. 

::: Original Review, 09.10.2023, including additions and supplements from 27.10.2023 :::

Inquisitor Martyr derives from Warhammer 40.000 and thus you are the last Bastion ante impetum Chaos. That's usually a good thing, since Warhammer 40.000 is kind of the Caravaggio of Future Fantasy. So, what could go wrong?

Unfortunately Inquisitor Martyr looks and feels - in its early stages - like a game that was made in around 2004. I say it like that, because there weren't many games in that era, that worked well enough to stand a test of time even just a few years later - not to speak of re-watching these today. Gameplay is coherent in itself, many aspects of Inquisitor Martyr seemed technically outdated on first sight. Later stages of the game feel way more elaborate and up to date.

The rather morbid visual language of Inquisitor Martyr is a factor of its own. Bulky Warriors, who wield overproportionate guns in space combat are the admirable Key Design of Warhammer 40.000. The lore dictates a nonsensical Warrior ethos and rites, which - like the sacred buildings - are a distorted mockery of the Church and of Christianity. While the obscured setting purposefully never resembles neither the age of the crusades nor anything else in particular, the forces of Chaos add an imagery of gruesome grimaces from hell. On top of that there's an all-over-the-place distressing Aesthetic that expresses itself in the adaption and repurposing of sacred interieur design. There is an unlikable governess-like authority figure who presents an image of physical mutilation, looking like she's having her spine, arteria and throat surgically separated. Then you are offered a flying companion which can - by choice - look like a murdered baby doll, a dead fetus or a deviant fetish. One could argue that all these things represent some sort of inner struggle and depict the inner hell turned outward as in the paintings of Hieronimus Bosch. Less patient viewers might dismiss all this as pure satanism and outright perversity.

But is Inquisitor Martyr a good enough game? Would i recommend this game to anyone? 

Yes, because to my own surprise this game gets significantly better over time...

After what seems like an endlessly repetetive chain of tutorial missions i went on to that ship that functions as your Inquisitors hub and reluctantly began hunting down targets and looting rather redunant equipment in what feels like an even more repetetive grind. While i almost abandoned this game, Coop seemed like the only promising option for this game, given you find someone who is enthusiastic enough to give it a go. Playing Inquisitor Martyr alone felt like a sentence to death by boredom in the early stages of the game - But once you get the grip the games fascination unfolds.",1696807253,1698368363,False,0,2,0.454045116901397705,4,True,False,False

Story: It's literally the Spanish inquisition in the future with Space Marines and a non existent chance of survival for anyone but you. That being said, I did enjoy learning about the Warhammer 40K universe and lore (though I'm sure I've only scratched the surface). You will encounter different NPCs, some of them will end up on your ship, some you will never see again, and you will have some inconsequential choices to make. What kept me playing was neither the gameplay or the main story, but rather my stubbornness and the lore. Inquisitors, Tech Priests, The Machine Gods and whatnot. In the end, however, I was left disappointed. I had a very hard time finding more than a couple of characters to care about (apart from a couple in the Prophecy stand alone DLC), making the story a bit boring.

Gameplay: This is where the game lost me. What seems, at first, like a solid foundation, just kinda sucks. While it has every element to work on paper, it just doesn't feel right in actual combat. Maybe it was the classes I played, maybe it was the difficulty I played on (played on 3 levels above mine before getting bored, then just normal), but the pace just wasn't fast enough to me. It felt as if there was no mobility whatsoever. I played the campaign as a Crusader and  tested a few levels as a Tech Priest for good measure (Which are the equivalents of a Barbarian and a Necromancer in Diablo). I figured my favorite weapon and armor type pretty quick and while I usually don't mind trying different weapons, I found the appeal to be quickly gone when shooting a gun is only doable while stationary and I had issues with the fact that I couldn't learn any new moves/spells or skills because they are locked to your weapons and armors. The only way I found my character improving was that levelling grants you attribute points that you can spend in passive skills which are each categorised and each have prerequisites to meet before being able to invest into them (deal this much DoTs, kill this many elites, AoE this much dmg, etc.). I liked suppression stat. I found it an interesting stat; it's suppose to represent battle fatigue. IMO it doesn't represent that at all, but when that starts to be gone you know you need to watch yourself as debuffs will start to happen. It showed me how outmatched I was before just being... dead.

Graphics: Graphics are pretty decent, though there are too few different places/areas to visit. If you purchase this title anyway, make sure to turn the AA (anti-aliasing off) or else you'll be looking at a blurry mess the whole time you play. Oh, and the game stutters. Dunno why. It's also locked at a weird 54 FPS. Also dunno why.

Soundtrack: Prophecy stand alone DLC introduces some extra soundtracks, which is nice, but it's forgettable. Picking up items felt bad ass at first, then quickly got kinda funny. ''VAAAOOOUM''. But the base game lacks a bit of tracks. 

And for those that are wondering, Warhammer 40K Inquisitor: Prophecy is simply the continuation of this story. Though it is sold separately, it doesn't require Warahmmer 40K Inquisitor: Martyr to run.",1696631668,1698276808,False,4,1,0.47787436842918396,0,True,False,False

Having loved both of those games, I was quite excited to hear about this new one, but then it all came crashing down after reading the reviews.

Mostly, said reviews argued that the game was full of bugs, issues and had no end-game content. We’re now in 2023 so of course we wanna see where the game is standing now. But first I’ll talk about the good and bad and then finally focus on answering whether or not the game is now in a playable, and most importantly, enjoyable state.

Good:
-	With 5 classes (2 of which are DLC locked), there are numerous build options.
-	There are many similarities to Diablo II. It’s a given for a hack’n’slash, but the presence of runewords (or rather Psalm Doctrines in this case) and gems is fantastic.
-	There’s crafting. Actual good achievable crafting, allowing you to re-roll a specific mod on a piece of equipment for a better value, or just re-roll for another mod instead. This makes gearing way easier than in most games.
-	The skill tree consists of nothing but passives. Meaning the actual gameplay comes down to what weapon you WANT to use. I’ll say that’s a plus.
-	The game is beautiful. There are so many little details everywhere… although you should pay attention to your life bar, not the decoration.
-	Although I can’t say it’s representative of the entire 40k universe, it does feel good being able to fight different races instead of just orks. There’s nothing like hammering an Eldar space ship or torching a Tyrannid’s nest.

Bad:
-	There are still numerous bugs within the game. Most of those are quite harmless but some are game-breaking, forcing you to either restart the mission or forfeit. Although I should mention, for the most part, the game plays fine.
-	If you fancy playing in co-op, the connectivity is absolute bonkers. Playing on a high-level mission with high ping and rollbacks is bad enough, but immediately losing the mission due to an apparent disconnection is nerve-raking.
-	Inquisitor could damn well use some optimization. Despite having a way beefier configuration than what’s recommended, I was still plagued by micro-freezes and framedrops.
-	Although there are a few end game possibilities, they all boil down to farming missions with up to three tarot cards that raise the level of the mission or give the enemy some combat advantages in exchange for more experience, more loot, and/or more reputation. I wish we could farm some actual unique bosses, but alas, there’s no such thing.
-	The Tech class has a separate campaign. This means that as a Tech, you cannot play the campaign(s) in co-op unless both players chose the same class.

So all in all, is it good nowadays? Yeah, at least for a playthrough of season. It’s nowhere near perfect, there are numerous caveats and there’s not much left to do once you’re done with all the seasonal achievements, but I still had a good time with it. I know I’ll be back to it during the next season.

One thing I do want to mention though: it’s a complex game. It’s in no way a bad thing for me, but with all the mods a single item can get, it can be pretty tricky to know what to go for. You can obviously check guides for it but keep in mind most of those are either completely wrong or outdated. As an example, I’ve seen the explode on kill mod being apparently mandatory on a flame thrower, where in reality you don’t need for two reasons: 1) the flamethrower only attacks in AoE so by the time your target is dead, everything else is too 2) by choosing that mod instead of 25% more damage per debuff you would lose a whooping 375% damage upgrade solely based on the burn and heat vulnerability you can apply with your flamethrower. So yeah, even though this play like a twin stick shooter with a controller, this has surprisingly more depth than it first seems and you’ll need to invest time into learning the mechanics.",1698228945,1698228945,True,10,1,0.645867764949798584,0,True,False,False

POE was way, way too much, overwhelming the player with currencies, leagues, mission types, requirements, etc. Diablo 3 was boring but I enjoyed it for like 60 hours with a friend. Outside of that, I only ever really had fun with Titan Quest, which Inquisitor feels analogous to. For me, the key to enjoying this is accepting that, as a non-ARPG person, I'm okay with playing suboptimally. These games are mostly about min-maxing and intersecting effects and stacking statistics/synergies, which is why people play 'em, and while this game definitely does that it isn't remotely necessary to play and enjoy the single player campaign. 

A lot of the criticisms here are valid. The crafting and itemization is baffling. At level 38 I still don't understand how ""quality"" works vis-a-vis item level, damage, effects, and rarity. 99.99% of things you pick up are totally useless and sell for nothing, and even when you accumulate credits, they're worthless. But the actual (repetitive) moment to moment gameplay is hella satisfying if you're a 40k fan. All the weapons are there, and they have a lot of oomph. It really does feel like the writers care about 40k, and is easily the best written Warhammer game since mechanicus. It's not great, but getting like a thousand hours of content for $9 is a steal.

Though i have to add that every single mission is essentially the same. You get teleported into a map with a load of enemies, you go around and slaughter all enemies, you get teleported out. It gets repetetative very fast. There are only two things that really keep me playing. The first is just wanting to play through the stories, the second is grinding for better gear.

One more thing and I'm gonna indulge in a bit of nerdrage here. As i said, you get teleported in and out of EVERY map. Just no. The settting is warhammer 40k not star trek. Teleportation technology in 40k is INCREDIBLY rare. And yes, as a lord inquisitor on board of a roguetrader ship you defintily belong to the very rare set of people that conceivably get acces to teleportation technology but even then you really don't want to use it all the time. In the imperium of mankind a teleportarium is considered archeotech. In other words it's technology that even the cult mechanicus doesn't fully understand and that makes teleportation tech a bit unreliable. Especially if it's used without a teleportation beacon in place. But even with a teleportation beacon in place there is always a nonzero chance of being teleported a couple meters into the air, into a wall or below grund. The only faction in 40k that has near perfect control over teleportation technology and uses it on a regular basis is the Necron. Yes, it's a rather minor thing and it's really just flavor but stuff like this really bothers me. Seriously, why do you have to constantly teleport everywhere? Why not just have you land with a regular old Valkyrie gunship?

I think one of the problems is all the skills in the game are tied to equipment, so after your first play session you'll have basically seen everything. Levelling up gives points but just to throw in passives, and sure 5% extra heat damage or something is nice I guess, but it doesn't feel rewarding at all.

The other is that the loot feels dull.

Martyr is not a bad game per se, it just fails at everything that could have elevated it to ""Good"" status. Almost every aspect of the game is either unpolished, straight up broken or annoingly time-consuming. Five years after release, no less.

The graphics are nice but rather uninspired. The are all the obligatory corpses and chaos sigils but every indoor location looks almost the same. Also every transition between star systems, planets and the ship's cockpit are animated and, sometimes even come with a loading screen. It becomes annoying quite fast, the same way it did in Mass Effect: Andromeda.

The sound is there but the dialogue has an annoying habit of starting mid-mission or even mid-combat and cutting out because the character walked into a cutscene. This is a pure game design failure in pacing. The developers could stop the action for a cutscene or put some sort of road block that would make the player hear the entire conversation if they moved around too fast.

[b]The moment to moment gameplay suffers a lot.[/b]

There are a lot of bad map design decisions and the controls often wreck a player's ability to quickly and properly position the character. 

* Lots of unnoticeable obstacles in the maps (like weird railings that go across corridors) that break WASD controls since touching such a railing stops the character in their steps.
* Mouse controls are bugged and broken. Some skills have an aim range below their attack range, so the character wil walk way too close to an enemy before firing a penetrating shot that goes beyond said enemy, unless the player uses and abuses the ""hold position"" key. 
* Sometimes the character will absolutely insist on walking in a certain direction during channeled skills, making the player choose between weird steering with the mouse or putting the skill on cooldown.
* There is a separate set of dodge controls for the assassin class, custom tailored for people with ten fingers on their hands and the option of ""dodge towards pointer"", which makes ""dodge forward"" force the character to dodge towards the mouse pointer, but no ""dodge in the direction of movement"" option, for some reason.

[b]The game offers very little guidance and help on its mechanics.[/b]

Quite a few skill trees, perks and attribute points are hidden beyond heroic deeds and achievements, so if a player didn't meticulously study every nook and cranny of the UI, they might miss those for a while. Skill trees, in turn, mostly offer minuscule bonuses like ""+3% to fire damage"" or ""+5 suppression regeneration on hit"". I beat the entire campaign without investing a single passive point, since none of those passive skills felt immediately interesting.

Items offer great(?) effects such as ""+40% damage in [b]enraged/berserk/focused[/b] state"", but at no point the game bothers itself with explaining how to get into those states. The official answer is ""If you have an enrage/bers
erk/focus token, then you're in enraged/berserk/focused state."" No, I am not joking. Also, I still have no idea if ""+100% damage to [b]Burning[/b] effects"" is better than ""+15% damage"" or if ranged psyker skills actually count as ranged damage, since there is no detailed breakdown on how much damage DoT effects do vs direct damage or, in fact, what counts for what damage type.

Getting any helpful information on builds and relative efficiency of different effects practically requires outside help, browsing forums and wikis and fervently praying to the machine god for a revelation.

[b]There is little joy in looting.[/b]

It's an ARPG, but the loot is severely undertuned. Most items have the same exact pool of stats regardless of their level and only differ by some some mystic ""Quality"" stat. Level 60 epic items can and will spawn with two or three affixes and be objectively weaker than a rare item with five affixes that you found at level 15, because the number of affixes can't be changed and rerolls are costly and boring, since you occasionally have to roll for more rerolls - items have a reroll limit but you can fix that with a modest donation of credits and materials.

The only items that are worth more than a passing consideration are relics, or, maybe, ancient relics, or even archeotech relics. Unless you are serious about the game and would rather get holy items, which are the only ones to have non-rerollable unique affixes, which often still do nothing for your gameplay style.

Non-campaign missions (void crusades, priority assignments et c.) offer you a flexible way of making them more difficult via an RNG system, but some of those RNG options are downright ridiculous. For example ""You lose a life every 5 minutes"" when you only have five lives for an entire multi-mission crusade or, even worse, are playing a hardcore crusade.

[b]Pay for stupid games - win stupid prizes[/b], or something.

There are multiple currencies, seasons, weekly tasks and reputation farms and you can farm influence in certain star systems, but those all blend together into a ""just why should I bother?"" pile.

Martyr is entertaining enough to play for some time but playing it is not entirely unlike watching a car crash in slow motion, noting every minute detail that the developers decided to overlook in favor of their FotM seasons mechanic.",1697942556,1697943899,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is really ingenious in the way it incentivizes you to play at the highest difficulty you can manage, without locking you into a frustrating and humiliating experience if you're not that good or your build isn't up to snuff. Whatever your situation, you can play and have fun gibbing the shit out of the bad guys. Also, the art is first-class, the music is even better, and the voice acting ranges from outstanding (my tech-priest) to acceptable. And there are tons of content, as well as multiplayer (co-op and pvp, which I haven't tried). 

I know my review is useless to those of you with a doctorate in ARPG's, looking for every niggle to argue with your fellow professors about, but I'm not writing this for you. I'm writing for the gamer who's just looking for something fun to play, and I'm telling you that this game fits the bill. Especially if you get it on sale like I did.

I should of started with the fact that I am no fan of Warhammer. I don't know much about the lore if not at all.
But what I do know is game mechanics and this game has something good going.
Never liked the fact that you play random roulette with the item's stats but at least you can modify them.
Have an item you liked from early level? You can level it up and change it's stats.
Perk tree has quite some content. And the fact that you can reset them is great to reroll for a different gear / items build.
Main missions are laid out nicely with some good voice acting.
Easy to play with friends. They connect to your game or vice versa.
Different terrains and scenery are nice.
Challenges through the tarots card system is interesting. Makes the game more challenging with more rewards.

A fun enough game. The levels have an amazing WH40K atmosphere. There are many varied tile sets that you don't get bored quickly, though the level design does get repetitive rather quickly - linear tunnels with very little variation, the extra rooms which lead to dead ends don't give much of a reward (maybe you'll find a chest once or twice, but otherwise it's just more of the same enemies). 

The gameplay feels great, controls are responsive. Would love some more cosmetic items (weapons and armor) than the 3 armors per class which you can use. 

The story is all right. All the characters you meet and travel with you have their shinning moments and do differ from each other.

There are some promising mechanics, which could have been ok if they were applicable and used.

In the end of the day, it all comes down to enemies zergrushing you and you slaughtering dem cursed heretics in the name of the Emperor with no issues. Most of the enemies don't feel like any kind of opponents, their AI is just shoota at ya and that's it. 
It's only Chaos champions and Orgines caused some trouble so far. And seeing Adepta Sarorita slaughtering several Chaos Astartes 2-4 shots for each, is really disappointing. Or, for example, Aeldari... During one mission of extermination the Adepta Sarorita I play has exterminated IDK how many Aeldari warriors, which were trying to (again) zergrush me without trying to hide or use any kind of tactics, or say properly use ranged weapons.
So yeah, the enemies balance and AI is a great falure.

When starting the game, I saw there is a way to kinda hide behind a cover. I was sorta happy to see such a thing, and expected there to be some tactical moves, cold calculation, a way to hide from enemies... NOPE! I didn't really understand the purpose of why this mechanics were added to the game. Taking into account amount of enemies rushing at you, it generally makes no sense to try hiding or smth, just shoot them and that's it.
I also was expecting a lot (or at least expected something) from the allied forces control. Do you know how much I used it? Never)

Some necessary gameplay features are also missing... Like, for example, quick switch between two weapons (or mb. I didn't find it). So to switch from melta to a sword you'll need to enter your invernory.

The game was promising. I expected a lot from it, and it could have been done much better. You can see, that there were some attempts to arrange some tactical gameplay, some interesting mechanics, and etc., but IDK they just dumped this half-made product into the market.

It had a very rough start back in 2018, like Cyberpunk 2077 rough. Almost no one was buying it. The devs didn't quit, though, and after a year of patching, I finally picked it up... for 50% off. 

I then proceeded to play for 300+ hours. All in the year that I bought it.

Let me tell you, it was still pretty buggy, and the item balance was a bit poor (praise be to grav gun), yet I didn't care. Martyr more than met all of my wants from an aRPG, and this is coming from someone who's been playing Diablo, Diablo 2/2R, and Path of Exile from their releases to the present day. Martyr was worth every penny of the $20 I spent.   

I don't remember exactly why I hadn't touched the game in almost 4 years. Part of it was that it still had some annoying bugs. D2R released. I finally played through vanilla Grim Dawn. You know, this and that.

But after Diablo 4's lackluster release (and hundreds of hours RPing as an ogryn in Darktide, don't judge me) I remembered the fun I had with Martyr back in 2019 and reinstalled it. 

By the Emperor, I will say this again, Martyr today is worth its full purchase price. It's music, visuals, sound design, and voice acting make you feel like you are in another world, essentially doing what Diablo and Diablo 2 did. MAN(kind), the music in Martyr is rad. And the gameplay is rad, too. You actually have enough time fighting the mobs to see what they look like, giving them some personality and recognizability. Plus, the difficulty at base levels in missions is high enough to keep you from falling asleep, and there're tons of sadistic ways to up that difficulty (and make you regret your life decisions) as you go.

Things I liked:
1. Cross-character progression system that unlocks perks and passive skill trees.
2. Flamers are a good weapon choice.
3. You can rebind keys as you like.
4. You can change difficulty before each mission, higher difficulties give more rewards.
5. In campaign missions you aren't punished for deaths (mostly).
6. There are vehicle missions that make you feel especially mighty.
7. Sister of battle, tech-priest and psyker classes have interesting mechanics. 

Things I didn't like:
0. The game starts with trying to destroy your GPU. For some reason FPS are uncapped and it's loading GPUs (3070 in my case) for 100%. Remember to cap it manually at whatever you like.
1. The game really could use more polish: adressing tyranids as ""heretics""; blood and dirt on the floor vanish when the camera floats during dialogs; there was a female model and the text refered to that character as ""she"", but the VA of my char said ""he"" instead; typos, missing words and some other stuff I won't bother mentioning.
2. Some skilltrees are hard to unlock, but for the wrong reason. To unlock heat DMG and DoT skilltrees you have to interact with explosives and traps in missions, but no one can tell how many of those are going to be in your missions. I've managed to unlock DoT skilltree only after I've finished the Prophecy DLC.
3. Crusader and assassin classes feel kinda similar to each other in comparison to the other 3.
4. The game always treats you like a melee character and will force you to come at point blank range during dialogs with bosses, which screws you over if you're playing a range build.
5. Crimson knight vehicle can't heal in battle, its out of battle regen is too slow.
6. No loot or EXP for killing in vehicle missions.
7. It seems there's no way to read dialogs again.
8. Morality system is broken: people almost always go for Puritan, because it's better; some choices don't matter at all or are essentially the same thing.
9. No offline mode for the time being. But the devs said they had it in plans!

It's also worth mentioning that the lore accuracy is ... Don't expect much in that regard.
At the end of the day the cons were less impactful for me than pros and I was able to have fun playing this game, so I definitely recommend getting it at least during a sale (the discount was really good) if you like diabloids or WH40K.

The Steam store page used to have a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3049632135]clear notification[/url] that Inquisitor has online-only DRM as well as requiring a Neocore account to play. That notice was [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3049626485]removed[/url] in an update a few months ago, [i]five years[/i] after the game first went on sale.

So good news, right? - the DRM has been removed! ..... Ah no, it hasn't. Other than the DRM disclosure being hidden, there were no other changes made to the game that day. They just didn't like that consumers being properly informed was eating into their profits.

A fuller explanation would be that Neocore's WH40K license is probably about to expire, and they are trying to milk every last dollar they can out of Steam customers before they delist the game and then quietly, a year or so later, shut down the servers and leave the single-player game completely unplayable.

I expect this sort of behavior from AAA publishers like Rockstar, Activision, EA and Ubisoft. But it just goes to show that smaller developers like Neocore can be just as horrible.


EDIT: Just a few hours after I posted this review, Neocore posted their own [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/527430/announcements/detail/3719467945375301810?snr=2_9_100000_]update[/url] claiming that they are planning on an offline mode. That would certainly be welcome if true, but I am highly skeptical at this point and I think everyone else should be too.

The reason being: I can't think of any plausible reason why they chose to hide the DRM notice from the store page other than that they are intentionally misleading Steam users (I asked them this question in the discussion forum and have not received an answer yet). Given that, there's no reason to believe they aren't also being misleading now with their recent announcement.

But some are better than others and at least this one has some story and lore to it, skill trees are okay, combat is okay, the expected grind isn't too tortuous. Crafting is account-wide which is not what I previously thought. So there is no need to go through maxing all crafting skills every time you start a new character. This goes some way to explaining why the craft tree is so slow to fully open up.
 But there are a few issues. The tough seasonal events (i.e. void runs) don't always register as they should. I have completed 3 in the ""season of malediction"" where EVERY void run is meant to be considered a malediction but i still have not had the required objective marked as complete. The 75 min complete speed run with all side objectives is ok for fast tanky characters like the crusader but others might struggle. You can get through it but in 75mins? Doubtful. Meaning that a few small areas of the game may well need co-op or multiplayer aid.
 Yet even with a few weaknesses Martyr and it's dlc's have kept me occupied for long enough that I'm very pleased with having picked it up at a greatly reduced sale price. At full price well it depends how much you like arpgs. Usually I don't so for me the answer would change to a no. But I've had a blast so I can't give it a negative vote for that.
What I WILL say is that the Metacritic score of 65 is very misleading since it's based on what was apparently a VERY buggy release and none of the dlc content.

Here's a review that highlights the game's co-op experience and its satisfying combat against hordes of enemies:

Co-op Experience:
The game offers a highly enjoyable co-op experience that adds a new layer of fun to the game. Joining forces with friends or other players to purge the galaxy of heretics and xenos is an exhilarating experience! The co-op mode allows you to team up with up to three other players. The variety in character classes and playstyles makes cooperative play engaging and strategic.

Coordinating with your teammates, combining different abilities, and facing the challenging enemies of the Warhammer 40k universe together is where the game truly shines. Whether you're cleansing a corrupted derelict spaceship or vanquishing a horde of chaos cultists, the cooperative aspect enhances the overall enjoyment of the game. The synergy between classes, as well as the satisfaction of tackling challenging missions as a team, is a standout feature.

Combat Against Hordes:
Warhammer 40k has always been known for its epic battles against overwhelming odds, and Inquisitor - Martyr does not disappoint in this regard. The game excels at delivering intense, action-packed combat against hordes of enemies. The sheer number of foes you'll face, from heretical cultists to demonic entities, can be staggering. The game's mechanics, including cover systems, destructible environments, and a wide array of weapons and abilities, provide you with the tools needed to mow down these hordes in a satisfying and tactical manner.

The game's well-implemented physics and visceral feedback make every shot, explosion, and melee strike feel impactful. Watching enemies disintegrate, explode, or be torn apart by your relentless onslaught is undeniably gratifying. The diversity in enemy types and their behaviors keeps you on your toes and ensures that combat remains engaging and challenging.",1696890968,1696890968,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, the atmosphere is great. Everything from the level design down to the interface screams ""Warhammer"".
There are a lot of different builds and quite a few combat styles. Most weapons have a one- and two-handed version, and you can combine two different one-handed ones to get a more versatile set of attacks. You can even customize your stim pack, and I've never seen an ARPG where this was more in-depth.
There is also crafting, which has interesting aspects and can result in items you actually need, so it doesn't feel useless.
Combat is solid and feels really ""badass"", for lack of a better term, as one would expect from a game with this title. You can freely select the difficulty, as well as other modifiers that add rewards at the cost of making the game harder.
There are also multiple different game modes that all put a twist on the core gameplay, and reward you with gear appropriate to your level. Everything you do makes you stronger, and item progression is very smooth and well-done.
The story isn't amazing, but also not boring. It's essentially what you'd expect from a story set in the 40K universe. Loads of big baddies show up and you can kick all their butts, despite not actually being a Space Marine. (Yeah, don't think about it too hard^^) I was even a bit surprised to find out that there are choices in the main story that effect your character, and even have small story events down the line.

The enemies, while having a lot of variety, tend not to have too many different strategies. I wouldn't say that there are no noticeable differences between Tyrannids and Dark Eldar, just that it's not enough to make me care too much who I'm fighting. Although that could just be because I'm not playing on maxed difficulty, perhaps at some point it can be really relevant to your build.
The levels are also never really boring, but also don't break the mould. Once you've seen a type of level, you're not likely to be surprised, but somehow that didn't make me not want to play anymore.

Really, the entire game is ""solid"". I get the feeling that the devs took great care to not overload the game with too much, while at the same time making sure that the systems that are in the game work well and are impactful.
It's hard to explain. I never got the feeling that the game was under-performing, or that some aspect was lacking. But I also never got the feeling that the game was doing anything new.
This game is the perfect example of what happens when you perform very well, but not above expectations.
This game is the essence of the score 7/10

You choose which 2 weapons you equipped, but the skills are tied to the weapon so you're just leveling up passives which are mainly things like 3% damage or 2% movement speed. 

Chaosbane was around Diablo 3 levels of complexity (which is fine if the gameplay/mechanics are good), but this is dumbed down even more. I don't understand their audience. I would think most Warhammer fans are going to be hardcore nerds into a complex game rather than something watered down immensely.

A quick overview of the game's post-release evolution. When this game released, it felt very sluggish  - moving, engaging, looting all felt slow. The devs did a massive overhaul of combat, increasing movement speed, combat moves and cooldowns, and there are simple loot filter and auto-pickup options (neither of which need to be enabled. They are off by default). This level of attention after the release of the game, when other devs might have moved on, is remarkable to me. They took a game that was Not Bad and made it into something very memorable to me.

After that overhaul, seasons with unique season mechanics began. These have unique mechanics that cause enemies and/or anomalies to appear in normal missions and interacting with these give you progress toward season-specific boss missions. The season will also have a new type of affix that can now appear on weapons (such as one affix that allows you to release lightning on hit or being hit while other affixes combine to make it chain longer or do more damage, etc). There are also the equivalent of runewords (psalm-code doctrines) and the components can be removed at any time and leave both the item and components intact for use in other gear.

The sound is good, especially the fighting sounds of guns, melee, fire, explosions and more. There's nothing like jump packing into a mob that explodes as you use a las cannon or flamer to melt the survivors. The story is fine though nothing to write home about. Leveling is steady even at higher levels, making the tarot cards that give extra XP feel like viable options.

There are a couple options for endgame. You can continue regular missions (of which there are 10 types) that you can do to earn gear and reputation in the respective systems (of which there are 20). Acquiring reputation unlocks additional systems and, more importantly, tarot cards. Tarot cards are the difficulty + reward multipliers for any endgame map. A card will specify the type of negative and positive it will give you - I.E. melee enemies get a random damage or defensive buff but you have a chance to double the end-of-mission rewards. Some tarot cards also raise the area level until it is many above your own, allowing the game to continue scaling after level 100.

There are also random intel missions which are short quest chains with a reward at the end and it provides you 2-3 mission types to choose from at each step.

The main endgame option is Void Crusades. There are 9 different ones, each with its own static map creating a web that connects the nodes. You can path through the web differently depending on if you want the maximum reward chests at the end or if you want to save the nodes that raise the difficulty of all remaining levels so that you have an easier run overall.

I haven't touched on many things like the solid crafting/rerolling system (you can modify all but one class of item as many times as you want) or character classes (3 base classes with 3 specializations each in Inquisitor, the WH40K:Inquisitor - Prophecy stand-alone game has another campaign and character with it that can also be used in this game, and the Sororitas DLC that came out recently is a 5th class (class only, no new campaign/missions).

I've played this game on and off for years. I never bought into the random negativity in the discussion board. I just get on for a few weeks at a time and have fun purging heretics, xenos, and daemons.",1685579437,1696718663,True,47,1,0.823609352111816406,0,True,False,False

The ""campaign"" is kinda short, altough interesting, and I suppose they are going to expand on it.
Side quests(series of missions) are ok, although a little tasteless.
Side missions are absolutely a grindfest, and it gets old fast.
Multiplayer is inexistent take my word on that.
You fight Chaos and traitor Imperial Guard for the first tens of hours, until you reach power 1300 or something, then you get ot fight dark eldar, so if u want ot fight eldar you need to grind a lot.

DONT BUY THIS GAME YET, unless its like 15-20 $ cause its nor worth more. Maybe in the future, doubtful, they will add enough content that will stop this game for being called a grindfest.

Pros:
+ It's Warhammer baby! Lots of cool environments, enemies, and lore.
+ Fun for the first 20 hours or so.
+ Features Fabulous Bill.

Cons:
- The majority of missions are basically just a variation of ""kill all enemies"". It gets old FAST. I stopped doing Intel missions and priority missions when I realised they were just overworld missions with slightly better loot.
- Loot is boring and often useless. You can easily farm Valorous Heart missions to get great Relic items, making the regular loot you get during the campaign essentially useless. I've lost count of how many times I've gone to Ragna and just clicked every ""Sell All XXXX Items"" button without checking the loot, because it's all usually trash. At some point I stopped seeing item drops as items and just as additional money.
- Very confusing, unrewarding and overly convoluted crafting system. Upgrade costs feel way too high for certain upgrades, but hey, it's not like you are using those credits for anything else.
- Combat system feels shallow. As a Tech Priest you basically have 4 options. 1) Shoot enemy with your gun. 2) Smack enemy with your axe. 3) Summon constructs that you have little to no control over to attack the enemy for you. 4) Throw a grenade or mine. Since mines are severely overpowered I just ended up chucking them everywhere and killing everything without a second thought. There are a few passive skills you can unlock, but in terms of active skills you are limited to the above options. This makes it very difficult to experiment with new builds or skills.
- The skill tree feels too big for the number of skill points you get to distribute, and the individual skills/perks feel lackluster: from level 60 onward leveling takes much longer than before, and it sucks when you then only get one skill point which you can use to give yourself a very minor stat boost (+3% ranged damage, for example). There are some nice skills, but for the most part they require investing too many points into the individual skill trees. 
- Boss fights are so trivial that they might as well be regular enemies. Due to the already mentioned highly overpowered mines, each boss fight basically consisted of ""chuck three to four sets of mines on the boss. Bam, he's dead"". There is a tone-deaf cutscene where Ragna is shocked and afraid when you encounter an Incubus boss. She warns you that they are extremely dangerous, which is cute because at that point you've likely already defeated many these Incubi with ease. Why is this one so special, Ragna? Where were your words of caution the first 30 times I fought one? Do you even really love me?!
- The Knight missions are torture. You can't get any loot or experience from the enemies you kill, and the Knight's movement controls are... something else. Every time Ragna suggested that we use the Knight, I died a little inside. I actually cheered when my tech priest shot her suggestion down during one of the mission. You don't really face any special enemies that justify the use of the Knight - it's just more of the same enemies, just in slightly bigger groups. In all honesty the Knight levels felt like a character nerf - I'm fairly confident that my tech priest mines can do a quicker job of clearing the Knight levels than the Knight can. The Knight's weapons are also a bit weird, and you can't really get the sense of sowing pure carnage with the available skills. It's basically an auto firing boltgun that does pathetic amounts of damage, a laser beam that fries everything it touches; a single target, high damage shot; a weaker explosive shot that does AoE in a minuscule area; and a weak front-facing shield... None of the skills made me feel like I could unleash the full wrath and glory of the God King Emperor of Mankind on the mutant, the heretic, or the alien. Where's the massive power sword that I can use to cleave through the enemy masses? Where's the massive explosions? The Knight feels more like a child's wind-up walker toy than a divine instrument of war.
- NPCs can just as well be UI interfaces. They don't really have any dialogue or interaction options - you just use them to access the relevant game menu or to get new quests. 
- The in-game clues you get from the servants of chaos look like they were written by a preschooler. I chuckled at how grimderp and edgy they look. Even the font looks evil.
- What is the point of the alignment system for the different map sectors? I didn't see this influence my game once, except to prevent me from using certain Tarot cards. On the same note, the Radical vs Puritan path choices and rewards are a joke and will have almost zero impact on your playthrough.
- I unlocked a skill tree for the tech priest by killing 5000 enemies with melee attacks, but I can't find the unlocked skill tree anywhere.  
- If this is an open world game, it's an open world during a COVID lockdown. You can walk around on the small bridge of your ship and in the small, self-contained sections of each mission's map. That's it. 
- WTF is a Xenox? If the voice actors can't even be bothered to pronounce the Warhammer terms correctly, I can't be bothered to care about this game (looking at you, Magos Biologis Matrodora). 
- The game has a lot of bugs, especially with rewards and performance. I received a popup notification a few times telling me that I received skill points, but when I checked there were none. The option to turn off weather effects is also not persisted between missions (hell, it doesn't even remember the option until the end of the mission, requiring you to turn it off manually multiple times during the same mission). 
- The game requires about 90GB of space to install, which isn't justified by the in-game experience.

It feels as if this game was created so that Games Workshop can say that they sell a Warhammer 40K ARPG, instead of creating a good ARPG system and adding the 40K theme later. If you are looking for a Warhammer game and you are interested in the story and setting, give this a try.

My feelings are very mixed. This game has so many play modes (Ordo missions, regular missions, void crusades, intel missions, etc.) but they are functionally one and the same thing: very repetitive map cleaning times infinity. 

By level 20 you've probably seen everything the game has to offer, and unfortunately, it's not going to change much for the remaining 80 levels, should you choose to grind those. And after level 60, leveling speed comes to a screeching halt: you will play 5-6 story missions without seeing a single level up.

The campaigns (including DLC campaigns) are quite well voice-acted and climatic, but way too long. There's a lot of ""filler missions"" that do nothing for the story and are there just to waste your time. The missions where you pilot the mech are especially pointless: you don't get exp or loot for them, and the mech is such a slog to navigate that it's genuinely painful.

I ended up with a stupidly powerful Crusader that would oneshot the final boss with Multi-Melta's charge attack on Extreme (+8) difficulty. When I however switched to other weapons, I couldn't even beat the stage properly. The weapon balance is completely wrong. Some weapons are 10x stronger than others (looking at you, heavy flamer).

That being said to forewarn anyone, this game does have some irritating aspects. The constantly ""online"" aspect although its predominantly a single player game. Most people constantly complain about that, and for good reason it will cause your game to take a sh*t mid mission.

But my main issue is the void crusade bugs that lead to failures, and a couple of the faction types having an enemy with an ominous ""one hit kill"" skill shot that is impossible to dodge, counter, or escape from. It really needs to be fixed. This issue will melt your lives and fail your crusade too. The primary and obvious one for example is the enemy female psykers.

The game needs something NEW and FREE besides crusades as end game content as well, considering they get repetitive, and they do have their issues.  The damage scaling on crusades needs to be dialed back some too.

I get why you need online for coop, I even understand the logic behind the drm and anticheat download circumvention through forced online, I just hope you guys take that out and enable p2p/local host coop once you kill the servers.

Good things: 
It's an ARPG with all the loot rain of different colors.

Bad things: 
This game was made with the assumption that you know a lot about W40K universe. What are inquisitors, what is chaos, warp, demons and whatnot, why is this a big deal and why that is not. 

As a new player you have to read a lot about the game. There are a lot of mechanics that should make sense (I hope that's the case) to a W40k fan but not to a casual. There's an ingame encyclopedia but it doesn't mention a lot of important things. And as anyone would like to read an encyclopedia to get started.

The characters are'n memorable, just a small talking heads, one more self righteous than the other. 

The ambient is grim. That's not a problem, but the fact that the most of the game happens in tall Gothic corridors that make you change the camera perspective in 30 seconds is. And that's why despite all the gore and decent weapon sounds the hits don't feel as heavy as they should. So after a while all the missions (being similar and repetitive) can be categorized in two: inside (most) and outside. 

Your avatar changes only when you change 2 things: weapon and armor. Yeah you can change the primary/secondary colour and have 3 ""+1 ribbon"" looks but that is ridiculous. It's like back to Diablo 1. DESPITE all the cosmetic DLC's.

I bought the ""complete"" edition only to see that there is still a Sororitas class DLC to buy. So yeah, ""complete""!

Edit: Finished the campaign. Not worth it. It's just not fun. Even the missions with the big robot felt like a chore.

Pros:
 - a lot of 40k fractions with their connections between each other make Martyr nice to dive in;
 - wide variety of playstyles even within single class;
 - comfort missions and tasks logic;
 - pretty good craft and loot variety;
 - Belizarius Cawl, finally! 
 - often you have tense action;
 - such a deconstruction of Space Marines, very brave move;
 - billions of sectors, planets, quests and activities, you name it!
 - good music;
 - different approaches for missions mechanicks and structure from different NPCs.

Cons:
 - awful servitors logic, looks like this pussies always look for the weakest enemy (and u can't control em);
 - two-dimentional firearm logic - you can't blow up Hellbrute's head if it has a wooden box in front of im, shame;
 - billions of sectors, planets, quests and activities with three and a half task, map tiles and enemy assests within;
 - hell of a windows, resourser, loot with zero value;
 - catastrophical text and dialogues design: giant blocks of voice performances with 300-400+ characters you need to read to save your time;
 - flat and bleak characters, too many of them;
 - there is no dash. In action isometry in 2018. Only one class with dash system witch made through different keys for every direction, shame on you;
 - music feels like random tracks compiled with no understanding of gameplay atmosphere;
 - poor level desing, billion miles of senseless backtracking and empty rooms;
 - almost all in-level interaction with crew fucked up: glitching, interrupting, aborting for no reason;
 - systems map with zero depth in it and endless descriptions for no reason (i am still a big fan of their ""influence""-charts for every planet);
 - ill-starred fractions and their interactive characters representation (SM, Mechs, aeldari);
 - fuck, guys, when I play Mechanicus, do you really think my char doesn't know how cogitators, turrets and machines interact? It was the most useless Adept in all Forge Worlds.
 - highly poor internet connection system. Guys, I can loan a credit to give you money for an devops and connection QA if you can't do it yourself.

This game is as indie as you can imagine. Most of this mistakes NG have fixed in future, some of mehanics aspects were drastically improved, but right now this game is more of a Guardsman sim than warhammer immersion -  you will understand nothing, stuff will be occuring uncontrollable despite your activities, you will remember one, maybe two systems, you will use your trusty lasgun because all other stuff is FUBAR, your main task will be to kill as many xenos as you can before they serve you for dinner

The gameplay is good, it is fun to kill things. The rest is kinda average and some straight up bad. I probably have some bias too as the devs are fellow countryman, and we don't have many dev teams in this small country so... Still, a decent but flawed game.

I didn't really care about the story, my mind just wandered off during cutscenes alot, there is a bunch of readable stuff which I don't really like in games much, escpecially not when it is an integral part of the story and you will miss a bunch of things not reading it.

I really didn't like the skill system. This is probably the biggest negative for me in this game. Weapons/body armor being the sole source of skills in an ARPG is just weird to me. Especially in this game as there are a shitton of loot all the time, you are constantly upgrading everything thus constantly changing skills around. A lot of the time you will face the choice where you like the skills you have on a weapon but you just pick up one that will do a lot more damage but it comes with skills that you don't like. Imo thats not a good kind of choice in a game like this. I am not a hardcore ARPG player but I don't really even understand how am I supposed to make builds when my skills are constantly changing.

The mission system being basically just a menu where you start every map from is also kind of a weird choice in a game like this. Even when you do the campaign you teleport out to your ship then back in to the next mission even when the locations of those missions should be near eachother. Like why? This doesn't make any sense at all. Why not put in a cutscene or some kind of transition then go forward with the campaign? I Don't get it, like this it completely pulls you out of the game every 10-15 minutes which is just not good. Also the maps are very repetitive with the same tasks over and over again.

The game also runs badly at times. My PC is more than capable. I had 20 fps in some sections. Sometimes it runs well, other times it becomes a fucking slideshow and the settings doesn't even change anything. My hardware isn't even used properly, like the GPU usage is at 50% tops, CPU is 10-30% but the game runs like shit.",1690403871,1690403871,True,1,0,0.446471989154815674,0,True,False,False

that I have numbered and will answer here with my current opinions.

TLDR; Yes there is fun to be had especially if you love/like w40k. Wurf.

POSITIVES:
-WarHammer 40k, Done right. Environment, characters, etc all to form.

-Some of the music is very fitting, just wish you could choose what to play when
as it's dynamic to a degree. The Default Title music is like some sort of heavy
surf guitar or something and is AWESOME, wish it played all of the time.

-You can choose to use move to mouse, wasd, or both. You can rebind everything, this is
fantastic for people with wrist & hand issues from an ARPG

-There is a whole 'what you see' filter system and a seperate one for 'tactical view', so you can
setup what is highlighted when you want and swap that with the press of a button. Again, FANTASTIC
for an ARPG

-The developer cares about the game and continues to update, patch, & tweak things. This is FANTASTIC
in this day and age of 'fire and forget' developers who abandon games left and right.

-The gameplay is fun and a hoot, and feels w40k-like. It's very solid for an ARPG.

-The game itself has a ton of minutiae to tweak and rig things, so it has loads of depth
and you can repeatedly return to the game and find it rewarding and engaging, AMAZING! Usually
you come back to a game in the last 10 years and are like ""oh now I remember why I stopped playing,
meh.""

-Almost ALL DLCS can be EARNED in-game! HOLY WETFISH AQUACRACKER! It also doesn't require 40+ hours
a week to do so! What a great system!

NEGATIVES:
- For some reason, and I'm not certain why, the game still feels clunky and I think it's the camera.
You can rotate it at will by holding a button down, but that's not as fluid as most games with a rotating
camera usually use right mouse button; which you need for an ability slot. I suppose you could rebind that
slot but I will point out that many ""move"" abilities end up in that slot which is also fantastic. I think
there needs to be a follow camera that rotates following the mouse WITHOUT holding down a button.

- When using WASD you'll often be stuck on tiny, undestroyable props or something, and it makes the game
feel janky.

Issues from Original Review:
I admit I can be very scathing and downright rude when I express my experience with things.
Sometimes it's entertaining to people, sometimes it's not, but sometimes it lights a fire
up the right bum and things change.

1. Well there is online play and yes to does require a sub-system via thier system, to first validate
then approve being able to do so. So that's still there, it still seems to be kinda hiccup-y from time
to time. But yes you can play with friends, warning however if you do the campaign only the host gets to
make morality choices which can bork a build. They do respond daily to problems and issues however
so that is a bonus.

2. I can understand that they need to validate things on thier end, but the system is still clunky
and you can lose progress. Could be done way better for certain.

3. Morality when playing campaign with friends is still an issue. So you have to keep track of what mission
will force a morality choice when playing together, and do those solo if people's choices conflict.
SUGGESTION: When you go to load up the mission, it should WARN ABOUT MORALITY CHOICE.
SUGGESTION2: Just have a pop-up asking the others in the group session what they want and affect them accordingly.

4. I'm not certain if this skill point issue was resolved or not, I've since made 3 different characters up to lvl 80
and haven't encountered this again. I have however encountered an issue frequently where attribute points were displayed
incorrectly. usually after swapping between characters.

5. Information, ah the key to min-maxing and uh, knowing why that green blobbly thing is stuck to your leg.
The in-game stuff is ok, but it's more of an explaination of what that system or part does, it doesn't give hard
facts, conflicts, or numbers.
The compendium on the website is more helpful, but again, there are simply some questions that can't be answered without
simply trial and error or finding where someone specifically asked that question and maybe (usually not) it was answered.
First one that comes to mind is Cabal drops; it's extremely obtuse as to what / where / who drops them. It should literally
be listed of the specific enemy. For my part I was forced to find where someone made a list, so now I have my own list.
Another one, is how to get morality points after the campaign? Everything says ""priority missions"" but you can only do 3
a day, and you get a new one after 24 hours, also they don't tell you if you'll get a choice or not, and they are often
3-5 missions long. So you could waste 2hrs for nothing. This is bad.


Original Review:
BUYERS BEWARE! 
Broken game still, after two years of release!

I'm not certain what the developer's problems are, but they can't seem to actually pull it together and fix bugs of their game, let alone act like there are any bugs, which there are.

This blows my mind, as it's very easy to get FREE interns to play your game repeatedly almost giving the company an utterly free quality assurance department.

1. No real actual online play:
- This game requires a thirdy party account system at Neocore itself which 90% of the time doesn't work nor send out a verification email required for you to play online. The company is blissfully unaware as people post
constantly in all available social platforms trying to get them to wake the hell up and see that their system doesn't work.

2.- Have to connect to Neocore servers to play multiplayer; this is stupid as hell in this day and age of peer to peer networking. This means you have to have a good connection to them (Hungary?) else you will constantly drop when trying to Coop with friends and get auto-booted into random coop sessions instead. What moron at their company thought it was a brilliant idea to host their own servers is beyond me. This also means once their servers are down, you'll not be able to play, ever.

3.-Morality System within all campaign missions if one person in group chooses a side, all members get stuck with that choice. This is majorly game breaking as it is nigh-impossible to gain enough rep as it is, to redo your morality if one of your friends chooses a choice different than you. It will take possibly a years worth of waiting and hoping for RNG missions that only give 5 morality, versus the 25 you get for campaign choices. There is also no way to respec that tree ever so you are screwed by whatever choice.

4.-Game breaking bug, randomly when you level, you will receive Negative Skill points, instead of positive skill points, which permanently screws that character forever during leveling and there is no fix. This bug is over a year old and Neocore acts like they can't find any information about it; this is because everyone is so fed up with the jankiness of this product that most people just uninstall the game and move on. Again, all they need to do is get some goddamned interns and have them sit and play the crap out of their game.

5.-Lack of any real information about the game anywhere. It's very hard to find straight answers about most things; the in-game system is just fluffy paragraphs that really don't answer any questions; hilariously whenever you need to ask a question you will find yourself rooting through 2+ year old similar questions that people have been asking for years, with most likely no actual real answer or resolution.

A fun and thrilling RPG game for both Warhammer fans and those unfamiliar with the franchise. With 39 hours played on a single character, I have STILL not completed the main storyline, I have just begun Chapter 4! And with content being added with frequent updates, it is unlikely I am to complete it anytime soon! Also with the option of Co-Operative play you can also play with up to 3 friends. It is possibly the best game purchase I have made in recent times in regards to both quality AND time quantity.

 With 4(initial) classes to play,(Crusader, Assassin, Psyker and Tech Priest) each has 3 sub-classes and with the vast amount of skill tree's you can build your character to fit your own playstyle. With a large variety of weapons you could be cracking skulls in melee combat with a Thunder Hammer or incinerating foes from range with(My personal favourite) the dreaded Multi-Melta. 

Inquisitor takes place in a vast sector of the Caligari Sector, a sector teeming habitable systems, space stations, ancient ruins and shipwrecks....systems brimming with secrets and hostile threats to the Imperium of Man, from the lithe elf-like Aeldari and ever hungry alien Tyranids to the Daemon worshipping traitors of the Chaos Legions.

Honestly the BIGGEST problem with this game though is that it's always online, whoever decided that is a fucking dumbass and it caused FAR more lag than there would normally be. Weapons feel nice but some weapon types are far superior than others(at least from my experience on the sister) such as the bolter vs plasma gun, the bolter is so much more useful and even one that it supposed to be far worse will usually end up with much better damage per second.

Playing is that you hop from mission to mission, each taking about 5-10 minutes. You do get to see a few different biomes and every mission is put together from building blocks. Missions have one goal, there a handful different goals including but not limited to ""remove all enemies"", ""disable these things"", ""defend this object"". The story is basically these mission with some exposition+cutscenes in the mix.
After you run out of story, it's basically doing random generated missions to grind for better gear.

The only way W40K - Martyr could be less likely to succeed is if it was developed by Rogue Factor and published by Nacon. Yet succeed it does. It plays like a slightly more complicated D3.

I held back for a while to buy this game as there were quite a mixed bag of reviews all around. There are reasons for this, most complain about the all time internet requirement to play coupled with crappy servers, although I never had a n issue in my entire play through, even played some coop. There are other gameplay or technical issues at hand that I absolutely cannot stand. Dont forget that I bought the ""complete"" edition, which is  not so complete as they added a new overpriced class that isnt included.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
The base game has 3 Inquisitor types, a psyker which is this games magic character, an assassin and a templar. Those have their own type of resource that activates an abillity or uses it for abilities. I mostly played the psyker and finished the game with a relative ease. You unlock new abilities via leveling up and those unlock very quickly and soon you can choose your own build. 

Each character has their own focus, although a clear different playstyle tendency.. Templar can be played as a melee tank, damage dealer or pure heavy cannon using ranged. Assassin also has a melee path, with also being able to use hard hitting sniper rifles or John Woo esque pistol run and gun.  Psyker can just be a pure mage, or buff himself and uses utility spells to increase his damage, although he doesn’t really have any melee attacks except a force sword that just can be used as an ability. There is a great variety of builds, and level ups rewards stats or passive skill points. Only resetting them is a bit weird as you have to pay a lot of money for reset points, which the shopkeeper has only one or two between each mission, which just resets a single tree, and there are a couple of those. New abilities are obtainable through different equipment items.Generally i really like this leveling and building experience and is one of the best parts of this game.

Melee in this game is just really lacklustre, not only does it lack feedback, but also ranged is just way much better, especially for the time saved you have to run to the enemies as the game features a lot of enemies behind cover. Cover is also a weird mechanic, im not sure if im just underutilizing it or if certain builds require it more, but I rarely used it, even less the turrets you can use and personally shoot down enemies with.

Life in this game is red, shields are blue and unique is a suppression “health” system that has different effects the more suppressed you are or not. But enough of the deep analysing, My main issue with this game might be a personal problem but I play ARPG´s mostly for its main story and sometimes post game content and not the opposite. The main story starts very interesting but gets into a fetch quest with various non related missions. The actual named martyr space ship just appears in the beginning and at the end of the game. Maps are scrambled randomly, looking like hallways and random chunks while planet sequences are just completely open sequences. There are some unique encounters, like piloting a mech or a tank. 

My main issue is that the main story plays exactly like post game content. Everything is leveled to your level, so it doesn’t matter what you do, you can only activate higher challenges by increasing enemy levels, but that makes me the person who has to balance a game as on the normal difficulty the game is just boringly easy. Maps look the same and I don’t remember any single location of the game, instead of having the game take place completely in the Martyr, they opted for a completely forgeable experience where each map, aside maybe the tutorial, looks that it was made via a random map generator.

I barely touched post game content as the main story was quite exhausting to play and I only managed to finish it while watching tv shows on the side due to how repetitive it feels via the map design. Although there is a lot of that content available and if you like this kind of gameplay loop you not only have seasons but a variety of currencies that unlock new items or cosmetics as a reward. Quest design is okay, there is some variety available for this type of game, but there is just a single proper real end boss that actually feels like one.


[u]Story[/u]
The so called Martyr is an old space ship that was belonging to a high ranking Inquisitor who made various sacrilegious experiments in the Warhammer universe. Ship appears suddenly, main character finds it, lands, finds out that there is a lot going on with various factions and secret weapons, has to flee the ship and most of the game will be spent with various problems that have nothing to do with the Martyr itself. Story is told via voiced dialogue, most very crucial story plot points, or the more interesting stuff is told via text messages. Probably the worst way to tell a story.
Also worth noting that the game ends on a cliffhanger, directly just without any kind of closure and sells the proper ending as an expansion. Fantastic.

[u]Sound[/u]
I liked the voice acting due to how much there is, especially that it changes depending on which main character you choose. Combat effects are totally fine and serviceable, same with the soundtrack, the more calm tracks are really neat but the battle tracks are rather lacking.

[u]Graphics[/u]
The game looks really fine and has a few very well designed scenes in the backgrounds of some of the hiveworlds and all the ships are cool designed from a visual perspective, although it has the problems I mentioned earlier.
The biggest problem is the stability, even if I set the game to absolute low I cant run it properly, as it suffers from slowdowns in random moments which is very irritating

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
Martyr is a very interesting and ambitious game that tries to implement a variety of unique systems but most feel underdeveloped. I also loved the customizability and the variability of each class available. But there are so many issues going on with this game, from the performance problems, to the very lacklustre main campaign and storyline with repetitive and a forgettable map design to the rather unbalanced difficulty and skillset. The only remedy is the Warhammer setting, but otherwise a very plain game.

For all it's millions of dollars Blizzard made a completely middling experience with Diablo 4 somehow deprived of both personal identity and soul. Actiblizz tried to combine the better parts of Diablos 2 & 3 and somehow took away the worst of both into 4. 

But the art was okay I guess. 

So where did the best of those games go? 

I'd argue that, for the most part, they went into this one. 

This game takes all the stuff you love from those other ARPG's, adds in all the QoL that 3rd party mods usually do and, in a first for most ARPG devs, actually listens to it's community. But... it's not without it's share of problems. Hence the ""No"" recommendation which I'll get to at the end. 

I'm gonna type a lot so here's your TL;DR -

[u] Solid 8.5/10 ARPG from an ARPG vet but a current gamebreaking bug stops me from recommending this. [/u]


[b]THE GOOD[/b]

- Systems: From the passives/skills to the loot to the crafting it's all very modern ARPG inspired. The mechanics hit that sweet spot between ""complicated"" and ""simple"" where ARPG's thrive.

- Loot: Feels rewarding and the grind is just enough to where it again finds the balance between instant gratification and tantric starvation. Though I will admit most of what drops is credit-fodder and there should be an auto-sell-on-pickup function the actual time sunk to reward ratio is good enough for me. Better than most ARPG's honestly. 

- Difficulty: Martyr makes it simple to be as sadistic or masochistic as you please to yourself or your enemies. If you die, you feel like you understand how and why you died and, most importantly, how you can do better next time. This is an integral part of a good Roguelike game and I'm glad they incorporated that kind of learning through failure into this ARPG. 

- Visuals: While some aspects would surely be considered dated (look at the Psyker's face good lord) and while many animations are just... so janky the realization of the 40k world in this game is fantastic. There's a lot of very intricate and interesting detail in some of the most minute of places and you can really tell they cared about portraying a grimdark future in a very grimdark way. 

- Gameplay: Where it counts, this game's got it. I never tried the game before the gameplay rework but I definitely appreciate what's there now. The gameplay speed is just about right with a decent sense of urgency to combat. The player feedback is great from your weapon blasts shattering groups of heretics into putrid piles of debris to the audio cues that inform you of exact what has dropped and where. 

- Story: I've read some people complaining about the story. Let me say this: While the writing quality isn't up there with some of the 40k novels... What else is? Some of those are heralded as the 'best' 40k literature has to offer. And while this isn't the BEST, it's still really damn GOOD. 


[b]THE MID[/b]

- Voice Acting: It ranges from AMAZING and spot-on for 40k (the crusader is incredible) to ehhhh (the rogue trader ship captain, some guardsmen lines). I wouldn't ever call it outright bad but the sheer range of ups and downs makes it inconsistent, immersion breaking and a little offputting. Again, not all bad! But certain voices just aren't right. (Also: Does the Alpha VA change halfway through the game? Cause I feel like it does and that was jarring and strange). 

- Music: It's no Mechanicus or Darktide soundtrack but it captures the 40k vibe well enough to be passable. But it feels uninspired and more like 'checking boxes' than actually trying to breathe life into the atmosphere of the game. It's just background ambiance and in a post Doom 2016 world simply having music to check a box isn't awesome. Just play the Mechanicus or Gladius soundtrack in the background as you play instead.

- Coop Play: This also goes in mid. The netplay is a touch glitchy but stable 95% of the time. However there are certain story missions that cannot be played in cooperative mode, storymode missions that some consider to be the most boring, tedious ones of the entire game. In addition there is currently a glitch causing the 'reconnect' button to freeze everyone's game which... no. That's not good.

- The Optimization: This game has some really bad framerate drops for mid to lower end devices. I personally never ran into this issue on my rig (2080ti/3700x/32GB ram) but even a friend of mine with WAY better specs than me had some framerate drops when too many FX were on screen at once. 

- Animations: There feels like a clear difference between an A team and B team on some of the animations. And while the enemies seem to have been animated by the A team, some of the player character actions were definitely dictated and performed by the B-team. This is especially true for the Battle Sister character who, and I cannot stress this enough, has the animation quality of Minecraft Steve. 


[b]THE BAD[/b]

- Pricetag: When not on sale, actually buying this game and all DLC's is just shy of $100. And while I believe a player can get $100 worth out of enjoyment out of this game it's really rather scummy to still be charging that much 5 years after it's release. On the one hand, the game doesn't have traditional microtransaction scummery with a paid ingame currency which in 2023 is a win. But you could also argue cutting content from the game and selling it as 'DLC' is a microtransaction in and of itself. I've heard the argument where 'it's a player choice' to buy DLC and if it's just cosmetic this would be true. But when actual gameplay content is behind the paywall that argument folds. BUT... I won't necessarily dock Neocore for this because if I had to guess it's a Games Workshop decision. Still... Not good. Definitely worth it for the $15 I got the whole bundle at during the steam sale. But not on sale? Make the whole thing $30-40, y'all. Come on. 
   
- Mechanicus Start: The Mechanicus character starts at a different point in the story than all the other characters (6th chapter out of 9 or 10). This is very, very confusing as it's placed 4th out of 5 characters that can be selected and at no time that I can recall is there any indication this is the case. If you're playing this game for coop reasons just know you can't start off as a mechanicus character along with your friends.

- Weather FX on the snow level: Even after turning weather FX off the snow level is just too goddamn bright. It's visually strenuous in an already visually taxing game with so many things happening on screen at once. Anytime I see a mission on this map I skip it entirely because it's an assault on the corneas. In a day and age of 'darkmode' becoming default (and for good reason!) this map is visual heresy. 

- The Bugs: Ultimately the reason I'm giving this a 'no' for the moment. And the moment they fix the glitch that blocks you from doing ANYTHING other than abandoning/restarting your mission I'll change this review that instant. But between the video glitch that completely blacks out your screen for a few seconds, the one that re-plays the high-tier item drop noise constantly and the one that completely stops you from being able to even play the game I simply cannot recommend anyone to purchase it at this time. 


[h1] DEFINITELY SKILL ISSUE [/h1]

I'm just mad, bro. Because, as previously stated THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY DAMN GOOD GAME. But, as the Angry Video Game Nerd so eloquently put it: What's the most important part of any game? Well, being able to fuckin' play it! So I really want to recommend this game. With all of my heart, I truly do. It's an 8.5/10 ARPG that's true to 40k lore, has great gameplay, systems, endgame loop, mechanics and art design. They cared and it shows.

But if I can't be sure I'm gonna be able to play the game or run into a mission-failing glitch? I can't recommend people spend their time getting invested in this.",1688857353,1688866877,False,60,3,0.605785667896270752,0,True,False,False

If you like to be battling with engine problems that freeze the game and make you CTD, if you like to be battling with errors due to patches that break more than fix things and above all you like to waste time doing end-game missions for that their paper servers close your session without any information or word from the devs.

Good game for those who like the W40K universe and like ARPGs, with significant improvements when it comes to improving and manufacturing equipment, many missions and types to choose from. The Void Crusade system is the best I've seen that allows you to choose the maps and missions you want where the limit is your ability to do missions that can vary in difficulty from +1 to +118.

WH40k and ARPG seems like a complete no brainer that I can't believe GW hasn't forced a whole series of these games. This isn't the case, and I really don't understand how this game has mostly positive reviews. I would truly love for this to be a good game but I can't give this a positive. You can tell that they tried to make a good game, but fell short in so many aspects. In a world where Grim Dawn, Wolcen, Last Epoch, PoE, and Diablo exist, this game is just bland and uninspired.

The missions are only about 3-5 minutes long and the story is pretty horrible. Enemy density is atrocious, with the largest pack I saw at around 10 enemies/ Enemy packs are scattered very far apart so you can't really chain pull. Don't even get me started on the abilities/balance aspect of the game. The first character I made was an assault crusader, and I got him to level 10 by holding 2 down and whirlwinding. The last boss that I fought with him took about 5 hits to kill, and I still had the starting equipment from level 1. This leads me into the gear, which is pretty bad. You can see from other reviews people have the same issues, in that you don't really have gear progression. Leveling up 10 times only to get a PURPLE drop that only provides a 2% increase in one stat is honestly kind of insulting. You might say that the assault crusader is simply just that good at low level, and I had the same thought. So I tried out an Aetherwalker Psyker and experienced the exact same situation. I don't know who this game is made for, but if the base difficulty is this easy, I'm not sure who would find it enjoyable to play. You might notice that I only have a little over 1 hour on this game, but trust me, that is plenty of time to test the game out because of how fast the missions are over.

This isn't an MMO. I don't want to blast through leveling extremely quickly just to get to the good content. Good ARPGs aren't about the destination, its about the journey. The journey in this game is just bad. If you really want to try it out, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FULL PRICE. Nab it when it is on sale for 80% off. Better yet, don't buy it and instead go play Grim Dawn or Diablo 2.

When you play the campaign missions and are interested in the story, you will have a bad time. Depending on the situation and character, the subtitles are in various places on the screen. Therefore, you must know exactly where to look to not miss anything. The voice acting is okay, even if corny and ham fisted. A fatal flaw is the sound mixing, which is all over the place. In some missions you clearly hear the character voices over the BGM and battle noise, but on others not so much. Sometimes one character is almost mute and sometimes the BGM drowns everything out.

The game tries in many aspects and, frankly, it may be more appealing than your average Wolcen\Last Epoch\Grim Dawn or, god forbid, the ""other two"". Because you've seen that sh*t for decades, enough is enough.
But at the same time the amount of utter, unpardonable failure that you'll encounter is just too much to ignore, all things considered.

First of all - the experience. Neocore's previous game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, is a masterpiece in terms of experience. Big zones, filled with easter eggs and interactibles. Coupled with the protagonist banter and the aestetics - it's one of the best immersives in the ARPG genre, in the league of Marvel Heroes and Lost Ark.
This time around - there is no... experience. I could say ""download or buy Van Helsing"" just for campaign. I could say the same about Lost Ark. I can't say the same about this game. On one hand, the details, the feel of Warhammer - is awesome. On the other - it's purely and utterly instanced. The exceptions only prove the rule. You want to embrace the destructible environment, the decor, but... the audience wanted a dibloid. So Neocore obliged.

Speaking of dibloid - I assume that the developers wanted a more developed version of Dawn of War 2, with cover mechanics and executions, but, from what I hear, at launch the game was in an even poorer state. Right now, however, there is so little similarity that in terms of polish and execution - tha 10 year old game is a much more appealing(including visually) product than this.

The next problem is the engine and netcode. While the game does technically allow co-op now - it's broken as ****. Limited time to read quest messages, disappearing messages(not all are logged). Not to mention various bugs related to inventory, skill use with rubberbanding and visual glitches. Not that you are expected to play an ARPG in co-op, but... again, worse than Van Helsing.
As for the engine - it's terrible. Barely scales, barely looks any good(again, comparatively to DoW 2 or, for example, Lost Ark), doesn't run above 60fps(even recommended to lock it at 60(max allowed in-game lock)), has a weird DLSS3-like frame duping thing for potatoes - basically it barely taxes your GPU until it just BREAKS THE HELL DOWN. As in total FPS drops, visual glitches, total engine failure that artifacts until you restart. Not good.

But the most pertinent problem of all is the ARPG balance and gameplay design. I honestly hoped that Neocore has learned something since Van Helsing, but... baby steps.  I haven't tried all the classes, haven't finished even a single one, but the glance through the sort of ""compendium"" by Frat - has made me realize that it's almost worse than Van Helsing. Shotgun, for example, is broken. Doesn't matter what class you play - it breaks you. A certain lightning sword is only good because it synergizes fully with an already meta doctrine(socket set bonus) and physical builds practically don't exist for an ASSASSIN. Furthermore - the sniper rifles are utterly obsolete. Even in co-op, as far as comfortable long-range support nuking goes - snipers are just CLUMSY. You pick that same shotgun or even a bolter and you'll have a more reliable time.
And that's ONE example.

I wish I could say that ""oh, but the game isn't a finished deal like Grim Dawn, it has seasons, it gets characters and DLCs, it gets developed"". My a**. So where's the balance, huh, Neocore? I mean, sure, from 2018 to 2020 you were castrating and re-tweaking the game to be a dibloid and not a Neocore game. But you've had 3 years since then. Your game isn't single player torrent edition, you can't say ""play whatever you like"".
You have bloody leaderboards and seasons!

So where are the nerfs? Where are the buffs? I mean, seriously, I went from a ""full-a**"" sniper, trying to take sniping seriously to ""omg, there can't be a better weapon than a melee twohander, it has direct scaling AoE, lots of mobility, dots, its potential is infinite"" to ""oh, so you don't care about aaaaall of that, you just stack heat and abuse a certain doctrine and item combo and STILL get a better deal?"". And that's barely halfway through leveling up!
What are my endgame choices? Suck or play meta? Of course, every game has such issues deep down, but most games have VARIETY.

And with dual-wielding being basically nonsensical, and weapon skills locking your gameplay down to ""you can use the same 4 skills from level 1 to 100""(Wolcen would like to have a word with you and teach you are thing or two) - it's not like you have a VARIETY. You just have maybe 5 ways to play a character(and that's pushing it) and all you have to do is balance them.
Because what else are the seasons for? What else is the always-online for? Am I supposed to rank against a vegetable playing meta and ranking 5x+ the score, just because I want to play a WARHAMMER game and not a dibloid?

And that's on top of bugs, bugs and more bugs. Too many to mention, the abovementioned compendium has a lost list, but you WILL encounter them.

The story is bland, the presentation feels extremely out of place. I mean, it's clear that Neocore TRIED, I've started with this, they wanted to make a NEOCORE game. But that would've required open world, some proper immersion. Instead, it's like a silly game of detective, while you try to remember what are you actually doing here, and the game constantly has to remind you of that before, during and after the quest.
Seriously, you know you have a narrative issue when 10+ year old games feel like they make more sense. Because everything is so, SO instance-based. Every text log is so ""detective journal"" based.

To summarize: if you can get it on 75%+ discount, with all DLCs - you can try it. It's not too bad for the money. It's definitely not a 60$ product, the development was basically wasted here. Sorry Neocore. It's like you've built a very BANGED UP Ferrari. And it only goes 40km\h within the city limit. And you have to pay full Ferrari price for it. Compared to the value of countless other games, whether on sale, on ""resources"" or F2P - this game just doesn't offer 60$ experience.

I wish I could leave a positive review and support the game, hoping that maybe Neocore would at some time release their third gen ARPG, taking the best parts of both their previous experiences, but... one review wouldn't change much. And it would be deceptive.

P.S.: A lot of people are whining about Sororitas not being a part of the Complete Edition. As a veteran of WoW, where you had to buy WoW and the latest current xpack for 60$ - I don't see a problem. The game in its worse days used to be 60$(as stupid as it is). Now, fully loaded with DLCs(I hear they can be bought with in-game currency), it can be had for 15$. To me that's not a bad deal. And it's absolutely normal to leave the latest DLC full price, it's standard practice.

Because, again(and hopefully), this isn't a ""finished game"". It's not a Definitive edition. It's a ""so-far"" edition. It's even packed together because of their conslow release. Now, if Sororitas\season 7 ends up as the last season, with no more DLCs, and the owners of the ""Complete Edition"" would forever be stuck without the last one... Well, that would be bad. I would be wrong.
However, I would also just wait until it's 75% off and buy it separately. By that time it might be 90% off for a single DLC. So it's not a big deal.",1687215542,1687215542,False,1,0,0.438729405403137207,0,True,False,False

EDIT: Turns out there was a simple fix. Just uninstall the game, delete all folders the game created, use regedit to delete any trace of the game's existence from your registry, and re-install. NOW you may access the main menu and create your character. [i] Except you Can't. [/i]


You may look at all the available classes and even attempt to name the character, but the button proclaiming the power to create your character merely mocks your attempts to engage with it. The button clearly responds to clicking, but will not relinquish it's secrets in the face of such rudimentary means of interfacing. It appears that in the time of machine learning, we have brought upon machine spiritual-awakening as well, and technology can no longer be trusted to work. The code has become sentient, and we are all now at the mercy of it's mercurial moods. The industrial revolution and it's consequences, truly have been disastrous for the human race.

The obvious solution is to have your techpriest prepare their incense and ritual prayers to show proper reverence to the machine spirit. But there are older, crueler gods I owe my allegiance to, and by conducting the ritual to appease the game's machine spirit, I would inevitably exceed Steam's refunding time-limit of two hours.

2 hours should be plenty of time to decide whether a game is worth keeping, or refunding.

- You NEED a controller to play this game. Why? There's no PC bindings. It just yells at you to put in a controller when you boot it up.

- The skill building in this game is... very strange. The abilities you get are tied to your weapons and armor, as well as your class. The fewer weapon skills you have, the more class skills you get, and the other way around. 
It's not what I would think of as traditional when it comes to just finding things that combo well off of eachother, and moreso centered around improving the raw statistics of specific abilities, which I quite enjoy.

- This game was VISIBLY rushed. It's nothing terrible, but grammatical errors in subtitles, item text going off of the screen. It definitely has its imperfections.

- Minor performance issues even on high-end rigs on high settings; this game does NOT like a lot of enemies on screen and starts to seize up. This has only occurred once for me personally, but I have heard of other accounts for it.

Ever since the early 90's when I first picked up a copy of White Dwarf magazine from my local hobby shop and saw a Space Marine for the first time, I have been really obsessed with the lore and stories of the 40k-verse. 

I never had the budget to get into the table-top hobby side (though I've a few friends who did), but I would eat up every source book and codex I could find. Because the writing and world-building in 40k was like nothing I'd ever seen before. Thankfully today, all of that information is freely available to the public, but back in the day, not so easy to read dozen's of codex's for free.

I've always loved 40k games that do the lore right. And what can I say, ""Inquisitor: Martyr/Prophecy"" does just that. From the writing (which really reminds me of a lot of the ""Black Library"" material) and fun little easter eggs for 40k fans, to the over-the-top voice acting of just about everyone in the game (especially the Drukhari, and Chaos characters), to the incredibly detailed models, items, settings/maps, the lighting, all of it just absolutely NAILS the 40k vibes. I especially love the inclusion of the Morality system. It fits so well with a game about The Inquisition. Fair warning: the game takes a minute to really pick up, so stick with it for a few hours. Once you unlock Void Crusades the game really starts coming together. 

And the game is pretty damn fun and addicting too. It can get a little repetitive, but that's the nature of ARPG's. At least the 40k flavor keeps it all feeling engaging. I just hope they keep expanding and adding new factions. (Someone really needs to give Tzeentch and Slaanesh some love in a 40k game already!). I dunno, I' not usually ahuge fan of Diablo-likes, but this one just pulled almost 100 hours out of my life over the past weekend. And I had a blast every one of those minutes.

Not bad for a $15 Steam Sale purchase. To address all of these recent negative reviews, I personally haven't had a single disconnection issue with this game. But I also don't really co-op or PVP, so that may be why. If you are a solo player, you should probably have no issues getting this to connect.

The fix was to delete the font folder for the game and it worked.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Diablo games as a kid and a teen and this game brings me back to those days where I was able to relax and annihilate waves of enemies.

Positive key points:
- A lot of mission and item variety.
- The game runs smoothly.
- The story is surprisingly good if you are into Warhammer 40K.
- The graphics and design are great.
- Mission duration is on average between 10-25m depndending on the difficulty.
- The game crashed once in 35 hours and on the menu, so I'm pretty happy with that.
- Average - good items start poping up early, so the game scales nice.
- The difficulty selection in the missions and how it's described is a great advantage.

Negative key points:
- The start is a bit complex (no interactive tutorial, just reading text).
- There are a few bugs in gameplay that need refinement:
    - Playing the tech adept, you're contructs(support npc's) get stuck behind items or stay inactive while you are fighting, once in a while.
    - The switch between weapon sets is not very fluid.
    - Enemies can thrown behind walls after a knockdown, which then become untargetable until they come out.

I mean... it's pretty bad. It's Diablo in space, but the controls are garbage and English is clearly not its first language. This is not a new game, and there's kinda no excuse for the QoL to still be this atrocious.

Lemme rephrase. I bet there's a really cool game here, but it's hidden behind (a) incredibly awkward controls, (b) bad voice acting and (c) a story I wouldn't care about even if it did make sense (to be fair: it might make more sense than I think it does; I have a very hard time paying attention through the atrocious acting and even worse writing).

This is a cash-in on the W40k IP, that takes little care to pay any respect to that setting. For example: we say ""in the grim, dark future of the 41st millennium, there is only war."" Saying instead ""in the distant future of the 41st millennium, peace does not exist"" is just a blatant attempt to explicitly NOT SAY the franchise catch-phrase.

Last (and least): this game makes my PC heat-up more than anything I've ever run on this rig. I handle Elden Ring, Icarus, Diablo IV and Dwarf Fortress with no problem. Playing Inquisitor is the only thing that has ever caused my extra fans to kick-on. I won't say anything as cringeworthy as ""this game isn't worth the strain it puts on my machine"" (which it isn't), but there must be A LOT of unnecessary stuff going on in the background for such a lackluster product to cause so much extra heat.

Even then, you may still want to avoid this one unless you’re willing to slog through a [b]terribly dull experience[/b].

Seeing as I’m a Warhammer 40,000 fan who’s REALLY tired of Space Marines and I think the Inquisition is one of the most interesting factions of the setting, trying out this game seemed like a no-brainer to me. I may not be a massive fan of [i][url=https://www.gog.com/game/diablo]Diablo[/url][/i] style hack-and-slash action RPGs, but I can enjoy a good one every once in a while, such as the excellent [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/219990/Grim_Dawn/]Grim Dawn[/url][/i]. I’m telling you this because when you hear my points of criticism against Inquisitor Martyr, you may well think that maybe I just don’t get the appeal of [i]Diablo[/i]-like games in the first place.

So when I tell you that the [b]missions are boring and repetitive[/b] and that the [b]maps are uninspired collections of (randomly assembled?) hallways and arena rooms[/b], you may say: ""That’s just the way these games are."" Yes, even main story missions often boil down to killing everything on a map seemingly pieced together from completely flat hallways and nondescript rooms. Yes, the story is just an excuse to get you to play more missions. Yes – all of that is the usual fare for these types of games. But [b]it’s usually done better in other [i]Diablo[/i]-likes![/b] After the initial missions that set up the core mystery of the plot, I’ve never once felt truly engaged during my time with Inquisitor Martyr, as everything just boiled down to holding the attack button to kill random enemies, wiping the map to win, and receiving some story explanation for why you need to rinse and repeat ad infinitum.

All of this would have been easier to stomach if not for the fact that [b]every single aspect of Inquisitor Martyr feels just a little bit crummy[/b]. That’s perhaps the most remarkable thing about this game: Someone went to great lengths to put all of this [b]diverse Warhammer 40,000 content[/b] into the game, from various planet biomes (ice worlds, desert worlds etc.) to the large number of different enemy models (Chaos, Xenos, heretics, pirates etc.) and various weapon types you get to play with (from flamers to power halberds) – but none of it is really very good...

[b]None of the enemies feel distinct[/b] as you just mow them down indiscriminately without even looking too closely at them. The [b]weapons feel way less impactful than they should[/b], be that because they sound underwhelming (just listen to the bolter and plasma gun sounds) or because of lackluster visual effects and awkward (melee) animations. The [b]voice acting for your main character is atrocious[/b], no matter which class you pick (luckily, some of the NPCs are alright). And while the game throws lots of gameplay systems at you, [b]you can usually get through any mission by choosing whichever equipment has the highest numbers and holding down the attack button[/b]. The suppression system boils down to running back the way you came every once in a while to cower behind a chest-high wall for a bit. And that's not even getting into the fundamental problem of focusing your game about Inquisitors entirely on shooting and hitting things, when investigation, deduction and carefully orchestrated plans should be the core of any Inquisitor’s work.

All in all, Inquisitor Martyr is a mediocre experience from top to bottom. [b]If you’re not into Warhammer 40,000, there’s literally no reason to play this, as there are plenty of less dull [i]Diablo[/i]-like action RPGs available[/b]. Even if you’re into Warhammer 40,000, you’ll need to set your expectations pretty low to see anything more in Inquisitor Martyr than a load of wasted potential.

[h3]Addendum[/h3]
If you're interested in Inquisitor: Martyr, you may also want to take a look at the comments section of this review for some additional viewpoints and further information. As you can see from the topics I decided to talk about in my review, my personal opinion of the game comes very much from the perspective of someone who values things like interesting map/mission design, plot etc. If you don't share that perspective and you place more value on being able to tweak your character build with a complex skill system, for example, you may have a very different experience with Inquisitor: Martyr.",1682975617,1685354451,False,103,1,0.7293052077293396,9,True,False,False

It's a little dated.  Controls are a bit clunky.  If you are using a controller, the mouse and keyboard are disabled entirely, which I find really annoying.  Since I play on desktop, having mouse and keyboard available while I'm sifting through junk in the inventory would have been helpful.  Skill targeting is a bit of a problem when using a controller as well.

I personally love playing the game when listening to an Album/Podcast in the background.
The Graphics, Story and Gameplay is pretty well-done, even though the level design could be improved on.

The Game is absolutely god-aweful at explaining how the systems works.
I spent most of the time reading the in-game Journal to even understand what most of the things mean or do.
All the 'tutorial' and 'hints' are useless, they never tell you anything important.

Only when I was 40+ Hours in did I find out my 'Sororitas' can turn into an 'Embodied Saint' for a period of time because the game never tells you.
I had to find out about the 'Tarot Card' system from a YouTube video about the game.

This game is something im always in the mood for. If I want to sweat/rage and grind I can do that, If I want to sit back, chill and have drink this game is great for that too. Just soak in all the action and art style of 40k. I find myself playing it every day, at least one mission. 

There is a ton of customization and loot, im still learning a lot of it. The story isn't interesting for the first few hours then it gets pretty good. Still nothing mind blowing but its interesting. 

The gameplay is... Technically repetitive but as you progress it gets way better. New enemies, different themed maps, different mission types etc. Try out new weapons and change your build. 

As far as content goes, the game plus the DLC will provide HUNDREDS on hours of fun. There is I think 5 classes, a campaign(with multiple stories/quests at once), warzones, special missions, void crusades, co-op, pvp, clans, end game, challenges and general missions available just to hop in for fun/ modifying with tarot cards(cards are generally buffs for enemies but you get better loot etc). 

My one gripe with this game is the boss battles. I also have Warhammer Chaosbane and those boss battles were really good (minus unclean one). The bosses in this game just feel like usual enemies but OP. Very dependent on your rank vs their rank. 

Also, the game runs good,sounds good, feels good and looks pretty good (would do better on a higher res monitor as some fine detail gets blurry on 1080p).

The only critique i can say is that solo leveling to level 100 is outrageously slow and mindnumbing

EDIT: after 200 hours the most frustrating problems of the game emerged
-Audio cues often bugs out and you get completely wrong cues for drops
-Poison damage area is very difficult to spot, leading to a premature death often.
-AI of enemies is pretty good. AI of allies and minions is criminally stupid and missing any kind of self preservation, making you fail often missions unless you gimp yourself lowering the difficulty to a level that loot will be abysmal.
-Crafting components balance is not well thought out, some components are useless and there is not a conversion system and other components are never enough
-Leveling is too slow
-Build variety is limited to 1-2 builds per character
-The void crusades is the most convoluted and unecessarily complicated endgame system i've ever seen, unplayable without having guides always open.
-tarot cars. Good system but the leveling rate is insanely slow
-Some particular missions instructions are unclear and too brief

GIving a 5. Take the game on sale if you like the setting and you have already burned out all other ARPG.

(Most of the negative comments and issues described in the other reviews are accurate.)  But nevertheless, after a while I was hooked.  The setting is appropriately grimdark, the music is great, the combat is a lot of fun, and although there are only a few classes there is a lot of customization available to keep things interesting.  The dialogue is inane, but this is Warhammer; what else would you expect?  Some of the voice acting is hideously awful though.  It sounds like one of the devs recruited their middle-school kids to do it between dinner and homework.  The main story and sidequests are engaging, and the random missions are fun for multiple replays.  Co-op is available, and has an auto-leveling feature.  PvP is supposedly available, but I never have tried it.  There are co-op and PvP lobbies available, and joinable ""cabals"", but these features appear to be pretty dead at present.  The devs made a serious effort to overhaul the game after its initial mediocre reviews, but it's pretty clear that they've moved on so not much more will happen with the game. 

If you like ""Grim Dawn"" or ""Torchlight 2"" you will probably like this game.  I really can't speak for Diablo fans because I didn't like it, but it's the same general concept so if you liked Diablo there's a good chance it will interest you.  Also, if you like the Warhammer 40,000 universe, it captures that atmosphere and should appeal to you on that level.  It has a lot of problems that the other reviews describe in detail, so you should definitely wait for a Steam sale.  (And although I don't have the ""Sororitas"" DLC, it is clearly not worth full price because there is no additional content, aside from the class itself.)  The Emperor Protects!

EDIT: I should add that a really fun feature is the destructibility of various objects and terrain features.  Eldar shooting at you from behind barrels?  Blast the barrels out of the way!  Tyrannids under a pillar?  Bring it down on top of them!  Just in a bad mood and got a big gun? Destroy everything you can!  Also, the smaller terrain features often have rewards when destroyed.  Usually it's only a bit of money, but sometimes you can find  health, supplies or equipment.  Long Live The Imperium!",1683429132,1684061509,True,24,1,0.715623438358306885,0,True,False,False

Knowledge, child. There is no keener mind in the galaxy than that sour chunk of meat that occupies his skull. He has forgotten more about the inner workings of man and xenos alike than any Apothecary has ever known. I came to him to learn how to craft new and better contagions, so that Grandfather's blessings might be shared more freely. There are secret plagues from Old Night in these containers and virulent infections culled from crumbling bones of long dead aeldari. And with these raw materials and his aid, I have made wonders and horrors undreamt of by even the most glopsome of my brothers. Plagues that would devour even the rubbery flesh of Grandfather's children...

Daemons are not susceptible to mortal plagues.

No, they are not. And yet I have seen the results myself. That is what he offers me, child. In his shadow, I grow pleasingly feculent.

And what does he get out of it?

Were you not listening? Plagues, child. Swift plagues that can ravage entire systems at impossible rates. Oh, his mind is a thing of broken beauty. Even Abaddon cannot conceive of genocide on such a scale - it is not war to our Chief Apothecary, but simply...pest control. Imagine it. A great silence, falling all at once across a system.

I tried it when I was looking for our next coop game and was suprised again because almost everything is in a better place than it was. It is still a bit clunky and the standard enemies are quite dark in rather dark levels but in its current form, it is a good, fun game to play if you enjoy WH40K at least a little. In addition, it works well in coop. It is quite easy to play with a group of chars of different levels and almost all progress is tracked for all players. I would still not pay full price, though.

The old review:

TL;DR: If you are a WH40K fan you might want to grab this at a discount. I'd say it is worth 10€ at most.

The story is really good. The secondary story is really good. The voice acting is superb. The aesthetics are well done. Lore wise is makes sense (with a few excepions of course) There are quite a few good ideas that I don't want to spoil.

But the underlying game is not up to par. Combat is clunky but in a bad way. The controls don't feel direct enough for a hack-n-slay. Gameplay is massively repetetive: levels repeat themselves and it is almost always the same few enemies or very minor reskins. Staggeringly there IS a complete second faction of enemies. The story missions just don't you them. Completely baffling. There is smaller stuff like the skills that cannot be mapped to the mouse buttons or the non-intuitive crafting.

While the game has its flaws, including occasional technical issues and repetitive gameplay, it more than makes up for them with its engaging story, deep customization options, and satisfying combat system.

Pros:

Engaging story: Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr has a well-crafted storyline that immerses you in the grim and brutal universe of Warhammer 40,000. As an Inquisitor investigating a mysterious warp anomaly, you'll face off against a variety of enemies and uncover secrets that will keep you hooked throughout the game.

Deep customization options: Inquisitor - Martyr offers a wide range of customization options for your character, including weapons, armor, and abilities. This allows you to tailor your playstyle to your preferences and experiment with different builds. The game also features a unique skill tree system that allows you to unlock new abilities and passive bonuses as you progress.

Satisfying combat system: The combat system in Inquisitor - Martyr is fast-paced and visceral, with a wide variety of weapons and abilities to choose from. The game also features destructible environments and cover, adding a layer of strategy to the combat. Overall, the combat is one of the game's strongest points and is sure to keep you engaged throughout.

Co-op multiplayer: Inquisitor - Martyr features a co-op multiplayer mode that allows you to team up with friends and take on missions together. This adds a social aspect to the game and can be a great way to tackle the more challenging missions.

Graphics and atmosphere: The graphics in Inquisitor - Martyr are top-notch, with detailed environments and character models that help bring the Warhammer 40,000 universe to life. The game's dark and foreboding atmosphere is also a major highlight, creating a sense of tension and dread that is fitting for the setting.

Cons:

Technical issues: Inquisitor - Martyr has been known to have occasional technical issues, including crashes and performance problems. While these issues are not constant, they can be frustrating when they do occur.

Repetitive gameplay: While the combat system in Inquisitor - Martyr is satisfying, the gameplay can become repetitive over time. The missions and objectives can feel similar, and the game's level design is not particularly varied.

Steep learning curve: Inquisitor - Martyr can be overwhelming for new players, with a steep learning curve and complex systems to master. This can be discouraging for some, but the game's depth and customization options make it worth the effort.

Limited character movement: The movement system in Inquisitor - Martyr is somewhat limited, with characters unable to jump or climb. This can make the game feel restrictive at times and can be frustrating when trying to navigate around obstacles.

Lack of variety in enemies: While the game features a variety of enemies to fight, including cultists, demons, and heretics, they can start to feel repetitive over time. More enemy types or variations could have added more diversity to the game.

Overall, Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr is a solid game that successfully captures the essence of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Its engaging story, deep customization options, and satisfying combat system make it a must-play for fans of the franchise. While the occasional technical issues and repetitive gameplay can be drawbacks, they are overshadowed by the game's strengths.

All I want is just being able to set the resolution to 1920x1200 and play the game, but that just doesn't work. Every time I open the game there's a new surprise: sometimes the resolution is set to 800p, with no option to select anything higher than that. Some other times the game is in a weird windowed mode that you can't move, with part of the game outside of the screen. So, I have to start juggling with settings (switching between windowed/fullscreen, trying different resolutions etc.) until I somehow get it to work as intended. Or not, there's no guarantee. And even when it does work as intended, that's just temporary, because the next day i re-open the game and I find myself back to square one.

First time I started it up, I got stopped after the intro cutscene because ""unable to connect to servers"". Okay, can I play offline? No? Oh...
So I do some searching and find a thread stickied in the discussions board which has some pretty long-winded list of excuses for why the game is online only and will never allow offline play at all.

Then I noticed another stickied thread in the discussions page about this 'known issue', with the developers having posted an incredibly scuffed work-around of manually installing an SSL certificate yourself which they have dumped into a folder in the game's directory. Very professional.

So okay, not off to a great start is it, but at least now it connects, right?

Well... yes, except it turns out that I can't actually interact with the game, because it has decided that I have a gamepad connected even though I don't, and therefore only shows gamepad button prompts and will not allow me to use my mouse cursor at all.
So I go back to the discussions board to look for a solution to this one, and waddya know, 'known issue'... from 5 tears ago. Supposedly ""fixed"". There's also yet another incredibly scuffed workaround of deleting some registry entries. And this 'solution' was provided by the devs themselves!
So with much grumbling and gritted teeth, I go delete said entries, rerun the game aaannd... same issue. After that, I threw up my hands in defeat, uninstalled and refunded.

I bought the game day one on Xbox One and at first I was impressed but after the main content was done there wasn't much to do and I felt ripped off. Especially since i forked over £70 for the gold edition at the time and when Prophesy came out, I had to pay for it to play it, which I didn't because I already spent a lot for **** all. So I waited patiently for the time this collection would come out for cheap so I could snatch it up and play on my superior PC. Knowing how the game was on release and playing it now, I definitely appreciate this version more than the day one release version. Before, I played as the crusader and he was pretty fun but tbh, the classes only determine what weapons you get other than the armour abilities but it's the weapons you're mainly going to be using and the gadgets. This time around, I played as the assassin class and i'm only a fan of one of her armour abilities where you can stop time. Its pretty dope. the other two armour abilities are one where you create 2 copies of yourself and they're like a distraction but they do no damage, well mine didn't anyway but if you have a shotgun equipped the copies will constantly bully the enemies with the knock back and stuns. its pretty fun too but the stopping time one is way more useful. The other one allows you to turn invisible and if you get attacked or are attacked by AOE you become visible again. It sucks.You'll also quickly gravitate to a particular play style once you start getting some different choices of guns but I started off with a shotgun and sniper. The sniper is *** but the shotgun absolutely devastates. Anything else I used afterwards doesn't nearly compare. After I learnt that the shotgun is an AOE weapon, I pretty much filled my AOE skill tree and then for my second weapon I had a melta gun which has a good AOE skill. Ranged skill tree i'm filling up too and aimed shot. Some DoT as well but basically the set up I have just wrecks and i'm happy it didn't take me long to figure it out.There are some annoyances with the combat though, I changed my movement to WASD since I wanted to keep the aiming separate from the movement but when i'm moving and I use a skill whilst moving, say the normal attack button, I stop when I shoot and if i hold down the shoot button I just keep stopping and starting instead of just standing still and shooting. I can move forward without touching the ""W"" key if I start shooting whilst moving forward and its super annoying because I just wanna stand still and shoot but instead it shoots, runs forward a bit then shoots again then runs forwards again until I let go of the shoot button so I have to be very mindful of my movements before I shoot. I mainly just click whenever I wanna shoot but it's starting to break my mouse I think. It's also the reason why I've gravitated to the shotgun, not only does the weapon wreck more than one enemy at a time and stun locks them with the basic attack but it's also the easiest gun to use with the control scheme because the other ones just aren't fun to use in comparison. Shotgun is easier to run and gun with too so you don't really need to stand still to shoot unless you get to high level and the shotty isn't up to par with the level.I like the enemy variety, It would've been cool if all the rebel guards didn't look the same in all of the sub-sectors though. could've just changed the colours, ya know? Because it kinda gets boring when most of what you're shooting at is red. You got the word bearers (RED), khorn (RED) fair enough, lore wise they're meant to be red but then you got the rebel guard (WHITE/RED), Eldar (WHITE/RED). I know developers like to use red to symbolise enemies but gib me another colour to shoot at, please. There are other factions who don't have red as their colour but 4 different factions having red as their colour is too much, 2 is enough.Also, there's no purple in the appearance customise thing, like whats up with that. They got all these nasty green and brown colours that look like poo and sick but no purple? Damn shame. I like purple. The appearance customise also bugs out sometimes making you not be able to view the changes so you have to quit out of the game and load it all back up again just to change your appearance.I like the variety of guns and armours too. Would've been nice if there was a transmorg because some look wicked then others, not so much and it kinda sucks because you could get this really good piece of gear but the design of it just doesn't fit my fancy and just changing the colour of it doesn't do it for me. Like having it where we could salvage some gear then you unlock that appearance forever would be awesome since so many appearances just don't get seen since they belong on crappy gear that you're never going to equip after a certain level lol.The allied guardsmen are all the same colour too no matter where you are. I think you should be able to customise what your guardsmen look like, colours and the lot. Just doesn't feel like i'm in different sub-sectors when all the allies look the same and you never see any civilians, alive civilians anyway. Since a lot of the sectors have been cut off from one another you'd expect them to have some variations in their look at least.Even though I've listed a lot of bad things with the game, they're more like issues I have with not being immersed enough into the universe and its these little things that grind my gears not just about this game but most games. Allow me to shoot and run but if not don't force me to run when i'm standing still shooting. More variety in colours for the enemy and have a good purple in the game so I can wear purple. It really is a fun game though. The destruction is good, it runs smoothly, the sound is impactful (not a word according to steam). I also haven't even gotten through the main story yet 26.3 hours of play time atm. I still wanna play more and I cant wait to try the other classes. I think i'll go back to the crusader after this character because he looks cool and is the closest thing to a space marine in this game.",1679772112,1679772479,True,0,0,0.494437575340270996,0,True,False,False

First of all, the camera angle just feels awkward, it makes me think I am playing a more like top-down game than isometric game.

Second of all, the skills. Let's just say that all the skills here are just copypasted skills from APRG The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, which is not surprising since it is made by the same studio, but here there is even lower number of skills than in Van Helsing, which straight up feels like a devolution. Also the skills are tied to the weapons you are using, which limits your customization fantasies.

Third of all the cover mechanic. I just do not think hiding behind cover in an ARPG works, it does not mesh well with kiting. Also you want to enter a room and you cannot use a wall next to the door to ""peek"" inside the room. The cover mechanic may have worked better if the developers worked with fog of war or something and you would have to methodically uncover next room etc. But it still may have been horrible. 

Fourth of all the monetization. Selling skins to a primarily single player game is the definition of greed. Also DLCs that add one playable class each, when the original game has only three classes? Get out of here.

I love Warhammer 30K/40K.

Calling it an ""Open-world"" ""Action RPG"" is quite a stretch. It's a hack 'n' slash dungeon crawler with small levels (which in itself isn't a bad thing).

The voice acting is truly awful. Story-ruining awfulness that just makes you skip the story narration/interactions.

Rinse and repeat levels with no discernible gameplay difference between factions you face.

Awful performance, even with settings dialled down to minimum.

Upgrades are essentially via RNG dropped items, and crafting levels have to be unlocked - why not just make higher level crafting require rarer materials? Speaking of which, I LOVE a bit of grinding for materials, I will slowly walk for half an hour from one corner of a map to the other, overburdened because I am NOT dropping a single item. In this game, when you come to scrap items for materials, you are not guaranteed to receive them there is only a % chance of you receiving the materials!

I found navigating the menu/page UI to be a hindrance, particularly trying to get out of the galactic map on the bridge of your ship - I couldn't see any 'exit' option, and going 'back' takes you further 'out' planet/system/sector/etc.

I REALLY wanted to like this. I stuck with it longer than I usually would because, well ... it's Warhammer.

Really f*cking fun game if you like the W40k universe and ARPGs. Best way to describe it is Diablo 2 + Warhammer 40k

Although as an ARPG it is a bit weaker in that aspect, loot and stats are a bit lackluster, but still hell of a lot of fun to play, the combat, the gore everything is spot on. Story isn't that bad either, you're basically following this abandoned mysterious ship called the ""Martyr"" that is jumping around the Caligari Sector (where the game takes place) and you are an Inquisitor that is tasked with hunting it down and solving it's mystery (hence the name Inqusitor Martyr).

Pretty much all major factions are covered in the game excluding the Orks, Necroids and Tau.

[b][h1]Bad Stuff[/h1][/b]
The cons are it's online only, which literally makes no sense since its a PvE single player game with optional co-op. There are like these daily and weekly bounties and stuff like Destiny 2 which seems a bit weird, like the game has a live service skeleton without the live service. Also no cloud saves? Also you need to enable high DPI scaling in the .exe file to use 2k and 4k resolutions (not that bad but a bit annoying).

- Characters constantly get stuck on the environment when moving
- Several major campaign bosses sat there not fighting for the whole fight
- Frequent enemy rubber banding
- Combat text is broken, incoming damage #s don't match shield/health loss
- Wording/UI is very inconsistent making it hard to know when effects apply
- Descriptions are wrong i.e. a passive ""crit chance"" when unlocked provided crit damage
- Can't see temp buff cumulative values, there's hard caps on stats so this matters a lot
- No way to track achievements that unlock important passives/buffs
- Tons of loot mods and no way to filter them makes sorting loot an absolute chore
- Non-campaign missions are very boring
- Endgame runs take 1.5-2 hours to fully clear to loot room (shorter for less loot)
- Endgame runs get harder as you go, but start way too easy for way too long
- Endgame makes you manually reapply loot mods every sublevel, no stored presets

Original review:

TLDR: A very unintuitive account creation process and neocore games' broken website mean that I can not actually play the game that I paid for. And there are plenty of reviews with similar issues. Buy this game only if you are feeling lucky...

LONG VERSION: In order to create a character and actually play the game, you need to create and verify an account on neocore games' website. Fair enough, except that there is no pop-up or other ingame notification about this, so I selected the class I wanted to play and kept clicking ""create character"", only to have nothing happen. Eventually I found the reason why, but this lack of ingame message about this was strike 1 for me. 

Strike 2 was when I tried to register an account on neocore games' website, only to be told that I have been sent a verification email, which I need to open in order to finalize my account and be able to play the game. Except, that no, I havent actually been sent a verification email. And using the ""resend"" does nothing.

Strike 3 is that this has been going on for a week now. A full week, during which I can not play the game I bought, due to the developer's crappy website.

In light of this new development, I'm flipping to positive, and that clears the counter. But folks should be aware of how many people saw this and considered it when purchasing.

ETA: So the last patch Neocore did has apparently resolved my connection issues. There's nothing in the patch notes about connectivity except for ""improved backend performance"", so I dunno what changed. Yet, that problem has cleared up for me.

I can now recommend Inquisitor with a clear conscience. All my notes in the review below still stand. It still requires online connectivity at all times, which I think is a significant downside, but all the positives are enough for me to give it the thumb's up. If you can deal with that requirement, and if it doesn't cause you trouble like it did for me, then this one is worth grabbing on sale.

Note: it is NOT worth the full $49.99 US. But when Steam Sales occur it's usually $10. That's quite a bargain if you find the game enjoyable.

OG Review follows:

It's a solid game. 
-Fun visuals. 
-Nicely thematic. 
-The story ranges from serviceable up to engaging once you hit the expansion. 
-Character customization is fun.
-There are multiple build options for every class, varying gameplay significantly between runs. 

One could wish for a way to just skip the campaign, but players have been asking for that since day one, and it hasn't appeared, so I think it's just hard-baked into the code and the devs can't do anything about it. It's not that big a deal, really, just an irritant.

But if you're seeing the new Sororitas inquisitor and getting hyper (I know I am), just be aware of this ongoing significant problem. You'll see that reviews for this are in the mixed category, and that's for good reason. This is a solid game except for one fatal flaw:

[b]Some people can't actually play it.[/b]

You'll be sitting in the lobby, looking over your gear or build and get disconnected.
You'll finish your mission, return to the lobby, be salvaging or selling and get disconnected.
You'll be trying to start a mission. The screen hangs. Disconnected.

This only became an issue after they changed hosting services towards the middle of '22. No doubt the new servers cost less, but you get what you pay for.

To their credit, the disconnects are no longer immediate (usually) and sometimes you can get two or three missions before getting booted. But not always, and certainly not over a longer play session.

This only seems to be a big issue for some users. Others have no trouble at all. Customer service is polite and helpful and gives you a way to dump everything to a file for them to analyze. But this has gone on for about four months now. No amount of logs seems to fix an issue, and I'm starting to think the developers are just stumped.

If you're thinking 'I'll just play offline', stop right there. You can't. Even single player requires that you be logged in. This is because there's a PVP mode, and cheating is way too easy to accomplish if you can fiddle a character without the server watching you. I do not know what percentage of the playerbase engages in pvp, but it's apparently enough that the developers need everyone logged in at all times, even serial soloists.

This review will likely flip to a thumb's up if they ever figure this out. Know that if the constant disconnects don't affect you, they might not ever.

Just be aware that you're rolling the dice. Go in with your eyes open.",1668108626,1678259194,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,11,True,False,False

what this game boils down to is green numbers good red numbers bad. It is looter and a bad one at that.

The basic game play loop is fine but the biggest problem is the progression system. unlocks are purely in the form of stat boosts all skills and abilities are tied to your equipment so pretty much you will rinse and repeat the same game play over and over again until you are sick of it.

A much better idea would have been to have a skill progression system to unlock new abilities and then level 60 would actually feel different from level 50. but sadly you will be mashing the same buttons all the way to level 100.

Other things which are bad about this game.
No quit to windows option in the pause menu. I shouldn't have to alt+F4 my games in 2023
the voice acting is laughable at points. Most of it is standard. Not great but not terrible. but some of it is really bad.
Very little variety. either in the levels, enemies or indeed the game play. There really is no difference between the Eldar or Chaos Marines. 
Achievements based on random chance are a terrible way to keep people playing. If I have to do 15 of a certain thing don't make me do 100 things hoping for a random event to happen 15 times. 
The music what there is of it is pretty good. Sadly most of the time they just have ambient noise during game play and so what I consider a really important part of the game is missing.
Oh and the glitches are many and annoying.

What is good about this game
Praise be to Nuffle for skippable intros
the artwork is fantastic as it is with all Warhammer properties. I have no idea if it is unique to this game or just from the Warhammer catalogue but it is superb.
I have not found a single game breaking bug so far so that is always a good thing


I know 40K is Grimdark but this is more Grind Dark and then grind some more and grind and grind and grind until you realise the grind really isn't worth it.

There is enough of fun numbers go up and becoming a one person walking carnage to hit spots on mechanics being fun checklist.
However this game doesn't respect player's time and said time investment down to the core mechanics.
First off - it's always online requirement. A bizarre choice in a game largely geared towards pve and solo or coop content. More so it creates various mechanical hurdles in 'end-game' coop modes as it forces end of mission even if crusade (type of said content) side objectives are not done or found.
It also forces a limited inventory, and more importantly limited character slot inventory. Meaning with 10 slots and heavy focus on seasonal gear being better, means sooner or later you will have to say goodbye to gear you have grinded for.
Second point is said seasonal content. It's not only time limited, but never returning (aside from some shards and mechanics/ maps). Meaning, there is a content in a /largely single player game/ which gets artificially gated behind time, fomo, and grind.
Not cool.
Third off, the game tries so so hard to be mmo like. Various sub currencies, weekly mechanics, shops on timers, mission roll on timer. Sometimes it feels like they wanted to go full life service but had to scale back from lack of, by my guess, money.
There's even micro-dlc store for one of the currencies if you want to not spend irl money on those. Which makes me question why not release them either as bundled content pack for irl money only, or as free dlc.

I like but.
But there are some things that sort of take away from a good, 40K based looter shooter.
I like that the dungeons are fairly simple and one can't get lost in them.
One can alter the difficulty from dungeon to dungeon.
Character selection is sort of a difficulty selection of it's own.
Crusader; easy
Assassin; medium
Psycer; hard
 I think my biggest female dog is the fact that the weapons seem a bit out of balance.
20th century weapons like flame throwers, grenade launchers and automatic rifles seem much more useful than laser guns, plasma weapons and melta guns.
 The only exception to this being graviton guns.

Incredibly minor passives that feel like almost no choices really matter, since all options are incredibly bland. In most cases you are deciding between 1% aoe or 1% ranged damage. But no indicator or way to know if this even effects your weapons/abilities.

My biggest complaint if the visual clutter and visual representation in the game.

[b] After a few attempts, I finally completed this game and I must say I never expected that I'll like it so much. [/b]

I'm not a hardcore W40k fan, but I've read some books, played other games, and so on. I have to warn you - I'm trying to enjoy almost every Warhammer 40,000 game due to the lack of good ones in this universe. My Cadia stood really hard during the [b]""Space Marine""[/b] walkthrough, and I think that every Dawn of War game is good in some ways. And [b]""Inquisitor: Martyr""[/b] is definitely a good game as well.

There is a decent main storyline, some memorable characters to meet during your holy crusade to purge the unclean and discover the truth, a huge variety of equipment, active and passive skills, late and midgame activities besides story missions and so on, which already makes this game an almost perfect ARPG. Three main classes with their subclasses (+ one completely new DLC class Tech-adept, but later about him) have a lot of different gameplay mechanics, so replayability is very high. Also, you can respec your character for a small price anytime to try out other builds.

The atmosphere of the Dark Millenium represented perfectly through surprisingly good music, details on locations, dialogues, notes, and lots of other lore-friendly stuff you can find throughout the game. So it doesn't matter, you're a neophyte or you're already a big fan of this universe, you should give this game a chance to swallow you like an Eye of Terror.
Yeah, the game has A LOT of repetitive content to help you grind the best gear, materials, and so on, but you DON'T HAVE to even pay attention to all this if you don't want to. It won't prevent you from completing the game and having fun with it in any way. I've completed the main story, side-quests, and priority assignments DLCs and finished the game with 62lvl crusader, completely equipped with relic gear within 50 hours or something like that. And I haven't done any randomly generated missions on the star map. Of course, if you want some Diablo 3 in the WH40k universe - go on, but I'm not a big fan of it.

One more thing - you have to buy [b]""Inquisitor: Prophecy""[/b] DLC to complete the main story, otherwise it will be unexpectedly torn off at the most interesting place. But in my opinion, the last quarter of the main plot the DLC delivers is the best part of the game.

Also, there is a moment about Tech-adept class in the [b]""Prophecy""[/b] DLC, which disappointed me a lot. The thing is you can only play through the expansion storyline with this character class. It doesn't matter if you own the original game or the DLC only, with Tech-adept you will only be able to complete just a final part of the story. Hope this game will be supported and one day developers will give me an option to replay the game from the very beginning with this interesting character.

Overall it's 8/10 due to some technical issues and the moments I described previously. I'll definitely complete this game one more time someday. If you're looking for a decent [b]Warhammer[/b] videogame, this is one of them.",1586200669,1675119132,True,144,9,0.888316094875335693,11,True,False,False

the graphics are also hit and miss, there's some impressive and fun destruction happening when it hits the fan and the armors, weapons and enemies have a pleasant amount of detail but some of the environments look... unfinished (looking at you repeating tiles in the higher levels of the hive cities) also, the repetition of envs sets in pretty early. 

the performance of the game is also a pain point, no reason why a game with the detail level could have such mediocre performance. it is not terrible, but neocore tech stack needs a review. 

Lorewise... it its choke full of correct WH40K references and flavor. the power level of the Inquisitor tho... not even the strongest, most powerful lords of the inquisiton have the destructive skills that this dude has, he is low key chapter master power level at the start of the game and scales up to almost primarch level down the road, which is... well silly, but makes for fun gameplay.

I played many 40K games in the past, from RTS, to shooters but without a doubt this is a genre that fits like a glove in this intense, bloody and gory universe. 
The game put us in the shoes of an Inquisitor set to find the Martyr ship and to purge the Caligari Sector.

Visually the game is pretty OK and a lot of your surrounding are completely destructible. The controls are intuitive, similar to many games of the genre and the skill tree system is pretty decent. The number of mission are fair, 20+ missions, but although they seem diverse some missions are really short and repetitive. And that affect the length of the campaign, that in the end seems short only for you to find out that you can have a lot more to play if you purchase the many DLC's available for it. 
Don't get me wrong I still enjoyed the game, and you still have a lot more to play if you wish, only with the base game, but looking into a paid DLC list of 20+ items I can only think that the devs/publishers are getting a bit to much greedy, aren't they?

Definitely worth purchasing with all the DLC. Sure, it can look expensive, but I prefer buying a DLC here and there than having to deal with crazy microtransations, loot boxes and co.

PROs
+ Class selection is quite varied and each class has its own different play style.
+ Easy to learn, but very flexible game system.
+ No microtransactions
+ Warhammer 40K lore
+ Fun campaign and good voice acting

Everything in my long form review is still valid, but with all of the bugs and glitches and game destroying disconnects and server issues, I can no longer recommend this. I have been told on their Discord server that the team has moved on to another game, and fixes will be far and few between. They can't even fix a simple broken achievement.

If you liked their previous games, or were super into Diablo 2+, then I can safely say that you will like this. If you are just a fan of Warhammer 40k, then perhaps buy this on sale (new: but even then, single player won't save you from disconnecting mid mission, or desynching, and ending the mission and not being able to leave it, losing everything). While the numbers of enemies, items, abilities, and more is fantastic, eventually you will run out. The maps will become boring, the missions repetitive, and you will need to have a hard core Diablo grinding mindset to keep playing.

The other problem is the issue of the sheer number of bugs. Visual glitches, broken achievements and game progress, massive frame drops; and the worst is server connectivity. For a game that is always online and heavily about playing with friends, the number of disconnects and desynchs is bad. (new: all of these things are reaching unacceptable levels now, with barely any team left to fix things at all)

The Warhammer 40k aspects of this game are done really, really well. The factions, weapons, etc, all represented are done in a fantastic manner. As far as 40k games go, this one is nearly perfect in terms of how everything looks, sounds, and feels. It is just that the game-play quickly runs out and becomes a bit boring, so, again, be warned. If I could give a mixed review I would, because of the super high price tag. But as it comes down to just the two options, I will go with the positive one. I really don't think that the price should be this high, along with all of the DLC, and the expansion. (new: and the fact that it is basically no longer supported. When will they drop the servers entirely and just make the game unplayable?)

after many happy hours played both alone and with friends. i can confidently reccomend this game. this was the gaming experience I wanted with diablo 3.

GOOD DUNGEON CRAWLER
GOOD CHARACTER MODELS
GOOD RPG BUILDING
GOOD LOOTING MECHANICS
GOOD MISSION CHOICE

occasionally you will get a server hickup or a gameplay bug that will ruin a mission. this can be very frustrating, but the core game play is so good, and the issues so sparce it is easy to look over.

I have to admit:
I cannot recommend the game.

Graphics are too meh and confusing, 
Junk is too abundant, 
Builds too much unclear,
Difficulty has to be set by ourselves all the time as if there is no reference.

The most confusing element about the game is how ""gratuitous"" the enemies fall on you and we disperse them easily, whereas I think this game could have really benefited from a more direct, detailed, slow-burn engagement process with our enemies, instead of washing them away until we encounter a boss.

Because, ultimately, once we have washed away everything (and even when we encounter some difficulty) there is nothing left but a collection of junk and a level-up that leaves us in an uninteresting intermediate build.

I understand this is influenced by how diablo-likes are made, but in this game we really need to ""feel engaged"" with our combat loop and here we are not. As a result we are not engaged with our combat, not engaged with the level design, not engaged with our ""obscure"" build, not engaged with our loot. It is, additionally, most confusing and not good-looking visually ""when in combat"", with splatters of various chaotic fluids but lacking the atmosphere it aimed at.

If the game would have been moddable it would have become a real gem with a specific mod to make our ""engagements"", our fights, and our loot more meaningful. 

For instance:
We have many items we loot looking the same and comparable on same terms, but having varied micro-attributes, making them all junk, so to speak. Yes, I could decide to combine all ""experience gain items"", or all ""loot quality +X"" items, or all ""heat damage +X"" items and make a final build, but at this step we change damage type all the time, we receive too many items, and our build is too intermediate. So everything is ""left undecided"".

And then the ""quality level"" by itself makes most of your equipment obsolete and uninteresting and your equipment ""short-lived"" as it is replaced by the next QL item. The junkiness formula has multiple parts to it.

There are some immense qualities to this game, hindered by obvious flaws especially in passives game design.

+ Always great to have a new diablo-like!
+ Good W40K writing and great inquisitor lore
+ Great attention to detail
+ Some fun/humor in dialogue
+ Impressive W40K armory in profusing detail; the most detailed seen so far on individual equipment
+ Attributes and attribute steps are customized per class
+ Several main classes each with their subclasses
+ Achievements unlock real stat bonuses or unlock skill trees
+ Different voice-overs for male or female inquisitors
+ Interesting perks and perk load-out

But :
- confusing gameplay and screen feedback (too much mess onscreen)
- bland graphics a lot of times missing on the atmosphere
- Junk loot
- Repetitive patterns in levels
- Undistinguishable enemies and very confusing mass of targets that we ""explode""
- Inconclusive & unclear build system
- Unclear difficulty that we have to ""pick ourselves"" on every level, as if the game did not even know how to balance itself
- revolting passives (too weak step bonuses, such as +1% in something)
- revolting passives (ie. being forced to take an entire tree by taking all passives from all directions, thus removing any interest in player decision)
- and again, too much junk with lack of clarity on stats you would aim for, and obsolescence from a QL system


All this results in a poor gameplay and an opportunity missed.

Some better build mechanics could have saved this game, or some better engagement with the combat loop such as less enemies, enemies more resistant (which could be interesting too for MP), and better itemization.",1529017424,1673971600,False,0,0,0.516129076480865479,2,True,False,False

The story is fine, but nothing amazing, in many aspects you could write down the story in a few short sentences, but i dont like spoiling story in reviews. The combat is what you would expect from a diablo clone, however theres something kind of interesting with it as your skills are tied to your equipment so your weapons decide your skill bar, your armor gives you a class based skill, and another equipment slot gives you a utility skill. In addition you get perk unlocks as you progress through the game that are usually tied to achievements which i felt was an interesting way to unlock new perks as it forced you to try other playstyles. In addition they had some end game repeatable content like rift gates from diablo 3, but after a couple of those it begins to feel repetative leaving the end game leveling to be a bit of a slog to even attempt to get to max level, for reference i only made it to level 80.

1. Audio bugs. LOTS of audio bugs. Character footsteps playing when viewing the ship and choosing a mission. Interactables and destructables that make no sound or make inappropriate sounds. Missing UI sounds. Music stingers and ""Victory"" messages at the end of missions abruptly start and then get cut off. Out of sync SFX on an in-game video clip.
2. Broken keybinds. I can bind dodge to Shift + WASD, but then it doesn't work as stated, dodge simply activates on ANY WASD press.
3. Very mediocre voiceover and VO postprocessing effects. The performances are not very good to begin with, with characters not sounding like they are actually talking to each other. Also, the voices are overly compressed and distorted in an unpleasant way. Perhaps this was meant to simulate a 'communicator' or 'headset' morph on the voice, but it's poorly done and further drags down the performances.",1673572026,1673572100,False,1,0,0.494350284337997437,0,True,False,False

The game is now only sustained through regular seasons (twice a year) that see zero testing and always introduce a host of bugs that never get fixed. Neocore have tried to fix many of the egregious and game breaking bugs and have consistently failed, it's not even funny any more.

The game is becoming worse with every such update. That goes on top of game breaking bugs, account and connection problems that have been present for years and Neocore are unable to fix them.

At this stage, there is almost no response by the devs to bug reports, game crashes, account problems, etc. While they push out ""content"" that is half broken, untested and relying on absurd levels of RNG, and which additionally introduces new problems to the already released portions of the game.

Two years ago Neocore managed to turn it around with Martyr and through sheer effort and dedication started to earn positive reviews. No more.

My original character from my review was an Assassin, and now I made a Crusader. I've been having a ton more fun this time around. GPU temps are still a bit high, but quality of life has increased, and they've added more depth and tweaks to a lot of the mechanics to really bring the game to the next level. Plus after being bored to tears with the same ~8 enemies in Darktide it's refreshing to see SO MANY ENEMY RACES in Martyr. Really quite impressive, and well worth the purchase.

[b]Original 2019 Review:[/b] I give it a thumbs up, but certainly not an excited or overwhelming one. There are numerous issues, even with the 2.0 content, from major problems like poor performance, high GPU temperatures, repetitive combat and voice lines, and ho-hum forgettable level design to the minor issues like sorting the stash combines all tabs, no camera autorotation, tedious item comparison (have to look item by item in your inventory instead of an icon you can see at a glance on whether it's +/- quality), to general rough edges (like saying ""hold Space to Cover"" EVERYTIME, even if you rebind the key or have been playing for 20 hours).

The good stuff? Well it feels really 40k. You get a little Rogue Trader style ship you can fly around an immersive map looking for missions. The classes are enjoyable (although don't be fooled - the subclasses have extremely minor differences and can end up playing nearly the same). Playing an Assassin is almost like a twin stick shooter (since you generally rebind movement to WSAD and have a dodge roll), compared to a heavily armored, slower, and less active Crusader. Tying skills to weapons is interesting, albeit done before in the likes of Victor Vran, with the downside of it being tedious to keep high quality gear for the 2 or 3 weapons you like.

Anyway the company themselves give me almost no faith as their previous Van Helsing title took a couple of years and several repackages before arriving at a ""definitive"" edition. So I'd say Inquisitor is worth a buy if you like 40k, don't intend to sink 12-15 hours a day into this like PoE or Diablo 3, and if it's on a deep discount.

Expect some frustrations and some underdeveloped/tacked on systems, but at the core there's enough enjoyment. Actually that's pretty close to how 40k plays out on the tabletop, so maybe it's fitting.",1563858534,1673511520,True,1,0,0.453525781631469727,0,True,False,False

The story lines are really interesting and well written.

I played nearly 50hours and I'm still not in endgame which is incredible and needed, also I'm not even finished with the main quests. So I feel that with the different type of characters you can build there are hundreds of hours you can spend in the game if not thousands.
I really enjoy the new skills and combinations with the higher lvl items and the passive skilltree gives a good opportunity balance your defenses and firepower or get some great effect. It's also good that we can change the passives to try out different types of builds but we don't feel we should do that too often. (I did once)

I still don't know every aspect of the game, every system what is built in and this one gives me a little obsession to go back and play more. 

There is depth in the Inquisitor: Martyr which can entertain but not too much to hold you back from the joy of the game. (I mean I've got no time to fully understand and play POE - I loved it once, years ago but now I can't sit down to it after work)

SO I can really recommend this game if you like rpg games with a rusty-gothic vibe and you need a little bit more than casual gameplay.

What made me keep playing was the story (base + prophecy DLC) while I was reading the lore on the wiki.

Pros:
- playing as a badass Astartes delivering emperors will through violence!
- story (its not skyrim but interesting enough to keep you playing)
- wh 40k lore if your only contact with the universe was the Dawn Of War series or the battle figurines
- void crusades + tarot cards make an interesting endgame
- abilty to modify difficulty as you play (even the campaign)

Cons:
- since affixes and talent trees are ""percentage based"", itemisation is a bit underwhelming during the campaign (it gets better once you start dropping more interesting affixes on relic rarity which allow for more complexity and synergies)
- instead of letting you run crusades all the time, game forces you to farm ""shards"" first
- forcing me to hold ""shift"" to melee attack or click on the mob rather than letting me just swing my weapon freely and ""mawn the lawn""",1673212379,1673212503,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still a bit samey missions, could really do with a bit more level/terrain variety, but trying the Crusader and the new Sororitas character changed my opinion. I guess the assassin and psyker characters weren't for me. Neocore did a bit of a rejig to some of the systems and now I'm actually finding it fun, not amazing but it's not the slog it used to be.

[Update] Unfortuntaly the enjoyment doesn't last, once you get to about level 30 things really slow down. I can occasionally bring myself to play a couple of missions in a row to grind onwards, but at this point the lack of progress, the lack of enemy and terrain type variety and the slow nature of combat just combine to make the whole thing an uninteresting slog that I can't be bothered to play.

It's mindless purging on heretics
story is decent nothing fancy
you can buy DLC with in-game currency (not the new classes)

Overall a great game! I've had it for years on my Xbox One, and while it was fun, it was missing something, oh right, friends! now I may not have a lot of people to play this game with on PC but I love the sounds, the xenos, the forces of chaos, buy it when it goes on sale! but it's also worth it when not on sale if you like isometric and direct control!

* 打击感很差，近战击打的配音有点像 70、80 年代的武打电影，画面看着很暴力但是击打反馈像是砍纸片。
* 没有技能系统，也没有精心设计的技能动作，技能由装备提供，角色只有被动，你不能围绕喜爱的技能构建配装，不自由。
* 玩法单一，只有高度重复的任务，任务甚至没有 BOSS 可打，单调且缺乏挑战性，感受不到角色的成长。",1672903349,1672903349,False,0,0,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False

The Good
1. Enjoyed the Warhammer lore and feel
2. Very satisfying to blaze through hordes of alien and chaos mobs and special characters 
3. Liked the ship and amount of things to do and make

The Bad
1. Very frustrating server disconnects. Multiple times it crashed when I had picked up a relic I wanted and it's gone forever. Also multiple times it crashed just nearing the end of a long run and all progress is lost. 
2. Very slow tech fragment gain. I can't build a variety of machines in my team as it takes so long to gather them for building multiple weapons. Can't even try new types as I'll have to build it up all over again and I just don't have enough parts.
3. The glory rewards are so random. I tried hard for a week to earn the top 2500 glory reward but got nothing special. Whereas playing casually the week before and getting a thousand points less got an ancient relic and red gear. Felt like effort wasted.

So they sold a bullshit about how they carry for living world in they game and why that game should stay on online version and there is no way they will give as offline but when something go wrong with server-company:  u know well mmm fuck u we dont care u can w8.

Always online is idiotic, regardless of what the devs say. There is absolutely no argument.
Do not buy this game even if you saw it on sale. Since you won't be able to play it it is the same as throwing your money away.
The game has ""mostly positive"" views because at one point of time apparently it was stable. That time has passed. With added popularity this stability is gone. One third of Google Searches about Inquisitor - Martyr is about crashes and problems, ""inquisitor martyr connection issue"" has 859,000 results. The search ""inquisitor martyr"" has 1,110,000 results. A specific problem ""inquisitor martyr cannot connect to server"" has 63,600. A simple google search on ""inquisitor martyr progress lost"" nets you 590,000 results. You've read it right: More than half of the net presence of Inquisitor - Martyr is about people losing their game progress. If you have a controller you're in luck only 25,900 results for ""inquisitor martyr controller disconnected"".


Despite forcing players to be always online the game company does not have the server capacity to handle the traffic. As a result you simply cannot connect to the server, or in the off-chance you manage to login get booted from the server losing all your progress. I don't know if I'm the lucky one by simply not being able to connect at all since at least I didn't suffer through losing hours of my progress-levels, items, unlocks etc.- like many other players.

Each class has a set of skill trees, about 1/2 of which are unlocked at start the other half are unlocked by completing tasks like ""Complete 25 missions without dying*.  The game takes place in a subsector, with many systems, each with many planets.  Missions on each planet, story or not, increase your influence in the system, which leads to rewards.  There are many class mechanics for each class, there is an hourly resetting shop, item crafting.  The ""health potion"" of the game can even be tuned to increase health regen, buff stats.

I'm relatively early in the game and i don't think i've seen all enemy types, but so far i've faced off against chaos imperial guard, chaos marines, psykers, tyranids.  There seem to be fewer enemies per mission than say D3 had, but i think they are in general just a little tougher.  At level, trash mobs take just over one hit from my primary to kill, usually.

There are something like 8 item qualities.  This leads to my only complaint so far - blue and green qualities are reversed when compared to damn near every other game on the market.  This lead to me discarding some better gear in the opening missions of the campaign.

I'd say for the steam winter sale price of 9.99 usd (35 if you buy ALL of the dlc), it's a good ARPG",1672332896,1672332896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not only that but they force you to create a Neocore account to even log into their subpar servers so not only do you need a steam account to purchase and download the game you now have to give this company your email for an account you'll only use for this game. Annoying.

Warhammer 40K: Inquisitor is a two game set with a story that starts in Martyr and continues in Prophecy. So both are worthwhile, but when you start a new class, you might want to run that character through Martyr first, since there are specific story elements that are unique to both games. That's a bit unusual, but honestly the game is worth just rolling with it.

As part of the Massive Warhammer stable of games, these games represent their entry in the Action RPG arena. And they hold up against the best out there - Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, and whichever other you favor. ARPGs are generally isometric 3rd person viewpoint ""shooters"", although melee and environmental damage also play large roles. The setting is, well, 40,000 years in the future, and life is grim, grimy and fanatical, with all sorts of overkill and desperation on the menu. This game is something of a slaughter-fest, and can be a great relaxer at the end of a work or school day.

The various scenarios rarely run past 10 or 15 minutes, and you'll be smooshing so many enemies that your brain's reward center will be flashing like a deranged strobe light. There are many systems within the game, and each is introduced as you level up, so you don't get overwhelmed. This can feel a little ""on rails"" at first but rapidly opens up into multiple currencies which, collected, give a myriad of upgrades and gear add-ons to help you tweak your build. So the build and gear game is constant and wide-ranging, and keeps you engaged in a variety of selectable missions even when you are not in the mood for the main stories.

Classes are actually well-differentiated and definitely feel different from each other. You have two weapons sets, and up to two weapons per set, plus healing, a special gear-related power, and a special effect, both on longer timers than the usual ones. Weapons offer 4 different attacks, so you're balancing a useful number of fixed and configurable skills that give a large number of combinations. Combined with the gear customization system, you won't find yourself in a rut with a ""perfect"" setup for any given character. It's just not possible.

The stories are interesting and the voice acting is usually very good. Graphics and sound create a great atmosphere, and some parts of environments are explosively breakable. Cover can be obtained by just being near it and hitting a key to move into it.

This is, in my mind, a top-tier ARPG, and well worth a go if you are into that type of game. Highly recommended even if you are a stranger to the Warhammer world. However, it is a Grimdark setting; the game is not depressing or seriously emotionally affecting, but it is deliberately dark in atmosphere. That's just part of the lore.",1672080743,1672080743,True,24,2,0.713637173175811768,0,True,False,False

This game is a hidden gem. I started playing it after prophecy released so I guess it must have had a rocky first year when it released for it to have done so poorly, so I can't comment on it's launch state. But after 2019, it's been great.

This game will always have a special place in my heart:
- It was my introduction to the Warhammer 40K universe and I'm crazy about WH40K now
- My wife doesn't like video games and every attempt to get her to play something with me was an irritating failure. But this game changed it. The game is easy to pick up, and very rewarding with it's progression, itemization, customization, and the power fantasy of tearing apart the enemies of the Imperium

If you're a WK40K fan or an ARPG fan, Warhammer 40K Inqusitor Martyr (frikkin mouthful) is a must try.
If you're neither, I'd still highly recommend this game.
Just because you get to be an inquisitor who yells ""HERESY!"" and jet jumps into a horde of xenos scum before ripping them to pieces with an eviscirator. 

The classes and weapons are very satisfying and the campaign was pretty good in my opinion.
You get to drive a tank and an Imperial Knight... Me likey.

Most WH40K games have a single or at max 2 enemy factions from the universe. And 90% chance it's frikkin Nurgle again. 
This game has a lot. You fight a lot of plague enemies, but then there's Khorne's minions, Drukhari, Tyranids, and a whole bunch I don't yet recognize. The environments are great and it really feels 40k. I do love how they nailed the aesthetic and dialogue. 

The music is sub par and the performance isn't good until you find just the right graphical settings for your system.
But if you can get past that, this is a game that deserves a lot more than it got and I highly recommend you give it a try.

Gone forever.

Despite forcing players to be always online the game company does not have the server capacity to handle the traffic. As a result you simply cannot connect to the server, or in the off-chance you manage to login get booted from the server losing all your progress.

Funny enough, they use The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing as an example of all the trouble it was to implement and support that. Now, in late 2022 the servers have been shut down for The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, so offline is all that's left. So, less than 10 years after release. You've been warned.

It requires a controller plugged in to play. It won't even let you to the menu screen unless a controller is plugged in. That's a showstopper for me since I like to play these type of games with mouse and keyboard.

Positives- It's great Diablo Style game with a Warhammer coat of paint, with it's own enemy variants, and destructibility. The Characters have their own lines, the game has hours of content worth going through, with the levels and the models looking okay. This game got me interested in Warhammer.

Negatives(With a large caveat)- It's not really engaging or addictive. (The caveats) I still don't know warhammer, so any issues on source representation is not visible to me, because I don't know shit. I also rarely play co-op or multiplayer so IDK if they function.

Overall-
I have been playing Darktide(co-op) and this game, so far one was disappointing, while both gave me entertainment value.

the game made an initial bad impression because it requires you to make a neocore account (that was annoying but fine, other games do this) and then when i tried to login to that account on the website it showed a create profile/update your old neocore account which i had to notice a button top right of screen to exit an endless loop of next button doing nothing. if you want to access some useful things click the right arrow icon in a box top right and just confirm you dont want to create profile. otherwise you cant view anything on their website.

this is a diablo clone (sort of) set in the unique warhammer universe; specifically in the 40k future. its bleak and depressing, desperate, and gloomy, especially if you know the lore - and this game captures that and turns it into a lot of underrated fun! i had enough fun i bought the sororitas dlc same day i bought the game on sale. the initial irritation with the account creation thing soon went away. i wouldnt call the game a diablo beater but its fun enough for a lot of play.

the game has controller support, though i havent used it since i play diablo 3 on keyboard and mouse so i went that way with this game. this means the assassin dodge is something i dont use at all - though maybe it is easier to use on controller.

the game has seasons like diablo 3 does, but im playing the game like i play diablo 3 and ignoring them. i make no comment on seasons therefore since i dont play them, but they do exist. for me the build perfection is what i play for - trying to get the perfect weapon or armour or other item with good rolls or ones i can change. maxing stats on gear and so on. plus... testing your new thing on poor helpless enemies is fun. okay they arent helpless exactly. i die a lot sometimes. but im having an adventure! or doing random missions for fun.

and the game is fun. thats the key thing here. if you enjoy a dark future gothic neomedieval setting and slaying heretics, daemons and xenos and defending humanity - be an inquisitor!

Creators did a wonderful job in capturing artstyle of WH40k.
-Enemy design is amazing.
-Story so far is cool
-Voice acting is also very nice
-A lot of character classes to chose, every class has a subclass to chose from
-Overall solid ARPG, for a WH40k fan it's an awesome experiance! (On sale this game is in awesome price!)

Cons:
-Combat may not be as impactfull as it should
-Not a great fan of online style gameplay with leader boards etc. 
-Not a AAA title more like AA so some jank is to be expected.

Overall I recommend to all WH40K fans and arpg fans.

I'm a veteran ARPG player. I've played plenty of ARPGs throughout my years, and Inquisitor Martyr has one of the worst sound design ever. 

I have nothing against the gameplay of Inquisitor Martyr. It's a decent game. Game itself feels like a Diablo 2 rather than a fast Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2.



You know what made Diablo 1 - 3 good tho? The ambience. It made you feel you're on a gothic good-vs-evil setting through their music and sound.

Torchlight 2 made you feel like you're on a Steampunk setting. Still thanks to great sound design.

Grim Dawn made you feel well, whatever its setting is, but still the sound design there is still pretty good.




But here? For the love of the Emperor, whoever is the sound engineer of Inquisitor Martyr should get fired! 



Warhammer 40k should reflect its grim dark setting. Just listen to the Ultramarines Chant, the Battlefleet Gothic soundtrack, heck even the AWAKEN MY QUIVERING ABS theme is pretty dope for 40k. 

On the other hand Inquisitor Martyr's sound design is really poop - from its muddy voice acting, to crap music, to the absolute lack of ambience. 

ARRRGH! I WANNA EXTERMINATUS THE FACE OF NEOCORE'S SOUND ENGINEER AND OFFER HIS SKULL TO KHORNE! GRRR SO ANGRY!

THIS IS ALL THE SOUND ENGINEER'S FAULT! IF HE'S HALF AS COMPETENT AS OTHER SOUND ENGINEERS, HE MAY ACTUALLY DO A DECENT JOB! BUT NOOOO! INSTEAD THEY HIRED AN INCOMPETENT BUFFOON.

What can I say, I've played the hell out of it even before the official release and have been coming back for other 50-100 hours a number of times as it became better and better.

There are a lot of things I like about it and 5-fold more that I don't, but I still keep coming back time to time and stay for more.

Unfortunately, I'm generally better at stating negative sides, so I'll start with the cons.

Cons:
*Skills coming from weapons rather than the character seem to be quite an interesting feature. Well, it kills the variability and in the end you have a choise of 2 sets of 4 skills working the best for your playstyle. 
*Difficulty scaling. You deal 99% less and take 100.000% more damage. Yeah, the system's lazy af and doesn't make it any more interesting
*Repetitiveness. All missions are more or less the same, with the only difference that you have to interact with the environment in some of them instead of just killing everything in sight. 
*Skill tree. You absolutely need to invest in defensive trees if you want to do +10-16 missions. So half of your skill points are reserved just for that, it is not a choice but a necessity.
*Items power. This is a common problem in many ARPGs reduced to absurdity. Your lvl10 randomly dropped relic will be better than all epic items up to lvl 40-50 and even better than the other lvl40 relics with different effects.

Pros:
*It's a hack'n'slash in Warhammer 40k universe.
*Burn the Heretic! Kill the Mutant! Purge the Unclean!
*Weapon sounds. I wouldn't mind to be mauled by the Eviscerator just to hear it IRL.
*You deliver The Emperor's Will. If it's not enough a reason for you, you shall be purged in flames!",1670444781,1670444781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played a decent amount of them from diablo to lost ark, path of exile to grim dawn and a few others along the way. 

Most of them I've played on console but since becoming PC only I've struggled to find one I want to stick with, but then this game went on sale and I've been playing it at every opportunity. 

To preface this review I have played this game extensively on playstation so I'm not a newcomer but I'm also not super hard-core or knowledgeable to properly explain all the issue in any deep meaningful way. I most play this game for two superficial reasons. 

Firstly it's the settings, tone and style. It's gory with satisfying combat, it's set in the grim dark universe of 40k which is an excellent setting for an ARPG and also it's quite unique in setting, typically ARPG's are fantasy settings so a future one with guns and tech is very nice. 

Secondly it's just pretty well made and has all the trimmings you'd expect, lots of replay value, different classes with subclasses, loads of mission and enemies and gear variety, seasonal content, regular updates, dlc, cosmetics junk, a weekly vendor selling gear that can be earned with ingame currency. Basically they've put together a long and satisfying game with plenty to do and see, does it get repetitive? Of course but that's the nature of the beast. Is it fun? Yes. 

There are a few things that do detract from the overall experience, it seems other reviews are stating issues that make the game completely unplayable, I have not encountered those issues but if you do thankfully steam has a generous refund policy. 

However I have seen two pretty significant bugs, first was the resolution wouldn't allow me to select 1080p or above, this was fixed by changing my screen scaling to 100%, weird fix but I can now select the resolution I want. The other bug is more annoying, the game will just freeze at random points and I cannot move my character, what's weird is that the game is still running and you can access the pause menu and quit or restart the mission with ease but it doesn't stop the problem from being frustrating. 

The last bit I want to mention is that when the game launched it was apparently quite janky with awful combat, they've updated the game quite significantly since then and I never played the launch version, it is just sometimes you will see this mentioned in online discussion and it was a bit confusing for me when I first played. 

In short this is my ARPG of choice, not the best at all but certainly a good time and up there as one of the better 40k game. If you pick this up I hope you don't run into the other bugs my fellow steam reviewers have because this game is a blast.

check this discussion, I've already stated my issue there, let's see what happens:
https://steamcommunity.com/app/527430/discussions/

In the mentioned discussion shared by link the Devs explain that they are facing issues with the game breaking apart everywhere and requesting us to ask for their help on this topic to see if they can try to unstuck the player and solve the issue.

I don't exactly know what's happening, read some stuff saying the problems started they the devs downgraded the servers where the game is hosted, I just feel ripped off.

To close the review, the game is really heavy on your computer so be sure to read the requirements and stay away if you don't meet them.


[UPDATE]
The problem was solved, I'll be able to proceed, as such I'm changing this review to positive for now, for the support I've received from Devs and because the problem I was complaining about was solved.

We were almost considering going into the next season but had to Google when the season ended because there is a lack of communication with player base ..turned out is was in 2 days time!! 
We attempted the full clear void crusade for season tier reward but the servers disconnected twice in a row when we were on the last missions. Straight away we decided enough was enough time to uninstall.

Other major problems include
1.DLC is all single player
2.Turquise armour that says 'immune to all damage over time effects' is completely lying - you can stand in poison gas and still take damage
3.You actually loose xp if you quit the game at the end of a mission!
4. disappearing shards/psalms in tech bench
5.controlling the knight titan is absolutely shite
6.The main campaign mission is OK but the Drukuri storyline is so dull it felt like a chore

Sure, its missions are a bit repetitive after a while (which ARPG isn't?) but let's be honest: if you're looking at this you're not here for high level mechanics, you're here for the lore and I can assure that Inquisitor delivers. 
There's full truck load of lore and it's done really well!

As an ARPG it has some strong points: there's a lot of end-game content, much more than in other arpgs, and if you like to play ranged tactical combat (controller is a must!) you can do it in a very satisfactory way.
Loot sometimes is a little underwhelming, but it's not an ARPG where you must have a math degree to understand every aspect. The game gives you a lot of freedom and choices in builds and chars too.

If you're are looking for a good ARPG that feels very nice with a controller and has a lot of content then it's woth a try. If you love WH40K universe and its lore than this is a must buy.

Not because of bugs. No... just because this game is kind of a design mess and the gameplay loop is really... dry. 

The story in Martyr is mildly interesting, but progress made towards the campaign feel so repetitive it's difficult to really sit through a mission to get to a story bit. And when that story bit arrives... it is fairly boring. The idea behind a centuries old ghost ship being lost in the galaxy is compelling but the execution is weak enough where you just don't care. 

So when I mentioned the game is a mess... whoa boy. Almost nothing is intuitive. Screens are clogged with seemingly useless information and there are so many systems that seems to impact your character is negligible ways that you don't really feel like any choices you make are very impactful at all. Entire game systems are never even explained. Take ""Suppression"", as an example. I'm uninstalling after 12+ hours, reaching level 30 and playing the game up 2 difficulty settings (extreme) and I have no idea what this major mechanic even does. Occasionally I see ""suppressed"" over my character, but I still run around killing things without issue. There are whole skill trees dedicated to this mechanic and I have no idea what it does. 

The biggest issue here though is the gameplay loop. It's just not very interesting. You teleport to a randomized map with the same textures as the last randomized map and ... it ends up being exactly the same experience. You always face 3 types of enemies. Lots of little dudes in a cluster. 2-3 few ranged dudes. Or 1 big dude. Regardless of race or faction, the skin doesn't matter because the encounters will go down like every other. This is in **every** level.

Be warned, this is another Developer that wants to be ""innovative"". Out pure ego and pride, failed to make a game as smooth and user friendly (gameplay-wise) as more popular ARPG titles such as the Diablo series, Grim Dawn, or PoE. Rather than take something that is tried and true and works, whilst applying a 40K veneer over it, they decided to reinvent the wheel.

Also note that this title is on life-support do to poor sales and the costs involved with maintaining a license for the material. Since the whole game can only be played online, it is at risk for server shutdown. Like other failed Games Workshop franchises, this developer has a skeleton crew dedicated to the title and I highly doubt we'll see any improvement let alone a full turn over. Here's hoping that some of that is fixed with their promised ""2.0 Omnisiah Patch"".

Good things about it:
- The 40K setting has been faithfully represented and you feel like you're in the gritty, gothic, and grim dystopian future of the 41st millenium. Graphical representation of the various settings from toxic fumes spewing forgeworlds to towering hive cities are really well done and you get a good sense of these places. Finally being able to explore the inside of a gothic class cruiser (The Martyr) for example was very satisfying.
- Gameplay is highly addictive and you will soon find yourself wasting away many hours as you progress through the various missions ruthlessly slaughtering the hundreds of enemies thrown at you.
- Numerous weapons from the setting are represented and can be satisfying to use albeit with some minor issues.

The Bad
And that's where it ends. Unfortunately for as much as the developer marketed the title and as much as they boasted about the games depth and ease of use, it falls terribly short.
1 - Gameplay is terribly hampered by horrible glitches (sporadic movement when using weapons) that becomes a challenge on its own. A good example of that is you can't simply just use the Left Mouse Button to swing a sword while moving with WASD as other similar titles in the genre do. Instead your Character will randomly move in various directions as you click to attack. This causes severe strain on your hand and in the high difficulty settings can quickly get your character killed ending in mission failure.

2 - The developer is adamant about adding this strange random movement to all basic attacks. Gone is the simplicity of moving and shooting as seen in Diablo 3 or Grim Dawn and instead it's replaced by constant interruptions of your basic attack as well as movement in random directions against where either your WASD keys or the mouse is pointing. 

The main reasoning for this is to slow the player down. The developer's intent is that you're supposed to stop, shoot/melee a target, and then repeat.

This not only shows lack of knowledge of the target audience but more importantly what makes this genre fun and appealing, see point 3.

3 - Lack of knowledge and experience with the ARPG genre soon becomes evident. Equipment slowly becomes difficult to come by and because progression is linked to Equipment rating and not character level, you'll soon find yourself grinding away endlessly trying to find what ever piece of wargear can improve your rating in small increments.

With that being said, the most powerful items at any given level (for example, a Legendary Bolter versus an Epic Bolter) have very minimal advantages over the lesser version. If a legendary (called Relic items in the game) has a DPS of say 100, it's Uncommon equivalent (two steps down) would have a DPS of about 90. The difference between item quality is very minimal. It's not unusual to have a Relic weapon (Orange color) be amazing at level 44, and suddenly you get level 45 and a Blue weapon of the same (Green in other games, but for some reason Blue in this one), is all of a sudden better.

Unlike other games in the genre where an orange weapon/armor/equipment can last you many levels, you'll soon find yourself dumping these items for better ones a single level or two later.

For example: it took me 2 hours to craft a Purple (called Ancient in the game), piece of armor, only to find a better piece of the same armor that was Green (Rare in other games) one level later.

4 - Crafting is lackluster at best. It is tied to your current level, and when combined with the issues I mention above, result in an unrewarding experience. Items crafted are only marginally better than what can be found in missions, and epic items (purples) crafted will last you a level or two at best.

5 - Character Customization (Game mechanics), is abysmal and all seem to follow a one sided ranged meta forced by the developer. You can get away with melee builds early on or at easier mission ratings (+250 or lower), but anything higher (in hopes of better rewards) become impossible without a solid ranged build.

This goes against everything that we've come to love about this genre where both ranged and melee builds are equally viable.

6 - Character Customization (Visual), is practically non-existent. Like [i]all[/i] Games Workshop titles, this game does not allow you to fully visually customize your character. You have some limited paint options to recolor parts of the armor, and I do mean limited (mostly material blends), but everything else is hard coded by the developer.

Not that it matters, recoloring your armor is expensive, and prohibitively so if you try and apply the more elaborate materials. When combined with how quickly you replace armor as I stated above, you'll find you'll rarely use this feature.

In the end would I recommend this game? That's a firm No. If you're really into the 40K setting and don't mind any of the above issues I mention and are ok with subpar ARPG that takes many steps backwards but has some addictive gameplay elements, go for it on sale.",1550369632,1670171227,True,0,0,0.59841763973236084,0,True,False,False

It is not worth anywhere near the full price, and for $18AU for the Complete Edition (which doesn't include the Sisters of Battle class) I am still somewhat mixed on my feelings. It is at best a very basic dungeon crawler with a solid 40K paintjob; the settings and characters are faithful, from my rather limited understanding of the lore, and the visuals are pretty good.

The game has far too little customisation for the length of the campaign alone - only 1 of the 3 classes available to me - the Psyker - has full access to changing out active skills and allowing me to play as I like. The rest of the classes are locked into what their weapons provide them, which makes sense. However, most of the weapon skills have almost NO variation between them, and are overall extremely boring to use. 
Even then, by level 20 or so with the Psyker I have apparently unlocked almost all of the active skills I will ever really get; while there might be more in the post-campaign missions, I am NOT willing to spend 80-100 hours using the same skills to get to that point, which is apparently how long the campaign usually takes to complete.
The always online aspect just means I can't skip any of the grinding and actually have fun. Other games in the genre, like Path of Exile or Grim Dawn, have a plethora of skills and options to upgrade or alter them which keeps the game fresh, while this game DOES NOT. 

The most it has going for it is the 40K setting, which it does do justice, however that hardly props up the sub-par gameplay. Also, as of writing this Darktide has released, and the only thing keeping me from playing that instead is needing to build a new PC to run it.

We are in 2020 and changing the resolution doesn't do anything and neither does it detect 2k or 4k resolutions. I found a guide to add the manually which I did but wow, nothing happend once selected. I selected then the lowest resolution possible just to see and nothing happend once more. Oh and if you select certain resolutions, others just..vanish until you restart the game. How did that happen?

If a game can't even allow me to pick its resolution in a working fashion, what else might not be working? I will continue to try I guess, not even knowing if I play on the resolution I need to or not. Steam Overlay says not (you can see on the size of the overlay on what resolution you are)

Edit: Wow,..Just wow..So you have to adjust your desktop solution scaling for the game to properly render in 2k?! What in the world? since 2018 they said they would bring out a fix for this...

Already encountered two obvious bugs within the first two missions. After a cutscene your characters sword goes kinda crazy (as crusader with the second subclass) and in the second mission the turret clips in/out and gets invisible, especially when manned.

Oh boy, cutscenes where the characters clearly float on the ground instead of staying on it.

Where is the love for the detail of this?!

Revisit in December of 2022:

Wow, no work done. Still cant select 2K resolution, as long as my controller is plugged in it disables my mouse while EVERY SINGLE OTHER GAME simply detects your inputs or at least ASKS, frame limiter up to only 60 FPS...

Summary- The game is really good. I really compare it to Diablo 3 in regards to the content and playstyle. Nothing really big and bad, but the story and the universe is the draw here.

Story: This is a great depiction of the Warhammer 40k universe. I never had the money to dive into the table top game and always loved the games on PC. This game was just great to listen to alone, from the sound effects to the voice acting. Hearing the Plague Marines haunt my ears with their gargle voices was terrific. 

Gameplay: I started off by saying it's similar to Diablo 3. I say that because of the simplicity. It's not a 1 v 1 with how it's done because this is more RPG than reliance on gear. Yes, you rely on gear, but you have many ways to add points to your character via RPG options. The world is also very large, but I noticed alot of the maps are recycled after a while. They are re-textured and objects are different, but they do repeat. There is plenty to do because the game throws side missions at you like Takis to children with ADHD. (yes I went there... I worked at a special education assistant teacher, I've seen stuff...)

Rewards: The difficulty is really interesting. Lots of options from normal to I don't know lol, cuz I lost track after impossible. Impossible adds 5 levels and I'm like shiiiiit, these guys 2 shot me? I'm like, who do I have to impregnate with this missile launcher to get a better piece of armor? Buuut that's the fun, the higher the difficulty, the higher the challenge and the better the loot. the loots always good at higher difficulties and has been worth the trouble. 

Season event: The recent Season event is the Judgment thing, lost track of the name because i've been having fun. In short, you run around in non-story missions and it highlights guys, those guys turn bright, those guys you shoot, those guys go boom and give their buddy aids, you shoot the buddy with aids, they pass aids to their buddy, rinse and repeat. Ta daaaa, you have a badass season. Much better than Diablo 3 lol. Simple, effective, makes me wanna go back and unleash the wrath of god on some ass. Because I'm a simp that spends hundreds on onlyfans and need to connect with my man hood again.

I'll be honest, there is nothing special about Inquisitor - Martyr.

I gave this game another chance after 1 year and I haven't experienced any of the issues from my original review (ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW). 

The one thing that annoyed me (but not enough to stop playing or anything like that) was that you need to tap a skill button 2-3 times before it registers.

Otherwise I'm giving it a thumbs up for now :)


ORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW
This game was released 4 years ago. The amount of bugs I came across in almost 40h of play is inexcusable. 

Skills are not working (as in you press the skill button and nothing happens - e.g. shoulder rocket pads on the crusader don't fire any rockets, just use up the energy, grenades dont do damage to enemies, even though the floaty numbers say they do, etc.) 

Crafting is not working. It takes my money but does not craft/change, or even better, I used up all my materials and money and I rolled a really good kit and when I exited the crafting menu the game reset my inventory to what it was prior but no refund on my money/materials. 

Reward system didn't register progress.

Some perks outright dont work. E.g. There's a perk that negates crit chance for a flat dmg buff. There was no dmg buff during game.

All of above are essential components of the gameplay loop.

 If it worked the game would have been a jewel but..

It's really buggy. I'm going to give up on this game, sorry :(

Don't get it unless it is on sale.

Each area literally feels like you are playing in a square.

It's like playing within a Starcraft map. 

The item system is just nerdy and complicated so the Warhammer fanboys have something to nerd out over. ie. instead of a helm you have an eye implant etc.

The skill tree system is more of the same, complicated, and Warhammer nerdy for the sake of Warhammer nerds to geek out on. 

The dialogue is long, boring and again filled with stuff only a Warhammer nerd would know and only jokes they would ""get"" and find funny.

I love Warhammer btw,  even Vermintide... but this is a yawner... lastly 83gb!!! are you serious?! This game is 20-30gb at best. That just tells me it's built poorly... It also crashed when I first launched it.

That said, it's plagued with game breaking bugs that have no workaround currently as they are server side issues by neocore games own admission. Such as loot disappearing. When I say loot disappearing, I mean all the loot.

[b][u]ORIGINAL:[/u][/b] What a disappointment this game has been. The art direction is solid, everything else is just poorly executed and wasted potential. Gave them a year in EA and almost 4 months post release to see where things were heading. There are so many bugs and abilities not working as stated, so many promises of ""we're looking into it"". What do they do? Add an unrewarding 'end game' mission that you have to grind resources each time you want to run it once, nerf the grind even further, then fix chat (3 months of no chat in an online game) and release DLC. 

At least now I know to stay far away from Neocore Games, just hope I can at least save someone the same expensive lesson. 
If you are still interested in the game, I would recommend waiting until it's $20 or under, it certainly isn't worth a penny more, even by my loose standards.

* the game is diablo 3 derivative, except without the charm of the different areas, crisp graphics, and engaging narrative.
* it doesn't seem to understand controllers out of the box even though it lists full controller support, my dualsense 5 did nothing without manual configuration.
* gameplay is a standard point and click affair, with all the standard aiming and mis-clicking issues diablo is known for.
* graphics are muddy, indistinct, and low-res. it's been a known bug since 2018 that if you're using any kind of desktop scaling on a high res monitor, it screws up the resolution and you're unable to select the native res of your display. I've been running 4k for a good long time now, and the fully aliased 1080p it delivered looked like garbage.
* there are audio issues, and they seem especially prevalent in places that shouldn't ever have problems, like playing its low res and overcompressed ""cinematic"" cutscenes.
* you can't pay me to play as a generic space army dude these days, but of course the game class-locks gender, and the only girl you can play without spending literally twice as much on the game for the Girls DLC is incredibly sexist and gross even by 40k standards.

chances are pretty big, that if you are looking into reviews for a 40K-game, that you like warhammer 40.000, so that as a given you will most likely enjoy this. the grimdark people want from the universe is there, the violence and unforgiving world are on point.

the color-palette is of course rather desaturated, but not just grey/brown. the demonic stuff sticks out quite a lot. it is not too varied, which lies in the way the universe is always described. but since you can be planetfall or inside of spacecrafts etc it is not always just the same. some of the environments are desctructable to a certain degree and if you look for it, there are quite a few chances to benefit from that.
sound is good, but not amazing. very fitting overall even tho a few lines of voice over are still missing. 
the missions are fun but, and that is my main gripe with the game: rather repetetive. the whole game seems to be.
i would normally say that is a bad thing, but if the gameplay is fun: more of the same good thing can't be bad. but be warned, things obviously won't change much.

the biggest problem i have with inquisitor martyr is that they keep advertising it as ""open world sandbox"". huh what? i may have a different understanding of what ""open world"" and ""sandbox"" mean, but this is not it. they are clearly used as buzz words.

this is how the main gameplay loop goes:
· start in your ship where you can do crafting, shopping, inventory management and leveling etc.
· then go to the starmap, look through the available sectors and missions, maybe pick some perks (when doing investigations) and then jump into said mission.
· play the mission untill you reach the objectives (sometimes you may keep playing to make sure you pick up everything or kill every traitor etc if that should not be part of the victory conditions.) the maps are fairly big and it will take you a while. be warned most of the time you are not allowed to die more than a few times before the mission fails.
while playing the pace is most of the time rather slow and there is not too much emphasize on the A in ARPG honestly.
· recieve rewards and go back to your ship
· start over

this is NEITHER OPEN WORLD NOR SANDBOX if you ask me. it is fun and there is a lot to do, but not what you are lead to believe.
maybe i'm just being overly critical. or they will add more. we'll see.


tl;dr:

cons:
- neither open world nor sandbox
- rather slow paced for an ARPG
- quite repetetive gameplay
(- still some placeholders, 'cause early access)

pros:
+ beautiful grimdark as it should be
+ a lot to do, even if it is the same thing over and over, because...
+ ...it will never grow old to blast heretics into bits, chop off limbs or explode dreadnoughts
+ nice progression (account progression, not just the individual chars)
+ the game is oozing with atmosphere
(+ stable for an early access game)


in short the game is halfway between Diablo and Chaos gate. in every aspect: pacing, variety, loot amount, leveling system. i'd say people who enjoyed both of those and are fiending for a good 40K-game: this is it!
if that is worth the price they ask for it, is up to you.

will have to review again in the future since it is early access",1504627484,1669766887,False,0,0,0.686028242111206055,0,True,False,False

I like that this game's pretty straightforward, and I like that there's not the feeling of some hidden hand in the game looking to take extra money from you - like Grim Dawn, stuff like that.  This is a straight-up ARPG.  You know, like Diablo, if Diablo 3 was actually decent. With no greedy micro transactions for new clothes or whatever.

Right now my main here is a crusader who specialises in flamethrowers. 

And I like to kill the enemy.  A lot.  This game provides me with endless satisfaction of action RPG enemy slaying in lots of different ways.  My reward is improving my character, getting better loot, killing, and repeating these three things.

If you like that sort of thing, and WH40K lore and pageantry doesn't turn you off, then you'll love this.  Period.

Old Review: I was an active player and huge fan of this game but the updates are way too slow and the game is still very lag even if one has a high end PC. Seasons and end-game activities are boring and too repetitive. Unique items are just rehash and character customization is very poor. Co-op for this game is almost non-existent and developers are just full of empty promises. The game's storage requirement is very weird too, it requires a whopping 75 GB.

I shall tell you some imperial Truth about Inquisitor Martyr (and it's Expansion Prophecy)

First of all citizen, you are looking at a big and long Game, with tons of content, worthy of the Emperor's vast grace.
The SP Campaign alone is so big, that you easily will be between Level 60 and 70, if you want to serve the Imperium by doing all Sidequests.

The Graphics are nothing World shaking. It fits the WH40k Lore, its dark and gritty. A little bit low res on some places but we are not on a Paradise World / Garden World citizen. This is War. You are constantly moving and purging. No time to pay attention to Details.

The Sound is fantastic citizen. The Sound of firing a Bolter or heavy Bolter against the Enemies of Mankind is deafening and truly a perfect representation of the Emperor's Wrath. The Death screams of the Xenos and Heretics dying left and right is purging done right. The Ambient Sounds also helps with the Immersion. The heavy steps of your Inquisitor gives really some weight to his movements. Music also fits but you are more exciting hearing the Bass Sound of a Bolter Round, transforming Xenos into Pinata.

There are a lot of Weapons for each Class. My first Playthrough was with a Ranged Inquisitor and his trusty Bolter Towers, which are great to get enemy Aggro. The variety of weapons is remarkable.
Las Pistols, Lasguns, Melter, Multimelter, Plasma Pistol, Plasma Rifles, Plasma Cannons, Grav Guns, Grav Cannons, Bolt Pistols, Bolters, Heavy Bolters, Grenade Launchers, Flamer, Heavy Flamer, various Types of Grenades, etc... + Melee Weapons like Thunderhammers, Chainswords, Power Axes and more because sometimes, you want to get close and Personal to purge the Heresy from the Face of the Galaxy.
Also you have defensive Items like Void Shields and such. And that was just for one Class. 
The other Classes get other Weapons and Drops.

You can Purge Heretics and Xenos the Way you like citizen. If you want to be a litte heretical yourself, you can go with a Psyker Inquisitor. You will be able to cast lightning and more magic stuff. Usually you would be sentenced to Death by a 5 day Phosphex Bath for being an unsanctioned Psyker, but as long as you are doing your service for the Imperium, it will be postponed until it's over.
The other Class is the Assassin Inquisitor, but to me it looks like they are coming from the Vindicare Temple. This is when you want to one hit kill Xenos.
And we have the Mechanicus. It's a Summoner Class. You use Bots, Drones and Combat Mechs. A small Army doing the dirty work, while you stay behind collecting the drop. Your Bots do a better Job than those useless Guardsmen.

The Gameplay is pretty much like Diablo and any other Hack n Slash...or so it seems for the untrained eye citizen. This game requires Tactic and knowing your Surroundings. You will use cover and run from cover to cover, while going Bolters blazing and using your active skills. Almost all Cover can be destroyed, with sustained fire (depending on the Material and your Weapon). The Xenos and Heretics understand that as well and will use it against you. So be cautious or you will witness a second Istvaan 3 drop site Massacre, if you just stand in the open.

The content is as I said: Big. And don't think it's over after the SP Campaign. Oh no citizen. The work and Service for the Imperium extends far beyond than just that. Void Missions, Sector Bar filling Missions, Astropath Missions, DLCs, Warzone, Ordo Missions, cleansing operations, targeting beacon Missions, Tarrot Quests, Arena with infinite Waves (Survival Mode) and PvP. Also more and more Sectors of the Galaxy will be gradually accessible over time (depending on the Devs).

Not all is fine and dandy tho. 
Levels are repetitive and have not a lot of Variety. 
Missions are more or less the same.
Much of the additional content is basically a Gear check or Grind heavy.
The Story falls flat.

But you are not here for the option to sweet talk to the Enemies of Mankind, you are not here to get your best ancient Relic Items presented to you on a silver plate, you are not here for the plotting, you are here for the PURGING.

The classes feel fun to play, the powerscaling can get a bit weird in the campaign, since you're a literal god of death at points, but the end game offers enough ways to amp the difficulty. The campaign is fun to play through imo, however I do understand the requests to be able to run the end game content from the beginning. The AdMech campaign is one of the neatest ideas I've seen from an ARPG DLC in a while, really appreciated it. The cross compatibility is outstanding, as well. I've gone from Windows to Linux as a daily driver in the past year and, admittedly thanks to Proton as well, there is next to 0 performance issues for me. I even think it may run a little better, but that could just be my nerd bias. 

Like everyone says, there are a few drawbacks. There is a bit of an excessive amount of DLC, admittedly. The extra character is cool, and I do understand ongoing costs of maintenance and hosting; but even as a fan and someone who *owns* it all, it's a lot. The tutorial for the core classes being nonskippable is a bit of a nuisance, the always online requirement is a pain. While I do enjoy the end game content, some of it feels needlessly luck based when it comes to achievements. 

The camera is sssuuuuupppppeeeeeerrrrrr fucking annoying. Like, that's the only thing I think I've encountered in the game that I just straight up do not like. If I was on console playing with a controller, that'd make sense. I'm on a goddamn PC dude, just make it a static view. If you're going to have me to control it, allow me to turn that feature off. If you're worried about people missing loot or chests or what the hell ever, highlight the obscured item. It could not have been easier to program an accurately swiveling camera on a 360 degree loop based on user input that it would have been to determine obscured items and highlight them. This is separate from the other dislikes because holy shit, this feature is probably the worst in the game imo. 

Its a good game, devs are pretty communicative too, which is rare it seems. I feel like I usually have something to read from them concerning the game. Base game and the ExPac are really all you need, imo. Buy the other stuff overtime if you want, but not having in no way detracts from the game. The AdMech Tech-Adept from the ExPac is one of the cooler ideas for a DLC character that I've seen, and I eagerly await the Sororitus character. Yes, the game needs work. Yes, multiplayer servers can be a bit dodgy. Neocore is putting in the work and has been putting in the work. I know the issues exist, but I seldom, if ever have any issues personally.

Had no idea of how much customization there was via sockets, the radical and puritan passive tree, the tarot system and leveling within, then there's drops that you can collect to open up void maps ... haven't even tried one yet.  Now I have another couple dozen hours now and the game has really grown on me .  The developers are setting us up for a 2nd season with it's own rewards which you can display in your ship. So there seems to be something of fresh content for the game. Also, the game seems to have alot of collectibles from dev thank yous, login gifts, or from events.  The familiars, foot print effects, helmets, some you can buy with Fate ( a reward alot like currency )but other collectibles that I don't have access too are listed as Legacy or for Event X.  I think it's great how the developers, of any game, release new seasons or even content as they want you enjoy playing their game.

It's now Nov 2021 and I may not have hundreds of hours played in WH 40K IM but this game has really grown on me.   There's been graphical quality updates, quality of life changes, the devs seem to have events big and small frequently.  Finished season 3 now and can't wait for season 4 and what the achievement rewards might be.

It took me a while to figure out what the game has to offer
In short Id compare gameplay with Diablo or Hades mixed with MOBA type skill mechanics.
My 300 hours of playtime are almost exclusively on my crusader
Just recently hit lvl 100 and still having a blast

Custom Playstyle
Each main class has 3 subclasses with a set of weapons and armor available exclusivly to the main class.
Any class can apply a mix of all 3 subclasses gear and abilities
Id estimate around 360 skills in the tree to chose from (18 trees with an average of 20 per) 
combined with something like 100 gear passives you can design a ton of play styles
I would compare how gear works to moba type games like DOTA or LOL where you stack a skills hit chance based on percentage
Balancing the combination of skills to focus damage is the core of the game
For example;  AOE and DOT plus inc heat dmg, applied to the melta gun will turn your foes to slag with only a few shots was an early strategy
I've wound up with a heavy bolter and power hammer/supression shield 

Custom Difficulty 
One of my favorite aspects of WH40K Inquisitor is difficulty control
Each mission can be tuned to be easy or challenging as youd like
The main campaign will unlock Uther's Tarot
UT is a deck of cards that adds both greater challenges and rewards to most any mission.
If youre looking for a specific type of item or gear, chose the corresponding card and odds are you will find what youre looking for, making the grind feel much more rewarding and manageable compared to the basic RNG loot mechanic

Lore
The plot of the campaign is basic. That being said, it really doesn't need to be much more. The lore of the WH40K universe is one of, if not the most over the top hilariously brutal settings i can think of and the plot of this game 'within the over arching universe is like a small window into the madness that is 40k
Inquisitor has me looking up every video i can find on youtube now
Looking into the tabletop games and every other variation

End Game and Replayability
I had a blast leveling up my first char solo and now im getting into coop and pvp while perfecting my build.
Its also true that no single class can doit all. Im excited to play all the other classes, making for great replayability.

Cons
Its expensive-wait for a sale 
For me even at full price id get my moneys worth by now
The need to complete the campaign to unlock functions of the game without any indication is disorienting as a new player 
You earn gear thats around your lvl meaning its not worth investing too much into gear before then
Still I did at times without going bankrupt or getting bottlenecked
There's about 6 armor skins per class with 3 style variants so not a huge selection of armor styles to pick from
Colors can be customized to some degree for both armor and weapons. The amount of weapons to choose from makes up for this imo
There are a lot of mechanics that are hard to find and a lot of menus
It can also be frustrating dealing with the ""online aspect of this game if you have no desire to play online.
There are occasional server issues, however, I've joined the discord channel and the last time servers were down a dev was responding and on it in less than 10 minutes with the issue fixed in about an hour.
I was really impressed by this tbh

Its way too fun mowing down the hordes of Chaos with a Hammer and Bolter

I can't say that this game really excels in anything, it does an okay job in covering the ARPG elements. Missions take between 10-15 minutes or longer depending on what difficulty you set it at. The tarot card system is an interesting mechanism to trial with, the harder you make it the greater the reward. I felt that the story really did nothing for me, it did pick it up towards the second half of the story but then the ending was dreadful.

There is also sadly a lot to dislike about the game. It feels repetitive, poorly optimised, same enemies, and it won't win any awards for the graphics. It's.. dull. But I suppose it does set the gritty scene of an Inquisitor. Selling items seems absolutely pointless, unless I've missed something? I've earnt about 5 million so far and I have nothing to spend it on - the store that refreshes only has the weakest of items throughout the game, I feel like they really missed something here. So I would recommend salvaging everything instead. I also ran across a DLC issue everytime I played - because I purchased the ultimate edition (on sale) it seems as though most of the DLC missions are behind a story-wall, so most times I was just going to select my actual mission, I'd then have to cross-off three or four pop-ups that would say I couldn't do this DLC or that DLC until I reached a point in the story. You would think that once would be enough to inform you, but it kept doing it throughout the game which I found bizarre. 

For all the negatives which I'm sure I could list more of if I think harder about it, the cool aspect to this is playing as an actual Inquisitor. You feel strong. In the first 20 levels or so I found myself just working my way through the levels not really knowing if I wanted to carry on. But around level 25-30 my character felt really tough, or I had just got more used to the game, and then I'd steamroll through most enemy groups with relative ease - which increased the fun of tweaking the difficulty by making it harder. 

There are a lot of extra mission types you can do in the game which I don't think it does a good enough job in explaining, I mainly stuck to the story with some seasonal missions sprinkled in-between. 

Overall, it's alright, I enjoy it more then I dislike it. Definitely grab it on sale else you'll be disappointed. Too many elements to the game feel unfinished / unpolished.",1668625263,1668625263,True,37,1,0.723114609718322754,0,True,False,False

It is a straightforward and satisfying experience on the surface and there is plenty of depth to keep you interested in the long term. I would say that mechanically, the game has a lot more going on that most other games of this type, but some of those systems are immediately obvious.

The core gameplay is simple, and probably simpler than a lot of other action RPGs. This is one of the only negatives to me, depending on your class or build, you only have a handful of buttons to press and you will only press 1 or 2 of them 80 percent of the time. Other class get more mileage out of the system. The psyker tends to use a much broader array of abilities consistently, while the crusader and tech priest use far fewer. The up side of this is the sheer variety of options, even within one class. You have access to many different builds and weapons and they all function quite differently. This makes alts even within the same class attractive because you can completely flip how even the same class plays. For example, a melee crusader versus a range crusader will be a completely different experience.

The stories are interesting and fun to play once. I don't like that some of the mechanics are locked behind completing the entire campaign, both base and Prophecy because the missions are not that fun to do over and over again with new characters. It is a very warhammer lore heavy story that should appeal to people with knowledge of the world and may baffle people without that knowledge. You can basically skip the story missions entirely and do your own thing, but you will lose out on some of the late game mechanics if you do, and unfortunately this lock is character specific, requiring you do it on every alt. Most other things, like inventory and storage are account wide with the only exception being that seasonal characters are separate from non-seasonal ones for the duration of a season.

Difficulty is something that is broad and highly adjustable. At max level you can really pump the difficulty upwards using the ingenious tarot system. The only thing to note here is that this is a highly build-focused game. The type and quality of your gear and perks matters far more than your player skill. While you can't be completely mindless, whether or not you have an easy time with hard content will depend far more on what you are wearing than on what buttons you press.

The game is on the border between live service and not. There is seasonal content with seasonal characters. The seasons are very long, free, and include a smattering of other events that pop up. A season takes takes a lot of work to complete. There is a ton of DLC, most of it is minor and can be earned in game or purchased. Despite the game's age, it is clear the developers are continuing to add to it. The upcoming Sororitas DLC class is a good example, and I'm very excited for it.",1668621655,1668621655,True,2,0,0.517908334732055664,0,True,False,False

I really did not have high hopes for this game, since there are so many ARPGs out there, and, of course, W40k games still have this feeling of not hitting right, even so we had Space Marine, Dawn of War and Apocalypse. 
And this one is not quite up there, but it tries.

The main issue I have is the ""meat grinder"" objective of everything. Of course, it is war, peopple die... in the hundreds or thousands. But a single hand, not even astartes, is wiping out thousands of special forces, mutants, demons, astartes and even greater demons. It just does not feel right. 
Right in the beginning of the game you find a slain ""Angel of Death"" and the voice lines say something like ""What even could kill one of the best warriors?"". Yet you proceed to massaker them in the dozens. Often more than one at a time. I know this is fantasy-land, but this feels unrealistic.

The conversations are completely voiced and the voice actors did a decent job. Sometimes there are some Names mispronounced, but I see, that they were trying to seed in different accents. All in all well done.

The thing that kept me at this game was a quite intriqueing story about the ""Martyr"" a forgotting ship in the nowhere of space. You leave this ship in order to find it again, you will visit planets and do some smaller side missions, but everything leads back to this ship.

I did not bother to much with the generic missions, even so there are sometimes some paradoxes. As in an NPC congratulates you on a job well done. And you haven't met him yet. Then, a couple of missions later, you free him from captivity. Nothing to big of a deal, but it is recognizable.

I also did not bother much with the equipment system. I found a weapon that fit me and never used anything else, aside from other weapons of the same type. That was a little different with the rest of the equipment, where I just looked at the bottom where it says ""This one is <number> better than what you have"". Made it pretty easy.

At last the difficulty is something to look out for. 
There is ""Normal"" which is so underscaled I did not even bother contemplating any tactics or tricks in order to kill that giant monster. And there is even a much easier one called ""Story"". I can't really see whats that for. Otherwise we can crank it up to ""Eye of terror"" with ""Extereme"" being somewhere in the middle.
I did not try those modes, since I was interested in the story, but if you love to grind that one should be more for you.

On the good side it has an amazing soundtrack, well designed characters with this specific ""sass"" you would not expect from a Rogue Trader Captain or even an adeptus mechanicus. I love those interactions! The space marine on your ship was actually quite boring in comparison, and the locations, especially on the star map, are beautiful. You really get the Warhammer 40k feeling from those, even so the textures are a little washed down. 

All in all, recommendable for fans of the 40k universe who like ARPG, Story, with all sidequsts finished in 23 hours on ""Normal"" as an assassin.

[edit from 31 October 2022]

I thought it was time to see how this game has developed by now.
However after the startup and intro cut scene the login to the game server failed.
Adding ""verbose_logging=1"" as start parameter in steam creates a log file at ""documents\NeocoreGames\WARHAMMER.txt"" showing the error:

[...] CoreBackend Creating new connection. Timeout: 5.092868
[...] Got error on Websocket: X509 - Certificate verification failed, e.g. CRL, CA or signature check failed
[...] CoreBackend became Unavailable
...

After checking the web and steam discussions it shows that this is a known bug.
The developer suggests to create a separate windows user profile and start the game this way. However I find this unacceptable.

After all the technical issues this game has after all these years, I cannot further support the way the developers go about it and change my review to negative.
The developers either have no control over their own product and thus cannot ensure a proper product quality to the end user or they simply don't care.

Either way I strongly suggest to stay away from this to save you time and money!",1602263296,1667249311,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now I really don't want to go back to Martyr... and that's not even because Chaosbane was good or anything (it wasn't)... but Martyr manages to be even more boring.

The story has interesting aspects and I want to continue the game for it, but its presentation is beyond basic. And I mean 1997 Diablo 1 basic. The first few missions manage to suck you in with their level design (Warhammer, Spacehulk, Nurgle! YAY!), but then it starts to dawn on you... Is the whole game just going to be ""Go into (small, copy pasted) level X, find thing X/kill X, teleport back""? And is it always just the same copy pasted (bland) maps? Yup, it's going to be like that (at least for the first 18h and I doubt that changes). Other ARPG/Dungeon Crawlers are the same in that aspect, but manage a better presentation, and even more importantly: They manage to suck you into the loot spiral. Martyr just didn't do that for me. I played a Psyker and based on the weapon, your skills change... So sometimes you find a really nice weapon, but the skill is garbage. Welp, into the trash it goes. All the other gear is like: ""Hm... that stat has 0,5% more, but I loose 0,3% of..."". Even with stat rerolling it's... you guessed it, boring.   

Can't even say something about the Soundtrack, since it was so forgettable. Game difficulty was extremely dodgy as well. It's waaaaaaaaaaaay too easy. But you can activate 3 extra difficulty ""cards"" / choosing Very Hard+ and then it's most of the time still too easy and sometimes it's just insta death time. 
I don't think I will continue the game, it's sadly just too boring and basic in its gameplay. Well... I will just continue to read WH40K: Eisenhorn book(s). Reading the story of Inquisitor Eisenhorn is simply more enjoyable than playing this game.

However, once I started playing this game I was quite surprised at how much i love the game. I really enjoy the Crafting and Loot system in this game, but what I love more is the Eradicator Inquisitor I made and the Voice-Actress that portrays my character sounds so bad-ass. Like she made the whole experience playing this game even more enjoyable. Just Amazing.  

The Story is really interesting, I am not someone who knows a great deal about the WH40K Universe but this game does a great job at presenting the World and Characters. I have to say it's pretty messed up LOL. but very interesting nonetheless. 

One thing though, this game requires you to be Online to play, and I don't really like that in my single player games, but having said that, I can see why it's needed as the in-game Merchants refreshes their items & arsenal so we get new stuffs everyday. The game also updates with new Missions and Seasonal Events. at the time of this review they just added a new Mission to hunt several Villains in the game, and get rewarded. pretty nice.

I won't say this is like another generic Sci-Fi Space ARPG, I mean it's WH40K. The game plays really well with solid crafting & looting system, plenty of side missions to farm and level up, an End Game Crusade missions which is difficult but rewarding. So far so good 145 Hours in.

However, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the game simply due the forced online-only DRM.

It's not there because the game is an MMO, because it's not. It's a single-player action RPG with co-op options.
It's not there because the developers find offline/online characters too ""hard"". Every other aRPG has managed it.
It's there 100% as DRM. It's an anti-piracy solution and that is it, no other reason exists.

The developers once put their foot down and whined that they were effectively bullied into adding offline functionality to their previous game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, and that it was a bad decision. Today, 15th of October in the year of our Lord 2022, the developers announced they're shutting down the online functionality for Van Helsing. Not migrating to AWS, just shutting down -- so long and thanks for all the fish. We can still PLAY Van Helsing because we, paying customers, ""bullied"" the developers into making sure it had a fully functional offline mode. Warhammer Inquisitor has no such offline mode. Every time there's a server issue, your game goes away. Developers are so so sorry, and they'll fix the issue! YAY game is back up after some downtime. So so sorry!

They recently migrated from the bankrupt GameSpark online backend (the same one that necessitated removing online functionality in Van Helsing) to using Amazon Web Service, but that required downtime. YAY. Game came back but it was missing progress players had made, so so sorry, here's an EXP boost. YAY. 

This is a single-player story-heavy action RPG, the game's store page points that out clearly in the very first paragraph. It's not an MMO by any stretch of imagination, it's Titan Quest in space. And it can go away at any time; server issues? Down. Patches? Down. Developers realise it's no longer economically viable? Down... forever!

If only they'd added the offline-only character option 99.99999% of every other similar title has, I'd be singing its praises from the rooftops. Graphics, audio, gameplay loop, it's all brilliant --- but the DRM and the bullheaded stance of no offline mode kills it dead in the water. Just like life will once the servers go down fro good.

After sinking several hundred hours into the current season of Diablo 3, and hit a point where I couldn't go much further without spending many hundreds more hours grinding the same content over and over to get more paragon levels. The reason I mention this is if you, like me, hit a seasonal brickwall in Diablo and are looking for a similar-but-different alternative, you are who I am speaking to. And if you like the visceral ARPG gameplay of D3, this game definitely scratches that itch moreso than others I've tried.

I would say its slightly more complicated than D3, however that might be because I've played D3 for years and only had this for about a week, so I don't know where everything is in this game and haven't optimised the path to the endgame. There is definitely a bit more depth to the levelling process, which in D3 can be completed in a matter of hours, or minutes if you get powerlevelled-- that doesn't exist in this game. 

Lore-wise, I mean, its WH40k - is there a sci-fi/fantasy universe that has more written/talked about than WH40k? I think this game would appeal to anyone from those with a passing interest in WH40k, all the way up to model-painting hobbyists (who also like ARPG's). The narrative in this game is deep, intriguing and compelling, and well presented within the game.

What this game is not:
An open-world sandbox. There is one 'peaceful' area and thats on the bridge of your ship, everywhere else is some kind of mission type zone that you warp into. Its pretty awesome actually, but if you're looking for a kindof exploration type affair, this isn't that. You teleport straight from your spaceship into the action, kill baddies, collect loot and teleport back (sometimes not in that order). I don't know why they advertised it as an open-world sandbox, I just don't think that describes it very well. 

Also it doesn't have as big a community behind it as D3 or PoE, so there isn't one handy resource like Maxroll with people playing and theorycrafting and writing guides as a fulltime job. There's a few YouTubers who make some good content for the game, but nothing like the level of community in D3. This can be a good or bad thing, on one hand if you're looking for a straight tier list of which builds are best and how to farm the gear for them, as far as I know that doesn't yet exist, on the other hand it kind of means there are no wrong answers build-wise.

P.S: Also for D3 players; there is a 'salvage all' button for EVERY QUALITY OF LOOT from common up to legendary, as well as a similar 'sell all' at the vendor if you swing that way.",1665645416,1665645416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's nice to have a slower ARPG as I dislike when the game turns in a light show on speed with only huge numbers popping everywhere on screen.
The detail of models and interaction with weapons are awesome, bolters popping enemies like ripe tomatoes never gets old.
The initial impression is great, but as time goes by, you slowly see the game's problems.
The loot system is underwhelming with nothing exciting happening. Playing the main campaign this is more obvious as it scales missions with your level. At one point I just stopped swapping gear and just continued plowing through it. Same happened with the skills (passive) as all points spent give you small percentages or something really specific, so there is no game changer that you slowly build up to.
There are a lot of attribute points, skills and perks, but in the end it just feels boring meandering through them.
The story is an incoherent mess and by the end I would tune out through the exposition. You might say why would you even mention a story in an ARPG, well because the game has a ""story mode"" so you can experience this mess.
It's like the game has a lot of ideas, but everything feels unpolished or half-baked in the end.
Another positive is the infinite mission generation, but it also falls flat with the above mentioned problems as it becomes tedious and you really don't have a reason to replay the game to that point.
For the end, the biggest offence is having a mandatory always online to play singleplayer. Not counting the actual gameplay issues this alone is enough alone for a thumbs down.",1665153281,1665153281,False,14,1,0.593692004680633545,0,True,False,False

Warhammer is an incredible world with so much lore, its hard to keep up now. The gameplay is hectic and chaotic in all the best ways. Both the character and level design add so much to the eeriness of the game and it does feel like one man against an army of filthy beasts. All four classes have their strong suits but I'd definitely go 'Sader or Tech-Adept every time (highly-recommended.)

Most of the DLCs are hit or miss but the main game has plenty going for it to keep you busy.

A great ARPG for people looking for an entry point and being drenched in the story of Warhammer does it a lot of favors. I hope this sees a sequel with even more intense graphics and content.

The Gameplay? Mediocre at best. Just a grind for gear with minor variations in appearances. The weapon types and strategies available are barely sufficient for each class to feel complete, and action quickly gets chaotic with some characters getting lost in the sea of bodies on screen.

The Story? Practically nonexistent. The dialogue is delivered so dryly and none of the plot points are engaging. It quickly becomes a pattern of wait for the talking to end, dump your loot and immediately go out again. Optional objectives appear seemingly at random and are often not level appropriate.

The Look? Unsurprisingly, this is where the game excels. The visual style of the 40k universe is well represented both in the characters and the environment. Sadly, this leg alone is not enough to prop the game up, as the grind makes biomes repeat quite often, which ruins the appeal.

Some of the controller binds don't make much sense. The double trigger keybind feels horrible, and makes mobility cooldowns not worth using on that keybind.

It's really satisfying planning out a build and specializing in one particular mechanic.

But the main issue with this game is that missions are randomly generated, and all follow the same kind of pattern.

After playing for long enough, you can start to realize that everything starts to feel the same. You can experience all that the game has to offer in a relatively short time.

And I'm also not a very big fan of these types of looter games where one of the core mechanics is constantly getting new gear which is only marginally better, or often times worse, than your current gear.

A large portion of this game is spent in the inventory screen, staring at stats and trying to decide if you should sell this item or keep it for a build later.

And the stats on all of the weapons are randomly generated too. You can often find weapons which make no sense, like having bonuses to poison but not dealing any poison damage.

active skills are bound to your equipment, so the 4 attack ablilitys are bound to the weapon. the passive skill system on the other hand is very open for experimentation, which is nice i guess.

Nothing feels satisfying, guns sound weak, hit registration is weak, story and acting is weak.

This game is so lame that I was able to reduce it to ""only look at the mini map, hold A when arrow points towards red dots"" and it worked out, even against bosses. Zero challenge whatsoever. I reached lvl 7 and only ever applied the 1st skill point I got, so I don't know if all the complicated skill trees, perks and crafting and whatever else may ever get useful at some points, but so far it just seemed needlessly deep and useless since I just had to hold A in front of literally anything and it eventually died anyway without ever posing a threat anyway, the game even auto-aims a little and makes your character walk towards the enemies the right distance to shotgun them while holding A! I was playing the girl class that seemed to be all about dodging, so that says a lot too.

I couldn't tell you much about the graphics but it's really over the top dark, maybe you're into that though. I couldn't really care less since I honestly didn't even look at it after the 1st level, I was essentially just playing pacman on the mini-map.

Imagine if that baby's genetics had StarCraft sequences because Games Workshop actually had a brain in the early 90s and didn't pull out on Blizzard (for those who don't know, this is why StarCraft and WarCraft look like Warhammer.)

See, Diablo 3 (and likely 4) is for casuals. I had fun with it but build diversity was non-existent during seasons. Path of Exile, on the other hand, was for hardcore players....which I am no longer because I became an adult with responsibilities sadly. Martyr is something in the middle; you need to use your brain to put together a build. However, you don't need to spend hours and hours theorycrafting only to realize you fucked up 10 hours ago or something on passive skill selection and now it'll take 20 hours to fix it (this is Path of Exile.)

After the migration to the new servers the game is unbearable, and I do not recommend playing it, as long as the game requires constant online connection.

Every action (buying, selling, crafting, opening boxes, etc) takes 2-3 seconds to respond, constant connection problems, UI bugs out, weird details pop on the screen mid-mission.

Finishing the season was a pain in my tushy, and most of the people in my cabal (game's version of guilds) stopped logging because of the issues and constant problems, and moved to greener pastures.

It has been 4 weeks since the migration, and the only ones migrating now are the players, away from the game.

A real shame.

old review
~~~~~~
It's a fun ARPG, with lots of content, lots of loot, a good variety of mobs and weapons, and many options for builds for every character.
The end-game is kinda lackluster, and never had a chance to play with other people.
For a solo player, this game is super fun. I do recommend joining a clan, for some nice bonuses.
The discord is active and lots of people discuss and help there. 
Overall- a solid 8 out of 10!

I am not a huge action RPG fan. I've played Diablo 1 more times than I can count, and I enjoyed Diablo 2 for the most part. The Champions series is the only other ARPG franchise I can think of that I've played.

I am a HUGE 40k nerd. I've played just about every game released, barring mobile releases, and I'm a huge fan of the tabletop game and some of the books and shows out there (Helsreach on YouTube is fantastic). The premise behind Inquisitor really grabbed my interest: you play as a secret agent of the human empire (the Imperium of Man) zooming around the galaxy and stomping out rebellions, alien incursions, pirate abductions, and other grave threats to the Imperium.

The main storyline centers on you tracking down a ship called the Martyr, which had been lost in space and time for centuries. Something nefarious has taken over the ship, and it's up to you to find out why. It's pretty interesting stuff, and the writing is decent enough to keep the momentum going. Along the way, you're frequently petitioned by other powerful figureheads to go and deal with heretics and the like. 

You find better equipment and weapons as you kill enemies, destroy the environment, and complete storylines. The variety is great, as a Crusader (shooty boy) you can beat people with an axe, dual wield pistols, or use a two handed heavy flamethrower to cleanse the skin from the bone and the sin from the soul. Different armor types also give different abilities, like being able to deploy an automated sentry gun to launching a volley of Cyclone missiles and obliterate groups of degenerates. 

There are many skill trees to invest points into as you level up, and I think it's neat that as you play to a certain playstyle (using area effect attacks, or single target attacks for instance) you unlock new trees which further improve those types of plays. It keeps the UI uncluttered for the most part, and, in my opinion, keeps character progression from being overwhelming by not giving you too many choices to dump points into, that might not benefit your style of play.

I like the visuals. There is great environmental attention to detail with the various places you go. I like seeing bunk rooms in outposts, chow halls, libraries, bizarre contraptions and uncomfortable looking chairs in pirate controlled structures, and Nurgle plague growths in areas where his followers have staked a claim. The gore is great, and disintegrations and dismemberments are meaty and satisfying. Bonus points for how goopy the Cylcone missile launcher makes the battlefield.

I haven't tried PVP or multiplayer because those things don't interest me right now, maybe after I complete the game I'll give them a shot.

All in all, it's a fun experience for someone who (like me) enjoys ARPGs, but doesn't have a ton of other experiences to compare this game to. I have no idea whether or not a huge fan would find the game lacking or exceptional. I think for 40k fans, this is a definite buy. One thing I did not mention is that the difficulty is highly adjustable, from baby's first video game all the way up to Commorragh levels of suffering.

First: You need to be always online, even for single player. The old backend was not very stable, so you often got kicked out of the game, even mid mission. Anyone with a less than supreme connection would probably find it unplayable. The game recently transferred to a new backend, which might make this better, I have no idea.

Second comes the reason I do not know if the new backend helps: I cannot play. Mid July some bug killed all access to story missions and seasonal missions, as well as priority assignments.

I first contacted support about this problem and a problem with my account on July 18th.
I got a reply partially adressing the account problem and a plea for patience on the bug on July 20th

Since then I've heard nothing. I tried adding info to help diagnose this problem, the added info has not bean read to this day.

I suspected there might have been a technical problem with the dialogue, and opened a second one on July 27th, a week after all contact stopped. That second inquiry, inluding all details and additional info, has not yet been read until today. So by now there's been 22 days of total silence on the issue, with no communication, no acknowledgement, nothing. I cannot progress in the season, I cannot start any new characters, because the bug has them all stuck after the first one or two missions. No idea if they will ever work on this again and the game will become playable, or if this ist just the end for any chance to play this for me.


The other problem with the account is also still persistent, because their account system simply will not send mail to gmx.de, it seems. First, I couldn't log in because the account was not activated  - never received an activation link. The only answer I ever received from support included an activation link, which worked - but my password does not. I cannot reset the account password, because I never receive the mail - and yes, I've checked spam folders etc., the mail never arrives. So i cannot use my Neocore account, cannot submit tickets or bugs except via the chat on their homepage, etc.

TL;DR: Unplayable because of bug. No support.",1656866452,1660340245,False,4,0,0.509244024753570557,0,True,False,False

For starters, the story is an unclear mess of an Alpha Pariah who got some super miraculous power of closing a warp rift within the Caligari sector. Where you get strung along with boring dialogue, poorly written characters and also horrid voice acting that makes some bad effort Saturday morning cartoon characters seem more lively than that bunch (edited)
Then mechanically the game is... Bad and weird, like very weird...

On the bad side, the targeting on either mouse+keyboard or controller is just awkward and automatically targets an enemy at random, sometimes your character will aim for the ceiling for some reason when they fire some weapons, then you have some AOE abilities that are a god send in clearing out trash...

And the mission designs are just awful

Which goes pretty much to 4 formulas ""Go to x point to pick up x item"" ""Escort idiot npc to X point for X reason"" ""Assassinate 3 enemies"" ""Wipe out all enemies on the map""

Now it wants to be a diablo-esque game, but fails imho in a few ways, notably in how it does its buff and debuff mechanics

Dungeons are somewhat lackluster in their design, but the combat is fun and engaging enough to pull your attention away from that most of the time. 

The voice acting for the main and supporting characters is pretty solid, but some of the minor characters may well have been voiced by someone they picked off the street. 

Soundtrack is dark and moody as you would expect from a game like this. Combat sound effects are ok, but some of the guns could use a bit more 'oomph'.

+ A great community providing resources, tools and guides.
+ High quality voice acting.
+ Good controller support, although individual enemy targeting can be a bit clunky.

- The main scenario itself offers little challenge: lives are unlimited in main scenario missions and choosing a higher difficulty does not improve rewards. Moreover certain features in the gameplay such as crafting are unlocked only by playing the main scenario, which means it has to be re-played for every new character created.
- The label of sandbox / open world is slightly abusive as the game is all about completing missions in closed maps with access to the main hub (your ship) in-between. While the maps where the missions take place are indeed organized into sub-sectors, systems, and planets that the player can visit, there is no particular feeling of coherence among planets. The player can simply browse available missions as a list of assignments and totally ignore the spatial organization of maps, which makes the open world feature a bit anecdotal.
- Some game mechanics are unclear and hard to figure out, such as the interaction between different item enchants.
- A few bugs here and there, but nothing gamebreaking.

All in all, a solid game that should keep you addicted for dozens of hours if you like the action-RPG genre and in particular if you're a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe!

At the time of me writing this review (7/26/2022) the game still costs $49.99 for the base version and for the complete bundle $79.99... and at the time of me writing this, the game has been out since June 5th, 2018. I'm sorry to say that the price point is completely unacceptable. Dare I say that the developers are not in the loop as to how the new market works for ARPG's. You make the game largely or completely free and then you allow support to be given through fun cosmetics and other ""micro-transactions."" The best examples I can give of this are Path of Exile and Lost Ark (also League of Legends). The reason this model works so well is because people just want to try a new game but don't have the money to just try every single game out there. Well when you play these free and better ARPG's you get to do it for free... and then what ends up happening is they trick you into spending some money to get a cool appearance here or there. It might seem cheesy, but it's absolutely brilliant and effective.

As far as the game itself, it seems very well made and polished. Limited bugs in the game, but some definitely exist, randomly falling through terrain, game crashing, and before I uninstalled the game I was level 98 in the new season and the game just wouldn't start up anymore even after restarting my computer. I probably need to  update my graphics drivers, so I won't fault it too much there, because that problem did not happen until very recently. Whatever the case, it definitely holds true to the ARPG style and feels very similar to other titles in that genre, such as Diablo III, Path of Exile, Lost Ark, and Black Desert Online. Slashing and/or blasting your way through maps at a good enough pace and you start to really feel some satisfaction. There is a really interesting mechanic called Void Crusades in the game that allow you to do some good farming runs that you can buff up and make more difficult for better loot. I did like that quite a bit. Unfortunately, there weren't any real ""Bosses"" to beat outside of the storyline play through while leveling (unless I just didn't know about them?). Character Customization was good, Graphics were good, and the game felt very playable. 

I ultimately feel like this game is in the same boat as Black Desert Online, great game, very well made and unique, but why would you spend money to play it when you can just play Lost Ark which is an even better game than BDO and is completely free. Likewise with this game, why play this game when you can just play a better ARPG like PoE which is also completely free. Lastly, even if you didn't mind spending money on an ARPG, Diablo III ($19.99) and Wolcen ($39.99) are around the same caliber AND are cheaper... If you really just want to give this game a try, I would try to wait for the game to go on sale or something, because I believe just a month or so ago they had a big summer sale where it was much more affordable.",1658814403,1658814848,False,0,0,0.459056556224822998,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER.....

After 10-15h you start seeing missions, levels and everything is endlessly recycled and the cracks starts to show up and they're big..... this game is solid but, does not have enough content to support how the game is structured. Endless random missions and new story line and......... same enemies, same maps, same plot.... paint jobs and you quickly realize that you're redoing the same thing over and over and over, nothing new and this should had been a linear 10-15h top down shooter and that would make the game GREAT, trying to be an endless arpg it becames its own downfall as it was not by one  lightyear enough to keep things fresh and engaging. 

This is a YES but in reallity is a BUY ON A DEEP DEEP SALE and IF you love warhammer 40k lore and you play the campaign only and don't bother wasting time on the rest as it is filler with the only purpose of givin some xp, but even the main campaign makes you op and turns the campaign very easy without any extra filler copy-paste maps/missions.

I know its a indie studio, limited budget, but we saw how van helsing games have a lot more content and variety and for who say ""but they've their hands tied by the lore"" if there is something that has plenty to make a game with a 1000h is warhammer, to this day the lore keeps evolving so they could had much more, was not the lack of lore or stories or races, events.......

TLDR: Feels like they meant to make it a single player linear game, but later changed their minds into an arpg and it didn't fit well. Good game, but its a single player top down shooter trying so hard to be a online arpg....

So far having a blast, and I mean ""blast"".  Gobs of meat everywhere.  As a 40K fan, how could I ignore this title?  For an ARPG title based on 40K, they nailed it.

As the debate on classes, yes, you can change weapons and armor, making it seem no classes exist except the main three, but who says you should interchange armor and weapons not associated to your subclass?  I keep true to the subclass, so I have three subclass per main class, giving me nine characters, twelve counting the Adept and it's sub classes.  I don't switch to more powerful armor or weapons if it does not meet my class/subclass choice.  I play all the characters at the same time, so I get to enjoy all the styles by restricting armor/weapon upgrades.

Which is the only gripe I have with this excellent title.  Only eleven character saves and one graveyard.  Wait, there are twelve different class/subclass.  Why do they do this?  Should be always enough character save slots for ALL the choices available, in this case twelve, not eleven.

Ignoring that, I love this title, one of my favorite ARPG.  Yea, I like POE, Diablo, Grim Dawn, etc., but this is my favorite due to environment, shooting mechanics, and I just love 40K.",1658714566,1658714566,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I read a lot of criticisms of this game when researching whether to buy it or not. Very glad I took the chance.

Pros:
--There are plenty of weapon options (weapons determine your skills in this game) and they are SO fun to experiment with. I was looking for a game where your skills are determined by character classes or skill trees, but Inquisitor's weapon system, to my surprise, completely satisfied my desire to experiment with different builds. Speaking of which...
--The interplay between weapons and their enchantments; and gear and its enchantments; and your many, many passive skill trees creates a super fun dynamic of farming or crafting the right gear for the builds you want to experiment with. When you find a weapon whose skills you love (and you will), you'll catch yourself chasing the best enchantments for that weapon, the best gear to compliment it, and the right passives to make your build pop off. It doesn't feel forced or exhausting, it's a natural and enjoyable chase.
--Those 15 or so passive skill trees? They're easy to reset. If you miss-skill, it's not hard to reset a tree or even multiple trees to fix your build or try a new one. No bricking, no need to make a new character. If you're going for a DoT-based build and discover you'd be better off with a crit-based one, the passive skill trees won't hold you back from switching, although finding new gear enchants could be a more extensive project.
--The community gives great advice. It's not a huge community, but I kind of think that's a good thing for this game. It's very personal. There's lots of good build advice, clearing guides, and do's-and-don't's lists if you know where to look (the Discord group is very active and well-organized, and there are a lot of good Steam guides).
--Pretty much everything has multiplayer!
--Big achievements list (known as Heroic Deeds) with valuable rewards, with a decent amount of class-specific achievements sprinkled in. Another thing for completionists and hunters like me to obsess over.
--You can purchase most of the DLC's with in-game currency. I got the whole thing for cheap on the Steam Summer Sale so this didn't affect me but it's definitely worth mentioning.
--Seasonal updates keep the game fresh and are adding new classes, mechanics, weapons, and other fun stuff. I see greater longevity for this game than I did when initially researching it.
--The investigations and plot of the story missions are quite good. The mysteries you solve and the morality choices you make give you a sense of what it might actually be like to be an Inquisitor. The journal that records your findings is very well managed, if you like to read fluff, and if you don't care much for plot, you can click through almost all cut scenes. The reveals from the story are juicy and feel ""important"" without being ""canon-shattering,"" if that makes sense. It's really quite good... IF you can handle some very questionable voice-acting and writing. Which brings me to my cons list...

Cons:
--Voice acting. My biggest pet peeve with the game. A lot of the xenos and chaos character voices are depressingly childish in their ""evil-ness."" Not all, but a very significant chunk of them scale the growling and huffing up to ridiculous levels. The main va's are fortunately not as hard to listen to in terms of voice quality, but they have other problems. It's like half the time they aren't even reading the words they're saying. The tone of the game is too serious for a tech-priest to be able to get away with pronouncing reliquary ""reck will ery"" repeatedly. And it's ""Astra Militarum,"" not ""Astra malaria."" To be fair though, it's not always their fault because...
--The writing can be pretty sloppy. This is different from the overall plot and pacing of the story, which I think are very good. I'm talking about grammar and syntax. Lots of extra words, missed words, and misused phrases. Some amount of this is inevitable and fine, but you can hear and read it tripping up the voice actors. Still, I recognize this is more a pet peeve than a proper criticism of the game. On to other things.
--In the endgame for each character, it would be nice if there were a few more viable options for ways to farm. Void crusades are fun and rewarding, but Priority Assignments are the exact opposite, and that huge star map feels kind of unused.
--The vehicle missions in the campaign are fun the first few times but eventually (quickly, for some people) get old and slow. Would be nice to have a way to speed up, skip, or pay your way past those on future characters.
--The guild system (known as Cabals) needs cleaning up. Either the search system needs to filter out inactive cabals or there's no point in having one. Right now, it seems most people find active cabals by going to the Discord group, at which point, why bother having the search system in-game?

I'm sure there's more I'm not thinking of but at this point I'm tired of writing and it's time to play. Do yourself a favor, 40k fans: give Inquisitor a shot. I'm so glad I did.",1658548605,1658548605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Action RPGs are just normal rpgs with cool moves like horizon or Dragon's Dogma
ARPG is a tag that retards use to .. idk whatever.
isometric fuck off ium with no point..
ARPG players should just be isolated in a room and kept care of cause they clearly have no idea what is functional and what is just a number





Turn off fucking frame blending.... Turn off EVERYTHING.. High particle effects. lighting. Subsurface scattering. Environmental effects...EVERYTHING. (not Vsync) 

For the frames?
nononoonono
Cause they fucked with the animations.... To make the game run well optimised..... Cause they overhauled the game by adding all that BS
WHICH>>>>>>>>>>>> fucking useless cause the game's coolest effects are hidden behind those effects

Turn all that on. You get generic shooter that has no point being one cause the enemies don't challenge you.
Even tho its meant to be more like the activision game ""prototype"".

Turn that off and. I shit you not... The turrets have bullet trail after firing the size of tank shells. Enemies HAD EFFECTS WHEN THEY DIE?? I didn't know that... Crimson fire... Neon Green... 

Mines.. fucking Mines... have like shiny blue particles.
your tech adpet's robot machine dogs despawn with a shower of blue.. particle things..

Yea.....
imagine turning a feature that hides your basic game on by FUCKING DEFAULT

gameplay wise....
Eh.. its ... Just a regular spectacle shooter that isn't even that much of a spectacle ... with ""choose if you want 2% damage or 1% armour like that's going to make any difference until you stack it 50 times Hahaha"" 
Its fun if you want it for a controller thing..... But honestly you aren't missing out on anything

Especially given their default fucking settings.

I swear everyone is using their library for fucking up animations to get more frames...

Im going to leave my negative review here. That I had up for 4-6months... To show you how bullshit it was if i didn't figure out frame Blending

Im honestly.. not sure if it worked. or im halucinating by forcing myself to believe shit.









TLDR
A Hammer is not fun because of how it looks or swings
Its fun because of what it does. 
Which is hammer down nails... The feel of nailing a hammer through wood.. Is fun
as you see a nail. You almost Salivate to want to nail it down. 

This game. Is all looks. Even if you see a nail. And you swing at it.. the nail goes down. but it makes a wrong sound.... as if your work is not complete and you need to do something else for the entire activity to make sense
as if you only nailed 2 pieces of wood to make a square..... the square is not formed... yet there is no more wood... The quest is complete . You are paid money... and you are shoved into the next quest... where you are asked ""Do you want a new hammer? With +2 pointless stat"" 

Don't buy this.
The devs don't understand how to make a game
I rushed to end this cause i was obsessed that maybe at the end it will all make sense. It is as pointless in the end as it is in the start

Here is something they needed to ask
Who was this made for? 
Why was this made?

Is this like prototype where you have fun cause the gameplay feels good
Is it like regular games where the goal is to beat the enemy by applying yourselfs and what you know about the game (not a lot , just wsad shoot. and simulating how you win. and then doing it) 
Is it... anything?

And the answer to that question is nothing.

If you aim to make your damage about equal to most enemies. You will see that.. the skill tree is sort of locked. its like even the Cool Math games dot com bullshit this and PoE try to pull is useless

I don't know if it was made for fun.

I know at the begining the combat felt empty  , Like i wasn't doing something right so it didn't catch. 
By the end. Im just too crushed. 
I turned all features on. Made the text bigger. And just enjoyed the BIG numbers... In size... 
Cause enemies are of 3 kinds
1 shot
3-5 shot
20 shots.

They have some ""Cool"" sounding stuff. Like Void war. And Uther's Tarot cards that look cool
But when you play the game you know tis all pointless
Its just
""A series of Random mission that you need to complete to the end"" and ""Modifiers to mission for more loot. But you take more damage"" 

And why? For what?
For Weapons? None needs them. Cause none wants to fight enemies CAUSE ITS NOT FUN

Something i recently noticed.
I thought ""Well ok. Lets just ignore all the bad. Sure it might pop into my head but with time it will be like air   LETS just have fun , by just playing the game , for fun""
But.. it needs to be designed for fun.. for it to be fun

No matter what you can't make Sitting at the Dentist Fun... cause its designed to be boring...

Storyline/Lore
-------------
The story stays faithful to much of Warhammer 40K accepted canon. You can absorb it all or just quickly run through the campaign missions. Voice acting is superb. Villains are interesting. The game definitely keeps a true dark theme of Warhammer 40K of the grim future. The only annoying thing is you have to redo the campaign every time you want to try a new character. Some missions are really annoying and you can be twiddling your thumbs if you know what you're doing and can easily clear enemies. After your first run there is almost no incentive to do the campaign aside from getting your morality and unlocking critical NPCs.
My only main annoyance is there is a morality mechanic where you choose important decisions throughout the campaign that impacts your character. Either Radical or Puritan path. The only thing is... you have to commit 100% to one or the other in order to get the best of either path. It has no impact story wise (except some minor plot changes). This really leaves no room to role play, but it is an ARPG. The enemies that are present seem to be mainly just Chaos (including 4 different legions and tainted rebels), Eldar (and Dark Eldar), or Tyranids. Wish they had orks but I guess it's because they aren't in the Caligari Sector the game is centered around.

Gameplay
-------------
This game stays true to the ARPG formula like Diablo and Path of Exile. However there are some unique changes such as the suppression system, combat stances, ranged weapons, belt items, and innoculators. There are lots of enchants to chose how to focus your build. This lets you chose to make some unique builds. What really helps is the game doesn't throw too many options at you compared to some other ARPGs (Path of Exile is the obvious comparison). Every weapon has 4 different attacks, and you can swap between 2 weapon slots.
I have noticed that melee builds seem to outshine ranged builds just because certain enchants only are on melee weapons instead of ranged (life and shield drain). Some enchants are must haves that allow you to push the end game content difficulty and become meta for most effective builds.

Bugs
-------------
This game has several game breaking bugs which can screw you over.
- Game will sometimes start dropping frame rates without warning and may even crash
- Random crashes
- Enemies can stun lock your character forcing you to restart the mission/alt+f4
- Multiplayer can cause bugs which lock out missions and make them impossible to finish.
- Devs don't do well communicating with the community when some major issues are present and they are working on them.

Community
-------------
I've found the players in the game are overall very friendly and helpful. It's hard to do multiplayer unless you join a Cabal (guild).
Players share builds and guides to help people learn what to do.

- Graphics are fine. It's an ARPG ffs. Looks quite good on high settings.

- Plays like a charm (for me).

- Totally different classes and builds

- not too hard, imho

The game systems are solid and the gameplay is satisfying, but it is just repetitive as hell. It feels like every map is the same endless metal corridor. Enemy and boss variety is severely lacking as well, so everything feels. the. same. Forever. 

There is a sort of infinitely scalability and grind that you can engage in, but these dimly lit hallways covered in gore and snot do not make for a long term enjoyable experience IMO.

I started in on the expansion and it was literally just more gore filled dark metal hallways, except with some space elves instead of daemons.

Many ARPGs are repetitive but in most you experience some sort of character and build growth where it feels like your character matures.

The 40k universe, even though is dark, has enough colour, simply look at the GW models - not this game though. 

The missions and level design is monotonous and repetitive. Walking through the same looking hallways for the 50th time doesn't feel satisfying. Character upgrades don't feel rewarding since the skill tree revolves around passive skills with minuscule increments to your overall power. The skills themselves come from weapon types which are very few and even fewer are fun to use. In other words there is very little to experiment and have fun with in this game.

if you like 40k then PLAY THIS GAME! the game-play is solid, the level of detail is quite insane tbh and the amount of tile sets and different worlds is pretty amazing to, when i played a map on the one of the coreworlds, i was like no way all that city down there is modelled and yep it is.

the screen shots on the steam store really dont do this game justice, i found the story instresting in parts it was 60%(good )  40% (ok)

huge amount of different weps, plenty of min maxing and honestly my inquisitor iin heavy armour looks insane, they still up date this game with seasons to my amazement.

the start of the game like 1st 30 mins is a bit slow as u get used to everything, but after that u get iin the swing of it..
im rocking heavy armorr and a huge ass flamethrower burning everythiing to bits its pretty dope.

like i said this a gem in the normally quite mediocre diablo market.. it is defo in the top 5 for me !!!

[b] [u]Disclaimer[/u][/b]
I am rushing out this review because I want to let the gaming community know that this game is MUCH better than it seems while the Summer Sale is still going on. So far I have only 6 hours in the game, and I’ve only tried out the Crusader class, and yet I already consider my 20 euro well spent because of the unique experience. 
Also, I am playing with all DLCs and especially the big DLC ""Prophecy"" enabled. Some content I describe below may not be available in the base game! 
Take my review with a grain of salt if you will but if you see my playtime go up, you will know that I meant serious business with the following praise for the game:

[b] [u]Gameplay & Loot[/u][/b]

Unlike your usual ARPG and similar to Path of Exile you don’t unlock active skills but your skill tree is only unlocking passive buffs. It is the weapons themselves that give you active skills. Every weapon has 4 skills and most of them differentiate heavily from those of other weapons. 

Apparently, other classes work differently. The Psyker class especially probably comes closest to your familiar ARPG gameplay with spells and such, while the Tech-Adept is somewhat similar to your usual Necromancer. 
You don’t have a single world you go through but you load into every mission individually. Which only makes sense because the game takes place on different subsolar-systems and different planets.

Mission variety is there and there are also some submissions within the missions (e.g. defending a drop of resources (which suddenly makes this game feels like a tower-defense game for a few minutes which is a nice diversion). But let’s be honest: it is an ARPG. Your mission is to kill as many enemies as possible while getting from A to B and then to C.  What you need to know is that there are voluntary missions which you can play for the loot or to level up, and there are tighter campaign missions in which you will have a rudimnentary purpose for you being there. I have found the story so far quite good for an ARPG and there is some radio chatter during the campaign missions and some text messages that are always written lore-friendly and correspond to the the respective writer (be it the no-nonsense, mathematical language of a Tech-Priest or a Captain who went rogue). 

Now to the loot, and oh my god, the loot! I can’t remember playing an ARPG in which I want to try out so many weapons  at the same time. Normally, I find a good weapon and stick with it until I find a much better one. Here, I find myself constantly switching between different sets of equipment, and each of them are viable although all of them require you to adjust your playstyle. You can rush in with your Chainsword in one and your Inferno Pistol in the other hand and wreak havoc right amidst the enemy mob, hacking away with your sword and release a powerful single fire shot from your pistol every 2 seconds. Or you could go in with a two-handed hammer and go full melee with slow but devastating attacks. The bigger guns vary from low to high range and you have to play accordingly. Every two-handed melee weapon has at least one skill that causes enemies to topple and lie on the ground defenselessly for a short period. (It can also happen to you!) I only mention this because way too few ARPG have such kind of physics based enemy behaviour. Note that you can switch between two weapon sets at any time which gives you even more flexibility. 

Upgrading your weapons works through Signia or your armor or eye implants, i.e. the upgrade slots are independent from the weapons slots (if that makes sense). All of the upgrades give you unique boosts and it is of course wise to have buffs that increase heat damage on a Melta-Rifle that lets your enemies simmer in a bright and HOT and definitively painful puddle of fire. 

I think there is not a ridiculous amount of different weapon types, although with enabled DLCs there are definitively more weapons than shown on the official fandom wiki! But considering that the weapons are so different from each other makes it satisfying even for someone like me who can’t get enough of different weapon types in a game. I would say the amount of weapons is similar to that of Path of Exile. 

[b] [u]Variety and sound design[/u][/b]

I’ve watched dozens of videos of the gameplay over the last 2 years to make an informed decision whether or not to buy Inquisitor. At the end of the day, I never pulled the trigger because it seemed like there are mainly dark indoor levels inside of spaceships. And I had no interested in that. However, contrary to these second-hand impressions, I can say now that there is a big variety of biomes/map layers. There are snow landscapes, deserts, hive cities, oil fields and some more. Right now, after my limited playtime I would still say that about 60 percent of the game happens indoors in somewhat same-y looking spaceships. But since the general design and the little environmental story telling is so good, I don’t really mind that discrepancy between indoor and outdoor levels. 

I watched SkillUp’s review from 2018 in which he complains a lot about the game. Admittedly, the game has changed a lot since then, especially with the 2.0 patch that released together with the Prophecy DLC. But the biggest issue for SkillUp was the audio. He especially complained about the sound effects being too similar and that that would be an issue in an ARPG since you hear the same sounds potentially for hundreds of hours. And granted, the audio never seemed very good when I watched gameplay videos. 

But oh my, is that far from the actual experience! The audio design in this game is nothing short of incredible! I have never heard such an impressive Bolter Rifle in all of the Warhammer games I have played so far. It really feels like it shoots a HEAVY caliber whereas in other games it only sounds like a light machine gun. There is even a faint  CHING when you stop shooting and the bolt snaps back for one last time. The laser pistol albeit small makes a decidedly uncanny noise after each shot. And there are three different sounds that vary in between the shots! You really feel the energy that comes out of this pistol is deadly. Then the plasma rifle with which you can shoot some kind of mortar strike which propels half a dozen plasma “shells” towards your enemies which will then explode with a sound that is completely different from a “normal” explosion.  

I will readily admit that the melee sounds are a bit on the weak side. But then again, the Chainsaw is spot on. (Note that when you hold the left mousebutton you will not only just swing towards your enemies but actually saw into them!) 

The music is serviceable 50 percent of the time, and fits right into the Warhammer universe. The rest of the time, the music will blow your mind. I mean it! For me, some of the tracks are right up there with Mechanicus’ OST! The ambient sound is also very good and adds to the immersion. 

I must note though that the sound can be patchy at times: the oil pumps are thudding down loudly on the respective oil field map layer but when you come closer to the pump, the thudding isn’t audible anymore. The same happens with some melee sounds at times. 

The voice acting, by the way, is very good, too, and just what one should expect from a proper Warhammer game.",1656701975,1656757183,True,34,0,0.762084722518920898,3,True,False,False

You can punch holes through objects with certain weapons, such as the bolters.

good game, but recommend waiting until a 50% or 75% off sale, and then buying the super omega pack that includes all DLC/expansions

this game really hits its stride 5-6 hours in. just understanding ability rotations, swapping between weapons for different cooldowns (kinda like ESO) and other mechanics become more natural and the game starts to really feel like a fun ARPG.

i also highly recommend trying every class to around level 10 before going hard on one class. i thought crusader was going to be my jam, but now i'm loving the power sword and needler sniper rifle on assassin. try every class, try every weapon on every class, see what is your favorite. it will drastically increase how fun the game is for you for a little time investment. 

2nd also, CHECK THE HEROIC DEED SECTION IN THE MAIN HUB. there are DOZENS of ""achievement"" type missions that reward attribute points and perks. these are serious in game advantages that remain unlocked on all future characters. highly recommend focusing on them and paying attention to the ones you want most.

edit: this game just gets more fun as you play. i think that's the problem and why it has such a bad reputation. the first 5 hours are just yawn story missions. but then you get perk slots, more passive points, psalms, shards, relics, tarot cards, etc. etc. just so much stuff that alters the game experience.

I like Warhammer because of the storytelling, the grim darkness and occasional silliness.

STORY: 2/5
The story in this game is completely hamfisted, disengaged and doesn't hit the mark for the inquisition.
Being an inquisitor killing countless chaos marines, chaos engines, daemons etc. really hits a weird note.
My breaking point came in chapter 4 when a guardsman wouldn't stop talking to me about another inquisitor. I was driving around a tank and he just kept babbling on in a silly voice. I'm unsure if it was supposed to be funny?
At least the 3 side campaigns (drukhari, black legion, etc.) are fun.

Gameplay: 2/5
It's an absolute slog of a game loop. It's just waves upon waves of mindless grinding. Even if I tune up the difficulty it just messes with my HP & damage output not the mechanics. You'll just kite the enemies ad nauseum.

I got the ultimate edition on sale for $20. I cannot suggest a full price purchase for the base version unless you're willing to grind out Fate points from completing missions to buy the DLC in-game.

It ain't stable or well optimized (sync CPU to GPU if your performance is too unbearable, and lower the persistent corpse count to like 10-20 bodies instead of the default of 100 because the frame drops ain't worth the spectacle), but it's fun if you're in the mood for some 40K content, or just want to play an ARPG that focuses more on tactical play instead of optimizing both the loot grind itself and your builds. You know, turn your brain off and just play if what you have works, instead of constantly crunching numbers to get single digit percentage improvements.

I don't recommend thinking about the meta too much. Have options for crowd control (there WILL be swarms of trash mobs) and single-target burst damage, and your build will be fine unless you're trying to do something absurdly difficult or just not paying attention to your positioning. 

With the Tarot Card system (which let's you pick which optional, drastic modifiers you want to add to non-story missions for their respective kinds of rewards), a cycling list of randomly generated missions, and the Void Crusades (basically, you use a resource to create mini campaigns where you complete missions on a randomly generated star map, and have to complete standard missions to progress towards one of the boss nodes on the star map. The more missions you complete, the bigger your rewards when you cash out at a boss node, but you only have so many lives for the entire campaign, and the campaign itself gets more difficult the more missions you complete.), you have a lot of pick-up-and-play options with varying levels of time investment that can be as easy or challenging (but also more rewarding) as you want.

 I played using an Xbox controller and the tactical control scheme, never touched mouse and keyboard for this so far. A controller is pretty comfy for extended sessions, and there's more than enough AOE and crowd control options in the game that I don't even slightly care about the accuracy loss. Switch the cover controls to ""hold"" instead of ""toggle"" if you're using controller though. It's finicky as all hell otherwise.

No personal comments about the story. If I don't like how a game plays, I don't care about the story it's telling. If I do like how it plays, I probably still don't care about the story. Here, the story is alright I guess, but I haven't gone out of my way to read 40K literature or anything, so I don't have any context for how it stacks up against other narratives with this setting and lore. All I really care about here is that I found some tricked out Lasguns, that there's sometimes a gaggle of guardsmen backing me up, and that there's always more Chaos Spawn that needs killin'.

If you think of it more like a tactical action game with an isometric camera (best analogy I can come up with is Killzone Liberation with loot mechanics and actually viable melee combat options), instead of something akin to the more ""traditional"" ARPGs like Diablo, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Torchlight, etc., then you'll probably have a good time too if you can tolerate the jank and don't stress yourself out too much over the game's potential. Otherwise, wait for a sale if you're curious but undecided, and maybe ignore it altogether if you're not. You're gonna want to bring some friends if you want to try the multiplayer content, though I can't comment on how any of it functions as I haven't had the opportunity to try any of it yet.

Oh, and learn how the suppression mechanic works. It'll save your life more often than you initially think.

The game feels and looks clunky, the combat is unimpactfull, perks change how your stats are calculated but never how the actuall skills or weapons work so you get almost no variety in HOW you kill, just how hard you kill it. 

Melee combat... how the fuck can you make a melee in a warhammer title feel THAT bad - from every perspective, animations are garbage and badly indicate the area of attack, sound is off, if you press attack while moving the character just keeps moving into direction you started the attack with. 

Chainsword, the most iconic weapon in wh40k is sooooo fucking bad it will make any logicaly thinking fan of wh40k want to find the one who thought that implementation is a good idea and purge his heresy with fire and melta.

The best feeling class to play is Techpriest becouse you dont have to fuck around with medicore combat thanks to servitors doing the job for you. That is if their AI actually follows you for a change becouse they tend to hover behind you so much they will ignore enemies. Crusader has great range of possible weapons and it didn't help much, try using heavy flamer. Feels fun to burn shit? Yeah, if you actually see it burning becouse by the time the animation of flame gets out of the flamer most shit is dead becouse of ""magic"" or you watch fire everywhere while nothing dies becouse terrain blocks it. Assasin feels great to move around but to fullly use her mobility its best to run around in melee - which as i stated is steaming pile of horseshit. Psyker? Oh you mean that skinny dude acting high and mighty while throwing piss poor animated spells? One of the enjoyable types of spells in most HnS are for example chanalled beam attacks. You stand and fire a blazing beam of inferno that melts enemies - how it looks here? It's a fucking 1 pix width tiny beam looking like a pointing laser.

The longer i think about this game the more pissed off i am that wh40k can't get any decent game excluding xcom-types (Mechanicus is perfect, Daemongate pretty good if you dont look at GUI). It's a pure fan bait. I tried to play it when it launched, returned each season to see if things got better and... nope. Still same, medicore HnS. Oh, talking about seasons... current mechanic for season that will last for months and months are golden balls surrounding you that buff up enemies and blast them with beams. Thats it. Seen any PoE season? A F2P game? Yeah. It's just as sad as the combat. Shit.

Even graphics are mixed bag - enemies look great, locations varies from ok to awesome and at the same time player armor models are mostly shit, some meh and 1-2 that look ""ok"".

The game FEELS like it was made to be a 40K game rather than a bog standard ARPG with the licence cheaply slapped on it to capitalise on the 40K fanbase (""Unlike a CERTAIN game called Diablo Immortal..."")

The mechanics while being quite similar to a traditional ARPG have their own spin on it.

- a proper cover system that you can use to hide from enemy fire

- a ""Suppression"" system that act like a secondary bar next to you HP that depletes the more you get overwhelmed by enemies, if it depletes too much you'll start doing mistakes and loose your marks and if it reaches zero you becomes too overwhelmed to even shoot or hit properly.

- a skill/ability system that relies on what weapon you're using, basically the weapons determines your active skills rather than the class

- And of course... the setting, the 40K setting is completely unique and this game does an AMAZING job representing the locations you'll be visiting, whether it be in a Imperial Ship corrupted by Nurgle or a perma-frost planet invaded by Chaos Marines, this game represents the universe to a T

Overall, this is a game made by 40K fans, FOR 40K fans and it's damn apparent with the amount of seemingly mundane details that 40K nerds like me are able to pick up.

Just be aware though... the game is not very well optimized... I'd even go as far as to say that it can be ABYSMAL at times and has been this way ever since release or even beta, so do yourself a favor and choose the medium preset if you're struggling to keep a decent frame rate... The game still looks great even on ""medium""

****UPDATE****

So... Nearly 2 years have passed since I last made that review and... Well, the game just kept getting better, and it STILL is getting better even to this day.

The devs really are passionate about this game and it shows, they just keeps on pumping MOAR.

-Moar seasons (a new one just dropped today)

-Moar classes (a new Sisters of Battle class DLC set to release somewhat soon)
 
-Moar revamps and reworks (every seasons brings at least one of those)

-Moar weapons (every seasons brings new ones)

-Moar maps and bosses (again, every seasons brings in new ones)

-And it just goes on...

So honestly, if you're interested in this game, just buy it whenever you can, its more than worth the full price tag, especially so if you're a big 40K nerd like myself.

But, if you're willing to wait a little, you can also pick it up on sales, those happens really often and it's usually 50% off at the very least.

Sure, it's still a grindy mess, but there's a lot under the surface here for you to explore. If you se this on a sale, its a easy grab now. Today I think the main flaw is the static mission throught the campaign, if they were somewhat randomized in their layouts it been a much better experience of leveing other classes. 

From 2018: It's such a shame to give this game a negative review, but I haven't even managed to pull myself together and finish the main campaign. Why you might ask? Because it is such a heavy repetitive game with a lackluster experience. All the missions look and/or feels the same, its just a straight corridor where you kill X enemies or push button Y. Not really and player descisions of where to go next or where to explore. Now I know diablo and other similar games arent exactly open world either, but atleast you get a bigger map where you can go either left or right and there are points of interest. 

This game could have used annother 3-6 months in development to improve the player experiece, wich again is such a shame becase the core of the game with graphics, voice overs, skill trees, weapons, music and a great Warhammer athmosphere is there and right on spot. 

If you're a warhammer fan and you find this on a 50% sale, go for it, you'll get a couple of days worth of gameplay. But for full price or a non warhammer fan I wouldn't recommend it.",1530435265,1655992398,True,0,0,0.516435742378234863,0,True,False,False

It seems to be much faster paced then when I left my original review, and now it feels much more like a hack'n'slash game that it always should have been. Recommended.



Old review:
I just tried this game again after being away from it for a while. And to the devs - I love Warhammer 40K. I like what you did design wise in the game. And I want you to make a game I will love to play. 
But it seems like you think you are on the right track and just need to tweek some stuff. That is wrong - Understand that I love 40K, and I love ARPG'S - And this game is just so boring and slow and not fun. 
1 mission is all I could stand, and I was about to quit half-way through.

(I posted most of these critique points back when i stopped playing last time, but nothing has really changed so here they are again)


- The pace is sooo sloooow. This is like no other ARPG on the market, and that is not a good thing. 
- The response time of weapons seems off, like you click the mouse and .4 seconds later you shoot. Combat is not fluid at all.
- I played on difficulty much higher then my gear score(mobs did like +45% damage) and it was still way way too easy. The only thing that made it hard was I got so bored that I started to just rush through. It was a small map, and I got bored. 
-The whole cover system is(still) just plain bad. First off because you do not need to take cover. Secondly, if you do, it breaks in seconds. 
- Map design is flawed - You constantly have to backtrack through empty corridors that you just cleared. Yawn.
- There is not enough action for it to be an ARPG, there is not enough tactical decision making to make it a tactical arpg. 

I know it is Alpha, but it feels like pre-pre-Alpha. Or a concept Demo.

And I hate to bring money in to this, but no matter what you do, this will never be worth 50$. Look at Grim Dawn - Much more game, more finished, better class system, better quests, better almost everything, and it costs 25$. The only thing this game has over Grim Dawn is that it is 40k.

If I did not believe the devs really love 40k and wants to make a good game, I would call this a sham.

It's repetitive, and you will get sick of Space Hulk style maps. That's my main complaint, here. The maps are so half-assedly ""procedurally generated"" they all feel the same and look the same. There's usually a hidden treasure box on every map, and often an optional mini boss too, so at least there's that. Destroying things sometimes drops treasure too.
If this game had the bespoke maps of Grim Dawn or Titan Quest sprinkled with some random smaller ""dungeons"", it'd be phenomenal, IMO. That's how they approached Van Helsing, and it worked out really well. I think this might have been a rushed game, sadly. Not uncommon with AA Games Workshop licensees. 
Grab it on sale if interested. Full price is frankly ridiculous. Don't let all the DLC's scare you though, you can buy those with in game currency (or just get the whole package for like 75% off like I did).

PS: I had some trouble getting this to run without making my PC sound like a jet taking off. I had to tell Win10 to cap my CPU usage at 90%. That made the game run cooler and much more quietly.

Theres definitly better ARPGs out there such as Diablo, Grim Dawn, Last Epoch, Path of Exile, Chronicon, TItan Quest, Torchlight 2, etc. However, if you've played them all already and need something else, It could scratch the itch I suppose but don't go in it with too much expectation cause ultimately, it still a basic ARPG with a Warhammer coat of paint.",1654928120,1654928120,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons
Graphics are not necessarily the greatest but I would say a 6/10 
though I do hold a high standard, nevertheless it's bearable, and doesn't ruin the core of the experience. 
 *spoiler?* I really enjoy the fact you can customize the paint scheme of your inquisitor.

Neutral
Its highly open as to what mission you take on.  There is the main story which as of writing I have not completed but has been good, not bad.  It incorporates elements of the universe in a way that would leave a newcomer who is curious as to discover the meaning behind the aesthetics, character interactions and terms that are used.  Which I don't consider a bad thing as a good jumping off point.

Pros
I'm in a mission and slaying a carnifex(boss) finding myself wanting to beat and punish the damn thing more than what my inquisitor can offer.  I don't consider this bad as it leaves me to looking forward to what more the game has to offer, I'm anticipating the end game with high level equipment to be even more fun. It's also made me nostalgic of previous titles in the series such as the RTS warhammer 40k dawn of war, and Dawn of war II.  I may replay them after this.

In summation
This game is perfect for those who are new to the series.  As an ARPG I'm always looking forward to the loot I'm going to earn in my next mission.  Graphics are eh but perhaps that is somewhat subjective, with some room for improvement in later titles should that be the case.  I'm sure there are mechanics that could be critiqued for pros and cons but I'm a filthy casual, I've come to enjoy it for what it is. 
Personally I've started as a crusader and enjoy switching between ranged and melee, finding that neither are a one sized fits all strategy.  At the least the play style is open to interpretation which is great.

the game play isn't Grimdawn, a must buy 10/10 if you're a fan of ARPGs, and at the least would recommend this game to anyone for the casual experience, and for those as a possible entry into the universe.

To comment on some things people say;

Server's constantly disconnect you: This isn't true, I've spent many hours without any disconnects. Most people I know who play have never had server connection issues. Maybe if you are on a dial up modem, it might be worth looking at your internet before blaming the game.

DLC aren't worth buying:  You can literally earn ""FATE"" in game to get all of the DLC except the class based one (Prophecy) for FREE.  All you have to do is play.  It takes about 2-3 days of playing to earn 1200 Fate to buy a DLC addon of your choice. Why buy when you can play to get for free? (Yes some DLC missions are greater than others, just google it)

No content:  This is an ARPG with a ton of depth.  There are multiple-Meta and multiple-Off Meta builds for each class.  There are relics that give functionality that enable new builds.  It has about 20+ hours of Fully Voice-acted pure WH40k conversations and scenes.  (anyone who says they beat the game in 3 hours is lying)  Story is divided into chapters, intel missions and special missions.  Its not handed to you, you have to be the inquisitor and investigate.

Game is clunky:  By default yes the hotkeys are badly set up.  But its like 3 clicks to fully remap your keys to your favored layout.  Just cause you have fat fingers, doesn't mean the game is clunky. Remap that shit into a good setup.  

Mission Grind: Literally identical to maps in Path of Exile.  Anyone who complains about repeat maps at end game literally is not an ARPG fan in general.  Grim Dawn resets, Path of Exile Maps, Diablo Rifts.  There are about 200 tile sets in this game and maps have ""distinct"" layouts.  This is partially due to the fact that if your on a map that is on a ship it needs to feel like your on a ship.

Loot Loop/XP loop:  This is where the game shines. There is crafting of gear, upgrading gear, constant loot drops, and more. Void Missions are the best currently for loot, and there is something satisfying about beating missions above your level for rewards you can't equip yet.  That feeling that your build just ""shines"".  

Time sink:  No joke, early game leveling is fast.  This slows to a crawl near level 60-70.  Especially if you know nothing about the game.  Read a bit, learn a bit, and soon you are speeding through those levels as well. There are ways to increase level xp by well over 500% if you know how.   Level 100 Cap- But you can push mission levels well over that. Satisfying.

Real Cons
-----------------
Low player count for an ARPG.   This means that group play/pvp requires you to meet people in game or have friends. 
Upgrades can be downgrades.    Not all equipment is worth changing to, only to be replaced later with better.
Crafting is expensive.     
Repetitive Loop.    Its very possible to have a 3 button build that completes maps in 2 mins or less. For some, this gets boring.

Real Pros
---------------
Fully voice acted and convincing story line for Warhammer 40k.
Several dozen builds for each class, build experimentation is satisfying.
All DLC is free except the class ones.  Just play the game to unlock them.
Combat is fun and impactful (once you remap your keybinds)
Has Seasons that add new gear, challenges, mechanics, and Cosmetic Reward tiers. (play to unlock)
NO BATTLE PASS!
NO IN YOUR FACE MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!

When Inquisitor Martyr first launched, it felt incomplete. Progression was sloth-like, the guns all made no sense in terms of impact and power, retreating fire was clunky and worthless, it was poorly optimized and it crashed a LOT. Worst of all, no co-op campaign.

WELL, I am pleasantly surprised to bring to you a VERY changed opinion. I will rate the pros and cons of out 3 points a piece. (My personal opinion folks)

[b]EDIT:[/b] Came back to make an adjustment, now that the Sisters are a confirmed thing.

[u]PROS:[/u]
+++Progression feels more natural
+++IN MISSION INVENTORY MANAGEMENT!? Should have been there from the start!
+++Weapons feel more impactful for their types
+++Movement is WAY less snail-paced and you run with a purpose
+++Optimizations!
++A MUCH improved crafting system
+++CO-OP CAMPAIGN IS BACK BABY!
++All of your gear types are now viable
+++PURGING THE HERETIC SCUM IN AN ARPG SETTING IS NOW FUN!
++Cover ACTUALLY works now
+++New difficulty selector for campaign/gameplay changes the entire dynamic, allowing for a challenge!
++A MORALITY SYSTEM!
+++SISTERS OF BATTLE INCOMING! YUSSSSSSSS!

[u]CONS:[/u]
-Some small textures stretch during cutscenes
-Some scenes have no combat sounds? wtf?
-If a large amount of enemies die on screen, some of the corpses ""T-Pose"" or do not ""die"" and stand as if alive
-You still sometimes blow up your own cover with powerful weapons
--You're an Inquisitor and you still can't call in AI backup... WHERE IS MY DREADNAUGHTBRO!?

imo, the pros outweigh the cons in every respect.

To be perfectly honest, the game now sits in a much more comfortable position. It's fun, dynamic and even kept me awake after working overnight. I stayed up to play from 12pm EST to 9pm EST nonstop. Last time I touched this game I didn't last anywhere near that long because I couldn't stand it.

All in all, it's time to rate the features!

[u]GRAPHICS[/u]
8/10
The game looks much better, and everything appears crisper. I have no complaints about this.

[u]AUDIO[/u]
6/10
They could have still done better here... some scenes still have no impact because the sounds are all muted. For instance there is a cutscene where [spoiler]the space marine you rescue gets shredded by an abomination and there's no sound for his leg getting torn off, or him hitting the ground...[/spoiler] Lost opportunity for leaving a lasting impression my peeps. Overall the sounds of weapons are pretty sweet though! ...minus the sounds of Plasma weapons... the ""ploom ploom"" sound effects are not what Plasma guns sound like. Where's the THOOM!? But the broken sounds during cutscenes bring this score down for me. The only sound that really bothers me is the Heavy Bolter... I miss the Dakka Dakka of the HBs from DoW2. SO... GOOD... /sad

[u]GAMEPLAY[/u]
8/10
The entire dynamic of the game has shifted. The gameplay is much improved and the feeling of blasting enemies to smithereens or crushing the skulls of the heretic filth in your path is very satisfying. For an Inquisitor, you're basically a terminator in a regular man's body. But you have so many toys at your disposal! It's very entertaining.

[u]CONTROLS[/u]
8/10
The controls are responsive, the new aimed-shot roulette is more fun than selecting your target and hoping the click registered, the weapon abilities all feel vastly improved and movement is much more enjoyable.

[u]STORY[/u]
5/10
The story is still pretty weak, but I'll give it a passing grade because the story is never the focus for these kinds of games. It's the action.

[u]OVERALL SCORE[/u]
7/10
Overall, I'd say Neocore did a good job. The game is finally worth playing. Unsure if it's worth that pricetag though... 40$ CAD would be more acceptable, but I bought it at launch and hoped it was better than it was. It is my opinion that the game worth purchasing at a 20% sale, EASILY.

- This game storytells correctly. Instead of the endless stream of skippable text from random NPCs you find in most MMOs or ARPGs, Martyr's story unfolds through voice acting between a small cast of characters during the flow of combat. A brief document is also thrown in every 2 or 3 missions, which is the correct amount of flavor text. 

- Martyr handles consumables correctly. Instead of needing to manage 5 different sizes of health and mana potions, you have a set number of consumable charges. (During missions, you find crates to recharge your consumables.) Also, there's a well-executed system for customizing your health consumable between missions, enabling you to choose between different health/power benefits at the expense of fewer maximum charges.

Martyr makes a lot of other interesting departures from most ARPGs. 

- The game is not open-world, it's mission based, with each mission occurring on a small-ish map. Martyr allows you to increase any mission's difficulty with random enemy buffs / personal debuffs.

- After each mission you return to the central hub, which is a ship's deck where you can interact with the same group of NPCs. The setup feels more like Harebrained Schemes' Shadowrun games than an ARPG. 

- The protagonist is front-and-center in the story, and has his own dialogue/voice actor. 

- The game's central plot is..... not bad. And it becomes progressively more interesting the deeper in the campaign you get. 

- Martyr's suppression system is executed well and provides players with interesting combat decisions.

Martyr is still an ARPG, which means repetitive gameplay spiced up by random loot drops, but its storytelling - both in terms of its mechanics and its level of quality - makes the game feel more like an ARPG/CRPG hybrid. That's a direction I'd like more ARPGs to go.

If there were one improvement I'd like to see in Martyr, it's developing the game's central hub - its ship - to more closely resemble the central hubs in Shadowrun. Add a few minor NPCs with their own personal story arc, include a small bit of background dialogue for each NPC after each mission, expose more of the ship's rooms and apparatuses. A richer and evolving central hub would further incentivize completing missions, and would help smooth out the ARPG grind of combat -> item management -> combat.",1650871634,1654148687,True,8,0,0.556773483753204346,0,True,False,False

62 hours in, did not feel like 62 hours. competent Arpg in it's own right, however you'll probably get the most out of it, if you also know 40k lore from before. Ton of end game stuff to do after finished the story.

Absolutely worth the price asking for it, however complete thing for 20 euro on steamsales. This game still supported by the devs. Hoping to see Orks and Necrons, one can always hope! 

absolutely a recommend for any 40k fans, one of those actually good 40k games which there there are few and far between, if I'd say so myself. 




[h1] First impression [/h1]

Like arpg games? Like Warhammer 40k? then this game is absolutely for you.

This is a great game so far, about 2 hours in. not the most ''woah'' regarding grapichs by any means, but they work just fine for what it is.  20 euros for the complete edition is a good deal for any warhammer fans. pick up the complete thing on sale, not worth going in and buying dlc seperate. 

Really like that the option menu explains what each option do and how it effects the game. Lot more games should do that.

[h1] 30 Ish hours in [/h1]

This game keeps giving, a must game, for 40k fans. But can't say for sure that i would stay as invested in this game if i wasn't into the lore of the 40k verse. Will keep playing for many hours beyond this, that's for sure.

Void crusade missions just failing cause of dropped connection which then makes that mission permanently gone, players becoming invisible to AI or even getting stuck in-place until they are downed, and many other connection issues really hurts this game, and with the severe lack of players I can even find anymore who want to play, seems like my time is better spent on some other game. Devs planned on releasing a new character class, but that was close to a year ago now, and still no ETA on when that will be, so I recommend playing this solo if you really do want to try this out, as how little active players are left and how bad playing co-op always ends up being, its not worth the hassle.

I'm a 40k nerd and I think this is definitely one of the better non-strategy games set in the universe. You get to unravel mysteries based across an entire sector related to demonic influence, alien infiltration and ancient secrets. You get to make moral choices about how to combat alien and demonic threats. The combat is simple enough but different weapons give different abilities which keep it interesting imo. They seem to keep adding content which is great and the more recent reviews are more positive than the overall ones which suggests the game has gotten better. Perhaps the launch was bad (I don't know, I didn't play it then) but it seems very good now.

I love the various stories and investigations but I'm not much of a multiplayer so can't speak on that.

Love it - Its more like the Ascent than Diablo. 
This is a lootershooter with melee. 

If you are familiar with any warhammer lore you will undoutably enjoy this game. The lighting and the look all match the feel. 
It is extremely satisfying to kill monsters in this game so far. Each weapon has its own skill set - Each gear you equip has a rarity level, with random stat buffs. This makes it fun to try out different weapons and gear, finding out your own synergy as you go. There are passive skill trees for you to invest points in, and gear to be upgraded or dismantled for crafting reagents. 

You get to pick what kind of mission you want to do and how hard it is before the start. You get a world map with different star systems, within the systems are planets, each planet has its own feel and quests with verying difficulty levels. 

I got it on sale and it was well worth the cost. This is a good game for someone with not a lot of time but a desire to kill people while listening to music. 

I think its good

This is one of my favorite ARPGs, the others on that list being Titan Quest and Grim Dawn.  Could it have stood on its own merits without the famous IP?  Maybe, but it would be a bit bland.  The weapons, movement system, skill trees, upgrade systems, game modes and other elements are straight-up modern ARPG fare.  Nothing surprising or terribly innovative, but also nothing poorly executed.  It's workmanlike and competent, with just the right percentage of Skinner box dialed in to keep the dopamine flowing.  No complaints, but also no great praise.

What elevates the game to my favorites list is the way the developers have implemented the Warhammer 40K lore.  If you're a tabletop player, there is no doubt what you're looking at when you see an enemy on the field.  Clearly they were all modeled in loving detail by fans of the franchise, and the sound effects are up to snuff as well.  The first time I heard an Eldar Howling Banshee... well, howl... I laughed in delight.  It's like seeing and hearing those models I laboriously painted for so many decades come to life.  The various tile sets which are used to construct the procedurally-generated levels are appropriately dark and astonishingly detailed, with tiny little touches everywhere that bring the levels to life.  The weapon selection is broad and varied, with effects that are meaty and interesting, from the thrum of lasguns to the pounding bass staccato of a heavy bolter.  The voice acting is mostly superb, with only a few sub-standard efforts.  The audio-visual elements all come together to create a convincing environment for the 40K fan.  I've nothing but praise for the art direction of the game.

What truly delights me, however, is the writing.  PSA: This is where the 40K nerdism starts, so you can leave now if that's not your thing.  The review is effectively over; this is just me being an old man and grumbling about the kids on my lawn.  If it is your thing, then welcome!  Pour yourself a couple fingers of bourbon and pull up a chair.  

I am a bit of a purist when it comes to the Warhammer franchises, both fantasy and 40K.   I've been playing both since they debuted in the 1980s and have a deep love for and understanding of the lore.  Pretty much anything within the Warhammer IP is a guaranteed purchase for me, even if it's sub-par when measured by other standards.  (Except Age of Suckmar; I absolutely refuse to participate in that shameful travesty.)  I've read quite a few of the novels, including the works of Dan Abnett and William King, widely acknowledged as the two best writers for the Black Library.  And that's where the problem lies for me.  

You see, as much as I liked and enjoyed their books, I felt that they pushed the 40K world toward a more friendly, egalitarian appearance with which modern readers can identify.  I have little doubt that was forced by editors rather than the authors in order to increase sales volume, but it still bugs me.  Because the 40K universe is NOT egalitarian, not even the tiniest little bit.  It is, in fact, the polar opposite of modern Western society.  It is brutal, medieval and unforgiving.  It is a grinding, meaningless existence in which human life has no inherent value, where a person can die suddenly and horribly for absolutely no reason at all, where your very soul can be consumed by forces beyond your comprehension.  It is the Holy Roman Empire during the 30 Years War mashed up into a Lovecraftian cosmic horror story, with the Spanish Inquisition thrown in to lighten things up a bit.  In short, it is not a place or time that anyone in their right mind would choose to exist.  The writing in Inquisitor: Martyr reflects this very accurately.  Most of the briefing text shows a casual disregard for life that is at once campy and terrifying.  Lines such as ""refusal of the pre-mortem honours"" will make you chuckle... until you realize it's talking about the attempted cold-blooded murder of an entire infantry company by their own forces for no more reason than a vague suspicion on the part of some cloistered and corrupt bureaucrat.  

This is real 40K, not the soft-peddled version we've seen gradually creeping into the IP over the last decade or so.  The setting is one of casual brutality, senseless violence, and horrifying religious fanaticism, of murder as the go-to answer to every question, of bigotry and blind hatred for anything different than oneself... and it is gloriously well executed.  The Emperor protects... until he doesn't.  Upon that blasphemy I leave you, gentlefolk.",1650657032,1650657032,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,1,True,False,False

1. Crusader (normal ""fighter"")
2. Assassin (physical damage glass cannon)
3. Psyker (spell casting glass cannon)
4. Mechanicus (pet class - DLC)

Single player experience: the story is fine, but not engrossing. It is a classic ""big grind"" to level 100. If this is your thing then I would recommend different games, both ARPG and normal RPG for a better single player experience.

Multiplayer experience: this was what I wanted from this game. There were a couple of bugs that regularly frustrate my friends and I:
1. When attempting to start a coop mission, the game attempts to ""find a server"". Some missions ""find a server"" fine. Other missions ""failed to join match"" once or twice and then load fine. Other times, the you always encounter ""failed to join match"". The work around for normal missions is to try a different mission until it loads, but when you do other game modes, like Void Crusade, if the mission doesnt load then it locks us out of the missions permanently: when all branches fail to load this time, we have to abandon the entire crusade.
2. When not the party leader, other players run a chance of encountering a ""suppression bug"" where your character is permanently immobilised until they are killed and resurrected. This seems to happen frequently for the psyker class especially when you run high Warp Burn.
3. Both of these bugs can stop play for extended periods of time, which is very jarring for such a fast paced game. The only ""control"" you have is to communicate this to the game designers, but their bug reporting functionality does not recognise your user account so you cant report bugs.

These frequency and severity of these bugs in coop play is making the game experience terrible. The game play loop is fine and is enhanced to good with friends, but the scales are tipping the other way the more my friends and I encounter these bugs. As a last ditch attempt, I may have to start a new class (not psyker) to reduce the impact of one of these bugs.

Until these bugs are fixed, I can not recommend anyone play this game with the intention of playing with friends. If you want to play solo, then this game is fine.",1649619809,1649619809,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In particular one guy had a ping pong table with an entire 3D map built up, and countless models he had meticulously painted for the purposes of a game he never really played. After nagging me at some length I finally agreed to play the tabletop version of the game and despite my background with many TTRPGs I found it utterly tedious. It seemed like you spent more time with a measuring tape working out weapons range and AoE than anything else.

Over the years I've looked at various games in the WH40K universe and just never bought in. Some part of me was always interested, but with all the lore and background I simply wasn't caught up on it felt a bit overwhelming to dive into such a well established universe rather late in the game.

I saw that there was a bundle of Inquisitor - Martyr and Prophecy on sale and decided I would dip my toe into this popular franchise, and I couldn't be happier I did.

This game is a fucking blast! I say that as someone who doesn't get genuinely excited by very much at my age. While playing one level I almost woke up my partner when I spontaneously jumped up shouting delighted exposition upon slaying some enormous monster at the end of a Purge mission. The non stop shooting, chopping, gore-splattered mayhem in this game keeps you furiously clicking at an almost exhausting pace. I haven't had this much fun playing a video game since before the century rolled over.

I've seen complaints that this game is too grindy, and honestly that's part of the appeal for me. Every little upgrade, object, pile of currency and new bonus you gain feels like a real accomplishment. You can almost smell the burnt chunks of meat flying around as you charge through hoards of unspeakable horrors, reducing scores of Chaos beasts to a fine mist with every mighty swing of your chainsword. With each tiny step of advancement you feel newly emboldened to wade deeper into the carnage, obliterating the unclean from your path and increasing your might with every step. I feel this game will consume more hours than I care to admit, on the level of my favourite open world franchises like Fallout and Elder Scrolls. I'm not usually big on these point-and-click slashfest games, but this one has sucked me in deep.

If you like carnage, relentless action, and a veritable monsoon of loot to sort through as you slowly build the mightiest Inquisitor in the galaxy, this game will definitely appeal to you. It isn't grindy, as the critics complain, it is the essence of grind itself, and that's pretty damn awesome. 

Don your armour, pick out your death dealing tool of choice, and charge into the armies of Chaos.

PROS (in no specific order)
Graphics are good. Gameplay is solid for the most part with a lot of options for different playstyles.
The game can be challagning sometimes but it is definetly not necesary to min-max.
Theres a ton of content with generated missions and yes its repetitive but it does not feel like work its a sci-fi hack'n'slash and totally represents the 40k universe. no more no less.
CONS (in no specific order)
crashes do exist, i.e. I had one crash after like 6hrs being in-game.
For the first couple of hours the game seems very convoluted (note: I started with the stand alone dlc ""prophecy"". The base game has a much better entry)
The biggest Con for me is the ""prophecy"" dlc.
while the campaign is pretty good the tech adept class is def not worth it.
CONCLUSION
Buy it when on sale if you are a 40k fan you should get some fun out of it.

You don't gain active skill points on leveling, just access to small passive buffs to pick from and you can buy resets from early on anyway so there's no real impact to even those small choices. You can unlock perks to get bigger buffs but I didn't feel had much impact on playstyle/performance.
Even the ""morality"" system where you're supposed to have to make choices is shallow and of little consequence as it's only a binary choice unlocking perks as you increase your leaning one way or the other, they didn't even think to have an immediate consequence such as having to deal with each choice offering different one-off-items.
Then the equipment is underwhelming also so you don't feel any significant gain to a particularly rare drop.

A little context: I bought this game and the prophecy dlc for 75% off a little after finishing and greatly enjoying my playthrough of WH40K:Mechanicus. I adore the 40k setting and atmosphere (admech especially). I also enjoy a bit of grind in my games. I enjoyed diablo 3 and POE in around equal measure, the former for its atmosphere and the latter for its gameplay. This review will be focused entirely on Martyr and not on the prophesy expansion.

All that to say looking at reviews I assumed I would get a lot out of this game. Nope.

Gameplay:
Shockingly bland. At least up to the point where I was in the story, all player skills are determined by their weapons (as in, specific weapon types have a set skillset and there is no variability) and there is no way to modify said skills like in other AARPG's. Which could be fine on its own (lost ark gets away with a pretty bland skill upgrade tree just fine) if the skills were individually interesting. Which they are not. Nothing like looting a cool looking pair of laspistols only for that weapons skillset to involve: [shoot laser], [shoot laser faster for less dps(?!)], [aimed laser], [beam laser]. Sweet Jeebus give me something to work with people.

OK, if there aren't any skill upgrade trees are there at least character upgrade trees? Sure! But they're entirely passives, and super bland stat-stick ones at that. Ooh, I have four skill points, time to upgrade my crit damage stat by 8%. That's not to say there aren't SOME interesting upgrades, especially for the DLC-only tech adept, but they are extremely far and few between.

Atmosphere:
Ah, the bread and butter of any 40K game. If only it existed here. That's not to say there aren't the staples. There are chaos marines and xenos roaming the halls of derelict space-ship-monasteries after all, but beyond even the most surface level there's just nothing. I'm not the most well-versed in 40k lore but even I know that the half-dozen guardsmen I'm put in charge of shouldn't be making it past the FIRST plague marine we run up against, much less the tenth. I've only played the assassin class in the main story so I can't speak for the writing of the other characters, but for someone who picked up a random, likely guardsman weapon she found on a ship crawling with the worst beasties the universe has to offer she is written to be really, and I mean suspension of disbelief breakingly, REALLY cocky. Which would be fine if she was running around in power armor or was an admech dominus packed to the gills in heavy weaponry, but she isn't. 

Also, a little pet peeve: good lord the voice acting. Like, the va's themselves may individually be very good for all I know but they are clearly lacking direction. Everybody has their own way to pronounce everything from astartes to heretic (with some characters changing pronunciation from sentence to sentence) and half of them are trying to go grim dark while the other half are trying to be badasses in call of duty.",1649264588,1649264847,False,43,4,0.692015290260314941,1,True,False,False

'We're not in Imperial space anymore' he says with a grim tone.

After having tracked down the long forgotten Monastery ship ""Martyr"", you quickly begin to realize that this isn't the same Warhammer 40k that you've come to know. Since WH40k Space Marine, there has been a void, a void which eager cash-grabbing zealots have been frothing to fill. Eternal Crusade sought to fill that void, but left us with more questions than answers...and eventually took everything from us.

Martyr seeks to redeem the franchise after so many ""developers"" have set out to make a masterpiece only to end up making a mockery of the franchise. It's almost as if they intended to do so. By rehashing the same mechanics and game-play like literally every other developer who even so much as looked at this IP has done, we humble space marines, whose only wish is to serve the Emperor and die in glorious battle against the heretics of the Imperium, have begun to give up hope that a WH40K title worthy of the Emperors glory would one day appear.

THIS is that title.

Martyr is a top-down-ish, bloody ARPG in which you take the role of an Inquisitor tasked with discovering the truth about what happened to the Monastery ship ""Martyr"" and routing forces of Chaos from Imperial space.

Dynamic objectives and procedurally generated dungeons/spawn points keep things fresh as you descend the depths of chaos infested maps (alone or with friends) and a deep progression system along with plenty of gear is sure to keep you occupied to the wee hours of the night...or morning.

This isn't your bruncles WH40k...this is WH40k Martyr and it is worth every last penny if you like ARPG's and WH40k.

Buy it now or suffer the Emperors wrath! *Get the complete edition.

Addendum: After the total catastrophe/scam that was Eternal Crusade, believe me when I tell you that I wouldn't have played this even if it was free, wasted my time writing this review, or even recommend it if I didn't truly feel it was worth it and that you'd enjoy it.

It does seem to have far worse graphics than other games that came out before it though, which is odd considering this game was released in 2018. Torchlight and Van Helsing both had far better graphics and were released years before this on small budgets.

The season system functions a lot like Diablo 3's Seasons, and neither is very good. They could both learn a lot from Path of Exile's League system. A season mechanic where you get a chance of chain lightning on attack is just mind numbingly boring.

Gameplay isn't very smooth either, using a clunky mishmash of click-to-move and WASD to move. I rebound it to WASD cause arrow keys are just a completely outdated choice, devs need to get with the times. The cover mechanic feels downright useless, and constantly places cover markers on my screen. I'm in no way incentivized to take cover when dodging stuff is just so much easier and safer (You still take damage when in cover). I don't know how players feel about this, but I think tying skills to gear isn't really a good choice. I found myself passing up a lot of good gear because they had undesirable skills attached to them, and opted for any equipment that gave me more skill slots.

From a lore perspective, it seems like every nobody in this galaxy is just able to dunk on my Inquisitor, which just feels weird. Inquisitors are supposed to be feared and respected by everybody, and sit higher on the totem pole than most members of the Imperium. I did like that they paired you with a Rogue Trader though, kinda shows the standing that Rogue Traders have within the Imperium. The Inquisitor's dialogue in the opening cinematic was this brooding badass, whereas the guy you get in-game in overly quirky and chatty. Kinda killed my immersion hearing him speak sometimes.

Pros
Gets 40K atmosphere, it's grim, it's nasty. Hell, I reckon it's the best representative of 40K we've got so far.

Cons
Dull. Yes ARPGs are grindy, but in order to keep you playing they need to also be enjoyable and this isn't.
Broken Skills. Several skills remain broken since pre-launch, rendering some builds useless and some builds godly IMBA.
Bugs and Glitches. Yup these are in here too. Even something so basic as description for skills and buffs are just placeholders.

Visually appealing, especially if you're a fan of the 40k universe.
Lots of content, I think/assume that I haven't even scratched the end-game(I'm level 80) and to compare to a campaign like Diablo 3 you definitely get your moneys worth here but if I compare it to Path of Exile it's not as good a look and that's an important distinction because PoE is literally free.
Occasionally great voice acting, mostly above-average, occasionally laughably bad. Perfection.
High replay value, 4 classes with lots of builds (whether or not they're viable is another matter, I haven't played enough to know).
Moral choices in an ARPG with a corresponding talent tree.
Probably more things that are praise-worthy but i'm here to rant sorry

Cons/Anecdotal ramblings:
Sometimes enemies get bonuses that make them immune to most forms of damage, which has happened at least once per day and results in a wasted Void Crusade, Intel Mission or weekly faction mission, all of which are tied to a finite or time-gated resource.  I'm aware that this is due to them gaining two stacking armour bonuses and you can actually kill the enemies with specific weapons armour breaking abilities but the only one of these I've ever seen has been single-target with a long cooldown and my preferred weapon doesn't have one of these abilities at all.  You can find threads asking about this issue going back years.  Again, I'm aware there exists within the game a way to counter this absurd bonus to enemies, but at a certain point you have to ask yourself if you're having fun.  It's incredibly disheartening to spend 45 minutes working through a hardcore void crusade just to have this bonus pop up and ruin the run, I've had it happen three times consecutively.

Apparently picking Assassin was a bad move because after spending 15 minutes rebinding keys in a way that makes no actual sense just so that my dodge key wasn't overriding my movement keys I realised pretty quick that when you roll/dodge there is a random chance (It's higher than I'd like to admit, or i'm incredibly unlucky) that your character will just clip into the environment which results in an instantly failed mission and waste of aforementioned finite resource.
It is possible to pick a passive talent that removes the dodge key from use and replaces it with a passive bonus but that's nothing more than a comically large band-aid at best and I sincerely hope that wasn't the intended fix.

Anything else is minor enough that I don't care or haven't noticed, as a fan of ARPGs and 40k.  Unfortunately the two problems above have a tendency to make the game instantly unplayable, as if it's in an alpha/beta state and probably shouldn't have paid DLCs or cost anywhere near as much as it does in general.

Not an exclusively bad time if you get it on sale but no matter what kind of player you are it is seemingly an absolute guarantee that you will encounter at least one of the two problems that I have.

Update: Stacking armour buff patched, if they can fix the Assassin dodge clipping through the environment and resulting in instant death I will absolutely change this to a positive review.
If you have no interest in the Assassin class, you could be in for a great time with this game as it stands.",1641207748,1648733487,False,9,1,0.611095964908599854,2,True,False,False

 Graphics are OK.

There are still improvements to be made, but the developers turned this game in a good direction. I look forward to replaying this game each season, and I usually dump from 60 to 100 hours each time. 

There's quite a lot of build diversity. Recently, minion builds have gotten buffed, so if that's your thing, you can play that. You can play as a sword and shield crusader or equip it with a flamethrower to give a little roast in the name of the Emperor. Maybe a tech priest with a poisonous auto rifle that hits enemies and then spreads to it's counterparts? The game has a total of four classes.

This game will immerse you in the Warhammer 40K universe like no other, with its immersive atmosphere and details. Parts of the structures can be demolished, like pillars in ships, etc. The soundtrack will pull you in when you eradicate Xenos and heretics from hive cities or infested space ships. Check out the song ""The Landing Site.""

The world in this game feels kind of big since you can pick and choose where you want to do your missions. A good variety of mobs. You can face off against Plague Marines and demons who serve Khorne, Dark Eldar, Void Bearers, and traitor scum imperial guards. Also, there's more variety in Void Crusades.

Endgame is focused on Intel missions, which can be found in regular play through or random missions, but they lack variety and mostly happen in the same planet system. I think it needs more variety. The Void Crusades are a collection of missions that have to be completed to reach a certain endpoint. Endgame needs more support.

Itemization is somewhat deterministic and, at the same time, random; you can choose what affixes you want to re-roll and their values. It's quite expensive to do so, and you have to collect every item that drops and sell it. Fortunately, the developers didn't hold back on the feel the weight meme and let you enable auto loot, which doesn't disrupt your game play flow and allows you to focus solely on action-eradicating Xeno scum.There are some other items that have perks based on your religious stance and can provide chace items.

DLC's can be bought by Fate that accumulates doing missions, so there's no reason to spend your money. The game also offers some cosmetic items for you to collect, like - footprints, some pets, and decorations. At the same time, I don't believe DLCs play a significant role because the rewards are lacking.

This game is great if you are a Warhammer 40k Universe fan and you like action RPG games. I don't know how it would play for a general aRPG enthusiast, but I think it's still worth checking out. 

Season 4 is on the way, and the future will bring us a 5th class-Sister of Battle.

- Extremely similar to Diablo 3 in style (loot farming, random map generation, socketing, specific classes with customisation through skills and weapons, seasonal character options).
- Reasonably good campaign. Story seems ok, if you're into that sort of stuff.
- Mission generation on random maps.
- Level scaling, with heaps of options to increase difficulty.
- Disparity between characters (some are definitely OP.....Tech Priest?).
- The DLC is not bad, but it's still DLC.
- Pretty maps.
- Quite a deep tech tree for each class and sub-class to consider. Can be challenging to get your head around.......and then suffers a bit from ""cookie cutter"" outcomes.
- Some classes get a few weapon options, and some get everything. Good and bad?
- Crafting available. Not terrible....maybe a bit more useful than Diablo 3 when you're levelling and also early end-game.
- Not much in the end game area, outside of DLC. ""Void Crusade"" is a good attempt at providing campaign-level content at end game.

-I really like this game.  It's a diablo style/twin-stick action rpg that focuses (a little bit) on more strategic fighting.  The character graphics are nice, but could be better.  The environments are gorgeous, but might/probably/maybe get repetitive.  And the last of the bad, there aren't enough different weapon/armor types for a DS/TS ARPG this long and involved.
-Now the good.  Combat is fun.  Co-op has worked perfectly every time without bugs. I haven't seen any bugs at all.  It runs smooth, and the class variety is pretty extensive (but gender-locked probably due to lore).  Also, the leveling gives you a lot of options.  You open up new skill trees based on accomplishments.  There are random level generations as well as a focused story that is coherent and enjoyable (a rarity for these games anymore).  There is always new stuff.  They add new seasons, new campaigns, and things I don't know about because I haven't maxed a character yet, but it looks enticing from the mission screens.
-Also there's an entire expansion/standalone sequel (that I haven't played yet) with even more content.  Wait for a sale for the combo.
-TL;DR: Pudding is good, yogurt is the stuff of xenos scum.  Always choose pudding.

Oh, and buy the game.  It gets discounted regularly, and I think it's worth full price to people who like this genre or are fans of 40k.  Even if you don't know 40k from the rock you've lived under for the last few decades, you can follow the story going in blind.

WH40k universe? Hack´n slay? ARPG? 
What more could you wish for?

The main story is very entertaining. I would go so far to say - it´s surprisingly unusual for the WH40k universe, but definitely in a good way. I don´t want to go in detail. Besides the main story, the game offers a variety of other missions and tasks like void crusades and many others. 

Also the ""Prophecy"" extension and some of the DLCs are worth to purchase. In my opinion ""Maelstrom of carnage"" is the most important one, giving you the opportunity to collect good equipment quite quickly.  
It´s much fun to try out new skills and items for your character. There are lots of approaches and possibilities for your character design, to be able to deal with the challanges. Watch some videos of the great community to get inspiration.

To the developers: I would pay another 2,99€ for a DLC that shuts up Caius Thorn during the missions. Can´t stand these theatrical speeches anymore. Think about it ;)",1645494012,1645494040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have a large amount of customization in difficulty which is cool. Interesting story line. I'm a 40k fan, so this is up my alley buttttttttt.... the missions all pretty much blend together. The biomes are all just different shades of grey - I get it, 40k atmosphere is grimdark, but still would be nice to feel like you're just not in the same corridor or blasted landscape every time.

I got it with all dlcs for cheap in a humble bundle back then though. Not sure if I would want to spend 80€ on everything.

There is a plethora of different enemies and maps. From confined corridors of a space hulk to ruin filled battlefields metal walkways over a deep abyss to open dessert planet (filled with tyranids usually ^^) From rebel guardsmen to nurgle demons to different chaos warbands, dark eldar to tyranids. (likely dlc dependent though)

You can customize basically everything to your playstyle. It starts with your ""health potion"" that you can add more types of healing from regen to instant to temporary to “vampiric” ... different buffs from dmg to crit to cool down bonuses and a lot of base stuff that affects reuse times and amounts of uses per level. Up to your skills that you can usually slot stuff into like runes or even equip your summons with weapons (mostly adeptus mechanicus' little toasters ^^) There are modifiers to missions that give enemies boni and make your life harder for more rewards.

You can set difficulty on a per mission basis. It just sets the enemies level which scales their defensive and offensive capabilities and works quite nice.

There are multiple passive skill trees unlocked by heroic deeds (use health potion x times, kill x elites, do x fire damage ...) to squeeze the optimum out of your character.

A lot of the items you will find are trash and it seems to be fully random. So you just sell most of the stuff. But every credit is needed later once you have unlocked the multiple crafting techs. From reroll a value on an effect on an item to reroll all effects on an item to craft an item, craft ""gems"" and ""runes"" to put in a socket... everything is there.

You have a nice selection of classes from admech which has nice summons and dot possibilities, psyker = nuker, crusader if you want to wield a large gun or large melee weapon or generally love heavy armor to assassin if you are the rouge type.

The weakest point for me is the story which, if you know the universe, is quite expected. There is a number of clues hidden in levels from blood written ramblings of a madman on his descent to chaos to entries of a techie in data slates which are quite fun but most of the time in the main story I had the feeling it was just dragging me through the sector on a sightseeing tour.

Another weak point is that mooks are almost ignorable. It does not matter if you have 10 different enemy types for mooks if they all barely scratch you. If it is a melta, plasma or lasgun makes almost no difference when the fire comes from a rebel guardsman. Only once you meet an elite of those it becomes interesting.
Another thing I like is the suppression system. You have a 2nd ""healthbar"" if this goes below certain thresholds you become susceptible to knockbacks stuns and knockdowns and also reduce in movement speed and other stats. A knockdown is a good chance to die because lying flat on the floor unable to do anything for a few seconds is hell ^^

You can mitigate this with clever use of the cover system ... which I do not (mostly because the cover is destructible and the use of AOEs turns everything into rubble ^^)

After the story there is a lot to do from crusades to story packs to random missions.

There is also a morality system which influences some passive boni and weapon boni and unlocks 2 skill trees. This is mostly decided by story decisions. 

There are a few annoying things that keep the game from being an awesome one:
When entering a scripted scene your char is in 90% of it just walked up to the boss no matter what state you are in or if you even want to trigger that encounter. This is especially cruel for a summon focused tech adept as he is super squishy, in front of the hard boss and his summons still standing where they where before the cutscene when combat starts. More than once I just died to the first strike then, before I could get back into safety behind my hordes. It is less of an issue on the more sturdy or even melee chars. 

The other is hard to see movement blockers. Like a single book of a large bookpile lying a bit to the side one could easily step over but it is as blocking as the rest of the pile, or ""chests?"" in the same color/texture as the floor that are hard to see. 
I usually play on harder difficulties and being stuck on something like this when trying to evade an attack or warp peril is a death sentence ^^

Similarly wonky are the missions where you drive a tank etc. they are nice to breack the slog but are super wonky. For no reason you get the level up popup more than 10 times in those missions. The controls are meh often locking your movement to the last pressed key when firing. (this bug? persisted for years))

Generally you need a certain tolerance to bugs, flickering or transparent graphics and sometimes bugged controls.

Still I would recommend it, it scratches the arpg itch well.

I cam back to this game after some time, and am pleased to see that the game has seen many overhauls that dealt with most of my previous concerns. There has been much polishing and expanding on the existing systems - most significantly to me was that the whole power rating system has been replaced with just levels, which is far simpler to understand and manage. On top of that there's been a lot of new content and mechanics which give the game a fair bit of variability. Plus there's been a whole story expansion and a new class, which I've been having a lot of fun with. 

I'm looking forward to what comes next for this game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game has a lot going for it, about until you finish the main campaign. By then you realise the enormous grind ahead of you before you'll be able to even start the Dark Eldar campaign. If you make it through that, then you'll make it halfway through it before, suddenly, you need to grind again because you're Power Rating is way too low. 

Personally the game feels like it shouldn't have left beta yet. There's a lot of features that just haven't been implemented yet. For example, there is an entire skill tree for Executions, and a command key to perform executions - which does nothing. It currently isn't possible to manually trigger an execution.  The 'controllable vehicles' aspect is completely limited to a handful of campaign only missions, and then never seen again.

The most annoying aspect for me is that it requires constant connection to the internet - not a big problem by itself, but should your connection get disrupted and fail to reconnect within 10 or so seconds you get booted from the game. No mission progress/loot saved. Even if you're playing solo. This has happened far too often for me.

A very big point in favour of this game though is that it gets the atmosphere of the Warhammer 40K universe just right.

Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this game - yet. I feel this game has a lot of potential, but has a lot of unfinished content to get through and some loot balancing issues to consider.",1542835866,1643869282,True,0,0,0.52403724193572998,0,True,False,False

I've enjoyed playing all three of 'The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing' games, including the Final Cut compilation by NeoCore Games, so when I saw they were releasing an ARPG based in the Warhammer 40K universe I was sold.

The game had it's pitfalls at the start, but with the subsequent patches, DLCs, and expansion it has become a solid game with a nice campaign storyline along with Seasons play as some of the bigger ARPG names have done.  It allows for replayability of your favorite character build or to try something completely different with one of the 4 current classes (3 specialties each) and another class coming in Q2 2022 by current accounts.

In the far, distant future of mankind amongst the stars. there are hundreds of thousands of worlds and tens of thousands wars.   Under the gaze and by the protection of The Holy Emperor, you vanquish the countless hordes of traitors, heretics, xenos, and Chaos threats with your thriced-blessed weapons of war and armor.  As an Inquisitor of the Holy Ordos, you are the judge, jury, and executioner for the Imperium of Man and sanctioned by the Emperor himself.

I'm beyond frustrated and the only thing that the discord folks could tell me is that it was my fault...I'm struck by the thought of the game missing files I cannot download because steam will not download them that somehow it's my fault that the game is broken and won't let me play it. I even told the crew what it says of the files that are missing and nothing.

The scale and detail of the map art really adds to the wow factor making this game one of the best constructed 40K worlds we've seen in a while.

The crafting system leaves very much wanting because it is convoluted, difficult to learn, and often not worth the headache when it cranks out gear that has worse stats than what you've already picked up. Plus you have to further spend a lot of extra credits to improve gear. However, since there is no shortage of loot in missions, and ways to increase the amount and quality of loot drops, there is no shortage of stuff to bulk sell for credits, it just means it is a huge grind to get to the good stuff.

The stories in each campaign, both main and DLC extras, are richly written, well thought out, and not too short like is often found in similar games. There is plenty of extra to do besides the main quest lines, including bonus challenge missions found from picking up random Intel drops, challenging Void Campaigns that reap incredible rewards, and daily Priority Missions that usually have some level of challenge to reward the player with descent loot.

Overall, this is one of the most fun 40K games I have played in a while, and I have played every 40K title worth playing since the original DOW.

Having grown bored with Diablo III I thought I would give the Warhammer Inquistor Games a shot.  So far I am really blown away by the story depth, interface/gameplay polish and overall fun of this game.

Voice acting is great.  Graphics are great.  Game Modes and missions are diverse and enjoyable.  I can't comment too much on the music as I usually turn it off and listen to my own playlists on my Amazon Echo while I play.

I am not a huge fan of the Warhammer universe but this game may change that.

Seriously, nothing dies normally. They explode into paste even if you just sniped them.

You can only play inquisitors (duh) but there's a decent selection of weapons, perks and skills to customise how you play.

Storyline missions are well done, repeatable random missions and ""tarot card"" mutators are there for extra challenge/reward.
Substantial seasonal and online event content gets dropped regularly now.

Nitpicks:
 - Some weapons are not balanced well, this is a constant point of review by the developers.
 - Some of the more commonly seen types of inquisitors (like the ones you encounter as NPCs in the campaign) aren't playable.
 - Some basic playstyles require a ludicrous learning curve and specific perks just to get workable, others barely require more than the LMB.
 - Enemy types could be more varied.

Pros: End-game mechanics are very well done. Gear is extremely configurable, you have the possibility of creating the ideal items for you, once you get a good power on an item. There are a lot of ways to hunt gear, random missions, void crusades, packs from the shop with ingame currency. Each character has a decent variation of builds that can clear endgame. Campaign is really good, dialogues are great. Each class has a very distinct personality, both in terms of dialogue and in gameplay.
Cons: Some mechanics are a bit hidden and can cause some frustrations: in my case, I did not realize that once you get to the level-up point for a tarot card, you won't get any more points for it and in this way you can focus farming a single card. Extended the season grind to way more than it should have been. The mission audio is janky at best. Killstreak sounds will play over other sounds, and the overall audio quality of the missions is quite bad. There are some small freezes when season 4 special elites spawn or when the Empyrean effects are triggered. Mission loading times are the mind killer.

Having spent many hours on Diablo over the years,  i wanted a solid Arpg that relates more to the sci-fi, guns, auto rifles, snipers etc kind of theme.  Warhammer 40k Inquisitor - Matyr has made a good to honest attempt at that in my view. 
There is a wide range of guns, armour etc. There is also scope for the more magic orientated builds, however i hav'nt really touched these yet.  I wanted a game that provides deep customisation, crafting,  linked to a randomised loot mechanic and this fits it perfectly.  Its also very solid in terms of gunplay. 
The skills system seems nice and complex providing great scope for customisation and theory crafting.  There has been some criticism of the skills system in that when you skill up,  you can sometimes go in to a mission and it feels meaningless, due to particular enemies etc.  As far as i can see you can research what type of enemies you are about to face in the pre-mission briefing,  and build setup accordingly.  What the developers will need to do however is make this process easier, such as providing a build profile saver etc.  
I would say also that this game is somewhat slower paced than Diablo 3 (for example). I find this a pleasing change from the smash and grab pace of other such games. 
 
There seems to be a lot of content here,  and a constant stream of it coming, in terms of world events,  and we will need to wait and see how good Neocore are at sticking to this.  They do however have a good track record at post release support. 
Aside from the credits system, there are other mechanisms / resources / valuable commodities that require to be earned through gameplay, that i dont really understand at this early stage.  I will try to update in due course ......
So far this is a good solid start to exactly the kind of ARPG i was looking for.




** Update  -- 11.10.19.  

I came back lately to 2.0.  Pleased with what i see so far.  Many sensible and good improvements have been made.  
I'm pleased with the endgame content.  There is a lot to do, whether it be warzone, special missions, priority missions. There is a new  shard mission structure thing which is excellent  and like a kind of mini campaign that you can repeat  It creates some great anticipation as you build towards opening the chests in the finale. 
 What i really like though is the risk / reward concept that is being rolled in to mission building.  You select missions then can add certain modifiers that make it harder.  If you complete then happy days for loot.  But fail your objectives then you feel like you've messed up.   I really like this risk / reward concept,  it encourages you to push yourself.   I play a lot of Diablo 3 and still like it,  but often when i'm playing i can't think of many times when i worry about not completing something ...   i.e  its a case of play,  complete bounty /  rift,  get loot,  whereas Warhammer 40K inquisitor you go into missions sometimes wondering if you've pushed the modifiers / tarot cards too far this time.  Great tension,  but as i say you feel happy with yourself if you complete and get the loot. 
The crafting / modifying gear system has been completely revamped and is very detailed and intricate.  You can really tweak and build something relevant to you. 

I will likely purchase Prophecy also if it goes on sale, or indeed i will wait for the Steam sale and hope it is discounted.  

Good job Neocore,  keep up the good work.



8.11.20 -

I just keep coming back to this game.  Over 300 hours between Martyr and Prophecy  (for some reason Steam separates the playtime depending on which game you launch, but its the same game whichever you launch into).
Generally i come back to this much more than Diablo 3 i find.   
Good job by Neocore in supporting the game post launch and keeping the updates / content coming. 
I still think the mission building dynamic -  risk / reward structure that i mentioned above,  is the best I've seen in a looter game ever.  Its very well implemented.   
The grind in this game is looooong ....   some may not like that.   I'm ok with it. 
I hope Neocore still release content / Seasons even though they are now developing a new game.  They seem to have a good track record of supporting games after release.

---

update 23.1.22.
400+ hours in to Martyr now. Still coming back. Just a great game. Excellent loot, great build variety, excellent end game. Genre leading risk / reward mission building as described in my earlier posts. 
And ...   we have continued patches / major updates still being released. We have a new class coming in 2022 also !   
Awesome job by Neocore, and an example of how to support a game after release  (take note EA, who after the Anthem release shambles, briefly looked like they were going to try and fix Anthem (Anthem 2.0) and then decided to drop it like a stone and run away).",1530022517,1642939334,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Difficulty ?
	Easy; This is an easy ARPG. I would rate it easier than both POE and Grim Dawn. Maybe on par with D3..I don’t know, haven't played D3 for many years, I could be wrong

End game?
	End game system is pretty nice. Comes in form of seasonal challenges and  2 unique game modes - Void crusade and War Zone. Both are like miniseries of missions with better than average rewards. 

Creating your own gear?
	Yes, crafting exist in the game. You can make your own items, provided you have a blueprint for them. *blueprints are consumables that has limited charges.   Not only you can craft your gear, you can also socketing them so gems and runes can be put into the sockets (they are not called gems or runes in game) And yes, there are runewords you can play around with, just like D2. You can reroll the enchant(affix) of your gear, like you would with Chaos orb in POE. Divine, chaos, souring all can be found under different names in this game.  TLDR - good amount of content when it comes to min/max
		
Should you buy this game?

The handling is a bit sluggish - maybe I need to up the skills on that.
Camera POV: sluggish/inertia (is that meant to simulate user FOV sluggishness?)
Player Handling: it feels like skating with 300kg, rotates like a turret

This is a hack and grindy hack and slash game, where loot matters, AND YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LOOT RANDOMLY AFTER A MISSION.

- Breakdown - 
Most fun co-op context is the Crusades. 
I played this with 2 friends. First crusade - at the final mission before the crusade loot, one friend is kicked by the server and can't participate. 

Our second crusade - our end loot got WIPED when we returned finished the missing. All the end crusade goodies - GONE. 

We thought it was a fluke, but then remembered that we had the same thing happen a day ago in an intel (special mission type) mission.

I liked the story of this game but not so much the game play. Everything just is so long and drawn out, it is just another Diablo style loot game at it's core. I liked Diablo for it's story not so much it's game play or the loot style. So personally I both like this game and dislike this game for the same reasons I did Diablo. I find the missions just drag on with hordes of enemies that I just get tired of fighting, not hard, not challenging, just the same thing over and over to get 100 epic swords that in the end seem meaningless, because they are far from rare just farmed. The player is constantly breaking them down for materials, or selling them. It is a very monotonous play, at the same time I recommend it for the story. The story is really good for warhammer 40k, you get to see much of the galaxy and how the general ""world"". The play style is very boring and a grind, the loot just seems meaningless as you are constantly swapping for hire level items, with different perks. The enemies are not challenging just boring to fight against, for instance Space Marines and Chaos Space marines are supposed to be rather rare in the world of warhammer 40k not many, yet it spawns legions of them at you.. the whole chapter of chaos marines should be done by the time you beat the game.. They should all be dead and gone is just the sheer amount the game throws at you because in games there are endless numbers of everything. Games do not convey rarity well, in story worlds. Some people like endless loot games, with hordes and hordes of enemies to fight. The only way the game tries to make it more difficult is giving massive bonus or debuffs.. and that doesn't change the core problem that makes it boring to slug threw the missions just to get to the next story plot which is the interesting bit. The story is worth seeing if you are a 40k fan. I've just recently finished the story, even if I've had the game for awhile now.. I just quit playing because the play style is so dry and boring, the end game is the same. It's basically Diablo in space with less powers.. I was never a huge fan of Diablo, I liked the story not the play style or loot games in general like Divine Divinity. They are worth seeing the story threw, but don't see myself doing the same thing over and over again for meaningless loot, as fun. I can see why I never finished the game when I bought it, nor did I want to play it again for so long because at the core it's just another boring Diablo type game. Everyone is excited to see the story, but when that's done its mostly forgotten until the next one for a reason because the play style is just not fun to drag threw for most people.

There is no better game of this type that gives the feel of sweeping through the tainted halls of ancient structures, tearing apart aliens and demons with endless machine gun fire.

There are some rough spots.  Campaign and related items (priority missions) don't have great writing.  Melee animations for some of the weapons feel clunky.  There's not much variety in character appearance.  Many of the mechanics are poorly documented.  I had to rely on guides to even approximate an ""optimal"" course to continue to develop my character in the endgame after the campaign (it's about choosing certain kinds of missions, with certain kinds of ""tarot card"" buffs that make missions harder but increase the rewards in particular ways).

The game engine has some issues that need ironing out, such as some features being experimental and others not seeming to work as they should.
The graphics are good and gritty as you would expect a 40k game to be - they have nailed that point, however you should note my above comment.

The gameplay is clunky - but you do get used to it - there is a cover system in this game I've never seen before, it kind of works - but like everything else it needs fine tuning.  Balance of difficulty is also way off, with some bosses being easier than some champion mobs, and some equipment under or over performs.

I found the story very good, but does require you to understand 40k lore otherwise it won't make much sense, so it is one for the fans.  The story did surprise me as, frankly, this is often a weak spot with these sort of games.

For me, a lot of the game needs finishing and polishing - which echos quite a few of the other reviews here, but it does feel like its in early access.

So why am I recommending this?  The potential for this game is stunning - if the developers keep working on this, the end result will be something very special, and a content roadmap has already been published by Neocore - and this shows great promise for the future.",1528664855,1641468092,True,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Warhammer 40K: Inquisitor is a dungeon crawler where you venture throughout the galaxy trying to the solve the mystery of a Heretical Ghost Ship. The game is brutal, addicting, and has endless customization but is extremely grindy a nature.

The settings range from endless deserts to desolate space stations. Firing guns leave smoke trails from the bullets, powers crush, burn, or explode enemies, and up-close can be a bloodbath as you wield melee weapons. The combat is brutal and the sheer number of enemies can be exciting as a horde charges you.

Building your character is the fun part. It can be a little overwhelming at first but anyone familiar with Diablo/Torchlight/or any dungeon crawler will catch on fast. If you like getting the best weapons, min/maxing to create the best build, and just grinding away in hopes of getting the best gear you will love this game. Also, there is endless content. I mean that literally. There is a random map generator and the developer is great at creating new events and content regularly -- including some DLC packs with new campaigns and classes. 

The story is pretty weak. Get a mission, kill everything on the level, and come back and sell loot. A string of dialogue usually ties it together but its not every riveting. As your base is on a spaceship, you can do desert mission and then a space station, and unlike traditional games of the genres there is no Acts or Chapters to give the impression of progress. I personally didn't find this enjoyable, as each mission felt like another slog to just get more loot and skill points. 

Overall, this is a fun and addicting game but is crazy grindy. However, if you just wanna slaughter hordes of enemies, you will get more than your money's worth and won't be disappointed.",1641403304,1641410002,True,8,0,0.586206912994384766,0,True,False,False

So far I'm way more impressed than I thought I'd be and I really like the overall gameplay.

The character classes are great so far. Melee is a little more high skill ceiling than gunplay, but it feels really rewarding. I love the weapons and how they directly change gameplay instead of just having different stats.

The graphics and sound are top notch and I'm happy to see so many of the 40K factions included (way more than I expected).

There's a definite learning curve (as I suppose should be expected) with regards to learning where everything is located in the menus, hud, options, etc., but once that's out of the way, the game is very feature-rich and user friendly.

One place where Inquisitor *REALLY* shines is itemization. This is especially true when compared to other popular ARPGs, the developers of which seem to go out of their way to keep you on the end-game reservation using RNG as a major time sink. In Inquisitor there are definite ways to gear your characters with very optimal best-in-slot items as long as you put in the work, and there is *significantly* less RNG involved in the process, only know-how and effort. This is facilitated using a very robust crafting/upgrading system which I absolutely love.

It should also be noted that many of the features that aid you in accomplishing this are earned during your first story play-through and then carry over to your other characters across your account. This has been very encouraging and has compelled me to play more than I thought I might. I can definitely see playing several characters since the system accommodates this very nicely, allowing you to focus on enjoying the differences in gameplay rather than just feeling like you're lagging behind due to the lack of a particular piece of perfectly rolled gear (which as I've said is attainable anyway).

First and foremost, there is a bug reporting system in-game that doesn't work at all.  So when you find a bug, there seems to be no way to report them without going out of the game and making a tedious and ultimately futile search for a place to report bugs.  I found a place to report them and never got any traction.  I was not contacted or shown in any way that anyone received the bug report.

So what bugs need reporting?

Here are a few:

Some missions can only be played 3 times per week, so when one of them glitches and makes the enemy invulnerable (all enemies that is) you have to abort the mission and now you are down 1/3 of those missions for the week.  You miss out on important and time consuming rewards.

Technomancer: Modules will randomly disappear from your minions.  So they will loose the benefit from the module, and you don't get money for selling them or any compensation for them and you have to wait to randomly get more only to have them disappear.

Not enough info on passives and how they interact with each other and your PC.  This is much worse for the Technomancer because a lot of abilities do not explain if they only affect you or also your summons.

Some passives appear to be broken, as in they do not seem to do anything at all.  Others will do the exact opposite of what they are meant to do: ie Ability to summon have a CD.  This CD is a certain number that can be lowered with gear and passives etc, but I will choose a CD passive and watch the indicated number go UP instead of DOWN.  So does this mean that only the represented number is incorrect? or is it a deeper bug?  No way to find out because of aforementioned Bug reporting issues.

I'm sure there are other problems and bugs that I wanted to report when I came across them, but gave up trying and do not have a list of them ava.",1641285588,1641285588,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The way you have to turn the camera is a chore when it shouldn't be ( on M&K ). You'll have to play around with remapping your controls if you want to have a more familiar layout or switch to a controller. I can't say if playing on controller is better or not, I never played ARPG games on controller before.

Combat isn't too bad, it has plenty of ranged and melee weapons of all types to help you find a preferred playstyle and allows you to carry two weapons that you can switch between on the fly. You can also equip a one-handed melee weapon and a side arm while having a two handed weapon of your choosing as your secondary, or dual wield side arms. Though some weapons are far better than others. 

Armor options seem to be limited per class, but each armor type gives you a unique ability to further your playstyle. Using the Assault Armor + One-Handed Axe + Bolt Pistol = Vanguard playstyle ( if using the Crusader class Inquisitor ).

--

Story is good, I personally think it's tough to have a bad story in the 40K-Verse unless they're written by someone who hasn't done enough research into the lore, some of the story elements will still remind you that you're playing a game set in the Grim Darkness of The Far Future. 
The game is lacking background lore and while it does have some good descriptions of the planets and stations you can go to. 
The maps themselves don't give you any incentive to explore them to look for lore bits outside of story elements when you've completed a mission as most maps are quite linear. You won't miss a thing, in fact it's difficult to miss something except for the Exterminate missions which usually put you in an large open map that you just run around unveiling, and those maps are barren after taking out all enemies. Another missed opportunity to add lore bits for you to find.

The planetside maps have no variety at all, they're just reskins of the same layout. The most variety you'll see is when you're on a frozen world and it turns the map into a large open field rather than forcing you to cross bridges and pathways on other maps where the layout has water or toxic waste instead of ice. Other than that, it's the same exact map.

Mission variety is minimal and short, if you're hoping for chapter length style missions from Diablo, you'll be very disappointed. I would love to try out the other classes in Martyr, but with the little to no variety the game can not keep my attention for long. I will be playing it when the Sororitas DLC drops as the Sisters of Battle are my personal favorite faction in the 40K-Verse.

The camera controls are horrible. There is no auto rotating camera which will follow nor is the game designed in a classic 2D isometric style like D2 , PoE or Grim Dawn.

However, as a stand-alone dungeon crawler type game, there are definitely better options out there. The atmosphere of the game fits the Warhammer 40,000 perfectly, with the copious amounts of campy overdramatic dialogue and environment. However, there comes the first issue. The visuals are extremely dark and muddy, marring the beautiful environments. The Gothic cathedral visuals that are the mainstays of Warhammer is covered in darkness, making the walls and terrain blend together into same looking rooms and corridors.

The second main issue of this game is the gameplay itself. It's clunky, unintuitive, and stiff. Movement is controlled by the mouse but so are the main 2 attack functions. These overlapping controls are contextual so it causes difficulty when you want to move but accidentally attack because an enemy got in the way of your cursor. Missions are repetitive and boring, with not enough variety in loot drops to make a difference.

The final issue is the performance. This game does not run well. Even on a decent rig. For some reason, this nearly 30 GB game takes forever to download and install, much longer than games that are larger than it. It loads extremely slowly, especially during character creation, and will occasionally freeze when opening menus. The game feels unoptimized and it shows when I get some pretty harsh frame drops in what doesn't seem to be a very intensive game.

Asides from the 3 main issues I've highlighted include some nitpicks regarding DLC and the game as a whole. Some of the current DLC offered by the store is simply content that you can unlock through grinding. This is just scummy monetization because they're mostly cosmetic objects that offer very little and are free and already in the game. The games-as-a-service seasonal model also doesn't work for a game like this and should never have been implemented. You can only have a specific character per season so previous efforts mean nothing. Games like Destiny 2 and other season based games have done this better with persistent characters, so why do you need a season specific character instead of simply using the one you've been playing with?

All in all, this game offers too little enjoyment and far too much frustration to be worth playing, even for hardcore Warhammer fans. Given the history of the developers, you'd think what they released would be better.",1624590894,1641200717,False,0,0,0.276278138160705566,0,True,False,False

Main gripes:

I was playing the assassin class specifically the sniper / shotgun one. I played through the main story to about level 55. I didn't do any side missions or quests or anything like that so my experience is based around solo play. I never really felt challenged or pressured most encounters were trivialised by rushing the enemy with a shotgun barrage or simply waiting for them to approach en masse and then gunning them down. The only time I used a health charge was during the final boss fight.

First of the range on the sniper rifle is terrible. It's pretty impossible to surgically attack targets without agroing an entire mob which is kinda the point of the sniper.
It should be about double its current range and you should be able to fire from cover reliably.

Speaking of mobs, the enemy's strategy is almost always rush the player. It doesn't matter if they're melee focused or ranged the second they're alerted they will rush your position. Sometimes they'll hang back and fire at you from cover but this is pretty rare in my experience. This leads to a strategy I like to call the ""meatgrinder"" kite the enemies into a narrow choke-point and rip them apart with close range shotgun blasts. I used this strategy for pretty much every single encounter and it never stopped being effective.

The loot system is kinda ""meh"". You will get legendary drops from time to time but there's very little variety or anything going on except slightly higher numbers. The system is pretty barebones and you wont really get that same rush you get from getting a legendary in other games. The weapons are fairly limited and you will constantly see the same weapons dropping over and over just in different colors or with slightly different stats.

The cover and suppression systems are interesting ideas but ultimately their implementation sucks.
The game wants you to use them as well but more often then not its easier to run and gun rather than try to hold your ground.
Supression doesn't affect enemies anywhere near as much as it affects you, what this basically means if you get supressed during a fight you get crippled movement wise and death is pretty much guaranteed. Which would be fine if the enemy used these systems as well instead of just rushing your position.

Every time I tried to fight from cover I was almost always immediately overwhelmed either by enemies rushing my position or simply being shot from all sides. This caused me to pretty much stop using the whole system around level 10 or so. Using cover felt like a detriment in basically every encounter, death was almost guaranteed if I tried to fight from cover instead of running around kiting enemies.

Since this is the main system of the game it needs to be retooled or re-balanced or something. The game is expecting you to play using these systems and the levels are setup with them in mind however my guess would be 99% of players will just rush to melee range or use the shotgun to shred enemies. You can complete most levels in a couple of minutes doing this. 

In my opinion there should be more focus on tactical fighting instead of ""run and gun"" gameplay. Martyr should try to avoid being a Diablo clone and focus more on it's own thing. Encounters should be smaller but more controlled firefights instead of running around kiting mobs. Attempting to rush someone in cover should be massively punishable. Each encounter should be a ""tactical puzzle"" puzzle for the player to solve.

If you are new to WH40K space marine universe/lore you might want to research a bit into the lore and atleast get a base understanding, else it will probably confuse the heck out of you lol

[b][u]Little about my personal perspective on arpgs and this game[/u][/b]
I'm actually not a huge arpg fan, well the ones from this view perspective. I have a few but this is the only one I have with 1100 hrs invested in. (Been playing since April 24th 2020) I promise even after this review that time will still be increasing.

[b][u]About classes and builds[/u][/b]
I currently have 1 of every class and 3 of the 4 capped at level 100. Lotta build diversity and multiple metas per class and also even sub par builds that still are very interesting and fun to use. That is one of the main reasons I love this game, is the class build diversity and weapon diversity. All classes can use range or melee weapons and even a mix of both at the same time. Classes in some ways can have multiple roles. 

[b]Crusader[/b] he can be melee 2h warrior or 1h & shield baring tank if you like that raw range crowd control damager he can do that pretty effective also.
[b]Assassin[/b] can be laid back in the pack sniper or a quick on the crits up close in your face trickster with time manipulation and hit run tactics.
[b]Psyker[/b] this is your mage class cast them wicked chaos spells or become battle mage with sword or a gun do lil of both. Your imagination is your only limiter really.
[b]Tech Priest[/b] that you get with the (DLC prophecy) is a minion master, you can choose your weapon be it range or melee also. But most of your offense comes from minions. Your minions also have progression, in the gear department. Tech Priest I would consider a more advanced player class, because you have to work minion gear as much as your own. So might wanna save him till you get atleast 1 level 100 character that way can fund him lol.

[b][u]On to missions and story.[/u][/b]
Story is a one shot thing per char unfortunately, meaning you can't go back and do repeats of it with the same character.
Not a huge deal but even I would love to do it again at level 100 be pretty neat, w/e though no biggie.
After story is complete and at any time outside of story, all missions are randomly generated and technically there is no true end to this game, it only ends when you quit playing it.

I do highly recommend that you get the prophecy expansion, it adds a little more story for the 3 martyr classes to play but the tech priest class gets a bit shafted as it can only play the prophecy story line even if you own martyr.
Just buying it for the class alone is worth it in my opinion. It is one of my most used and loved classes.  
(like a necromancer in some ways if you need that deeper detailing)
There is a system called tarot cards these cards give you a bonus and at the same time makes enemy more difficult. Like the saying I use in RL, ""caresses you with 1 hand and stabs you with the other"" lol. It's a good system as it allows you to set the challenge yourself, risk and reward type system.  The game does have 4p Co-Cp and PvP. 
You can play all missions including story in Co-Op.

[b][u]Lets go with technical stuff, updates and bugs[/u][/b]
Yes there is bugs, I'm here to give you the 100/100 review as deep and truthful as i can.
Most bugs that exist can be solved by restarting the game. Since I started most of the bugs I encountered has been ironed out. Some still linger but not to the point that it infuriates me or anything. Some I've got used to, don't even notice anymore. The developers are still updating and adding to the game, fixing bugs etc. The game is still very much alive from a developer point of view, the community is fairly small, yet there is plenty of people including myself that stroll the forums, always wanting to help to the best of our ability, knowledge and experience. Sometimes these people take breaks from the game, including myself. Though we usually return even if not actively playing the game just to offer up a helping hand here n there.

[b][u]Final Thoughts[/u][/b]
My personal meta score 90/100
Buy this game and play the sh*t out of it like I have. If you like what my review says, there is a good chance you will like this deep, beautiful WH40K game, it is a rough edged work of art.  I still enjoy this game as much as I did the day I started playing it, to be straight about it. I actually like it more today then I did as a newbie. That says alot, I can't say I own many games I still love to play after 500hrs much less 1100 hours and still counting. I play completely as a loner 120% solo player. (I prefer to). I could give more major positivity and lil more minor negativity from my review, some features and bugs I did skip but I feel the review is becoming so long most might not want to read it. I could understand that entirely.

This Diablo style RPG brings some good ideas, such as mixing equipment to unlock weapon skills. You have access to 3 (4 with DLC) classes, each having their type of weapon, every weapon defining a different playstyle.
Its story-driven campaign will ring a bell for every 40k fans, as it really takes great efforts to stick to the 40k cannon.
Enemies faced ranged to cultist to Tyrannid threat, going into rebel Astartes and Eldars. All of them having their different tactics. You'll have to purge massive Xenos and Heretics cohorts, in gruesome environnment.
Graphisms are correct despite a little bit of optimization may have been needed.
Multiplayer coop game is a big pro.

However, the game can be sometimes really repetitive, its gameplay being most of the times only wiping the map of ennemies swarm. So it's why I wouldn't advise it to people not intiated to 40k, as it won't really impress common gamers. That's a bit sad cause the game was really close of being a game of anthology.

The lore of warhammer 40k is one of the biggest aspects of the wh40k universe that I like. This game has very little of that, its got a fun campaign but you finish it quick and then after that it's just running the same maps against the same enemies over and over and over. Theres no story content or lore to spice up the monotony. The devs havent released any new story content for years now. What they DO release is the main aspect of the game so it will be what makes or breaks this game for you. Its divided up into seasons, each season has a bunch of new busy work to do and a smattering of new items, but...you have to start a new character over to access this content. And then at the end of the season this new character will be removed from the seasonal lists and a new season will start. You will need to then start a new character to access this next season. Your old characters will never encounter anything new that the devs put out, so basically once a season ends your character is useless and you might as well delete them. Unless you want to do ""void crusades"" and run the same. 10. maps. over. and. over. against. the. same enemies. over. and. over. with zero lore or story to keep you entertained. Its an odd decision by the devs, but it looks like these devs are falling into the same trap that almost every other WH40k developer falls into. They dont capitalize on the massive amount of interesting lore, which just makes this another hack and slash that gets boring after the short campaign. 

TLDR: starting over every season makes previous characters pointless. Not nearly enough story or lore to shoot this game ahead of a hundred other games in this genre. (grim dawn, path of exile, diablo, etc. etc.) 
Its fun for the small amount of story content but after thats done the grind and seasons are too terribly flawed and poorly thought out to maintain interest. Play grim dawn instead.",1639454780,1639454780,False,95,22,0.626548051834106445,12,True,False,False

The main reason I can't recommend this game is the always online bullshit.

 For 40k fans it's a very good game, those who searcing for an above average ARPG, will find an average one.
 3 classes: Crusader (Warrior), Assassin (Rogue) and Psyker (Mage). Prophecy dlc brings the 4th class: Tech Adept (Pet char). Active abilities tied to your equipped weapons (gives 4), grenade and armor slot gives 1-1. You can have a secondary weapon, with that, you can have 10 active abilities on your char to choose from.
 By leveling up you gain points to spend on passives. There are a ton of categories, each with their own tree. (Like AoE, Defense, Criticals, Heat dmg, Physical dmg, etc...)
 
As a W40k fan I found the campaign interesting. After that comes the leveling and endgame.
Which is consists of a lot of farming. You gonna need a lot of money and materials for crafting. A good design choice imo, there is little RNG in crafting, eventually you can craft the exact piece you want.
 You have some influence on what to farm by applying Tarot cards to missions. These cards have various negative (buffing enemies, timer on mission, etc..)  and positive (higher chance to find ""x"", more XP) modifiers. These Tarot cards themselves can be leveled up (boosting only their positive effects). So there is a lot to grind.

 Co-op can be laggy, but I'm glad it works. Years ago I had horrible experience, yesterday I was shocked as I could play without problems with a friend. The game would have benefitted huge if there was a global chat, there isn't.

Fun game (overall). Good story. Good voice acting. Great music. Great artwork. Good sound effects (except for melee weapons). Decent RPG elements.

Cons
Frustrating bugs, uninspired level designs, poor mission variety, and seemingly empty coop lobbies.

Conclusion
A good game, especially if you love warhammer 40k. While the game can get a bit repetitive in regards to mission variety, it is still a good game overall. Unfortunately It feels like 95% of missions amount to, ""Go here, kill that, rinse and repeat"" which is a bit disappointing, but the combat and story is enjoyable enough to hold my attention at least. More dynamic mission types and variety would really bump this game up a notch. As it stands, it is a GOOD game, but certain level-design elements are holding it back from being a truly GREAT game. 

To put it simply, the small, linear, and repetitive level designs are incredibly underwhelming compared to pretty much every thing else in the game. 

All in all though, still a good game. I would recommend it if you like Diablo-esque games, and Warhammer 40K.",1637995969,1638139511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Interesting campaign
- Great for Co-op with lads

- Only few cosmetic choices (but there are many sections which is a Pro)

I mean... c'mon I can understand this loot'n'shoot thing when it is fun, when you get new skills and make these skills work together, but what I get here as a result of leveling is just some 0.5% addition to some stats I have no idea about. Or, say, you decide to play assassin girl, you get the sniper rifle and... it shoots the same distance as your damn pistol?! What's the point, really?
And lore-wise it's terrible. In one of the start tutorial-kind missions you'll face a chaos dreadnought. Correct me if I'm wrong but it's the thing that requires a squad of marines to deal with - here you just kick it's ass with a laspistol. Probably in the end of the plot you just beat all the Chaos Gods and bring all traitor Primarchs on Terra to plea for Emperor's mercy.

The game is in a much better state and offers a ton of enjoyment for the price you pay on sale. They have seasons now, which adds a great deal to the endgame replayability. I think the combat style might not be for everyone, but if you are partial to it there is a lot of end game content for you to sift through. 

The DLC is not necessary to fully enjoy the game but if you are a 40k fan they are pretty cool. Nothing bombastic or new in terms of gameplay. Prophecy adds a tech priest and new story and that is playable within the seasons of the base game. 

Overall I really like this game now. It's sort of my go to ARPG when i get burnt out of playing something more hardcore or just want a new experience with new classes. Really impressed with how far the game has come.

The lore is solid, plenty of story which is voiced over. There seems to be plenty of activities focused after the main campaign, though I admit I haven't tried many yet.

awesome death effects when you murder large groups
You don't have to level every item every time you level
What I hate =
You gut stuck on corners constantjy.  You are the baddest ass warrior in the galaxy and you can't slide around objects.
Map design.  Seriously did any of the developers ever play a game?  The amount of back and forth and the number of times you get stuck or can't reach loot or an enemy is ridiculous.
Total lack of scale =
You go from I can't do shit to nothing can kill me to oh fuck I can't live with single items or abilities.  Very bad scaling.
Zero explanation for anything.  It's roll and hope the whole time.  You hope someone has written about what your need to know online because the game doesnt provide shit.
Enemies either explode instantaneously or take no damage.  You will have no idea why.  See earlier comments about scaling and explanations.  You can wipe everything on the map with a touch then get to a boss you hit with everything you've got and their hit points go up as you are hitting them.
I'm now level 93 and I haven't seen the seasonal event item for my character.  
Relic farming while trying to level relics with no stat explanations to find out they suck sux.

Please note playtime is massively inflated by idle time. 

Edit at 50hrs: I made a character that hits for 30k damage and heals the same amount, like a god lol.

Review at 10 hours.: The character building is really interesting. I'm on my first build around level 40.
Everything I like about ARPGs is here, lots of systems, numbers and loot. I'm already torn between starting new characters and progressing my first. 

It's really satisfying to see huge rolls from stacked buffs, but tempting to try to make screen go boom in different ways. I love my glass cannon, but a reflective tank will probably be next. 

Lore is pretty good, above average for most Warhammer and similar genre fiction, everything looks fantastic and really reminds me of the tabletop games. Story and acting are genre typical and above average. 

I got the full package all dlc for around £13, I'm stoked on it and give a daily blast.

42 years of age and have played every single ARPG under the sun... I'm so tired of the constant G, PG rated garbage that comes out year after year. With flashy BS affects and high speed game play that's meant to capture your attention/wallet like a typical pokie machine. 
I'm only 3hrs into this game, and I have to say, I'm already hooked (line and sinker). I read every review out there before even contemplating spending a whopping $70.00 for a game that is fairly dated and not considered a AAA game (indie developers). However in retrospect, so is D3, POE, and GD (in which I also loved playing). I half expected this game to be a bit of a dud with so many negative comments made all over steam reviews and general articles floating about the internet. So with that and also factoring in the high price tag,  I was expecting to somewhat regret my decision in purchasing this game......
I couldn't have been further from the truth, infact I'm so glad I went with my gut feeling/instinct and decided to give this game a chance. WHAT A BLOODY MASTERPIECE this game is, I will never read another negative review again and take it seriously.
Take it from me ""TOP DOWN ARPG GAMER"" this is a great game, and my only regret is that I didn't play it sooner.

Until, at one point, I realized that outside of good graphics this game really does not have much to offer.

To summarize:
- Shallow and expected storyline, with almost no plot twists and unexpected events.
- Forgettable characters, NPCs and Bosses. ( I have no idea what a single boss is called except the last one, which is a MAJOR letdown, but I won`t mention the name because of spoiler reasons)
- A.I. is really bad. Ranged  A.I. will just stand in a place and shoot at you and maybe move a bit if you start to run away from it. Melee A.I. is just made so it rushes at you with no strategy what-so-ever. After the first few hours, you will encounter mostly the same enemies until the end of the campaign. I was seriously shocked when I saw a new enemy type like after 90% of the game.
- Music is nonexistent and combat sounds get repetitive very fast.
- 90% of missions are like this: Spawn, run to the quest marker, read the new journal entry, run to the next marker, kill someone/grab something important, and then exit. You can literally skip 90% of the combat and you won`t really miss out on anything.

Overall, this is the most bland ARPG I have ever played. Too bad I needed over 2h to realize this, cause this could have saved me 20$.

If you like Diablo and you like 40k, then buy this. 
It is truly an amazing, immersive game. I love it. 
You play an Inquisitor and are tasked with smiting the enemies of The Emperor. The game takes some liberty with Inquisitors, allowing you to play one of four ""classes"" of an Inquisitor unaffiliated with one of the Ordos (hmm...). 
The classes are Crusader, who is essentially an Assault Marine or Devastator depending on loadout (even Tactical), which makes the frequent assertions of one of the characters (""You are no Astartes..."") very annoying (""I'm better than an Astartes, if you measure Astartes by your own sorry, annoying, ship-bound self, you piece of unofficial, suspect mutant"" is what I want to reply) rather heretical. I love this class. So much carnage.
Then you have Assassin (...), which is something between Death Cults Assassin and Callidus (didn't play this much), Psyker (errr... ALL Inquisitors are Psykers...), which I also haven't played much, and the heretical Tech-Priest class (lol wut?), which I have played quite a bit and which is either relaxed or boring, depending on your viewpoint, as your constructs do all the killing and you can't do much except grabbing the dropped loot yourself.
So, despite some lore liberties, this game is really good. Recommended.",1598940205,1635956937,False,0,0,0.509001612663269043,0,True,False,False

Funny how after only one play session I can confirm the same problem that seems to have been plaguing this game more than Nurgle can infest an entire Subsector....or maybe it's just the stupidity of developers who spend too much time indulging with Slaanesh to bother realizing their game RUNS LIKE SHIT!

Do I have steady frames, yes. Do I have a beautiful game, yes. Is it running as a game should and not abusing my GPU......NO! Why in the hell is a borderline singleplayer game hitting temperatures like this?!?!?!?!

(yup, no lie, just go to the discussions on steam and search 'GPU')

The game is not my problem, it's the cocky stupid ass developers like this that REFUSE to optimize their game and then give us ways to fix it using 3rd party resources because they don't want to just make it in the game which is where the optimizations should be.

THERE IS NO REASON MY GPU SHOULD BE RUNNING AT 100% WHILE AT THE MENU!!!!!!! FIX THIS SHIT!

One thing is for sure, this is the FIRST and the LAST time I'll ever deal with this company.

EDIT: At least with the great tech from AMD I was able to use their own Radeon Software to fix the whole damn thing without needing another application downloaded and running. Hopefully I can finally look passed this and just enjoy a game in the world of 40k that I love.

EDIT 2: The game is bland with the gameplay....it may look pretty and seem like a 40k game but the number of times they broke lore in game is just sad, they simply read a codex and took some cool quotes / artwork then made a game.

It also plays differently to diablo, it has a greater focus on being a bit slower and more methodical, rather than trying to go break-neck speed. 


Some of the Pros: 
It has lots of unique weapons, skills are tied to the weapons.
There are lots of guns, they also have a unique (to this genre) reloading system which is fun.
You can dual wield weapons, which lets you mix and match the skills that come with those weapons.
Most builds seem viable. Talent trees and perks are interesting. Both melee and ranged builds seem fun.
Sounds and graphics are good.
The devs clearly thought about the genre and what would be interesting to change.
The devs did a great job integrating not only 40k lore, but also flavor, without being overwhelming. 



Some of the cons:
I encountered a decent number of visual bugs. Once or twice in 50 hours of play I had bugs that prevented me from completing a mission. Edit: Coming back after a year, these bugs seem to be fixed!

Some of the systems (especially late game) are not intuitive and explained poorly (see enrage tokens, berserk tokens).
I personally didn't enjoy the sudden introduction of new stat types on high level gear (once again, the enrage/berserk tokens).

I have always loved WH 40K and i love being an Inquisitor (Basically upgraded Space Marine)
The game has alot to offer, but it does require some reading up and looking around their website and steam guides... The game itself can be very repetetive, and theres only few enemy types and dungeons/landscapes to run through.
What i like most about the game, is how you make builds. Ofc. some are stronger than others, but with all the different equipment slots, you can manufacture the way you like to play.
The gem/socketing system is also very expanded and theres many different options as to how you set it up. Both for damage output and your own personal preferance.

Overall, the game is lazy at some points. No denying that.
The grind is VERY real and you will not be able to boost a character to max level in a day or two. But the true endgame and setting up your build also starts at around lvl 50. (Max is 100)
But after 100+ hours i still enjoy this.
Lots of killing, gore and gothic atmosphere. I can play with the weapons i like and the crafting/gem system is super cool if you like to theory craft. 

The endgame crusades in this game, is what you would compare to rifts in Diablo 3 and as a baseline i prefer the rifts, but i also appreciate how they made something different here.
They also have seasons, if that is your thing.

Personally i would say its worth around 20 euro and you should not judge the game, before you reach lvl 50 and have tried out the void crusades.

- game drags on waaay to long. I'm in 18 hours and still haven't finished the main questline
- sound design is awful. Guns sound like toys, I have the impression that ambient sounds sometimes are entirely missing
- Leveldesign is really uninspired: when playing indoors, maps consists always of straight corridors decorated with some props, but base layout remains very linear. Planet surfaces are better in that respect but 75% of gametime will be in straight corridors.

Also, this requires you to connect to a live server. I hate that I can't play an offline character.

Grinding for gear isn't that bad. The drop rates are easily improved with gear and taro cards. When I learned more about the game, I did get a character to lvl 100. It's easy to respec skills. I'd call this user friendly if it wasn't so hard to figure it all out.

There is a friendly community, and from what I have seen multiplayer is improving. There is almost no purpose to trolling, and I never faced it.

- Are you in the middle of a fight with some boss? Did you know, that he is unpredictably talkative? So here is a mid-fight talking scene for you...

The 40k Themes, some of the voice-acting, and the overall style is very good. Too bad the game-play gets repetitive so quickly.

The missions where you are in a vehicle are sluggish and boring, and not balanced to high difficulties.

The DLC missions are a joke, you can't add the difficulty modifiers or change the level difficulty.

This is overall just a waste of time. If you're going to play, playing through the campaign first. DO NOT DO ANY SIDE-MISSIONS as you unlock things that make them way more fun.

You also only have co-op on the random missions, none of the campaign ones.",1634513474,1634513518,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The talent trees are more complex and the types of gear used impacts what secondary skills you can use.  So it is not a space rip off of D3, but stands very well on its own in my opinion.

I will say there have been a few issues with play that I hope to resolve including a low FPS and micro glitching that i am struggling with.  Also the idea of a stand alone expansion is lost on me because i started playing Martyr after the xpac was released, so i have two games in my steam and i am struggling to separate the two as to which I should be playing when and a little anxiety over missing content.

BLUF:  I really enjoy this game, this is a beautiful Warhammer 40k Diablo clone.  I know saying this game is a clone may sound like a bad thing, but I think this game performs wonderfully and is very fun.  That being said, the always online requirement and absolute loss of all progress on any disconnects make this a non-recommend for me.  

The Good:
The classes are interesting, unique, and the character and item progressions but are actually unique enough that your thought and choices matter (if you like min/maxing, this is the game for you).  Certain points of the game can be tedious as you level up, but for the most part I enjoyed the leveling up of each my classes and the time I spent playing the game.

There are many mechanics to make the late game interesting, with void crusades, tarot cards, and special missions providing unique twists that alter the game experience for a change in rewards.

The art style is beautiful.  The grim/gothic setting is done well and none of the characters were irritating.  The story line is unique with an above average twist in the game, and I consider better than most Warhammer storytelling.


The Bad:

The online requirement and the impact on the game...
I knew there was an online requirement before buying the game, I am not mad about that.  If you push your builds and make missions harder for better items or progress, missions can easily last 30-45 minutes due to the stat changes.  As someone who enjoys min/maxing and pushing the level limit of what missions I can do, there is something particularly irritating about running missions that are 10+ levels above your own (resulting in damage reduction for you and damage bonus for the enemies) and losing that progress.  If during that time your computer loses 30 seconds of connection to the game server, you get kicked out and lose everything from that mission.  To top that off, when examining my modem logs I do notice that I have occasional 5-6 seconds of lost downstream connection.  Evidently reconnecting to the game servers takes another ~25 seconds, as each time that is enough to disconnect me.  If I was a high school kid or a single guy with free time, this wouldn't be much of an issue.  However as a dad to multiple children, losing half an hour of game progression is not worth it to me.  When I get an hour or two of gaming per week, it's just not something I can endorse.  The community doesn't help in these matters either, as despite the dozens of forum submissions about this every person just calls you an idiot or states there is no problem.  

Que sera, I just have better things to be doing.

In summary, I think the game is great.  Despite uninstalling for now, I plan to try again in a few years when my peasant internet improves or I get more time to game.",1625669674,1634062475,False,85,0,0.750934064388275146,10,True,False,False

The core mechanics and not-quite-diablo-esque gameplay seem solid and I haven't run into any glitches yet. It doesn't do anything to really stand out in that genre save for the Warhammer 40,000 branding, but it also isn't totally incompetent either.

Without doing much research I managed to find a build with flamethrowers that got me through most of the game with hardly any equipment swapping. Its not like diablo where youll play an act/chapter all the way through. You have missions to go on. Once that mission is done you teleport back to your ship and prep for the next mission. I played through the game on normal which seemed rather easy. There is a story mode to make it even easier. 

After finishing the campaign, or even during it, you can go on side missions for more gear and loot to max out your characters level and use a tarot system for extra rewards. One such card gives you 70% bonus items and 100% rep increase on that level. The cards themselves can be leveled. I can say how or what they do after leveling them as I focused on the campaign.

The games biggest failing in my opinion is making the Tech Priest/Expansion class only playable after Martyr is beaten. By that point I was around level 60 with my space marine and did not want to switch off of that. When I tried the tech priest solo campaign (about 2 hours) I got a decent feel for what the class could do and felt that it wasted the potential. The priest would have been start with in the beginning of Martyr. Im sure it could have been reworked to add it.

You constantly get caught on small little rocks that completely stop you from moving. Forcing you to actively go round something that should even be an obstacle in the first place.

The game can't fix the bug stuck players at the tutorial map, this can happen when you done 1 first level then go coop with friends or it's just happen random.

As a Warhammer fan, it is always awesome to see the universe brought to life, especially from the perspective of an inquisitor. The combat is satisfying, enemies explode and shatter at your attacks. The customization is deep, progress is satisfying, and the types of objectives you run into are unique, such as tower defense objectives. 

But the game is ROUGH. The voice-acting is absolute garbage. It is embarrassingly bad, almost everything is mispronounced, and absolutely every single line is clearly the first and only take. The character models sometimes glitch out and flicker and props pop in and out as you zoom in.

It should say something then, that despite these significant problems with the presentation, I am thoroughly interested in the story. It is set in the mysterious Caligari Sector, and appropriately the main campaign is mysterious and captivating, creating it's own Space Marine chapter, pursuing a mysterious ghost ship. With a lot of questions and a lot of potential answers, the next mission is always easy to start up. 

If you're Warhammer 40k fan, I do highly recommend the game. The story will keep you playing, and the gameplay is fulfilling enough. If you're just looking for a good ARPG, you found a decent one.",1633581312,1633581402,True,7,0,0.584119319915771484,0,True,False,False

(This is a short, first-impressions review aimed at those considering getting the game while it's on sale. Most of my current playtime is on ""Prophecy,"" so ignore the number up there.)


[u][b]First:[/b][/u]
This is [b]not[/b] some half-S'd WH40k title. You can tell, right away, that a [b]lot[/b] of work went into this game. There are voice overs, cutscenes, complex skill trees, perks, Diablo-like loot-system and items, there are even seasons, with a bunch of stuff in them, going on.

In fact, after some 3 hours playing, I'm still lost trying to figure everything out.

They may [i]not[/i] have been too bold when claiming they were ""pushing the ARPG genre to a new level."" Blizzard could certainly find at [i]least[/i] a few suggestions about what they could implement in Diablo IV here.


[u][b]Second:[/b][/u]
If you had texture-related problems with this game in the past, like I did (causing me to refund it 2 years ago), don't worry -- they're gone. Everything is working fine now.


[u][b]Third:[/b][/u]
Buying ""Prophecy"" instead of ""Martyr"" only gives you access to the 4th character class. The first 3 come with Martyr. So I suggest grabbing the whole package currently on sale, with everything in it.


[u][b]Fourth (possible [i]cons[/i]):[/b][/u]
Your basic attack has a cooldown. It's a very short one (like 0.3s), which can also be reduced by passive skills and item attributes, but it kind of interrupts the flow of combat. I don't like this, but it's no biggy, as the CD is very short and you also have 3 other free, active skills (and more) with short CDs as well.

Finally, the game consists in doing small, isolated missions. You keep going from one procedurally-generated map to the next -- other than story-wise, there's no connection between them. I like the usual ARPG formula better, but this is no major issue either. It works fine, and every map is a mission, which means you get rewards after each one.


[u][b]TL;DR:[/b][/u]
For the current price, despite my still very limited experience with the game, this feels like a steal. If things keep going as I expect them to, [i]definitely[/i] buy this game if you are an ARPG fan. Like, right [i]now[/i].",1633554454,1633554664,True,1,0,0.436553001403808594,0,True,False,False

9/15/21 - Still broken, but given the game is 3+ years old and the developers are still acknowledging bugs and trying to fix them is a plus.  I would give this a neutral review if I could, but I did get my money's worth so I can't really complain despite my disappointment in the bugginess.

I had managed expectations for the game, because of the typically mixed level of reviews. I was still disappointed. The animations are sub-par, being even worse in some cases. than an RTS from 2005 (Dawn of War) from the same franchise. Specifically, when you dual wield, you don't smoothly move your arms or hold them both up while firing. No no, your arm snaps into place faster than an experienced six-shooter. So fast one could say it's like they didn't bother to animate it. There is also a lack of punch for the bolter weapons. They sound weak and, at least on challenge mode, feel needlessly weak.

There are some un-fun design choices as well. Such as firing full auto not only increases your recoil, decreases your max range and accuracy, but also decreases your damage  (by up to 35%, to be more specific, the starter bolter is 30 damage per shot in burst, 19 per shot in full auto). The passive skill tree has some minor bonuses that are ultimately ""oh that's kind of nice"" but don't mean much until you have at least 5 of the same stat boosted.

The game, for the life of me, would also seem to have some kind of motion blue and as far as I can tell, there is no way of fixing this. It just runs like this. It's an eyesore when you're moving. The game graphically however, looks worse than the trailers from nearly 3 years ago now. It's a shame.

I bought this game for a 60% discount. The problems that are existent inside the game are most likely not going to be fixed.

(It feels perfectly natural.)

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Most of my previous ARPG experience has been Diablo 2, 3, and Torchlight. Many incredibly similar mechanics, so if you have interest in chasing good loot, optimising builds, etc, then you'll like that part of it. There's now also mechanics for crafting and socketing gear, which expands options even further (I'm yet to get too involved in that).

General gameplay is pretty fun, you're limited to the skills attached to your weapon and your belt/armour equipment (and occasional once-off bonuses), but with two sets of gear and the option to mix it up midway through a mission really gives you the versatility to play how you want. The story mode difficulty can get a bit dull/simple but you can ratchet it up to increase the challenge.

At times playing can feel a bit repetitive, but I've found the same in all ARPGs and so I occasionally swap to different weapon classes which spices up gameplay a lot. This makes it feel more reminiscent of the good parts of Diablo 3 and an advantage over games like Diablo 2.

Haven't tried co-op yet, if I get the chance I'll edit the review, since co-op often makes an ARPG for me.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Story feels relatively fun, they're definitely setting up for sequels but this is WH40k, you're job as a cog in the Imperium will never be finished.

I like having a range of enemies to fight, it feels better than previous WH40k games like Space Marine, where you're limited to Orks and one form of Chaos. In this you'll get to battle Imperial rebels, cultists, Chaos Astartes, pirates, daemons, etc. And within this there's various types as well, for example you get to explore the difference between plague marines of Nurgle, the Word Bearers, and even the shadowy Alpha Legion (who make references to still being loyal to the old Emperor!).

Playing as an Inquisitor definitely gives a great insight to that shadowy organisation and it's internally fractured nature. It feels pretty true to the lore overall.

[h1]Engine[/h1]
I gotta admit I'm also super impressed with the game engine developed by NeoCore games. The destructible terrain is really fun, the physics side of it is quite lush. There's a few minor glitches but for an independently developed game engine by a relatively smaller/unknown team it feels super schmick.

[h1]Music[/h1]
Lastly, the music is really dope and atmospheric, while also being quite ""driving"" at times, fuelling your desire to fell the enemies of the Emperor in your glorious quest.

Update 2021-09-19
[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
I've now sunk about 200 hours into multiplayer with a mate and it's been a blast, but at times can be buggy. Sometimes loot  you sold/stashed gets duplicated when you log in, sometimes inventory becomes inaccessible and you need to log out and back in. In the latest season we've noticed a few missions where you can die and become untargetable and can't damage enemies, effectively creating a stalemate for you unless your partner completes the mission or you abort. Sometimes levels can be a bit janky and you get ported around and in 1-2 cases, ported outside the level and stuck.

While that sounds pretty grim, I still keep playing with friends because it's fun and despite the cooperative nature there's a thousand ways to be competitive and roast each other. From levelling against each other, comparing loot, finding bonuses that the other doesn't have, achievements, progression; it's all a riot. And now that co-op has been flesh out further there's a myriad of ways to keep interested, from seasons to reputation, void crusades to achieves to just plain levelling.

Still greatly recommend.",1568965753,1632020722,True,6,0,0.542473673820495605,0,True,False,False

While missions aren't extremely varied, there are a lot of different playstyles that you can try out through the different weapons and classes that are in the game.",1628631604,1628696826,True,4,0,0.563218355178833008,0,True,False,False

Pro:

-Decent graphics, animations and WH40k atmosphere
-4 different classes (3 + 1 from Prophecy), all with their own playstyle
-Several different enemy factions with their own spin/units
-Fun gameplay with interesting concepts, like a cover mechanic, an active dodgeroll on the Assassin class, or a sniper-minigame, also on the Assassin, an ""overheat"" mechanic on the Psyker etc.
-up to 4 players online co-op
-Easy and cheap respecs
-Interesting build possibilities (in theory at least)
-A rather advanced crafting system to modify, create and socket onto all sorts of equipment


Contra:

-A ""Mass Effect"" like morale system, that demands to go one way, all the way. Go full-on good guy or bad guy, or you will lock yourself out of certain skills and perks. If you play co-op and your players want to go different routes: tough luck!
-You can only play through the whole campaign in co-op with 3 of the 4 characters (Tech Adept is excluded, till you reach the Addon/Prophecy part of the story).
-Very Repetitive
-Questionable optimization (noticable fps drops on some maps)
-Quite grindy, especially after reaching lvl 80 and above
-Seasons are the ever same grind through character levels (You have to start a completely new character, every time), the same content and artificial challenges in the form of achievements
-Tilesets/levels repeat a lot
-MP bugs, able to throw you out of bounds when walking/dodging into friendly players
-Very heavy and noticable sound bugs. Especially in regards to the voice work. Character lines are stuttering, jump inbetween left and right for no reason or crackle a whole lot, as if they are compressed in a bad way
-Enemy (DoT) damage scaling is bugged/overtuned since half a year now (!) and is STILL not getting fixed
-The overall balancing is quite bad and way too focused on crits, doctrines, life/shield leech and additional damage enhancing stacks of minibuffs. This got even worse since the enemies damage has become overtuned, further giving an incentive to go for rush AoE builds and nothing else anymore, standing directly against the developers premise to create a more ""tactical"" approach to the ARPG/Hack & Slay genre..


Conclusion:

I would lie if i would say, that i didn't enjoy my time with the game. It's a good title to get in and out for a quick round and it can be great fun in co-op, as long as you have a friend, who is still playing it.

But the longer i have played Inquisitor, the more apparent all of its flaws have become to me, up to a point i can almost not bare it anymore.

If you can get it for cheap and have some friends you can start it with, i can recommend it for 1 or 2 playthroughs. Everything beyond that is not really worth it imho.

My main reason for not recommending it, is it's overall content and age, compared to its price.

So, if you want to get it, at least get it for cheap. It's not worth the asking price in any case.",1628056627,1628517469,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is very pretty, but some of the optimization choices can make older graphics cards hot enough to boil water, especially in a laptop.

yet, despite all shortcomings martyr is an incredibly fun game to play. the visuals are no less than stunning. the ambient is nice and dark and gun and hit sounds are crunchy enough. it's good fun to watch the enemies disintegrating and splattering apart. the character customisation and gear varietiy don't leave much to desire. the price point may still be a bit steep, but i find it well worth to be picked up on sale.",1627132428,1628372668,True,1,0,0.501312315464019775,0,True,False,False

Combat doe not evolve....The enemy from the first 5 minutes of the game is really no different than the enemy 15 hours and 30 levels later, and the missions all feel the same.

The AI is so stupid it should be called A, without the I. 
Again, no difference from beginning to hours later...just get behind cover and the AI will walk directly into your fire.

Crafting is a convoluted, confusion mess. It's as if they asked each person in the company to come up with 5 ideas for crafting, and then, instead of going through and picking the good ideas, they used ALL of them, good, bad, stupid, and retarded.

Also...the game gives you shards to integrate into suits and weapons, but even though you get these starting at level 1, you can't add them, or do most other crafting and upgrading until level 50.

I'm really enjoying the game, I am, but the server issues are severely hindering the enjoyment for me and the friends I play with. We've been trying to play the Void Crusade mechanic which is a tree of missions that spread out and culminates in a specific mission. If you fail a mission, that path is locked unless you manage to curve around through a different path. This becomes a problem because whenever the servers or netcode fails, the mission is an automatic failure which results in that mission being locked from future attempts. This causes a major reduction in enjoyment of the game because we can not attempt the mission again nor can we progress in that direction.

I previously recommended the game even though the servers were messed up at launch, but I never expected to *not* recommend it three years later because they were still messed up...
While I hate that the servers are messed up, I would be more okay with it if we didn't consistently fail multiple missions due to it. If the missions didn't fail and got locked, then we could at least attempt again. Now we're just being punished due to the servers being scuffed.



-Old review-


It's a quite nice game with excellent features and pretty decent mechanics. I recommend it for the game it is but also because there are a lot of people giving negative reviews because of the server issues that was occuring at launch. Whilst I do not condone the presence of server issues I do believe that developers are allowed some leeway at release because these things do happen and it can't always be helped.",1528237826,1628188445,False,0,0,0.481043696403503418,0,True,False,False

Its price is much too high, especially for the bundle with all the useless DLCs. The only reason i decided to try this game is because of Totalbiscuit's review of Neocore's other game. His opinion was (paraphrasing) ""it feels unpolished but it is fun"". The complain often raised by the players is the amount of grind and slow leveling. And the are right. I felt as if doing the worst grind in WoW MMO. Meaning it can not get any worse.  Kudos to the developers for making class designs so interesting as to keep me playing for 400 hours. Every other aspect of this game is literal junk and feels as a students project i.e. enemy design, AI , MAPS ARE ATROCIOUS !!!! and even gui sucks big time. There is no feeling of progression. As an example, one of the reasons i have been playing this game was i wanted to see the end game. The maps at the beginning are so bad, that i was refusing to believe there will be no evolution in map design. Well... there is none. On the contrary, probably the best map you will see, will be the VERY FIRST map. Than everything else will just be the old same , extremely poorly designed map pool. There is literally nothing else in the game. You played it 5 minutes, you have seen it all ! This is just one among a pile of other problems.  This game delivers a bunch of good ideas , but feels like ALPHA in the earliest stage and not a full game. Let me be clear: this just can NOT fulfill any player expectations of even the simplest hack and slash. Everything here feels like a concept, a  barebone project. The only thing that comes in abundance is an avalanche of  DLCs, that are worthless and add nothing to the gameplay. I love reading and a good story. And i obviously like warhammer. After a short play time, any player will realize there is nothing worthwhile to read and will skip all the text. The story is gibberish , written in a most uninspired way imaginable. If you wanna try a really good game , with soul, character, and a good storytelling go play Mechanicus. As for me, i will be avoiding all Neocore games. You are free to try them and play a bit, but if you are out for quality , you have to look somewhere else. Cheers! I hope this review will save you 400 hours of your life.
PS -  the class that has been added in Prophecy ""the adept"" is utterly boring and even after complaints and a supposed ""fix"" in the newest patch still remains so. I also heard people same the same about psykers and to lesser extent crusaders. The only character that delivers any action is assassin.

For a game that's been around for a couple of years, there should not still be literal game-breaking bugs. Some examples:

If you're playing an assassin, dodging will sometimes get your character stuck in the terrain. The only way out is to die or restart the game (and lose the progress on the mission you were running (and woe betide you are trying to solo a void crusade mastery and lose HOURS of progress))

If you're playing co-op void brethren missions, you and your entire party will sometimes lose all of your loot and XP when the mission ends because the server decided to roll you all back to before you started the mission. This happens WAY more often than occasionally.

If you're playing a co-op void crusade, which is an FTL-like series of missions that you have to complete for phat loot, the server will sometimes fail to connect your team to a specific mission, and then won't allow you to pick the mission again. It's still there on the screen, it still says ""available"" but you can't click it to start it.

Which brings me to a final point. The net-code in this game is awful. Really awful. If your party is not all on the same screen at the same time, expect wild rubber-banding and clipping through walls and into mobs and death.

This game could be a fun co-op experience, but I can really only recommend it as a single-player experience to avoid most of the bugs above and then, sadly, the game gets a little grindy. Buy it on sale, don't pay full price.",1628067963,1628067963,False,2,0,0.521074593067169189,0,True,False,False

Its biggest strength is likely the climate and lore – it's one of the best W40k games in this regard, wonderfully implementing the terminology, tech and core concepts of the 40k universe. The visuals, music and voice acting are all similarly awesome – for a content-starved 40k fan like me it was all beyond satisfying.

Then there's the actual gameplay and mechanics which are... A mixed bag. I find the combat enjoyable and relaxing in a rather mindless way, but I very much see that the maps, mission goals and enemy variety are lacking. Every enemy faction feels pretty similar, bossess are rarely seen and not very memorable, mini bossess are few and constantly recycled. Even in the campaign things gets a bit stale, while the endgame content just remixes everything you've already experienced. There's tons of content, but little of it feels unique, outside of cool story bits. 

The two things that save the core gameplay loop for me are approachability (missions are all seperate, quick instances and I actually like that, large open maps mostly just waste your time) and the overall feel of the combat (it's extremely gore'y and all most weapons are very impactful and fun to use). There's tons of passives to unlock and a vast number of viable builds for every class. Crafting is very intricate and lets you both create stuff and deeply modify random loot (although unlocking crafting options and perks, along with finding blueprints, takes a lot of time).

In the end, the game probably won't keep you playing for years, like some ARPGs, but if you get it on sale, you'll easily get your money's worth out of it even if the repetetiveness gets to you fairly quickly.

There's a lot more ranged combat in this game (there are guns), but playing melee is still viable. There are also three main ""elements"": physical, fire and warp. Mobs can have lots of AoE and armour, which is slightly different from D3. There are 3 starting classes, with a 4th which can be obtained through DLC.

Combat is a mix between taking cover/firing from range and a hack and slash. Cover is destructable and has HP. Missions also have traps, such as mines and turrets. You have 4 attack skills, which are based on your weapon types. You also have an inoculator skill, item utility skill and an armour skill. In terms of bars, you have HP, class-specific units (similar to Mana), suppression (like a mental state; which can affect the CC you take) and shields.

You have your classic DoTs, buffs, debuffs, soft / hard CC. There's a wider variety of offensive and defensive stats in this game. You have global damage reduction, as well as individual elemental damage reduction, damage reflection and damage deflection (like a parry). Many stats have a soft cap of 60%, which can be increased to the hard cap of 80% with Supreme stats.

The skill tress (passive skills) can't be freely reset; you must buy a reset item, which will allow you to reset one tree. This isn't expensive, but you have to wait for the shop to sell it, and it refreshes every hour, so I recommend looking at trees before deciding to invest in points. Alternatively, you can look for build guides online. Perks, however, can be freely swapped. You have 3 perk slots and you can unlock new perks by completing Heroic Deeds (you can think of these as milestones / achievements). Heroic Deeds can also grant you passive skill points and Attribute points. There are 3 Attributes (similar to STR / DEX / INT) available for each class and each attribute has stages, which grant additional bonuses. Your inoculator can be customised freely, with 3 classifications of buffs to choose from, and multiple charges.

In terms of gear, you have 3 implants, a Seal, utility item, armour and a inoculator. You can have to sets of weapons, which can be freely swapped in combat. These consist of 1H/2H weapon and 2 signums. You start with 3 tabs in your inventory and 4 tabs in your storage. As for loot and effects, there are more rarity tiers with unique effects and a much wider range of effects. You can have +loot quality and +loot quantity as well. This is much better than D3, as it lets you try out different builds.

In terms of pickups, similar to D3, you have item charges and inoculator charges. These items are utility items, with stats, that can equipped to your character. Items include shields, +crit, grenades or a bunch of other things. Inoculators are basically potions; you can heal and/or buff. There are also tech shrines that grant various buffs, again, similar to D3. You can find some chests marked on your map, but some aren't, so you'll have to spot them on the screen.

Crafting is based on the blueprint and salvageable material system. You can loot them and purchase them in the shop. Blueprints have rarities and are a great way to get a slot-specific item. Blueprints are a minimum rarity of purple. Crafted gear scales to your current level and are a guaranteed rarity. Crafting requires money and salvageable items. To unlock certain crafting features, you must first research them in the tech tree. These cost cash and Fate.

There is only one ""home base"", with a single shop that refreshes every hour. The shop sells all gear types, with rarities up to green. You can also purchase loot crates, which contain multiple items. There are also items which grant buffs that affect the next few missions you take. You can find your inoculator guy, crafting guy, storage, starmap and a few other things in the base. You unlock these things over time. The starmap is your navigation / mission select screen. You can click on something to travel inwards and there's a button at the bottom to zoom out. The controls for this is a bit annoying and you can't skip the animations. You can also find random missions at the bottom of the screen.

Unlike Diablo's open world maps, this game mostly has dungeon-like missions with lots of corridors, which feels a bit repetitive. In that respect, Diablo has more variety. This is still a very good game, full of variety; you have lots of weapons, gear, skill trees, perks and a crafting system. There are also various campaign missions, side missions and difficulty modifiers.

The most annoying thing I found: Temporal AA and Frame Blending can induce nausea (motion sickness), so you probably want to turn that off. There is a lack of tooltips and in-game information for stats, debuffs, effects etc. You will have to look up what they do online, which is quite a pain. Another annoying thing, for melee classes, is sometimes the targeting is clunky, so it's hard to select the mob you want. This is especially true for smaller mobs, or when you're surrounded. This does happen on other games though.",1627029125,1628002255,True,2,0,0.508202314376831055,0,True,False,False

While this game is chalk full of fun to be had, I've noticed it runs extremely hot. Like REALLY hot.
I've got a 10 physical core (20 including hyperthreading) and I've had to watch it like a hawk to make sure it doesn't overheat. 

This is a major pain in an other wise excellent ARPG. I've had it bluescreen multiple times already, each time because of heat. 

Putting that aside, there is a LOT of fun to be had in this ARPG. Deep levelling systems, deep mechanics, and more loot that you can shake a Pyrokinetic staff at. 
Multiplayer is absolutely dead, but I get the feeling like a Discord group could easily set up play-dates for people who own the game to meet up and do that stuff.

Tearing down games just because the have the Warhammer IP only further adds to the damage Games Workshop has done and its as self inflicted as shooting yourself in the foot.

To finally review this game, its a fairly solid ARPG that keeps having a surprising amount of updates. It feels like a big universe with a lot to do and discover. The classes feel unique and have the entire WH40k arsenal at your disposal. The customization is one of the best offered in a warhammer game. The downsides are the game isnt totally optimized graphically, you might get some weird stuttering no matter what settings you toggle, loot sometimes drops inside of walls or underneath the map, and the pricetag to get into this with all the DLC is staggering. Additionally the DLC is packaged in a way that is convoluted and confusing, which i suspect is a method of dissuading dissatisfied players from returning the game.

Pros:
* Enough things to do even without DLCs and with DLCs more than most people need from one game.
* Fun to play and easy to learn basics.
* You will be fine even when starting playing with zero knowledge of this game and bad choices are not as bad for character as in some games (can even reset most things).
* Good amount of tweaks for missions (level/Tarot/etc) and good amount different mini campaigns etc.
* Seasons, weekly things, ...
* Graphics, audio, theme
* Stories are pretty good
* Controls and menus are fine with keyboard+mouse
* No bugs
* Pretty good tutorial and help things inside game for basics

Cons:
* Could have some kind own place, including ""base building"" style thing. Now it's mostly just collecting some characters that gives more missions etc. and you are pretty much living in other characters ship.
* Not enough different styles for missions, many of those are copy&paste of other type. That leaves only like maybe 5 really different kind missions and one where you don't play your character.
* You don't see other players anywhere (no social hubs / places), just chat

That person with the special kind of O.C.D That allows you to perform the most repetitive mundane task, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over over and over and over and over and over and over and over over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again (did i really need that many overs? Yes) Just so you can perfect your build/gear.

Then, aside from the monotony, there is the stupidly slow grind to max level. I'm on 149 hours and only level 86. I use special items to boost my xp (meme virus), I use tarot cards to boost my xp, I make use of weekly events to boost my xp,  Yet It remains painful to level up. I want to hit 100 at least once, but...i just.....can't ...do...it.

I bought the game with all DLC quite cheap, the story was enough to get me to about level 50, at which point any interest just becomes mind numbing spirit crushing repetition. At least through the campaign the monotony is broken up occasionally with missions where you get to pilot a stupidly OP vehicle (imperial knight or tank), There is absolutely zero challenge in these levels, as the vehicles are just that strong, but hey, it was novel. 

This game suffers from the ABSOLUTE worst A.I. I have experienced in any game ever. You drop an AOE and simply walk around that AOE to guide your enemies into it. Sure maybe melee enemies would charge in, but RANGED ATTACKERS???? Why would they not stop before a fatal AOE. This bad A.I. usually works to your advantage, UNLESS you are the tech adept class which relies on A.I. to control your 'pets' (constructs), in which case you will activate a cogitator which releases waves of enemies to attack you, Your numb skull constructs will just sit there until your finished with the cogitator and attack something yourself. Might not make much sense without playing the game, but I assure you, It's really bad game play.

END GAME CONTENT: you may have seen in some of the ads for this game, well END GAME content becomes available at lvl35. The void crusade, which requires consumable items (void shards) to activate. IS THIS A NEW NOVEL WAY TO PASS YOUR TIME IN THIS MONOTONOUS FREAK SHOW......NO. It's just the same regurgitated sh!t you have experienced, only a level increase is applied based on missions accepted.

Does a class change alleviate the monotony? NOOOOO!. It's just a different form of dealing damage. There aren't really specific stories for each class, it's always the same story, The Alpha Pariah. But hey, you have that special kind of O.C.D, well then maybe you can't let go of this game until you have perfected your max level build WITH ALL CHARACTERS. I pity you.

Lastly there are HUGE game breaking bugs i.e You will lose control of your character for no particular reason and you have to mash your keyboard repeatedly to regain control, The EXTREMELY POOR A.I. i have aforementioned, The constant disconnects from the neocore server, no matter how strong your internet connection is, The complete lack of RAM dump saving that would allow you to pick up where you disconnected. BUT DON'T YOU DARE GET ON THE FORUM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, the 5-10 fan bois for this game are lurking there, ready to pounce, to crush any negativity and ultimately get you banned.
You suggest that maybe its the massive grind that stops players from playing past the campaign....CRUSHED. Yet while these same fan bois whinge when they can't get an online match, their advice to anyone with a complaint to ""maybe go play a game you do enjoy?"".

---- RELEASE REVIEW - Not a bad game by any standard but also not all that great. They got the aestheitc right for a WH40K game, they got the voices and characters right for the most part but the gameplay will leave you wanting after a while because...well...it never changes. You'll find a weapon you like and from that point on you will have the same abilities for the rest of the game which is what made me give up after a while. The last 10 hours of play time was me pushing forward as hard as I could to find new gear to try new abilities but they never came. It became very very boring. Unless you have an exceptionally good imagination that can fill in all the gaps then just avoid this. Go back and play Dawn of War or even Dark Omen. Want a decent Dungeon Crawler then go play Path of Exile or Diablo 2. Oh and I forgot to mention how poor the sound effects are, they're just shallow sounds with no dynamic at all. ------",1538160771,1627479832,True,0,0,0.560899317264556885,0,True,False,False

The ranged combat focus adds its own twist, weapons, and sound effects for them are top notch.

It does not offer a vast roster of active skills like other arpgs, instead available skills are decided by weapon, belt, armor. 

It does have a bunch of passive skill trees wich lend to theorycrafting.

Character customization is so-so, limiting you to armor/weapon colors, and a choice from 3 available skin templates for 3 different armors.

 Some of the maps can get repetitive, hopefully more tilesets, map layouts will solve this.

Offers buncha video settings, so game can be potatofied, but only to a certain point. Some potatoes just wont run it well without turning everything to minecraft quality.

527430,96488463,76561197999388638,0,47,4057,0,3468,1689535806,"This game managed to scratch a specific itch I've had for years. ""Diablo, but SciFi."" it's not perfect, but it certainly fits what I am looking for.

So, if you're not a fan of the genre of action RPG where you run around and kill thousands of enemies, take their totally arbitrary stuff that makes no sense and gain XP so you can kill thousands more enemies more efficiently... you should probably turn around now, because this isn't the right game for you.

From the standpoint of a fan of the genre, this doesn't really tread any new territory, but it does what it does pretty well, while also integrating certain thematic elements of Warhammer 40k fairly well. It was also written by people that understand that 40k is satire, so while the game has the 'grimdark' aesthetic down, it does not take itself too seriously and really leans in to the absurdity that is 40k.

The gameplay is familiar. If you play this genre much, you'll pick up the controls in about 0.2 seconds. One thing it adds to the genre is Cover, which is a slightly odd mechanic, but also feels entirely optional, especially depending on what you're playing.

The abilities you have access to are derived from the equipment you're using, which feels a little off to me for the genre, but I don't hate it. A lot of weapons, and all armor is class specific, which leads to not a lot of overlap in what abilities you have.

There are 3 classes (4 if you have Prophecy), and each of those has 3 subclasses- but subclasses just determines what passives you have immediate access to. There is almost 0 customization in your character, once you unlock the TechPriest NPC you can change the color and texture of the armor you're wearing, but that's about it. This feels very dated compared to many other genre entries.

Build customization comes in 4 forms:
Equipment (obvious)
Attributes, each Inquisitor has 3 and gains points to add to them with achievements and certain levels. These don't add a lot of customization, but still some interesting choices to be made there.
Passive skills. Each Inquisitor starts with access to a few passive trees, and gets a point to add every level (plus occasional levels granting 2 points), you can unlock additional trees through achievements, which are shared across your characters. This and equipment are your main customization elements. It's not hard to reset these, so you can always rebuild later if you're bored.
Perks: You eventually unlock 3 Perk slots, perks offer a lot of assorted benefits, and are unlocked through leveling up and achievements. These don't tend to be build-defining, but they really help you fine tune what you can do.

With 4 classes, and that much customization of builds, there's a lot of room to experiment in multiple directions, especially since none of the classes are shoe-horned in to a single specific archetype.

In addition to the main campaign, and side stories from the various DLC, there's also several options for random missions, similar to mapping in Path of Exile, and one thing I really enjoy is that this is available to you from a very early level, so you're not stuck just playing the same few missions over and over.

Each mission is a separate map, which does break immersion some, but it also makes the game very friendly to playing when you have a real life, because you can just sit down and play a mission or two, giving you a nice easy stopping point with no loss of progress. It also allows the game to span numerous planets, stations, ships, etc.

There's tons of loot, and plenty of space to pick up and store the loot. The game stops dropping mundane items very quickly, which I appreciate. There is an auto-pickup function as well, and you can set what rarity you want it to pick up, so you can always fine tune your looting if you don't want to pick everything up. There's also item crafting and item modification, which serves as a solid currency sink.

Depending on your playstyle, beating just the main campaign seems like it's ~15-20 hours of gameplay. At the time of review, 57 hours, I beat the main campaign once, got most of the way through it a second time, rand a number of side stories and side missions, and dabbled with one other character.

Okay, they've made a ton of fixes and updates, and it plays a fair bit better than I remember. Cover is less of a thing (the controls for that are still balls, but at least they don't matter as much), and a lot of the randomized missions have gotten a lot better balance-wise. 

They're going with a seasons system a la Diablo 3, which works for people who like that.

Overall, I'm switching this to a thumbs up. If you like Diablo-esque games and love 40k, snatch this thing up.

Orig. Review:

I want to like this game. I really do.

I REALLY do. I love the Van Helsing series these guys did. In fact, after writing this review I'm going to go back to playing that.

If it isn't obvious at this point, I have to not recommend this game at this time.

It tries to be a strategy game and an action RPG, and it kind of fails at both. Movement is slow and cumbersome, but not in a cool Warhammer 40k way. There is a cover mechanic that is just a pain to attempt to use.

Magic loot adventures are magic, loot and adventurey. The missions themselves are very unbalanced from the bit I've been able to play it. After a bit in the story, it opens up and has randomly generated missions that range wildly in finish-a-bility. The loot from each adventure is... rather standard. Nothing impressive. Not a ton of fun here.

The character's skills and upgrades on that note are, like... a bit on the confusing side and not very well explained. The mechanics seem to be there but there aren't any overarching goals that I can understand.

Overall, the game just... doesn't feel fun to play for me. I'm still gonna peek in every once in a while to see if it's changed (and I'll update this thing if stuff changes), but as of right now? Go pick up the Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.",1531194213,1627073545,True,0,0,0.549839258193969727,0,True,False,False

The game its self is pretty fun, it's like Diablo but in the 40k setting, I got this while the game was on sale, I love 40k so I figured I'd give this a shot, and truth be told, I like it a lot.

Then there was getting more involved in the the options for gear fabrications / alterations alongside the character building. I love how this game presents ways you can invest in building your strengths and knowing you weaknesses.
The plot is thick, the characters are memorable, and the twists and turns in the game universe are exciting. The game play is rewarding, handling fights is a thrill, and the glory of all the enhanced equipment you could shake a stick at it completely exotic. The game feels fulfilling and extensive, and all the extra sidequests available, as well as grinding material, really makes for an incredible game to experience.

The good is the setting and the atmosphere with the backdrops.  The collection of enemies along the way and how an Inquisitor can have an odd assortment in a retinue.

The bad however far outweighs this.

The story within for the setting can never be canon due to it's implications.

The script for the voice actors is terrible at best.  For example an inquisitor casually talking about chaos with their subordinates.  Not something most citizens get to know about without then no longer being to know anything.  Indeed many examples in the lore entire planets populations let alone ship crew have been exterminated for having the knowledge.

The voice acting is utterly abysmal.  I winced several times and put the volume down.

The map overlay is useful but always in the way.

The UI being in the way for moving away from enemies or targeting them if they're around the top of bottom left of the screen.

Sniper range being the range enemies become aware of you instantly.  Yay.  The assassin play through I did was real fun with that.

The final battle just a ridiculous slog fest.

The game is obviously set out in the grinding style, something which no longer appeals to me at all.

The grind fest and even just a campaign play through is boring repetitive game play.  Later the maps just get bigger with bigger groups of enemies to make it even grindier.

The controls are a MESS.  Move with cursor keys, but dodge, switch weapons etc are w,a,s,d tab and weapon alternative fire 1 and 2.  oh did I mention you also need to click the mouse buttons to fire?  And target something by moving the cursor over it?  

Want a good loot drop?  Destroy every piece of scenery you can.  I was getting 1 - 2 relics per map with it however this takes a looooong time especially later on and for the whole get the loot approach, I went over the refund time.

It felt a chore to finish the main game.  I honestly would have went for a refund if I hadn't played just over the time allowed.  And that was entirely just clearing what would be the tuition levels pretty much.",1627004245,1627007472,False,1,0,0.514714062213897705,0,True,False,False

Darksiders Genesis, for example, has a much much better controller support.

The game is entirely single player and they decided to have an internet connection. Big mistake that causes new bugs.

There is no Necro Tao and Orcs and others.

This game is absolutely worth the price as well as your time. Two things I always personally look for in these kinds of games as absolute ""must-have's"" are Replayability and Room to experiment with builds. This game has both of these qualities and it isn't immediately apparent by just looking at the trailer and screenshots.  if you play the Crusader, you could be anything from the quintessential Heavy Bolter-toting space marine to a flamethrower build focused on blanketing damage and burn dot's. The game has a ""Cover System"" that isn't mandatory to play effectively but can be used to compliment and in some cases even be a main function of some builds. The story and voice acting is, as far as i'm concerned, the best you could expect, this genre of game isn't known for it's phenomenal voice acting or plot, but this game didn't have me rolling my eyes, which was enough for me to become reasonably immersed. I completely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for an ARPG game that doesn't have shallow, singular, predetermined class builds with meaningless faux-customization like Diablo 3.

That said, now that i've played it, it's easily one of my favorite of the recent Warhammer 40k games to come out recently. THe game plays really well, and the aesthetic of the world is absoluteley on point, and to my delight, mowing down hordes of nurglings with a heavy bolter is every bit as fun as fighting a traitor guard tank. Speaking of enemies, all the big boys are here. Chaos daemons and traitor marines are here as usual, but there's also Eldar of both varieties, Tyranids, even normal rebel guardsmen make a showing, and i feel like for the most part they're done justice. If anything, i feel like traitor marines may feel a little on the weak side, but that's just me.

Now for the cons.

Like many 40k games, it seems to have suffered a bit in the budget department, in my opinion there are a few areas where it really feels like the devs just didn't have the resources to realize their vision, but it doesn't really detract from the experience that often. The only major instances where this rears its head is in the music department, which is unmemorable at best and totally absent at worst, and the graphics occasionally look dated even by the standards of the indie games that came out at the same time as it. But again, this was never big enough to impact my enjoyment of it.

All in all, it's a fun Diablo like that really sells the fantasy of being an inquisitor in the 40k setting. I'm really happy that i bought it, and if Warhammer 40k and Diablo are your jam, i highly reccomend it.",1626477419,1626477419,True,3,0,0.54703831672668457,0,True,False,False

It became a chore to load this game up and play through whatever you can call the campaign. If you can call it a story. You'll play the same environments, the same hubs, collecting gear that all resemble each other with different colored paint slapped on em. I love the lore of 40k, but this game doesn't capture it. If you're coming from a 40k high, either from reading the books or playing the table top, this game won't sustain you. Or maybe it will. Different strokes for different folks. 

I was just honestly let down, my expectations loading this up were way to high. My wide smile quickly turned flat and my eyes glossed over as the 15th mission I played pretty much resembled the first. Fighting hordes of chaos daemons was THRILLING at first, but the longer you play the less threatening and imposing they became. In my play-through I didn't see Chaos marines or did I fight with other Space Marines (maybe I didn't get far enough into it?). 

Great template though! If they just put a little bit more elbow grease into this, it would be a really great game that captures the deprivation of the 40k atmosphere. I wish I could be neutral here. I would only recommend this game on a deep sale, between 30% - 50% (yea seriously). Don't pay full price, I truly believe you won't get your money's worth. GAME ON MY FRIENDS!

The gameplay is the same mindless clickfest it is in Diablo, with some judicious dodging and running the fuck away added on the higher difficulty levels. There are tons of enemy types, and the kill animations are gory, but the right level of detail was not quite achieved, and, when fighting a big battle, it is hard to see what is going on. Bosses can be executed, but, again, the animation lacks something. Considering how simplistic the core gameplay is, the amount of work that went into fleshing out the game is surprising: there are several character classes to choose from, the biggest and most complicated skill tree I have ever seen, the most complicated crafting and upgrade system I have ever seen, a separate customize screen for your inoculator (stimpak, basically), a shop, several other shops, a ton of mission types which can be customized using Tarot cards, and I'm just getting started. Frankly, it's a bit overwhelming, and, even having finished the game, I haven't completely figured it all out. I would have preferred a little less of that, and a little more of other things. Like, for example, it is obvious that all the texts were written by a non-native English speaker. Surely, editors are not that expensive? I have great respect for the folks at Neocore, but they have clearly allowed their reach to exceed their grasp.

Now for the most important part: this is a game for WH40k fans, by WH40k fans. If Inquisitor is your first encounter with the Warhammer 40000 universe, you will probably not enjoy it much, because there are so, so many things you will not be able to understand or appreciate. The amazing story and dialogue could only have been written by someone with a deep knowledge and love of the Warhammer lore, which are also made obvious by the painstakingly created environments and character models.

Now there is no real way to mitigate HP loss on a psyker when your heat is in unhinged. Spawning warp anomalies and demons everywhere is already a heavy price to pay for staying in unhinged why FORCE the players to lose HP as well ? Inverse Warp Attenuation transformed the HP loss into HP gain which might have been a but unbalanced but they could have just made it into a perk that just stops the HP loss. Other perks which reward you for staying in unhinged are now useless as well since staying in unhinged basically means you die after using 2 powers.
All in all making changes like these without testing them is just a big NO for me as I've invested hours in this gave and my character/build is now unplayable.

EDIT: the psyker nerf continues. Now they taught it was a good idea to make anomalies spawn every second if you're in red heat.

* Pros
[+] The graphics and destructible environments are pretty good. Lots of small bits of debris and gore fly everywhere during combat.
[+] Voice acting fits 40k perfectly.
[+] Sound effects are great for all weapons, my favorites are the Auto Gun and Lasgun. (not sure about melee ones though, i didn't use those)
[+] Some of the environments are really cool the first few times you fight in them.
[+] Nice to have a game where you play as an Inquisitor.

* Cons
[-] Game is 75 gigabytes big
[-] It takes forever to startup
[-] SUPER repetitive gameplay
[-] Your character can't move and shoot unless its the heavy flamer, or a specific ability for that weapon. Your character will move, stop to shoot, then move again.
[-] You can't continuously shoot from cover. Just like moving your character will shoot, duck down, then shoot.
[-] Cover isn't very useful.
[-] Lots of enemy model variety, but lots of them act pretty much the same.
[-] The game is very easy, I had to put it on Impossible to have any kind of challenge.
[-] Maps start to look and feel the same very quickly.
[-] Maps are WAY too big for what the objectives usually are.
[-] Objectives and map design are extremely boring. Almost every objective is Kill Things, Walk forever to your destination killing things, Then interact with or kill objective. This sequence can work in games, but the combat is so repetitive that its a slog to get through.
[-] Story was meh.

UPDATE July 2021: So I decided to give the game a second chance after seeing it on sale. While visually the game still looks the same, I was able to look past that and judge the game on the fun factor. The game has changed somewhat since I originally played and I must say for the better. After the release of the 2.0 patch, many annoyances were fixed. Combat definitely flows better and gameplay was not as clunky as when it was released. The game added challenges and crafting improved somewhat. It also has several map types including void crusades which I found to be fun but repetitive. The one thing I enjoyed the most was the story. Warhammer has always had over-the-top violence and the game plays off it beautifully. I really enjoyed the campaign. The game has a huge following and the community was the best part. I met several players from across the world and each has their own take on why they love the game so much. Some of my action RPG friends feel that the game lacks oomph and is bland, but I feel that the game has enough for anyone to enjoy.

I also did not appreciate how every story interaction dragged my Tech Adept away from his pets right before the start of every boss fight, once even locking them on the other side of a door.

1) It requires you to be online. So if you have a dodgy internet connection, don't spend the money. Few things are more frustrating than disconnecting mid-mission and losing that progress.

2) The movement feels a little clunky and occasionally unresponsive. Sometimes it takes a couple of attempts for the game to recognise I've tried to use a skill or move to a location. It's not deal-breaking, but it's not as smooth as other ARPGs like Torchlight 2, Diablo 3 RoS, or Grim Dawn.

That aside, if you enjoy the 40k Universe and the above two points are not a deal-breaker, then this is a fun game.

There is something joyful about tromping down the halls of infested buildings with a heavy flamer, purifying the enemies of the Imperium with the Emperor's cleansing fires. I can't speak to the other classes yet, but the Crusader Heavy Gunner has been a lot of fun to play.

Small issues from when you teleport in and out of zones, the visual effect isn't always centered or even on your character(s).   Enemies don't respond or behave properly around players.  AI for minions is pretty bad at times, watching them shoot walls or stand around doing nothing isn't fun at all.

The game world you ""explore"" is probably the number one complaint I have.  You teleport into very basic levels that are all extremely similar, with only very slightly different tile sets.   I'll summarize what you'll be doing from level 1 onward:
1) Teleport into one of a few very basic and standard level layouts
2) Run around slowly killing stuff until you win the mission objective or you clicked on a few objective points
3) Teleport back to main menu where you select next mission from a spreadsheet and repeat

The game is just a serious of teleporting form the main menu to a small generic level, killing stuff, and repeating over and over.   I know other games like Diablo, Path of Exile, and more aren't all that much different, but it feels different to me when you're exploring a world rather than just being teleported into generic battle maps over and over and over.

Ultimately, I got this game on sale, years after release... and as an ARPG fan I'm reminded why I skipped this game on launch... it just isn't very fun.   If you've finished Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Diablo 3, Wolcen, and Last Epoch... and you're still hungry for more ARPG action, I wouldn't recommend this game.  I find myself bored and can't motivate myself to do more than 1-2 levels before exiting the game each time.

OH, and one last thing, the skill system and leveling is extremely boring.  Almost everything is just a passive boost to damage or defense.  Very rarely do you unlock a functional or gameplay changing ability and in most cases they don't feel very good.   The weapons you use come with their skills attached already so it's really just unlocking generic core buffs and abilities for your chosen class with very little to make it feel unique or inspired.",1625254099,1625254099,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have a perfectly stable internet connection: 
Story: The game is set in a dark universe, and you as the inquisitor set out to explore a decrepit ship and all its mysteries since it got lost in some warp anomaly 5,000 years ago. It doesn't overwhelm you with 40k lore, and only hints at things instead of infodumping most of the time. I wish more franchises took their storytelling as seriously as this studio did.
Gameplay: You choose one of 3 classes, which I feel should have been backed up with a bit more explanation like little video shorts, but a lot of it doesn't matter too much. I did the opening missions for 15 times a piece(had to do it several times for one because of DC issues, hence going over 2 hours). Until I decided on the psyker, the kinda mage class. The other two were just as tempting though, but I liked how clean sweep the psykers were. Having the best skills. I later realized your character doesn't have as many skills, it's actually the weapons you carry. Your skills as a psyker come with penalties which work on a ""the more you use them the more likely something bad will happen"". The skills for a psyker aren't nearly as good as your weapon skills, so I found I rarely ever used them. That's a rather weak argument for the skill system. I honestly prefer the way a game like Grim Dawn handled class and skills, and really don't like the swap system, especially when you find a new weapon every mission, and have to pass on it because it has crappy skills compared to yours. Better damage, but skills you don't wanna use.
The missions as far as gameplay go are a little tedious, but that's where the bread and butter of the story comes in. As an inquisitor you have to assemble a rag tag group of rather odd individuals to help assist you in your quest. Some help with being vendors/utilities while others enable PvP and what not.
The side missions are a bit of a spray and pray as far as sense goes. I've gotten missions from people I haven't rescued yet or have never seen like I should know them, contacting me on the comm. They should have unlocked as you rescue people, but they don't, they're just always there. There was also a lot of quests for areas much lower level than yours, giving me no incentive to do them because I got crappier rewards. The incentive for using higher difficulty also isn't well explained(or isn't worth it at all because I can't really find what the increases pertain to) Plus you do 95% less damage and take 200% more damage taken at max difficulty without an increase to XP even. Which is just confusing.
Sound: The guns don't really sound that different. One is a laser pistol, one is a flame thrower, and one is a gun-gun. A lot of the skills just sound like weird emp bombs or grenades. I found the stereo audio would often times make something slightly to your left sound like it was the farthest to the left it can possibly go.  I'm not sure if that's a design choice or a game engine problem but it was a tad weird to experience. Overall things sound roughly like they should. The voice acting took a lot more effort than I thought, despite the dry moments at times.
If you don't have a stable internet connection at all times: This game is unplayable. Forget playing with friends, it's just not playable single player! Despite being advertised as a single player game. All I wanted was a single player ARPG to pass the time, but anytime I get disconnected I get kicked out of the mission and lose my progress. Why NEOCORE, why?! So yeah, if you have an internet with crappy reception, steer clear of this ""single player"" game because it lies like a rug. I honestly begged steam due to false advertising and even explained by game time was over 2 hours because I was stuck replaying missions multiple times because I wanted to give it a fair chance before I gave up on it. I also pleaded to the Devs to fix it, but they have no intention of doing so because they need a stable connection for events. Which is fine! Just don't kick me out of missions if I DC, that's the worst! If I didn't have to restart every time I rejoined it would be so much easier, but I do, and that's completely f'ed up.",1625187334,1625187334,False,25,3,0.541042029857635498,0,True,False,False

As an ARPG, it's super solid. Combat feels impactful and punchy. Difficulty curve and difficulty in general are excellent. It's not faceroll easy like all other ARPGs. I haven't reached endgame yet, but from what I've seen, it looks hefty.

First experience with it, I played it for 30 mins, found it a bit clunky and the weapon I was using a bit annoying, so I uninstalled it and tried for a unsuccessful refund.

I decided to write it off and went to play persona 4 for a bit. A few months later the ARPG itch returned, and whilst searching reddit for a recomendation, this popped back up. Decided to give it a longer try, but this time  looked for decent builds.

I decided to go with a heavy flamethrower DOT build. 

Since then I've not turned back, I'm about 50 hours deep now, spent countless hours burning Xenos across the galaxy.

There is a ton of content with the types of missions, crusades, campaign etc.

If you're after build variety like POE or D2, it isn't here. I've more or less been using the same moves my entire play through.

There are some annoying bugs and balance issues, but they havn't effected me too much.

There are some janky bits in here from time to time, but the love for both the ARPG genre as well as the 40k universe oozes from every Nurgle-blessed orifice.

A few highlights to me:
[b]Story[/b]

It's pretty good with few plotholes and that surprised me. I was actually invested in it and it taught me things about the 40k universe that I did not know. The writing is also very 40k, even though the voice acting didn't always deliver it as powerful as it could have. The characters are again very 40k with most of them being complete sociopaths. You also have to make some tough choices. The first choice I had to make in the main story had me thinking long and hard and I liked that

[b]Weapons[/b]

The game comes with a wide variety of weapons and they're all fun to use. From the iconic chainsword and bolter to fusion guns and grenade launchers. They're all viable, all very 40k and all feel satisfying to unleash upon the enemy.

[b]Heretics, aliens and mutants[/b]

Plenty of beautiful units with their own attack patterns coming to you straight from the 41st millenium. Daemons, cultists, Tyranids, Drukhari and Chaos space marines are complimented by big glorious bosses like Leman Russ battletanks, Helbrutes and Carnifexes. My one big gripe in this area is that you really need to stretch the lore to allow an Inquisitor to mow down Chaos Space Marines and Tyranid Warriors like they're nothing, but ehhh would be boring if you'd just got to fight cultists all the time :)

[b]Stuff[/b]

There's so. much. stuff. in this game. Plenty of main and side missions, rewards, dailies, weeklies, void crusades, invasions, tarot cards to modify missions as well as a whole bunch of gameplay systems to interact with. From the usual things like a shop, crafting and slotting gems in gear to reforging, modifying your health potions with different effects and combining special gems for even more powerful effects. 
In short: STUUUUUUUUFFFF

[b]A few things I don't like[/b]

=> Enemies can be hard to click on sometimes when you're doing melee attacks. I have to learn to let go of the mousebutton and click on them properly
=> Some janky animations on the purity seals depending on the weapons you have equiped
=> The main campaign uses the same mission environments for too long. You spend a large portion of your initial hours plodding through similar looking corridors and it can get quite repetitive. I recommend doing some side missions to spice things up as you go along

[b]In all[/b]

Get this game if you're an ARPG fan!

Invariably compared to Diablo 3 but I would argue it has even more replay value.  In Diablo you play the exact same plot but with different classes. The ""Classes"" in Martyr (Crusader, Assassin, Tech Priest, and Psycher), have different dialogues, missions, and their own perspective on the central plot.  It's kind of like 4 good one player games wrapped into one.

Certainly the missions can get repetitive but there are so many weapons to play around with.  Consider : Laspistols, inferno pistols, plasma pistols, grav pistols, bolt pistols, and auto pistols.  You can equip any two of those or use a pistol and shield (two kinds of shields), or a pistol and a hand weapon (several kinds of single hand weapons), or use two of the same kinds and unlock unique attacks.  That's just the pistol options for a single class.  There are also standard weapons, heavy weapons, and two handed close combat weapons. I never get tired of building an arsenal of weapons and gradually tweaking them. 

As far as enemies there are chaos (Khorne and Nurgle), rebel Imperial guard, Tyranids, Eldar, and Dark Eldar.  Each enemy unit fights differently based on their skills and specialties. 

There is an Insane amount of missions to do with side plots, crusades, special missions, etc...

I've tried some of the other classes and it seems like there is quite a huge difference in gameplay mechanics, which really makes me excited to also level those up, and see which one I enjoy most.

Seems to have a very good baseline, definitely a hell of a lot of thought put into the game.

But do not buy it, it runs so badly that even on a beast of a PC it runs like a steaming pile of excrement.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

A Diablo like game in the Warhammer universe.  That's great!  It really captured the look and sounds of Warhammer.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

It just wasn't that much fun to keep grinding it out.  The gear drops were meh, the enemies were meh, the missions were meh.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

It wasn't that great, so while I beat the game, I didn't have a need to keep playing.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

* Co-op is available
* Straight up fun and rewarding

Cons

* Kind of clunky movement at times - you'll probably get stuck on inanimate objects often.

The Good

- Better Story
This is probably due to the rich world of 40k that Inquisitor draws from.
Often when playing Grim Dawn I'd lose interest since the story it completely unknown to me and I have no real ties to it, (still a great game though)

-Voice Acting
Grim Dawn has little voice acting. This may contribute to the above point.

-Different Missions
You can do additional different missions which can be spiced up with additional random modifiers which can add more rewards

- Appropriately Grim Dark Setting
Remains true to the setting of Warhammer 40k

The Bad

- Graphics
Can be hard to see some of the smaller enemies as they blend in with the Grim Dark setting. Not as fluid or as vibrant as Grim Dawn (then again the art choice is probably due to the Grim Dark setting).

-Mouse Controls
Can be a bit finicky (compared to Grim Dawn) and I've found targeting in melee to be hard. My solution, go ranged and hold shift to ""attack ground"" whilst clicking. 

The Different

- Weapon Based not Skill Based. 
Grim Dawn has more of a focus on the characters inherent skills and abilities and uses items to enhance those. Whereas in Inquisitor has it the other way round, it is the weapon that gives you the abilities and your perks / skills are used to enhance those.  

-No Legendary Sets
As far as I know all weapons and items are randomly created, so no cookie-cutter ideal item combos like Grim Dawn. I see this as a good thing as it makes each play through unique.


Overall once I got used to the differences I found Inquisitor to be a really fun game. So fun in fact I've been staying up too late to play.",1623684488,1623684488,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Co-op feels like mush because of laggy network connection. And you can't do end game stuff with friends - only randomly generated missions with repetative grinding fest. What?

This is hurts, because game have cool ideas like psalm combining for example and adding more difficulty throught tarot cards.

I had my doubts before purchasing, but this game is a god send to people, who wants a fun warhammer 40k title (which are honestly few and far between).

-It's action packed, plenty of explosions and gore, with a soundtrack that is actually very fitting and enjoyable. A lot of explosions - which in this game, fits perfectly. You are commanding the emperor's choosen inquisitor after all, who is technically a two legged walking tank.
-Skill system is pretty in dept, but comprehensive. Has skill trees (like path of exile) but they are separate entities, based around a theme (damage, health, aoe, etc...), not one big mess of a web (which might be a turn of to some, but for me is the nice balance between customizability and useablity).
-This game had to be written by fans. Pretty much every conversation/log entry/cinematic was written with love, by people who know and love this universe. I am not a super in dept warhammer 40k loremaster, but like the universe, and the way the story is presented feels like a love letter to warhammer 40k fans. The main story so far is interesting (nothing to crazy), but the script is just perfect. I constantly find myself cackling on what the different characters are saying. Also like the voice acting a lot so far.
-It honestly feels very polished, haven't met any annoying glitches so far (slight narrative issues in the beginning, but that's pretty much it).

I have no oppinion about the co-op/pvp side (in ARPGs, for me these where always nice ""extras"" instead of the main focus), but this game feels like a must pick up for someone looking for a good, entertaining warhammer 40k gorefest game to play. it's also good, if you just liked the new DOOM games (like eternal), since those were influenced by warhammer as well, and maybe wanted to try them as an arpg.

What I liked:

- Excellent action-focused combat. Throwing a grenade in a group of enemies, jumping in the middle of the explosion with your jet pack and finishing off the remaining enemies with a chain saw sword feels incredible.

- The ability to increase the difficulty for every mission (with higher rewards) is superb, since lots of aRPG's are way too easy. In the random missions you can use tarot cards for extra challenges (and rewards) which is great as well.

- Lots of loot, crafting, enchanting, improving gear and upgrades in over a dozen categories make the game very addictive.

- Built-in clan system with additional rewards.

What I didn't like:

- You have only 4 skills to use in combat and the skill set depends on your weapon. There is no unlocking of additional skills later in the game, which makes it rather repetitive after a while.

- Graphics are mediocre. The base game lacks variety in environments and many objects are re-used over and over again. Luckily the expansion adds several new and unique environments.

- The game requires a permanent internet connection for no good reason at all.

The story is decent. Few twists and turns, not hard to follow considering.

Gameplay is quite weighty. Big improvements were made in the release of Prophecy a couple years ago. Total overhaul of combat system and flow. Huge improvements imo. Movement is fast and responsive. Hits are gory and epic. Ranged gameplay is there, but lets be honest, You will want to run around and hack demons with melee weapons. Ranged combat, although usable, just doesn't do it for me quite like traditional hack and slash melee.

Voice acting is meh, a couple interesting characters met throughout. Animations on some things are a bit scuffed ie. executions (no sound for execution kills). Visual bugs are a few and funny. Performance is quite good, few places get boggy ie. foggy swamps with 10-20 enemies all beating you to death at once. Other than those few places, runs great. Average 100-120fps. 

Loot is interesting. I have not reached ultimate endgame crusade grinding yet. Builds that I have at my current disposal are good, just don't expect PoE type depth.

Worth every single cent I spent on it. 
The ambience, the scenarios, the stories, the writing, the atention to detail and Lore is immense. I cant stress enough how polished and expansive the game feels. The sound is mostly amazing, the enemy variety is astonishing. As of now my character is on the level 50s and I havent finished all the main campaings that the game offers. Difficulty scales well and rewards with additional tokens for tech tree, progression feels just fast enough to feel rewarding without being too fast that I feel spoiled, or too slow so that the game feels like a job. The game offers a lot of information on its mechanics, there is nothing that is not covered and can be easily accesed. In no point in time I felt like I didnt know what I was doing and any doubts I had I could look it up ingame, without having to google for it. 
The character I used was the Arch-Adept from the Prophecy expansion, I love Adeptus Mechanicus faction and being able to play something close to and Arch-Priest with lots of constructs is great.

Without any doubt one of the highest quality warhammer 40k games I have played. Hooked me right away as I played the first mision.

I love the Warhammer universe, and there were so many mechanics offered by the different DLC. The Inquisitor investigation missions seemed like an interesting mechanic, and, while playing, you can really feel like a cog in the giant machine that is the Imperium. 

Rose tinted glasses aside, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. After the slow-paced, forced tutorial missions, the game throws a lot of different metrics at the player quickly, which are not that intuitive in the beginning. The battlefields are somewhat varied and interesting, and some of them really look fantastic, such as when you are on a tall building looking down during missions set in the hive environments. One of the main problems I found was the pathfinding in general. I feel like it should be much easier when I am controlling short distances with my mouse for the character to follow. If there is just an edge for the character to get caught on, they will. Some of the ground missions have attempted to have foliage and other debris around the landscape to make it look more interesting, but many times it makes it difficult to really see where there is a slope you can freely traverse and where there is a piece of landscape that your character will find out is a dead end and become trapped. Hopefully you don't find this out while you are attempting to retreat to use your inoculator, which serves as your medical resource. The inoculator is interesting insofar that you can adjust to it have different properties based on your level and different types of little modules that can boost damage, health, and the cooldown for using it again. Strangely the default key for it is 0, which happens to be a large distance away from the standard keyboard hand placement. I changed my use button to something much more realistic, although when changing my video settings back to default, I discovered that the default setting runs across the board and also resets keybindings as well. That was an easy feature to discover on a one life mission, which did not end well for the Inquisition. 

I believe that I can overlook problems as long as the gameplay is solid. The thing that really made me decide to uninstall and write a review was the hit detection. Fighting large boss creatures was difficult, as they would have a large amount of burst damage and DoTs that would kill you unless kited properly. Using the assassin sniper character, when trying to aim at the edge of the top area in the screen would allow me to target the enemy, but then as I got closer the health bar would appear up top, and force my character to think I wanted to aim for the middle of the screen instead, firing my rounds off into the ground instead of the enemy itself. Other times, the game will move you next to the enemy before doing anything, which could be deadly with the melee attacks or different damage auras. Attempting to swivel the camera to they would come from the side allowed them too close for me to be able to move quickly enough to avoid their large damage attacks. In other levels, if there is a pillar in the way, and your mouse happens to slide over it during combat, the game thinks you are aiming in an entirely different direction. 

Other than that, my only other gripe that I can think of it the rarity system. This is the only game I have played that runs in the order of white, blue, green, purple, and orange. I was trashing greens in favor of blues simply because they have always been the more inferior rarity in almost every other game that classifies loot with a color system. There is a metric that displays the different ""qualities"" that is supposed to let you know at a glance which one is better, but it seems that the only measurement is like a point system, with certain attributes scoring way higher than others, so it was easy to toss a more useful piece of equipment.

Overall, if you absolutely adore the Warhammer universe, you might be able to overcome the problems and find a decent game, but for me, the chaos in the mechanics won out in the end and I gave up like a dirty heretic.",1623214103,1623214103,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

TLDR: If you're gonna make a game where your skills and character gameplay are tied to gear and weapons, have more variety of said gear and weapons, and don't have only 4 skills per set with one of them being your basic goddamn attack...with another one being your basic attack while moving backwards; yes that is a separate skill in this game.


Ok so why the harshness? 2 years after release they have to have fixed all the problems right?

Yes and no. On the one hand the game is as polished as it will probably ever be, at least on the technical side of things. Sure there's the odd typo here and there but unless you're a grammar hunter you won't really care. On the other hand though, the game suffers from fundamental and unfixable design flaws.

Unfortunately the devs decided to make a console ARPG, something along the lines of what Blizzard decided to do, and in order to accomplish that they've implemented the skill system in a 4x4x2 fashion. And while being a controller friendly setup, the game really suffers from variety in terms of skills. They did make an attempt to relieve this problem by making a Psyker type character, but then it was hamstrung by another poor design decision - all skills are tied to weapons.

[h1] What you actually get to play [/h1]
So lets dissect this situation in a little bit more detail.
Any and all characters have 2 weapon sets, with 4 skills per weapon set, plus 1 armor skill and plus 1 utility skill. Your character has NO SKILLS. You only get passives. Not only that, but most of these generic passive trees are overlapping with other characters. Critical Chance passive tree is available for all. Same for Defense, Health, Melee, Physical, Ranged, AoE, DoT etc.

Essentially  your only customization options in terms of how you play is your gear. There are classes that allow you to assign your own skills to the bar, albeit in a very convoluted way, but those too are fairly limited.

I can hear you saying:
""Well that's not a big deal, there are quite successful games that tie skills to items, such as Grim Dawn for example"" and yes that would be true.

Sadly, when it comes to actual gear slots you don't really have that much. there's only 2 gear slots that actually provide you with skills, that being your Armor and Utility. Armor variety is really meh, since there's only THREE class specific skills you have to CHOOSE from. Can't use 2 or all 3. The overall weapon variety is also pretty insulting. You have 2-3 Two-Handed melee weapons, 2-3 One Handed melee, about 5 Rifles, 5 Pistols and 5 Heavy Weapons. And to make matters worse, your BASIC ATTACK is a skill. Yes you read that right, in a game that only has 4 slots per weapon set for skills, one of those is taken up by your basic attack.

What was really insulting is the lack of imagination when implementing those skills. Imagine for a moment that you find a flame thrower. Cool right? 40k, cleanse and purge, awesome! Yeah, but your first skill is shoot while moving forward (I'm not making that up, your movement is tied to the skill) and your second skill is shoot while moving backwards... That is TWO skill slots gone for the act of having a basic attack! Never have I seen such lazy work compounded on such a flawed design framework.

The really sad thing is that the devs know it too. They tried to work around the limitations of the system by making the Psyker and Techboy more customizable, but now that means that out of the 4 classes, two are almost identical, while the other 2 are a DIY type situation. Sadly, it's like having the option to make something in your garage, but instead choosing to make stuff with ducktape and leftover rusty nails. Yeah you can make something, but it will always have nails and it will reek of rusty metal.

All of this results in an extremely shallow game. To illustrate the idea: Imagine you get to play any ARPG with the starting weapon from start to finish to then END GAME. That's right, the weapon and skills attached to said weapon you get at the beginning of the game, will still present the same gameplay to you at the end levels. And yeah, you can swap to your 2nd set of weapons, but it is slow, clunky, and often times it's difficult to figure out if the swap actually happened. Obviously by the time you figure it out your cooldowns have reset,  so just keep bashing with your first set of weapons.

[h1] Forget about the gameplay, How's the 40k? [/h1]

Well just like before it's both good and bad. On one hand the gore, viscera and overall catharsis of slaughtering hordes of demons, xenos and heretics is definitely present. The environmental design is also very well executed for the most part. Ships and manifactorums feel massive and very religious-y. Always tons of statues, massive pillars and loads of exposed servitor flesh. Yeah, the environments are Gothic to the core, at least the indoor ones. Outdoor? Yeah you get a heightmap with 2 looped textures over 3 detail layers. The bare minimum of terrain work. So don't expect much 40k there.

And let me come back to weapons for a moment. I'm sure you're thinking about some of the cooler 40k weapons. I'm sure you'd wanna play with lightning claws, or power fists, or dual wielding force swords or maybe a force halberd...hell maybe power scythes or some other crazy exotic weapons. Do you think you can do that in this game? Let me make this ez for you: nope.jpg

You get a Thunder Hammer and a Power Sword (which has TWO SKILLS, ONE of those skills is your basic attack...) Oh and you also get a chainsword and an eviscerator sword. That's kind of it.

[h1] Story and Audio [/h1]

Ok this one is also a mixed bag. Story wise the game presents very interesting situations that could have massive ramifications on the lore, which is really a breath of fresh air from the generic stories we get on other ARPG's. There's also a very nice ""morality"" system in place, although if you know 40k, you know you're an evil mass murderer, so your real options are a fanatical mass murderer or an ""independent"" free thinking mass murderer.

Regardless of what you choose though, it's all butchered by the VO work. Some voices are solid, if a bit generic, but unfortunately the Assassin (which is gender locked to female) is voiced so poorly it is actually cringe inducing at times. Probably the worse VO deliveries. If Alyx and Cortana share Everest, this one is equivalent to a sewer system under the Marianas Trench.

In terms of SFX this game probably has THE BEST sounding Bolter and Heavy Bolter. Honestly it's worth watching a video just to hear the shear level of auditory destruction. It's amazing to listen to. If the Bolter had more than 3 skills it would probably also be enjoyable for more than 5 missions.

[h1] Speaking of missions [/h1]

Generic design. Defend. Escort. Rescue. Wipe out. Collect. Secure etc. you know what you're in for. There are some nice meta-game choices when playing, but they are superficial at best. An example being that you have to assault some planet and you have 4 options to choose from on how to do it. Calling it a text adventure would be like calling the fridge note an essay.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

And there you have it. It's OK for 4-5 hours but the game quickly runs out of steam. If you have limited skill slots, you better do your best to make the few you have as unique and useful as possible...instead of wasting slots with something that in other games is done with the LMB.",1623191778,1623191778,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Great immersive campaign and universe.
- Really nice graphics for an ARPG (even on my donkey of a GTX 870m).
- Great music, effects and voice acting (well from the main protagonist, others can be variable).
- Enjoyable game-play. It's about D2 / Grim Dawn pace, which I enjoy, but not as fast as POE / D3.
- Great skills system / build variety.
- Great Crafting, craft items, mod items, mod mods, mod skills, mod flasks.

- Only negatives I have is that be careful what you name your account as you can't change it from 'in game' and the cover system is stupidly annoying, but I've basically turned it off in the options which makes the game a much smoother experience although you do sometimes get stuck on terrain a bit and can get a little janky.
- Also strongly recommend binding W/S for back/forward and A/D for rotate camera right/left (unless you really like using your middle mouse button), which you'll sometimes need to do although you can just click to move it makes the whole experience a lot better in my opinion and the same way I play Sacred 2.

It feels like Diablo II LoD in space, but better. I really don't understand the negative reviews (I don't play coop so can't really comment on that). I have several thousand hours in Diablo II & III and what I miss from those games is a believable world and story telling that makes you feel part of the world. Which is what a sorely missed after also playing a couple of thousand hours of Path of Exile, which just feels like playing a game. Well I feel very immersed in the Warhammer 40,000 universe (which I know little about, which may help) and feel part of the story.

Very strongly recommend picking up the complete collection on sale.

i had fun for the first 10-12 hours, ish, but then i realized how repetitive and flat the game really is. like others said, in the first few hours you see all the environments and enemies. Nevermind those things for now, the combat and the game itself is buggy, floating enemies, sometimes you can't shoot or switch weapons, and others, but these really make the game to be even less fun after the initial 10-ish hours. The game also seems made for consoles in mind, you can adjust the camera to a different angle which is also a pain to do, especially in combat when enemies can come from any direction. Comparing items is also a weird thing here, it compares ""quality"" what quality is that, i have no clue whatsoever, i compare individual stats (i started this after several hours in the game thinking higher quality is better, i was wrong)...

I've just started this game for the first time and I'm pretty underwhelmed.
There doesn't seem to be any organic world guidance, it's literally just a shit tonne of individual tiny maps and tiny missions stitched together, with a narrative stapled on top, and loading screens between every one.

The loot is boring, after hitting level 20, I've encountered literally 4 types of weapons, with one variant of each for the Tech Adept. There's a plasma gun (type alpha and beta), a shooter gun (type alpha and beta), an axe (type alpha and beta) and... AN ELECTRO AXE! WHICH HAS (wait for it...) A TYPE ALPHA AND BETA!!!

Seriously. no uniques, no backstories to the equipment.
There's a whole bunch of other kit you can buy that's timed and whatever.
It's telling that a lot of the temporary stuff is ""For the next mission"" or ""for the next X missions"".
It's a multiplayer lootbox game masquerading as a singleplayer game with good content.

I had high hopes for this, but it's basically aimed at multiplayer ARPG players, not at people who want to explore a large, organic world singleplayer.

If you liked Diablo, Diablo II, Grim Dawn, or Van Helsing's singleplayer, you won't like this.

fast forward to now and this is actually a really fun game. There are some UI elements that might be a bit unusual or take some getting used to but as an action looter slasher its good fun. 

if youre a canon desperate warhammer 40k type (probably a dude, sorry ladies but its true) then youll have some issue with the ease that a single human (augmented or not) can tear through astartes, traitor guard, war machines, etc

again, its good fun, but if youre the type to lose your erection as soon as the lore doesnt match your exact yank bank, well tough luck

also if you play as a psyker and turn your graphics up realllllly high you can keep yourself from having to pay heating bills as the heat eminating off of your computer should be enough to casually endure -45 degree temps. jk, there are a shit ton of effects that can be a bit disconcerting especially for the older pc owner.

The way missions are laid out is unique from all of them, with similar mission customization to POE.  
The campaign got me to level 60, and I got to about level 65 with the Prophecy add-on, which is a break from doing new game+ type of formulas like the others.  Like POE, you can hone a custom map to your liking with added difficulty for more reward.  The loot in this game is an excellent part of the fun.  As you get not only better gear, but different weapons, you can customize your character without having to start a new one.
The requirements for this game seem to require a beefy machine, but it looks amazing on high settings. From what I've read, the dev team has but a lot of work into updating/fixing this after release, and from my perspective, it has paid off.  
There are lots of different types of missions, lots of different enemy types, huge numbers of weapons that each can be tuned with different skills/perks.  It also has Psalm Doctrines, which are like Diablo's Rune Words.  Their are a ton of them, and they have amazing abilities which can be flexibly used in gear.

I highly recommend you plug in a controller and have fun with it ( it plays better on controller and feels better IMO which really boosted my enjoyment ). Between all the content available to you to the sheer diversity of the characters and builds you can do this is definitely worth buying if you're and ARPG fan looking to get into something that's in between Diablo 3 and POE. I would say its less casual than D3 but not as hardcore as POE. It has complicated mechanics that can be abused and built around to really make some unique powerful builds and the developers are always adding new stuff each season. Its actually a shame how much content and cool stuff is here that this game doesn't get a bigger playerbase.

Story (4/5): Good 40k story with a tiny bit of choice that mostly determines one of two ""alignment"" style skill trees.

Character building (4/5): Class based system with unique weapons for each class and the ability to tailor your passives and equipment bonuses to your exact liking.  Decent cosmetic customization but could be better.

Action (5/5):  Great pacing.  Slow enough to allow tactical play but not fast enough to feel like a bullet hell meat grinder.

Multiplayer (4/5):  Great scaling and personal loot allows for very flexible grouping with people at various points in the game, but no matchmaking and no player trading.

Graphics (2.5/5):  Decent graphics unless its a major focus for you.  Optimization is terrible and even powerful machines will experience frame drops and stutters.  Will require tweaking to find your optimal  performance.

Controller Support (3.5/5):  Full support and control with a controller (I use XB1 pad).  Auto target is largely good but can be very unreliable at times for choosing a specific target in a crowd and can often auto target undesired targets such as: mines on the floor.

Pros:
* The W40k universe is a much more iconic and interesting setting than the Diablo setting, so that's a big plus.
* The moment to moment play experience is good, even if not quite as good as Diablo (this is obviously subjective).
* Not a single crash so far.
* You select which mission to play next by going to a system, then to a planet and then select a mission on the planet. This is a really nice in-universe way of showing a wide selection of options (the travel animations could be slightly faster).

Neutral:
* The animations and playing is pretty smooth and responsive, but not as smooth and responsive as Diablo (so it's a good news / bad news kind of thing).
* The graphics are perfectly good enough, but don't stand out.
* The execution of the story telling itself is OK, though could be better. It's still far superior to Diablo. I can see someone play this game for the story, not so for Diablo.

Cons:
* This is a big one: The game has systems on systems on systems each with their own choices and it does an absolutely terrible job explaining any of it. It's needlessly complicated and confusing. You mostly can't even get reliable answers (or answers at all) using Google, either. This is a huge mess. E.g. it can be hard to tell which passives will affect which skills EVEN IF YOU GOOGLE IT.
* Quality of life of the UI and inventory management could be a bit better. There's too many drops to pick up, it's a lot of clicking.
* It's not so easy to experiment with new builds. It requires in-game resources, there are so many intertwined choices that it's a chore to change them all and more seriously, the whole game is so complicated that it's hard to know how you would even adjust different choices in a way to match each other.
* The game gets repetitive after a while. Probably a big part of this is that experimenting to switch up your play style just isn't a great experience like it is in Diablo (well, Diablo 3)

I wouldn't recommend this game for most people, but there is a certain kind of person who will create spreadsheets and do experiments to figure out all the choices and grind forever and get a lot of enjoyment out of that.

The biggest difference compared to other aRPGs is that your combat skills are linked to the weapons you’ve equipped, rather than unlocking them from a skill tree. Each weapon has four different attacks, you can have two weapons equipped and can swap between them at the press of a button.

There’s a wide range of weapons to choose from including sword, axe, hammer, pistol, flamethrower, laser rifle, plasma, melta, and probably a few others that I’m forgetting. Melee weapons come in one and two hand varieties, and you can dual wield or equip a shield. There should be something to suit everybody’s playing style.

I experimented with a few different weapons, personally I thought the melee weapons felt a bit slow, so eventually I settled on a flamethrower and laser rifle combination. As you would expect, the flamethrower’s standard cone attack can hit multiple enemies together at close range, but it can also lob fireballs quite far which will take out groups of enemies, and it can set an area on fire for a few seconds, killing the enemies which are dumb enough to walk through it (and I can confirm the AI is pretty dumb). Meanwhile the laser rifle has a rapid fire mode which is nice for killing single targets with higher health, which made it a perfect secondary weapon.

The game has a lot of content. Its taken me 37 hours to finish the main story missions and a couple of lengthy chains of side quest missions which had their own story. There’s also a lot of randomly generated missions if you want to grind for more XP/loot. The best missions have your inquisitor assisting the defence of planets that are being invaded by enemies, which feels like you’re part of a big war.

The story is okay. Its very detailed, which could be a good or bad thing depending on how familiar you are with W40K lore. It involves lots of factions that I’ve seen in other games, such as the Astra Militarum, Adeptus Mechanicus, Space Marines, Chaos, Eldar, but I don’t have a huge knowledge of the history and politics, so there were times where I felt a bit lost. I enjoyed it more in the last couple of chapters which focused on a specific character.

I have to say though, my efforts to understand what was happening were not helped by the fact that this is another of those games that frequently has your character talking to an ally over a radio while you’re in the middle of combat. “Sorry, what was that? I can’t hear you over the gunfire and the explosions. Call me back later”.

Another thing that annoyed me was that if you lose internet connection while playing, you’ll be dumped back to the main menu, losing whatever progress you made during the current mission. Even if you’re playing in single player mode. There is simply no excuse for this.

W40K Inquisitor – Martyr/Prophecy isn’t great, but it isn’t terrible either. Its better than the developer’s previous game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (another action RPG), but that isn’t a high bar to get over. Fans of Warhammer might enjoy it but I’d recommend waiting for the deepest sale.",1621842716,1621842716,True,63,1,0.842880010604858398,2,True,False,False

My only issues with the game are:
1] The build diversity is a bit lacking. Very VERY few builds run without crit. Crit is almost essential in every build to work and perform well. There are too many synergies and talents that are crit-centric. It is also just the plain, absolute best way to get more damage. 
2] Multiplayer is still kind of weird a lot of the time. Getting a friend in to play and grind together leads to lots of disconnects and syncing issues still. Solo is perfect though.

Repetitiveness is inherent in games like these. What matters is how the devs hide it through the gameplay loop to make it less obvious.

Games Workshop’s approach to the video game industry is something that I have always found baffling. When it comes to such a robust IP as Warhammer 40k, one could expect a triple A title released by a major publisher. It might have been the case when PC WH40k was unanimous with Dawn of War and its expansions. That said, it was 15 years ago and since then Warhammer games have spread far and wide. Truth be told, WH 40k licensed games appear as a steady stream of mostly charming mediocrity, with some honourable exceptions. Does Inquisitor - Martyr set itself apart from this trend? The short answer is no. On the other hand, it is a perfectly decent hack’n’slash game in its own right, set in WH40k universe. If you happen to enjoy both, this title suddenly becomes a perfect proposition.

[b] Thrice-blessed plot armour [/b]
As the title subtly implies, Inquisitor - Martyr allows the player to step into the boots of the member of His holy inquisition. A highly secretive organisation, foremost dedicated towards ensuring that the Imperium of Mankind at large remains unaware of existence of Chaos Gods and their corrupting influence. Having a 40k game that doesn’t revolve around Space Marines is a welcome change of pace. Although, that doesn’t make the scale of the protagonist’s exploits any smaller. Quite the contrary even. As Inquisitor’s chosen genre decrees, the player’s kill count quickly flies well into thousands - heretic cultists, xenos and even daemonic hordes drop like flies.  Feats of righteous slaughter portrayed in the game would quickly establish the protagonist as one of the greatest champions of the Imperium. Speaking of the campaign, it is a robust one. Base game takes well over 20 hours to beat and should you happen to own Complete Collection with all the DLCs this time can swell up to impressive 40 hours of play.

Inquisitor - Martyr tells a story of mysterious ship “the Martyr”, a mighty vessel once commanded by an excommunicated Inquisitor. The protagonist’s investigation of the giant starship soon sets in motion a chain of events that will determine the future of the entire Caligari sector and innumerable millions of Imperial subjects within. DLCs introduce smaller side-plot such as incursion of Chaos Marines or repelling a Dark Eldar raid. Admittedly, the Inquisitor’s writing is strangely uneven. Some plot threads reveal very basic information, seemingly having players less familiar with the setting in mind, while others require a fundamental understanding of the WH 40k to be fully enjoyed. It is perfectly understandable that the developers didn’t want to completely alienate the general audiences, although the attempt comes off as an inconsistency rather than a virtue. On the brighter note, Inquisitor - Martyr introduces a number of interesting ideas, bound to pick up the attention of the universe fans.

[b] Tools of trade [/b]
With all due respect, hack’n’slash genre isn’t exactly best known for its narrative prowess. Such games are all about fun combat, piles of shiny loot and growing your character to be ever more powerful. Inquisitor’s gameplay loop provides a solid, if simple, combat system around which the game just keeps on growing and adding new elements. Inquisitor’s combat divides into 3 categories – melee, ranged and class powers, each category is represented by a dedicated character. Crusader, assassin and psyker respectively. Every class has a dedicated set of equipment and the character’s skills depend exclusively on the currently selected weapon. 

On top of that, Inquisitor has a bit strange, yet curious character progression system via set of passive trees, most of which have to be first unlocked by meeting specific criteria. For instance, to unlock physical attacks tree, one needs to deal sufficient amount of such damage type first. Passive effects-oriented system means that statistics behind the weapon improve but an aimed sniper shot remains the same 60 levels later. The gun doesn’t suddenly grow an extra barrel or double the fire rate just because your character gained combat experience. Despite all the intricacies of the combat system, the fact remains the skill range available at hand is highly limited. To some, this might make the combat feel stale, although repetition is always a tricky subject when it comes to an inherently grindy hack’n’slash genre. However, should the quirks of combat prove not too off-putting Inquisitor - Martyr is a game that just keeps on giving, seemingly indefinitely. 

[b] Only in death does duty end [/b]
Sizeable campaign of the game is in practice a series of randomly generated maps, drawing from a couple of corridor presets and environments. Story missions are set apart, thanks to a voiceover by the protagonist and his retinue. It would be rather unremarkable if not for the fact that Inquisitor has fantastic voice acting, especially for the main characters. On top of that, each character class is in essence different inquisitorial agent played by separate voice actor and while they have mostly identical dialogue, there are subtle differences to better represent their background. The Crusader is my favourite, his voice convincingly oozing self-righteousness. 
[url] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2491929369 [/url]
“Map by map” gameplay loop of Inquisitor - Martyr gives the game a very open structure. Take note, this title starts very slow, gradually opening up to the player. Alas, the very opening of the game is plain clunky, only after some time, with level and campaign progression more and more content opens up for the player: PvP feature, free exploration of Caligari sector, crafting system, optional modifiers that increase difficulty in exchange for greater rewards, crusades rewarding player with even better loot and the list just keeps growing. During my leisurely playthrough, I was nearly 100 hours into the game when I completed the final story mission, which to my surprise, unlocked 2 further survival-style DLC gameplay modes.

Missions themselves come in a considerable objective variety. While each deployment encourages the player to kill everything that moves, it’s rarely the primary objective. Destroying a strategic fortification, rallying loyalist forces and taking control of an area, holding out against waves of enemies or saving a besieged VIP, to name a few. Those are hardly groundbreaking, albeit combined with the options already mentioned, the amount of ways to capitalise on slaying the enemies of mankind becomes ludicrous. The meat for the grinder is also senisbly varied - most of the enemies are chaos-related, although both craftworld and dark Eldar are also present in the game and even the Tyranids show their spiky tendrils. 

[b] Pass the Emperor’s judgment [/b]
In the end, Inquisitor - Martyr at large repeats the story of many other Warhammer games. It is a mediocre title with a heart, however unremarkable for the general public, it is appealing to the fans of the setting who I believe to be the ultimate target audience of such games. Despite a number of minor bugs, such as distorted voicelines and melee weapons awkwardly floating around the characters and some odd design choices, in my eyes this game does stand out among other WH40k licensed titles, even if just barely. On that note, I can easily recommend the game to all who enjoy hack’n’slash genre.

TL;DR A decent Diablo knock off

Wot I liked
- You can move with WASD. You should do it. I cannot stress hard enough how strong I feel for this feature. It strongly improves the character manoeuvrability and gaming experience. Clicking for movement should be left as an option for those few who still cling to it. For the rest there shall be WASD;
- Planning out your character is fun. There are several skill trees and perks for all classes. There are some class specific trees and perks. Mix and match till satisfied. There are also stats with breakpoints;
- Levelling system is kinda nice: you get stats and skillpoints on lvlups, you can also get some bonus points for certain achievements or as quest rewards. Several skill trees have to be unlocked;
- A good selection of guns and melee weapons. Neither is op and you can deal retribution effectively with a two-handed chainsword or a laspistol and a shield alike;
- You don't have to play the game 4 times (hello Diablo 3) to get to the challenging situations - you can increase difficulty (and get some extra rewards) from the start; 
- A decent space chart. Though the whole game takes part on a slew of tiny maps I got the feel of traversing this huge universe;
- Visually pleasing - the carnage, the executions, the gore. Heavy flamer's fire melting demons and chaos marines really sets the right mood; 
- The missions are repetitive - you're going to run ~10 mission types on ~10 different tiles. Having said that - the fast tactical action combat is fun!
- The story missions are kinda nice: it starts pretty weak as the voice actor's performance and lines are kinda poor even for warhammer, but then it slides into that over-the-top insane groove that I love and cherish;
- Most environment objects are destructible. Several volleys from a grenade launcher can really free up some space;
- Vehicle missions (piloting Shadowsword Tank / Freeblade Knight) you do feel like a badass trampling walls and exterminating vile xenos' warmachines with little effort;
- The game is low-key addictive, just like a proper diablo clone should be.

Wot I disliked
- This game has no business in being online only. It is a single-player solo game 99% of the time;
- Compatibility issue. The game just not works properly with the default settings. I had lag, really long loading times (around 30+ sec on an m2 ssd), and 30-50 fps. Everything was fixed after I applied ""Disable fullscreen optimizations"", but I wonder how many people just refunded it not willing to waste time on tweaking a broken game;
- GUI is old and tired - I'm glad that they put all the indicators and healthbars in the bottom left corner, however it is not nearly enough to be able to track all cds and resources in the heat of action, which is quick paced and lethal if you don't control your vitals;
- WASD controls seems a bit broken - sometimes your toon would just continue moving in the attack direction or target skill in the movement direction;
- I have no idea why they went for interactive camera - it brings very little, and you have to waste two extra keys to rotate it every now and then to see stuff. It's just annoying. This game could really use ""camera north"" option;
- Vehicle missions are very poorly balanced - playing them at higher difficulties is a nightmare: you have to burn each bottom grunt for 30 seconds and die dozen times to kill a single elite mob. Luckily you can turn down the difficulty setting and enjoy;
- There are only 4 classes;
- Price. I don't usually notice games' pricetags, barring some ridiculous numbers. Martyr asks you to buy the base game. Then it asks you to buy another game for the 4th class and the resolution of the campaign. Then it asks you to buy some additional missions. And some cosmetics;
- Maps are not really procedurally generated. It's a pity, cause when done well they add a lot to the enjoyment. Here you can learn the notable locations and beeline straight to them;
- The game could use some boss battles. There aren't really any memorable fights in the game;
- DLCs are actually low effort short missions with loot/currency or skill points rewards (one good thing about them is that you can buy them with in-game currency);
- There's very little information online on the game mechanics - and most of it is circa 2018; 
- No way to protect items from bulk selling; 
- Why do they keep messin' with WGBPO rarity scheme? Just leave it be;
- Weapon set key should be more responsive.

To sum it all up, I had started playing this game being undecided whether I like it or not. At first I had experienced severe performance handicap, poor story and clumsy action. It only got better from then - with the fix applied I enjoyed stable performance and very decent visuals, story got much better (in the trademark silly wh40k style ofc) and combat bloomed into a flower of lots genocidal fun. It's not PoE (it got better visuals though), but it's definitely not D3 either!",1619442183,1619442183,True,1,0,0.494382023811340332,0,True,False,False

All wrapped in excellent sound design and voiceacting, all of this transports you into the bleak far future.

It takes some playtime to really get into it, and wrapping your head around the control scheme. Which revolves around abilities that aren't so much learned by leveling up as they are tied to your equipped weapon and armor. I mean, that's at least what I get from my Heavy Gunner Crusader, I'm sure things change for other classes which all play differently from one another. As a fan of Space Marines, the Heavy Gunner Crusader is definitely close to being one. But each class is fun and distinct, while respecting the source material. There's a ton of passive abilities to choose from, and a ton of meaningful rewards for your efforts such as new weapon or item types to equip.

Although Warhammer 40,000 Inquisitor: Martyr is more simplistic compared to Path of Exile or Diablo 3, it makes up for it in terms of sheer satisfaction and reward ( loot, and the aforementioned progression unlocks ). Enemies explode into beautiful blossoms of gore and dismembered body parts, in true Warhammer 40,000 fashion. Guns and melee weapons are meaty and often ridiculous as you'd expect such as my beloved Heavy Bolter weapon type. You carry these crazy weapons and abilities into a massive variety of missions that take you to a plethora of different planets, facing a pretty solid array of enemies that also very much respect the lore. This game very much has ""just one more mission"" written all over it, especially if you really get into it and are sucked into the fun gameplay loop.

The game isn't without its faults, that's why it's ""underrated"" for me. Although it's excellent fun and quite addictive, it can't compare to more substantial action RPG offerings out there if you aren't interested in Warhammer 40,000. I also get audio glitches during large battles, and other assorted glitches such as bodies or decals fading out then fading back in repeatedly right in front of me. The game is clearly a labor of love, with a few rough edges, and an awful temporal anti-aliasing that makes the game very blurry but I must endure because I can't stand jaggies for the Emperor's sake! This game, in fact, is a ""rough gem"" if you will. I don't really mind, because I'm having a blast blowing the faces off the Emperor's enemies with a GIGANTIC GUN that fires exploding bullets ( according to the lore ).

However, I think it could be due to the class i'm playing. I have been reading online that there is some builds that are basically useless. So if you buy the game and play one of these useless builds then you will likely not have a good a time. The only real issue is balancing out the fun that some classes can have over others. I also think a lot of these reviews where before 2.0 and Prophecy which from my understand is where the game started to become the masterpiece it is starting as now.
One example of balance that I was watching online was regen soliders can only be stopped in higher difficulties by 1 weapon and literally all other classes are useless and cannot solo it. It should be possible in some way to solo all the content in the game since this is not an MMO. A lot of games do this though for some stupid reason and then they end up nerfing the only class that can solo it and the games become complete trash.

There are some good things going for the Martyr:
+ You can rotate the camera
+ Graphics and performance are ok(ryzen 5 2600 + vega 56 + 16gb)
+ I didn't encounter any bugs, the game didn't crash
+ There was some potential 
+ Co-op (although there is a major issue described below)

[b]BUT[/b]

- Classes are garbage, there is not enough distinction between them, no class specific skills - those change with your weapon and armour.
- Progression is awful, items are packed with statistics, you are not really sure what you should equip, the game tells you which item is better so you just equip it. No questions asked. 
- When we are on the topic of equipment. The game is basically a garbage collector simulator. Enemies drop A LOT of gear and you have to manage it every time you are back in the hub. Sometimes you have to discard items to make some room during the mission (not a fun gameplay mechanic)
- They added a new class in the dlc. Me and my friends decided to play the game together. One of them picked the new class and we couldn't start a mission. We couldn't figure out why for a long time. Turns out the new one can be used ONLY in the dlc campaign. The game is tagged with coop but there is literally no warning, i could tell some of the people who left negative review had the same problem and returned the game because of that.
- Missions are very repetetive. The same enemies over and over.  There is no feeling of exploration. After every mission you are sent bakc to hub. It means loading window every mission. 
- Too many difficulty levels. I'm not sure how they even work. Except for the 2 hardest we could see no difference. 
- Talent trees. Or a complete lack of them. There are passives that come down to ""put a point get more damage"". There are 2 -3 perks you can choose but they don't really matter. Nothing really matters. You can just SMOrc through enemies on 3rd hardest difficulty.
- Meh voice acting. The story is not very engaging.
- Killing enemies feels like a chore. 
- I could probably add some more cons but i think i made my point

[b]TL:DR Not a very good experience. Boring. Meh combat. Repetetive.[/b]

As you can see i enjoy playing this game a lot. So much so that i started to make and upload video guides for this game to help and give back to the community.
(check it out https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxaoFwdtHKEyEw3Kdm2-w7Q )
Furthermore Inquisitor Martyr started to get me much more interested in the lore, which im soo greatfull for.
The Review:

[b]-Story:[/b] 
Actually a decent story for an Arpg, you follow along the main missions and uncover more and more especially if you collect optional lore and read through the texts.
The first time i played through i didnt follow along and was a bit confused. So if you have no idea about factions, lore, enemies ect. i would give the story a 5 out of 10. BUT if you learn more and more about the lore, the game gets better and better. If you are well versed in 40K i would give the story a 7.5-8 out of 10.
[b]Gameplay:[/b]

With the patch 2.0 Inquisitor Martyr has been completely revamped. It has gone from a slow and tactical game to an fast, action packed, fun Arpg.
It plays really fluently, has 4 classes if you include the DLC prophecy, and they play very unique and different from each other.
You have a bunch of skill trees but your active skills are decided by the weapon or weapons you equip. So even with the same build you can switch out your weapon and have an completely different playstyle.
[b]Loot:[/b]

I love the gearing system in the game. You can customize and upgrade your gear to an extreme degree. Which allows you to really fine tune a build and try out many more. And it keeps you grinding for the next better piece or unique Enchant for hundreds of hours.
At times it can be a bit confusing but the developer confirmed, that they will implement a system to make gear customization clearer soon.
Each class has their own weapons , which behave completely unique and different from each other. Not only this but when you use Relic weapons they get their unique enchants which further alters the behaviour. It allows for such an amazing amount of playstyles and combinations. I love it.
[b]Graphics:[/b]

The game is beautiful, especially on highest settings. 
Effects, explosions, particle effects, spells ect. look really good.
And the best thing GOOOORE, yep suitable for 40K this game is damn bloody.
When you blast through the level and everything explodes into a rainstorm of blood and viscera, by the Emperor its glorious.
[b]Seasons:[/b]

They added Seasons last year, which gives you not only cosmetic rewards, but also unique Seasonal Enchants on Items which you can bring back into your Base game. Which furthers the Build possibilities even more. And each Season has their own theme and unique encounters, spells and mechanics. 
Im so glad that the game continues to get updates and hopefully we get many more seasons.
[b]Community:[/b]

Neocore has such an amazing helpful community, i strongly recommend to go on their website and in the 40K hub you can ask anything you need to know or find posts and answers from many helpful members.
AND the support team reads and replies to your suggestions, bugs ect. whatever you need help with they reply fast and helpful, i've never seen such good communication in an game before.
[b]Bugs:[/b]

Yes the game has sometimes bugs and some server issues. Is it game breaking ? no
Is there a chance that some BS goes wrong? yea
Go to the community hub report it, the developers go on fixing your char, account ect. pretty fast.
For the most part i've encountered mostly some minor bugs from connectivity problems. BUT they are easy to recover. 99.9% of the time log out, log back in and its there, or do it a few times and its there.
For example missing loot from my storage, it was never gone, just relog and then its back. I never lost gear or a char for real. Just relog and most of your stuff will be fixed, otherwise-> go neocore website.
Some minor bugs that get reported stay for a while(because patch cicles are a bit slow) but the get fixed sooner or later.

[b]Good hunting my fellow Inquisitors!
And dont forget Burn the heretic, kill the mutant and purge the unclean!
For the Emperor![/b]

I saw one years ago, it looked like the player controlled an army, kind of like the old Warcrafts? Those aren't my cup of tea, but top-down RPGs are. What I like the best about this game is that it feels like choices and point allocations matter. In some of my RPGs, I've taken big ole heavy axe-wielding, scantily clad barbarians and turned them into sword and board knights in heavy armor, and it feels exactly the same. Or, I sank a bunch of points into speed, and they feel not even remotely faster or more agile. OR, slash feels exactly like bash. OR, a super-charged arrow feels exactly like a standard shot. Not so with this game. 

There are some opinions that I disagree with. I respect the users' right to make them; I'm not a fanboi (I think that's how it's spelled these days) that freaks out if you say anything less than ""This is the best game in the entire history of gaming. Historians should stop and make a note that this is the game that changed the entire industry forever!"" Though if you dig that type of thing, I have a game whose community is nothing but fanbois; Rising World. Since 2014, the developer has ran around like someone with ADHD; starting a million little placeholder features but fleshing none of them out. But the community will freak the hell out if you do anything less than break an arm from patting the developer on the back.

ANYWAY, things that I respectfully disagree with: 1) Awkward control scheme/clunky mechanics/ overly complex mechanics. My disclaimer here is that I use an Xbox 360 controller; maybe it's more difficult with a mouse and keyboard? Every skill is assigned to a button, which is labeled, every skill explained, every tab explained. However, I took time and read every scrap of info tossed at me. However, if I read nothing, if I was so eager to jump into the fray that I frantically mashed the start button until the action started, I could see me very easily being confused. If I skipped every explanation,  just randomly assigned points, and blindly chose weapons, I very easily see myself having a bad time.

2) Bland, repetitive grind/steep learning curve. These are two different aspects, but I've lumped them together because I don't have too much to counter with. I've just never been bored with the game, nor have I found myself struggling to understand the game. I can't promise that you won't be bored/overwhelmed, though: we all have different gaming backgrounds.

That's about it from me, I think. I could probably ramble on more, but my son's in school, so I've got yard work and gaming to do. Ya'all have a good day :)",1618321093,1618321371,True,2,0,0.502119839191436768,0,True,False,False

I want to like it so much, but a few deal-breakers:
- It runs really, really poorly. Surprisingly so, even on a high-end PC.
- A bafflingly awkward control scheme. Thankfully, there are enough control options to turn it into something reasonably comfortable (but still far from perfect).
- Related to the above: You'll run into levels where you steer mechs, and these don't handle rebound keys very well (Note: This is what made me stop playing the game, I am not willing to screw around rebinding controls just to play one level, I've got better things to do with my time)
- So many overly complex systems jammed into your face way too quickly. I'm not saying the systems are bad, but I am saying that the learning curve is like running headfirst into a brick wall, and it makes it hard to just get into the core loops of the game.

All that in mind, if you LOVE 40K and the idea of a clunky Diablo clone themed around 40K, you'll find a lot to like here. Tons of content, lots to do, lots to see.

Diablo style ARPG light set in the 40k universe (duh).

The visuals are really good, nothing too amazing but there is some nice lighting and character designs. If you zoom in you'll see the corners cut with some laughably low res models. But with the camera zoomed out the game looks really good. 

The initial loading of the game is extremely slow, like at least a minute. Once the game is loaded it is ok but for some reason launching the game for me takes a strangely long amount of time.

The story is good so far. The game is a lower budget level so you don't get a ton of gorgeous cut scenes. Luckily the gameplay holds up. Playing as a Psyker feels awesome, you just lay waste to the heretic and it is quite satisfying seeing enemies burn up, explode, and dissolve in heaps of gore.

I have found the many systems in the game to be quite confusing. I am 30hrs in and still have no real clue how the crafting works. There are a lot of small details that aren't very well explained. Perhaps due to the game changing so much since release?

MP can be quite barren but you can find others playing. Apparently joining a cabal/guild makes it a bit easier.

Overall the game is surprisingly fun. One of the huge positives I find is that the missions take 30 mins or so on average. It is a great title that you can jump in and play a round or 2 if you don't have a lot of spare time.

I played the Martyr for about 30 hours right now as a Crusader class (I will write everything from the crusader perspective, but I expect this will be similar for other classes). I'm a great fan of Warhammer 40k (my collection of miniatures could confirm this) and I really liked some aspects of this game. I thought hard if I should recommend this game or not, but finally I decided to not recommed it. I will go through pros and cons to explain my decision.

PROS:
* [b]Environment[/b]: The Martyr really feels like you are in the 41st millennium walking through the worlds of Imperium of Mankind. And the chaos or drukhari infestion is looks just great. If you are deployed on battlefield, you can really feel that there was a battle happening before you arrived. I must bow before the level designers for Martyr
* [b]Weapons[/b]: There are plenty of iconic weapons from Warhammer 40k in Martyr like chainsword, plasma gun, lasgun, heavy bolter, storm shield etc. and most of them feel good. You can feel the weight of Thunder Hammer or hear the sawing sound of Chainsword.
* [b]Armors[/b]: When I'm talking about weapons I can't forgot about armors. The armors looks great, you can really feel like Grey Knight marching toward victory in big Power Armor.
* [b]Carnage[/b]: In every Warhammer game there should be blood and carnage. Martyr does this great, the enemies are dying in dozens and you can see pile of bodies in some locations infested by Chaos. You will burn the heretic and smash them to pieces in Martyr.
* [b]Vehicles[/b]: In course of the campaign you will have access to few vehicles which are truly great, but you will only absolve one mission in each of them so it's probably not that big pro.

CONS:
* [b]Repetitive[/b]: The game gets repetitive pretty fast. The first few missions on the Martyr are great, but after this it's always prepare on the Command bridge, start mission, finish mission, teleport back and again and again and again. Even the other mods are like this. 
* [b]Nothing new after few hours[/b]: This is really sad for me, after playing around 10-15 hours of the game, you will end up with everything the game has to offer. You seen every game environment, almost every enemy the game could throw at you. You will have access to all weapons, you will have access to all armors (there are only 3 types for Crusader) and you will have pretty much everything at your disposal. There are few things that you will still need to open, but this will take hours and hours of grind to get them and it's nothing really new, just some options for crafting or new void crusade (which is nothing else than mission after mission, where you can at least choose which mission to go next.) I must say few words about universe map in this point, it's awesome, but useless. When you first look at it, you will realize how big the Martyr is, but after you try to use it a few times, you will just end up using the mission list, because the universe map is useless if you need to find anything specific, you don't even know what missions you can find in which region or for which level it is recommended.
* [b]Defense missions[/b]: These missions are just frustrating, you will go through the whole mission and at the end there is something or someone you need to protect and if it's destroyed, bye, bye and repeat the whole mission. Even if you die the game is not that punishing like in these missions. I saw plenty of people complaining about this on the steam forum, especially playing as crusader.
* [b]Grind[/b]: I don't mind a little grind in the games, it's good if there are things that are rare or unique and you don't get them on start. But it's nice if you are actually getting something new. In Martyr you are just grinding when you open everything, you are just trying to spend hours and hours to just drop item that is little better than ours. Even the elite enemies are not worth the killing, because in most cases they are not dropping anything interesting. The last interesting thing I dropped was from the last boss of the Martyr campaign. I would understand this approach in the Free to Play game with premium account giving you bonus loot (I don't like the F2P model, but it's understandable that the grind must be high to force the players to buy the premium things), but in Martyr it's not fun. This is the biggest cons for me and the reason why I'm not playing F2P games that much.
* [b]Story[/b]: The story of the game is not that great, it feels good at the beginning and at the end of the campaign (where it finally starts looking more deep, but ending abruptly). I really liked the beginning where you are trapped on the Martyr and need to do a few things before you are able to get from the ship at last moment before it enters Warp. But after this it was go here, kill everything, find someone, get information from him, go back to martyr, find that you need something elsewhere and the pattern was repeating. I still waited for some big conspiracy that the game was slowly unveiling before you, but nothing like this happened. Instead of like inquisitor doing some investigation, I felt like errand boy who is running around, doing things for someone else.
* [b]Alone[/b]: In almost whole game you feel alone, you are visiting battlefields that are already in the hand of enemies, you are visiting places where isn't anyone except you. Sometimes it looks like the only allies in the game are the few ones you have in your ship and the few guards who will occasionally join you. I would expect to see much more units fighting on the side of Emperor of Mankind, but in the Martyr it looks like Mankind is already defeated and you are the last thing that stands between enemies and Imperium. This feeling would be easily avoided if there would be allied units fighting in some locations. Or civilians hiding in some shelter, they could even sell or buy something from you, why not?

As you can see from the review the cons are above pros. And here are some thoughts that would make the game much more enjoyable, at least for me.
* [b]Don't open everything at once[/b]: Just let the player do some missions (Or just do some checkpoints, there is no need to have missions in the game at all. It will feel less like lobby shooter, if there will be continuous area with occasional checkpoints, like elevators to another deck) on Martyr. This was great beginning. Then send him to some world or maybe sector and leave him on it for some time, introduce new environment, new enemies, new weapons and armors tied to that environment or sector. And after player finishes what is needed there send him to another location. Have optional missions on stations unlocking a different store in each sector, when you finish them. Make the map more usable.
* [b]Don't use the grind system[/b]: Give player an interesting loot when he kill some strong enemy. So the options to have higher level enemies against player has some meaning. It would be great to have some list of drop rates in mission description, something like Elite: 100% relic, 20% ancient relic, Champion: 20% relic, 0% ancient relic. This way the player will see what he could get before playing the game and not wasting hours looting trash.
* [b]Don't fail the whole mission when objective fails[/b]: This could be handled like player death, you will have some number of retries before mission fails and the mission is just reset before the player arrived to the mission objective.

I would say that the game would be much more fun when these three points would be implemented in the game. Maybe when Martyr 2 will be out.",1617919031,1617983693,False,73,5,0.825338184833526611,0,True,False,False

If you keep going, you will learn along the way, and you will find that the gameplay is rewarding and fun. (Except the camera, the camera is dogshit. You have to manually rotate it everytime).

Do you want an enjoyable Action RPG in the Diablo style that is immersive to the Warhammer story and lore? That you can spend some hours on mindlessly killing hordes of enemies? That is more competent than the usual Warhammer game?

Do you want a well-designed, streamlined and visceral Action RPG that can compete with top hitters like Diablo 3? That you can sink countless sessions into building compelling and fun heros? With good itemization and play that draws you back?

+ Warhammer 40k story from the Inquisitor perspective is great
+ Deep lore and authentic feeling connection to the 40k universe
+ Good enemy variety and animation

-Itemization sucks and is incredibly boring
-No unique loot items

-The cover and supression systems is are unnecessary and boring
-Difficulty scaling seems to have no tangible impact on loot 
-Lots and lots of half-baked gameplay and mechanics ideas

[list]
[*] A map that makes the game feel deceptively massive - Travel to Sectors which have systems that have a number of planets within. 

[*] Quite a varied amount of terrain maps from industrial cities & stations with corridors to open outdoor environments. Lots of detail and most things are destructible - best of all it looks and feels very true to the universe.

[*] Tons of enemy variety rendered with high quality animations.

[*] Overwhelming amount of gear and customisation (I'm still trying to wrap my head around it all)

[*] Lots of events & ways to reward your time. 

[*] I just learned about the Tarrot card system which allows you to add modifiers to a mission that grant bonuses and ramp up the difficulty. 

[*] For all the Pyro's there is a heavy flamer and you can purge the Xenos with righteous fire!

One last thing I'd like to say is that I've been watching this one for a long time. While it was in EA I almost bought it on a couple occasions but the comments were mostly negative and I held off. I cannot say for sure whether the game was a stinker early on but consider this - Its been supported after release for 3 years and Neocore have steadily improved it in that time.

3 kinds of armor models for each class? Really?

No matter what weapon you have Autopistol or the Heavy Bolter sounds and effects are the same.

Plasma amongst all weapons is the worst literally makes : PEW PEW sound. - Whomever was responsible for the sound effects knows nothing about the universe and probably cares even less.

So a few years later I found a bundle for this game and all its DLC for a nice price so gave it another shot.  This game now plays as it should have at release, with no issues.  If your a fan of Warhammer 40k, or new to the genre, you'll love this game.  When a game draws you in, and submerses you into its world its a truly epic experience, this is one of those games.   Lots of really well done voice acting, story telling is superb, reports/notes very detailed adding to the submersion into the 40k universe.  Game play challenge is very adjustable, and the play not to much of a grind.  Character classes, but with a twist.  Your armor can basically allow you to alter your class depending on the situation.  The quests are broken into bit sized pieces, so if you only have 20-30 min to play, you can knock out a step in the quest line.

• WRITING. Hitting this first because it's the best game feature, in my eyes. The storyline's solid, feels VERY Warhammer 40k, and the (few) decisions you have to make can be surprisingly difficult morally. It gets you invested. The dialogue is well-written and both grimdark and funny. CON: There's a lot of filler content. Sometimes it's reminiscent of old-school RPGs: ""we need to do X, but Y is in the way so we have to do that first."" That's good. BUT other times, it's ""well, we need to clear these 7 decks of the ship for forced reasons first."" It can get tedious, but imo the writing makes up for it in the end.

• Game time and content. I finished the *main* storyline at about 35 hours. Then there's a ton of other content: DLCs, seasonal and daily events, etc. CON: as mentioned, there's a lot of filler content that can get tedious. PS: for controls, I rebound to WASD/QE for movement/strafing and it works great (camera follows you automatically too), feels like any other game movement-wise. (Just need to rebind the assassin skills to something else if you do so.)

• Graphics are solid for an ARPG. Gritty, gory, atmospheric. The ""Cathedral"" missions in particular have awesome set-pieces that really drag you into the universe. CON: there's only a few maps/set piece sets. Maybe... 6 or so? So once you've seen those, you've seen them all. (The mention of a ""persistent open world"" is really not true; there's a star map that's navigable, with a map select screen, basically.)

• Sound is good. The bolter has that nice, *solid* thudding sound on impact, and generally the sound effects are fairly immersive. The music is great, but sadly you don't get to hear the full kick-ass combat themes, because the fights don't last all that long. 

• Voice acting is good. I'm not sure why some people knocked it; it's professional and some of the voices are great. HOWEVER: some (especially DLC) lines don't match their subtitles--the voice actors seem to have used more natural phrasing and the writing wasn't corrected--and rarely, some words are mispronounced. (But tbf, ""amygdala"" isn't exactly a word people hear daily.) 

• The stat and gear system's pretty good. As others have mentioned, as a CON, there's no real skills you *choose* while levelling up: abilities are granted or altered via gear and perk choices *only,* and can be changed at any time. A spec instead grants % bonuses and the like, though these do add up. The gear crafting is in-depth, with an unlockable tech tree that increases how much and how well you can craft and change stats etc. on gear. There's a TON of variables and damage types that you can test out to mesh with your spec and playstyle.

• Co-op worked just fine for me, and was a lot of fun. Played with a couple of friends who happened to also have the game and we rampaged through a few maps together for the Seasonal stuff. I'm sure we'll be doing this more often now. I DC'd once (my own internet connection) and the game asked if I wanted to rejoin the ""Multiplayer game in progress,"" which I did, and I didn't lose anything.

• Class definition: it's awesome. So far I've tried a heavy-weapons Crusader, and a Magos Dominus Tech-Adept (Prophecy-only). Now, the tech-priest does have a slightly different storyline, as he's from a DLC. But from what my friends have told me and my experience, the classes are *very* well-defined playstyle-wise, and the difference in dialogue between these two classes on some missions is noticeably funny (ex. the Tech-Priest saying ""ah yeah purging that planet was definitely logical"" vs the Crusader's ""the cold logic of the Mechanicus is scary sometimes"" sort of thing). Anyway, Crusader gets up in there and SMASHES (or BLASTS); Tech-Priest summons mechanical minions all over and rips things up. Psyker slams Warp ""magic"" everywhere and ho boy, the demons he accidentally summons... we were yelling at our Psyker a LOT, lol. NOTE: when choosing a class, the sub-class grants you a *unique perk* to that sub-class. LOOK at them on a wiki before choosing for sure, as these aren't changed later! Otherwise, the sub-class only affects the gear you start with.

____

Two notes:

1. I don't normally like ""always-online"" games and saw some complaints about this in comments. What people *don't* mention is that this IS an online game. There's leaderboards, Co-op, optional PvP (haven't tried this yet), an in-game mail system, daily and seasonal challenges, a toggle-able chat, and more. You can send stuff to friends, join a Cabal (guild/corp/permanent group) for additional bonuses, etc. While you don't see other players running around unless you're partied with them, it's definitely got good *reason* to be online. After realizing this, I have no complaints about it, and the playerbase still looks active.

2. The game is surprisingly feature-rich but ALSO very easy to navigate. It's a hard balance to nail in games, but they guide you through it smoothly, and at a reasonable pace. By the time you're level 40 or so everything's unlocked but you know where it all is, and how to use it. The gear-crafting and -modification, tech tree, Inoculator changes, cosmetics, map, and so on are all introduced gradually and clearly explained.

And lastly, ONE complaint/warning: when you run into story boss enemies, a cutscene plays. This makes your character sprint up to the enemy and exchange dialogue--believable, for an Inquisitor, but unfortunately when that cutscene ends you're left standing unprepared right in front of the boss and ALL its support. This has gotten me insta-gibbed more than once, and I hope they change how this works (moving you back to where you were, maybe, or better yet, giving you a moment to move away again before the boss engages).

I'm level 6 with 100 minutes of gameplay

This is a decent hack&slash game in the world of 40k, with a story.
GamePlay:
It is mainly based on killing enemies and walking around (through a not so complicated maze, go to the one end to open door on the other, where you press F and go back to starting point, and repeat)
Thats in my opinion not enough to qualify for a good game, even for hack and slash.
Grahics:
Dim (not grim) to the extend, to have negative feeling of 'bad graphics'.
Moreover, when I have tried to change options I have noticed that the game preselected intel graphics over nvidia (not a gaming laptop)
Enemies ae hardly distinguishable, the differences you can see are mainly - big-small, shoots-or-not, maybe there will be more different Xenos along the way, but as I switched from Subnautica directly to this game I cannot agree to having poorly designed aliens.
UX:
lots of tooltips is missing (not implemented) so seeing some values is as informative as chinese letter to an European. Some can be figured out (like big 6 under your character is your level)
Didn't play tutorials so thats why it may be hard to read them, however, a simple trick (tooltip) would be satisfactory
Don't know what to do with unwanted items - I figured out how to throw them away, but there must be a better option as every item has a selling value.
Plenty of credits in the local currency in loot but I still don't know what to do with them - perhaps further in game there will be some kind of shop or something, but I cannot find the place where my current cash is shown.
On the main screen there are plenty of options connected with DLC, but DLC menu is empty. Still don't know what is the seasonal goal I have 1/16 finished (even I dont know what are the steps to achieve the goal - again tooltip would be nice)
During creation of a character I could chose to create a character for a seasonal encounter or not - don't know If I could play with it without this season stuff, and I don't know whats the difference.
Quitting - Once I had to quit quite fast and I had to use Quit options like 5 times (quit in the mission was like Leave area not quit the game, then I had to quit and confirm to leave my current character, then quit and confirm to leave game) (my use of word quit in this sentence was redundant as in the game)

Character and character progress:
There are (if I remember correctly) three different characters to chose from, with their own models. and thats all for customization.
The progress of a character is not understandable, plenty of things a player has no control. The only thing I could do is allocate passive points (I think 1 per level) but the areas I could use them on are like 4 of 10 - rest is unavailable to me, and I don't know why. Basically those passive points can be allocated to damage(ie 10% melee damage) or resistance to damage, and thats... like... nothing at all
There are plenty of items with a lot of different modifiers, though a unique item can be worse than nonunique item, so its like looking through inventory (thats its quite big, and fills quite fast) for a longer time than playing the game.
I am not sure if level 6 is high or not, but for now I have found one type of a gun and two types of axes, quite small number considering there are plenty of other imponderables.. I expect that more are to come (like grenade and mine) as player levels.
I am not sure if its a bug, but I have used weapons before achiveing information about them on leveling up (it looks like dictionary entry is a bonus for achieving a level. I have disregarded bonuses that I got on leveling up.
I am considering returning this game, buut on the other hand I don't have a lot of mindless games in my library, and I do like warhammer 40k (trying to get all with exception of RTS and FPS game-clones)

Went up to 39th lvl -> some things have changed, but I found numerous bugs, like trying to roll on abilities on a weapon and it didnt work, got stuck in a cannon and couldn't leave, trying to get help on a channel but almost all were full and couldn't find any that is not 100/100 used, when I found one, the entire chatting feature was blocked, and could not say anything and when I was able to send a message - it seems like it went nowhere, but was sent...

The bug with cannon made me really angry - as I was thinking if maybe I should leave this game in my Library, this helped to solidify my opinion and reach for getting cash back ...",1616232094,1616521814,False,1,0,0.496934831142425537,0,True,False,False

Is it a shining beacon of indie excellence? Not really. But it is definitely fun and playable and one of the few 40K games outside of Dawn of War and Battlefleet that isn't mega booty.

There is quite a bit of different weapon types in the game, although you have to level up to unlock new types. Many do feel quite similar (2H energy weapons are all kind of samey, 2H kinetic weapons are the same way besides the shotgun -- mostly differ on spread, fire rate, move speed, maybe a skill or two for more AOE or more Single Target). A cool idea though is your active combat skills are based on your weapons/armor and each hand is different (2 handed weapons get 4 skills, one handed get 2 skills per weapon, so two sword skills and two shield skills for example with a sword/shield, or you can dual wield two of the same weapons to get 4 different skills).

The subclass of your main class only affects your starting gear in the game, which isn't explained very well. So you can freely switch between the three subclasses and any of the main Class's weapons at any point. Skills in the game definitely allow you to tailor your kit to what you like to use, although skilltrees don't offer major changes -- mostly % increases besides a few skills in each tree. Perks are where you customize your character to a greater degree imo and you can choose up to three that you have unlocked to use at any one time. There's only a few armor choices per class and some visual variants, but you can customize the appearance between three ""tiers"" and change primary/trim color and dirtiness/wear on any weapons or armor. Higher tier gear costs significantly more $$$ to modify. There is also a good crafting and enhancement system, somewhat reminiscent of Vermintide 2's crafting.

The negatives? Instanced maps are a bit small and tilesets could get repetitive after a good bit of time, it's definitely not ""open world'. I believe I have had about 5-6 different tilesets, although some assets are reused between them. Some of the cool weapons/gadgets are locked behind level ups, although it does give a good sense of becoming stronger. Graphics/Animations are good, especially maxed out and the particle effects, but they could be better. They're still both better than Grim Dawn imo (but I still love that game). While you can get a good amount of game time out of Martyr, the regular asking price of $50/$80 is pretty steep imo. On sale though, $12.50/$20 is not bad at all if you're looking for some good 40K action.

EDIT: Prophecy appears to offer some new enemies and tilesets. I don't recall facing Tyranids in the base campaign. So far I have faced Eldar, Dark Eldar, Chaos Daemons, Chaos Marines, Tyranids, [spoiler]Inquisitors[/spoiler], and Imperial Guard Rebels. Weather effects also help some of the same tilesets feel a bit different.",1616096112,1616517452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OLD REVIEW:
The servers used for Co-op are unstable and disconnect us 50% of the time. Want to know what happens when you are killing the last objective of the map and it disconnects? you lose all your progress and loot gained so far on that map... ALL of it. My friend and I were able to play maybe 50% of the maps without disconnection but that means 50% of the time we walked away feeling like we wasted our time and effort and money. 

We bought the game around the holidays so I cut them some slack and assumed it was a server overload. The issue remains today, a month later, with no indication that a fix is coming or that they are even trying. This is not an isolated incident happening to just me. It pops up all over the support channel and forums started in December. What makes this Thumbs down review tragic is the game is actually really fun when it works, but if I buy a game for co-op in coordination with a friend and that feature is busted, it doesn't matter how good the game is. Hope they fix it soon so I can flip this review around.

UPDATE: Co-op problem is fixed and game is more stable. While super disappointing that it took literal months to fix a main game feature, they did in fact fix it and my friend and I are playing every week now so I must amend my review from a Thumbs Down to a Thumbs Up. They are even adding Co-op to Void Crusade soon in an upcoming patch which is exciting. 

Actual game review? Main campaign is boring and about half way through we quit it to just grind random missions and priority assignments that we could add Tarot Cards to (think Map modifiers that give additional bonuses at the cost of higher difficulty).

Gameplay & Controls:

The game handles like a dream! Character control is smooth and point. We have options on how to control the character. On PC you can click and hold the LMB and your character will pretty much move in the direction the mouse is. This can be turned off if you prefer not to move like that. Using the LMB is also our main attack button. There are a variety of other controls we make use of. These are namely for our belt abilities, such as grenades or force fields.

The game is very similar to that of our beloved Diablo series and this is what makes this game so amazing… A Diablo like game would work perfectly; The Warhammer 40,000 universe has the size, scale, and lore to make an unforgettable game.
However, with Inquisitor – Martyr they created a brand new sector just for the placement of this game and that is where our story comes in. As an abandoned battleship appears out of nowhere in the Caligari sector, you are requested to investigate this occurrence…

From the moment you got close to this ghost vessel, things turned dire… Your ship got shut down and the vessel is infested by the worshippers of Nurgle… Things turn darker and darker here as you learn the ship's true identity and what has transpired abroad this once might Fortress Monastery. 

There are three character classes you can choose from; The Psyker, a powerful area-attack with debuff spells. There is the Crusader, a slow but heavily armored warrior, and then the Assassin, fast, agile, and deadly, but lightly armored. These three characters are powerful to wield and will bring destruction to the Emperor's enemies.

Each of these characters has three expertise and you choose one of them when creating a character. These expertise are similar to character specialization such as ranged or melee combat and giving you specific boosts based on which selection you go with. 

They also make use of a very unique set of Skill Trees, some exclusive to their class but the rest are unlockable as you progress. There are a variety of skill trees each offering unique abilities to enhance the power of your Inquisitor. 

There is the Health passive that specializes in increasing your maximum health, Damage over time, Ranged Combat, Defense, Support, and many others. Each of these trees has a variety of upgrades you can unlock by investing passive points into them, making your inquisitor that much more powerful. We have our own crafting section where we can craft and dismantle loot we do not need, the materials gained from this can then be used to craft new weapons and gear. The game's healing system is just as unique. Unlike other games where you have health packs or potions, here you have the Inoculator, a device that you can set up with a variety of abilities that does a whole lot more than just heal you! 

Suppression resistance, increase damage and several more other unique abilities can be made use of here. Another extra that this game has that is quite rewarding and unique is the unique cover system that you and the enemies can use throughout the levels. This offers a whole new level of tactical gameplay and devastation options. Every level is also filled with a variety of describable environments that further adds to the carnage of purging the heretic…

Graphics:

Quite beautiful, The Warhammer 40,000 universe is dark and very grim. There is only war and the game pictures that perfectly. Level detail is impeccable with so much detail added to each unique environment. The sheer number of destructible objects is remarkable and albeit simple, it really adds to the experience.

The backdrops such as planetary views in the different subsectors are absolutely gorgeous; sporting a variety of different colour spectrums to add to the beauty and mystery that is deep space. Character modelling was done just as beautifully. Each character is adorned and outfitted in their own unique get up that accurately represents the Warhammer 40,000 universe.

The lighting and shows for the game have been implemented just as beautifully offering that extra level of detail and beauty to the game.

Sounds:

What is a game without a good soundtrack… What is a Warhammer 40,000 title without those deep authoritarian voices that expresses their hatred and need to exterminate every Heretic, Mutant, and Xeno found in the galaxy… 

This game has an absolutely stunning soundtrack that enhances the overall experience of the game, it has further improved with the fantastic background music we have. Combined they bring this game to life in such a rewarding way. 
Voice over artists did a great job bringing their characters to life with stellar voice acting.

Replayability:

Although the game does not have multiple endings, there are two unique skill tree branches can only be unlocked by making unique decisions based on one of them. So, to unlock them completely it will require two characters. With the different playable characters and the excellent gameplay, it is more than worth it to play the game with each of the characters at least once.

The game also offers a variety of additional missions which act as side quests that you can undertake. At the end of the day, you want that god tier loot and that requires grinding… 

The game also sports co-op play so you can play the game with friends or if you're up to the task, take things PvP…

MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:
Spoilers Ahead:

The game we never knew we needed! It is a rather strange thing that nobody thought about making a Diablo like game with the Warhammer 40,000 universe… The two go together perfectly and there are endless possibilities.  

Inquisitor – Martyr is off to a great start with fantastic, yet challenging and rewarding gameplay. Beautifully created levels and a mysterious story that you can’t get enough of. It does a great job of not just copying everything from Diablo over, but coming up and presenting its own unique mechanics and features. 

There is the Perk system that is rather new and quite brilliant, which gives your character a variety of options to enhance their prowess. There are the expansive Skill Trees that offer so many build options for every class. There is that nifty inoculator that is pretty much badass and something I have yet to experience in any other game thus far. Completely new and absolutely brilliant. 

A wide range of weapons fit for close or ranged combat is at your disposal giving you so many options to go with. You can truly build yourself an Inquisitor that can stand against the tide of Darkness and with a single blow, lay waste to the enemies of the Emperor. 

There is a dedicated roadmap of additional content and improvements to come, but what we have so far is pretty fun and enjoyable.

There are a few issues though, the lack of a variety in levels. Pretty much every level feels and looks the same with a few slight changes. More variety in levels would have made the game feel less repetitive, and unfortunately, as a looter game, there is a lot of grinding to get better gear and increase your level.

I played a ""psyker"" character, and tried out a few builds while I went through a bunch of the main story content and a few side missions, but each build I was playing felt pretty braindead since I could just blast through basically any group of enemies I found in one or two hits. There are options to scale the difficulty up which just adjusts the numbers on things (you deal less damage, you take more damage), which I started playing with as soon as I could. This seems like the sort of setting which would help with the difficulty level, but it was hard to figure out what was a good difficulty setting in order for combat to be interesting ahead of time. I started ramping it up past ""extreme"", but then it just seemed like I was getting a bunch of gear which I couldn't use for a few levels, which is a nice thing to have happen once in a while in a game like this but feels bad when it is all the time.  I thought maybe I had just stumbled upon a particularly OP build, but the other ones I tried played mostly similar in how easy they were. 

Level design was very underwhelming and not very memorable - perhaps due to how easy the game was. I'll remember every inch of the undead burg in dark souls since they make you care about it, and this game seems to want to use it's cover system to get you to really pay attention to your environment, but again, if I can just blast everything to death right when I walk into a room before most of them even get into range to start attacking me then the room layout really barely matters.

Enemy design falls into a similar trap. There seem to be a wide variety of enemies who have different roles (snipers, support gunners, melee combat, summoners, teleporters, heavy armored guys, mini-bosses, etc.) but they really all ended up falling into two categories: dudes who died in 1 hit or who did piddling damage I could sort of ignore, or beefier guys I had to use some of my special skills on to kill in 2 or 3 hits or more hits while I stunlocked them. The somewhat messy visual style makes distinguishing between some types of enemies difficult (the different types of tyranid aliens), but I wonder if it is just more that I never really needed to use my brainpower to start distinguishing them.


Story is largely forgettable and emotionless, and characters are completely flat, partly due to the above issues. I seem to remember a few different kinds of missions, but they just seemed to be about blasting through room after room of enemies, so what was going on in the story never really grabs you. There isn't really much storytelling about any of the characters through the gameplay - they mostly end up just giving some inane dialogue over a moving portrait while you go and turn red dots on your map into loot.

It sounds like there are some items you can get later which add other modifiers onto some of the missions which people say make things harder, but I still hadn't found one of those 7 hours in. The main issue overall is that none of the systems in the game really get a chance to shine, since they don't really demand that the player pay much attention to them. When I can play through a story mission I am apparently appropriately leveled for for normal difficulty on the +5 underlevelled ""extreme"" difficulty and never end up having to use a heal for the whole mission, then why should I need to care about status effects and ""suppression"" and cover? By the time I was feeling like I should just crank the difficulty to max and tried out a few missions like that, I was already feeling that the rest of the experience was underwhelming.

Warhammer 40k : Martyr has both a lot going on and nothing, let me explained.
As a ARPG, it does have some nice new mechanics  ( few, though) such as covers and the old gameplay of the genre is right here : grind and loot. 
Gameplay wise,  it manages to be fun for both multi and single player campaigns.. mostly.
And that's where the problems start : basically, the singleplayer campaign it's fun until you unlock everything for your character and tried some maps... then it becomes incredibly repetitive even for an ARPG and more time passes, more you realizes that every single class has not so much to offer, compared to the endless number of levels.
Speaking of levels, the design of the maps is, at first, beautiful and filled with Warhammer 40K style but then, again, become stagnant and start to show  their emptiness.
Same for the story, intriguing at first but then become a '' go to point b, kill, hold the point, finish.'', with few variation.
Basically, the whole problem with this game that It lasts... too much, which is weird for an ARPG, since it is supposed to be replayable, so it should offers some form of incentives to keep the players playing, which it does not.
However, despite its faults, I still recommend it , even so if accompanied by multiple friends, for fan to WH40K ( which is almost a must buy ) and also for ARPG players.
Sure, it is definitely no Diablo... but if you find it discounted? then that's, my friends, the sign of the God Emperor's will!

Beware though: the grind is real. If you are looking for a game to hit max level in 20 hours, this isn't the game for you. To hit level 100 you will have to commit a huge amount of time. This also means you will be optimizing your build for a long time. I like it, but it might not be for everyone.

The missions become stale and repetitive after a while and the story is decent but nothing amazing or truly gripping and compelling. The game is a decent diablo clone but it falls short in a few areas and doesn't quite deliver what the 40k fan-base might expect from a diablo themed 40k clone. It is good for hack and slash or run and gun to clear a lot of diablo style dungeons, get loot boxes, and move on, but the story sort of grows stale and there are only a handful of basic mission types which are pretty much recycled dozens of times.

----------------
As a caveat to my recommendation, I DO recommend this game to fans of 40k. Those of you will get enjoyment out of this game beyond the sub-par gameplay. To anyone else, there are better ARPGs out there to spend your time on.

This feels like an early access title due to a great number of bugs, visual issues, server problems, etc. Every bug in this game ought to have been caught and fixed during an alpha test. Perhaps I'd expect them from an indie title or one-man developer situation, but even then they're painfully obvious issues and inexcusable for a fully released game. 

Pros:
-Lots of 40k lore; there are definitely Warhammer fans on the dev team here
-Variety of classes with some fun mechanics and skill-trees
-Variety of mobs

Cons:
-Plethora of inexcusable bugs
-Server stability right out of the 90s, and even then, a bad server from the 90s. ""I actually liked AOL"" bad.
-Advanced game mechanics can largely be ignored as fluff
-Co-Op play was probably an afterthought. Many unnecessary ""single player only missions"" defeat the purpose of Co-Op, difficulty to join other players that don't exactly match your story progress, inability to play expansion class with other classes.
-SPOILERS ON THIS NEXT ONE
 -- Playing as a Titan is a fun novelty the first time, but when you realize you can't be killed, there's no loot, no threat, and no ability to co-op these levels, you realize they're a complete waste of gaming time. Doubly-so when you fight some of the same creatures on foot that you had to fight while in the titan and realize they are still easy to kill. Pointless.

Art, sound and sheer amount of content is good. The problem for me is, no matter what area or mission you are on, everything feels exactly the same to play.  AOE the weakmobs, Mainhand the strong mobs and pop cooldowns on Bosses. That's all there is to it, time after time, area after area. There is no need to dodge, use cover or anything really.

Shame as there has obviously been a lot of work put in to this adding things, but when the core mechanic is this unwaveringly simple no new area, special effect or boss animation can save it. Its just too samey.

Pros: 
 Graphics
 Sound
 Plenty of areas

Cons:
 Combat is the obvious core of the game and combat is too simple and boring.
 Walk speed is also too low for a game such as this. You'll spend so much time watching the #run animation between mob packs it makes you question your life choices..

The visual style makes it seem like a highly technical Diablo-type game, but it's not that. It's actually a fairly simple hack and slash that keeps things basic on purpose. Instead of skill trees, you have perks that alter the game play and weapons that give you specific special powers. It's repetitive, but it's fun. There's no penalty for dying in the normal game mode, so I had to purposefully avoid dying just to make it any sort of challenge. A few missions are hard purely because you can fail them because you're on a timer. 

The environments are awesome, the art style is grand and the music is solid. The game play is lacking, particularly when you realize your character's special abilities are never going to change around level 20 or 30. What I do like is messing around with the perks, in particular the powerups that stack critical hits are fun to mess around with because it compels you to create a long chain of enemy kills in a row to keep the buff active. But there's nothing in here you haven't seen in other games, and the idea of being a cosmic space detective is just a veneer for what is really just a labyrinth-stype dungeon crawler with a mini map. I will say that the mage character has an extremely unique game play quirk where the more he uses his magic the more his own magic becomes dangerous against him. The other ones are pretty much par for the course, particularly the assassin-type character. Enemies will never get behind you, so characters with projectile weapons are almost always at an advantage. 

It's also cool that you get so much loot, but it's distressing that the items do not have unique names. The devs should've taken a cue from Diablo and given them all unique artifact names so that you acknowledge when you've found something particularly cool- in this case all the new items tend to do is adjust the stats on what you already have, and that's meaningless since you can automatically adjust the level ratio to make it harder or easier.

Dissappointment. 

Cut corners and stupid decisions everywhere.
Gameplay sucks because the control scheme sucks because the camera sucks.

Launch day was pathetically bad.

Here's hoping some patches will fix these things... doubt it though.

[EDIT ... ""current"" ]

Right so ... I grew up on D1, D2, Nox...   played a lot of Grim Dawn, PoE, D3, etc.. so ...

The camera ... still... kind of sucks.
Enemy variety sucks. This is mind boggling since they could've pulled off color-swapping enemies in a lore-friendly way.

Cut corners ... they're still there, but harder to see nowadays. At least there are no more [PLACEHOLDER] elements in the cut-scenes anymore.

Control scheme ... I'm reasonably sure it still sucks for assassins but as I've played only crusader... whatever... let's call this a fixed issue.

Stupid decisions ... this is quite interesting.
I find myself thinking about how well some things are implemented to the extent that I'm starting to regret blasting a negative review early in this game's life. Maybe if it had gotten better scores earlier, there would've been more stuff added.

I do like the ""crusade"" mechanic, the random mission mechanics, and their efforts at making running around heavy-flaming shit left and right seem integrated to the story. ... beats the hell out of that idiotic ""torment CXII"" bullshit Blizzard put into D3.

I like how you can ""tweak"" the difficulty, and especially like how a single item can allow you to play +10 rather than +8 if you do it right.

So overall I feel kind of bad for downvoting this thing earlier in the decade.

But then again, I'm reasonably sure I got a season's pass for this thing and I didn't get any dlcs, and the expansion is essentially an unrelated game. ... so yeah... still a negative review ... just because I'm equally petty.

Definitely way better than it's Fantasy counterpart, Chaosbane, so if you're deciding between the two, go for Inquisitor all the way. This game has been through a lot of updates, vastly improving the game over the years. Just be mindful a lot of guides may be for older versions of the game.

So, the story is pretty decent. An inquisitor killing all the enemies they do in this game is a little hard to believe, but the suspension of belief is needed for the great gameplay. There's a large variety of enemies including rebel guardsmen, chaos (Khorne and Nurgle), eldar, dark eldar, tyranids, and mechanicus robots. Some of those may be from the Prophecy expansion - like mechanicus. It's pretty fun encountering such a wide range of enemies and they're all fun to kill with the many weapons at your disposal from thunder hammers to bolters and psyker spells. Best of all, you can hold two sets of weapons and swap between them. The way builds work support this too. You can go all in on physical damage and go for a physical melee on one set, and physical range on another for example. 

In the base game there are three classes: Assassin, Crusader, and Psyker. Prophecy adds a fourth class so I will talk about that in prophecy review. I only tried Crusader and Psyker but loved them both. Crusader I played both melee and range. Honestly had way more fun with melee. Though it really gets good in the end game where the build really comes together with slotted equipment. Even though the build may be melee, there are a ton of maneuverability options like teleporters and jetpacks to get in and out of the fray.

Gunplay includes a cover system but honestly I rarely used it and would just kite enemies or kill them before they reach me. Most bosses seemed to be able to blast through cover anyways. Guns and psyker skills are super satisfying to use though, warhammer 40k weaponry is just a lot of fun. Psyker is this games version of a magician. You can run around casting spells all day and it can be super fun. Instead of consuming mana, you basically use more and more energy and if too much is done, can start hurting yourself or throwing out anomalies such as spawning demons or harmful vortexes. It's neat though - I like being able to risk casting more spells instead of having to wait for mana regen. Alternatively, can just switch to a staff weapon and cooldown that way.

The game has a morality system but you really want to always choose one moral path or the other. Roleplaying and going for both decisions can screw you over as you won't be able to get the moral skill trees unless go all-in on one path. Co-op is also a bit frustrating as the guest player must always go with the host player's decision. This is bad since Psyker really benefits the most from Radical, while Crusader would benefit more from Puritan. Also not all missions are available in co-op so every once and a while forced to disband to do single player missions in a tank or walker. These missions are OK. Honestly kind of a waste of time since you don't get any experience or items. The novelty wears after the third time it makes you do do this really, if not sooner. I guess I appreciate a break from the normal gameflow.

Although I kinda wish there was a way to skip the campaign with a new character. It's needed to unlock all systems, provides good experience, etc. But it's just so long and the end game content and normal side missions are so much faster and more fun. Void Crusades are a ton of fun with a lot of great rewards! Just gets frustrating to have to play through the campaign again to unlock them and then actually get high enough level to make them worth going through.

That said, one playthrough on one character is definitely worth it. I just got kinda burnt out playing through the campaign on 3 characters (I had 2 crusaders, one for co-op one for single player). Co-op was fun when it worked but we had many issues with disconnects and rubber banding. Made it kind of frustrating so I would often play by myself after a co-op session. I do really enjoy the game though and kept playing even after the story was done and curious enough to make multiple characters. Making builds was fun. I do plan on coming back to resume end-game play on my melee crusader. Just so much fun to smash demons up close like I'm doom guy in an ARPG.",1614975792,1615325928,True,83,0,0.86164391040802002,0,True,False,False

After an hour or two of doing side quests you tend to feel the monotony of the Imperium.  Personally in this game I do not really see it as a negative.  You're role is that of the one few Inquisitors within the Empire, and threats are everywhere.  No matter where you go nor how many you save there will be another map, likely on the same location with yet another threat.  You truly need faith in the Emperor to repeatedly go back to the same map over and over to repeatedly drive out both the Heresy as well as the vile Xenos that are willing to take any form of weakness as a toe hold into his Glorious Empire.

Over and over you clear a system until finally after hours of game play the system is free of side quests.  It is truly, to me, the best in game expression of the Empire's ""Holding back the Darkness."" More over then any other GW title this one tests your faith in the Emporer as well as your own grit and determination.  Only those that truly revere and serve the Emporer will be able to complete this 'game' / simulation.  The Emporer protects, and I am his wrath! 

It's a great game easily 4.5 / 5 - I'd highly recommend giving it a try.

Literally any other diabloclone is better, like PoE for the same experience or Torchlight 2 for COOP. This game is just an empty waste of time to play.

Which is a shame because 40k+Diablo is a potentially godlike combo. Seems they went with more of a POE approach to it, though, all the content is instanced(Load into the hub>Select mission>Load into the mission>Complete it, load into the hub again>Repeat), the game runs on the developers' own servers, seems they wanted to have a focus on community events, but there's no community to begin with.

The oily shadings and Unity store tier models make it look like a mobile game, but otherwise the game looks ok. Temporal AA sucks ass and will just blur the game while making it lag.
The camera angle is extremely frustrating, it's tilted in a way that you only see what's in front of you, so you have to manually move it around a lot(extremely frustrating on KB+M where its hold MMB to move it)
Seems like the game was designed for controllers in general. Only 6 buttons for attacks with LMB and RMB, plus the medkit is on '0' for some reason. 
The locations are done pretty nicely, though with a lot of the content being procedurally generated, you'll start to see a lot of the same maps. But I don't play these games for sightseeing anyway. 

The worst aspect of the 40k representation visually is the colors they went with for all the bad guys you kill. They're mostly pitch black with some shades of gray thrown in there. Rebels, Dark Eldar, Eldar. Even the one Space Marine chapter you meet is a muddy gray color. Rebel guardsmen in black worked in DoW2 because it was situated on an ice world. Black on a white background. In this game you just never see who it is you're killing unless its a big guy.

The sound design got the worst of it. Barely any of the iconic weapons pack a punch. The Plasma guns have the most laughable sound imaginable. The Bolter, Chainsword etc are also laughable. Voice acting is particularly bad, especially on what little lines theyve recorded for the bad guys(lmao at the CSM voice filter). Could've taken a book from DoW or even Fire Warrior.

The soundtrack is actually alright, and i like some of the things the composer did with it. The desert theme is cool, and more 40k games in the future should use electric guitars. Problem is, its implemented badly within the game itself. You'll mostly hear ambience noise if the game doesnt decide to stop playing music altogether(most likely scenario), so youd better be blasting a playlist or two in the background.

Endgame content(Void Crusades) isnt even doable in COOP, and even when it will be, COOP seems to be unstable and disconnects a lot. If you happen to crash or DC, no progress is saved(the game only ever saves during its many loading screens). It's also another game that requires an always online connection.

Pet peeves: Weapon types seem to be unbalanced, with some being clearly superior to others, and all of the character classes end up with pretty much the same build(if you want to survive). AOE seems to be mandatory. Endgame armor sets look like ass. The Tarot """"system"""" is just an incredible grind for little reward. Just spam Maelstorm of Carnage till lvl 100 for XP.

And to top it off, the game seems to have FNV levels of stability, with the game often crashing for people for different reasons. Very fun when the game doesn't save progress, but it does make sure to send a crash report every time.

Just in general feels like a soulless cashgrab.",1613822435,1613822435,False,55,2,0.695786893367767334,0,True,False,False

They really nailed the fell of 40k atmosphere, really love how the environments look. This game has more complexity than Van Helsing also made by neocore. Really the best ARPG that is not Grim Dawn, PoE or Diablo 2,3. The game is not perfect and there are repetition to the maps. You will see the same assets reused. It has an endgame system similar to PoE's maps, there are intel bulletins and you can modify them with tarrot cards similar to orbs in PoE. It's an ARPG that feels like DoW2 if you controlled 1 character. If you like 40k and ARPGs buy this, this is not your typical ARPG do not expect it to be as fast paced as Diablo 3 or PoE. It plays differently and I think that is why it is fun.  Martyr is not trying to copy pasta D3 like other games. Also I think loot and itemization are good.

I had been watching the price for a while, and I would recommend you pick this up if it goes on super-sale again.

I typically work 10 hour shifts and was looking for a game i could come home to and play in my off time.  Entertainment, 40k, and that power-fix is what I was looking for without a huge time requirement.  I would argue that this game provided all of that.  Is the story great?  Eh, not amazing, but entertaining.  Is it a Triple A game with no bugs?  Not in the slightest.  Has it been worth it as i've played 50 or so hours?  Yup.

Pros:
- Great on time management - although you log on to the server to load everything, all of the missions you can hit escape and pause it...something I appreciated considering all the online games.
  - You can also pop in for a mission (story or random) for short periods of time.  If you don't have time to power-level your inquisitor but still want that fix, this game facilitates that.
- Higher levels allow you to explore much, much more difficult challenges
  - Long endgame mechanics allow really long play time, at least that's what i can see so far.  I am 50 hours in and still feel like i am in the early game.
- Can grind-level relatively quickly and walk into story line missions way overpowered.

  I liken this game to a 40K Diablo (but the not the storyline.  albeit entertaining, no where near diablo).

Cons:
- Take a while to get used to all the mechanics
- TONS of build options, i know i was overwhelmed when I would hop on and just want to kill things.
- Game tends to chug when there are many enemies on screen and i am hitting all of them.  Not really a Con, most games would do that, but something to mention (w/a Nvidia 1060m).

the artwork is pretty nice however the missions get very repetitive after just 3-4 of them, its essentially the same thing with very minor variations to them.

the game play is the same too , with various guns only giving you the same options, (fire once. fire as a burst, fire while retreating) + one extra weapon specific ability, 
its very unimaginative if you use a plasma pistol or auto gun or flamer you get more or less the same abilities while they could have done so much more.

good artwork and decent storyline but such wasted potential.

Nothing really came close except for Inquisitor which also manages to combine the previous games' elements of horror and fantasy as only Warhammer can.

Delightfully, the game does what few ARPG's (even Blizzard's) does:  you can play it with a gamepad on PC.  And it's a seamless part of the game, not some awkward add-on.  The art values are top-notch along with excellent sound design.  From the clang of your Inquisitor's boots on the deckplates of the Martyr and the cries of ""For the Emperor"" from erstwhile Imperial Guard comrades-in-arms, it's a satisfyingly visceral game.  

I'm still just starting the campaign but the full (all DLC's) game offers multiplayer components and weekly rewards that rival those of other ARPG's that have an online component.  Like ARPG's with higher end production budgets, the campaign includes some voice talent and even the occasional cutscene.  As mentioned in other reviews, if you play long enough, the maps start to get repetitive but they cover a gamut of environments both indoor and outdoor.

The game evokes the simplicity and darkness of the original Diablo.  There's plenty of 40K lore but it's presented in a digestable format that you don't feel completely overwhelmed by reading.  It introduces game mechanics I don't yet fully understand including suppression and a barely useful cover system along with many customizable class types.

The monsters are your usual ARPG staples including generators, hordes, and bosses but the W40K equivalents, of course.  My shooter build has encountered Chaos Marines and Tyranids but I hope to run into Eldar and maybe even Orks later on.

Lastly, in addition to the campaign, there are side missions and randomly generated missions that have no bearing on the story except as opportunities to level up.  The game does seem to stress the graphics card more so than other ARPG's but I've not experienced any crashes or bugs other than spelling errata.  I have more experience with the DoW games in the W40K universe, but when I've had my fill of strategy, this is easy to get into if you feel like experiencing the carnage that a soldier of the Emperor can wreak.",1613457899,1613457899,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

All it required was a simple game restart. After losing everything, I hadn't done that because I was so disheartened. I started the game again (this was about 24 hours later) and everything was back.

 I got it on sale for 15$ and it was certainly worth that price. I would have a hard time recommending it for the full retail value of 50$ when it alternatives like POE and Diablo 3 are just better. But the WH40k universe is just fun to play in, and this being a descent ARPG allows you to do that. 

End game is a bit shallow and repetitive, but we are talking about ARPG so ... 

I would say the story/plot is light years better than POE, but you do have to have some WH40k knowledge to appreciate it, otherwise its just background.

However, the camera doesn't get ""low"" or ""flat"" enough on zoom to make it work perfectly as an over-the-shoulder action rpg and there is a wonky stutter step when disabling click movement and trying to be a hybrid build.

The negatives are the (campaign) vehicle levels. You feel pretty good as a character only to be thrown into a jank vehicle level with new abilities, level of power, etc. In my case I was playing on higher difficulty and my tank wasn't scaled in damage and when it died it would leave its husk on the battlefield when I respawned. Super jank. Just give an intro of the vehicle breaking their lines, kick me out of a hatch, and let me get back to hack & slash times.

And within these three sub-classes, although this is only in name because the only thing that changes when choosing a sub-class is the starting team, as you progress through the campaign or open world missions you get the rest with it. that you can build your character that would be broadly, AT SHORT DISTANCE (swords, blades, axes, shields, etc) or REMOTE with rifles, machine guns and the iconic Bolter. Even armor suits this, having the Assault and Demolition armor respectively.


In short, you have plenty of options that will surely end up hooking you, the problem is that the progression mechanics are not very fair, let's say, Each part of your team has what the game calls enchantments and each part has an enchantment limit (enchantments are the variants and values ​​that each part of the team has). Each part of the equipment has a rarity range (gray, blue, green, yellow and red) to a higher rarity level, the more enchantments the piece of equipment can have, for example a gray object has no enchantment, a green one can having two enchantments with a maximum of five and a red or yellow can frame a maximum of six enchantments (Red and yellow have a unique enchantment, they are the best). Once this is understood, the problem arises when the game refuses to give you the best pieces of equipment, the ideal would be to have your equipment made up of pieces of yellow rarity and six enchantments, well if you want that you will have to cultivate like an unhappy person because The game will not give it to you easily and if you manage to achieve this it will surely be with a design that you do not like because if each weapon, armor has different designs, this is good and at the same time bad since many times you will end up with a weapon or armor that you don't like it aesthetically but that it is complete to put it one way. The game has a weapon and armor crafting mode that you unlock as you advance in the campaign, a totally useless thing. All these shortcomings that name. The creation system does not solve them and even worsens them since creating something is not cheap and you will end up spending your cultivation hours in obtaining nothing. One would believe that when making something you would have the option of choosing the number of enchantments and the values ​​that these should have to adapt to our construction or at least the design that we would like, none of those happens since everything ends up being totally random and the safest thing is that you spend your hours of cultivation for nothing. By the way, to make objects of yellow or red rarity you need to unlock the option with a lot of in-game currency and you also need blueprints (which have five limited uses) after spending those uses you will have to put up with it and wait for these planes deign to fall from an enemy when eliminated or miraculously appear in the store to buy it.
All this is defined in that it seems that the game always tries to limit you and prevent you from reaching the maximum of your performance, there is always something that limits you,

Leaving that topic aside, now the game modes.
OPEN WORLD: The most boring and tedious missions in the whole game. It is better to do what is right and necessary, not to spend too much time on these missions
CAMPAIGN MODE: Excellent, very attractive. Easy should be 40 hours of campaign alone
WAR ZONE MODE: I can't remember at what level (I think 50), ten or eleven missions marked with increasing difficulty to go through each mission are unlocked. Very good gameplay, very attractive, and a mode that improves team cultivation compared to open world missions.
VOID CRUSADE  MODE: The best game mode, when advancing in each mission another is unlocked and the difficulty also increases, the rewards are the most rewarding and the best way to progress, in the higher difficulty levels it is required to have a character very well built if it will not be impossible for you to finish the crusade.
Well after each mission has its clear objectives, sometimes it is not necessary to kill all the enemies, I always did not care about that. This is WarHammer 40k, the only objective of each mission is to PURGE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOD-EMPEROR OF HUMANITY

Then the setting of each scenario, maps, weapons, ships, vehicles is exquisite. All in line with 40k, any fan of the franchise would be satisfied

In short, it is a very good game, all the shortcomings that I point out are not impediments to ending the campaign, many of them you end up noticing when you want to bring your character to maximum performance and test different constructions (for example, change short combat distance to long distance). You easily have your 40 hour long campaign. 


And if the game seems slow at first, you just have to hope to improve your character and you will see that even a Crusader with the most voluminous armor can move fast.

However, the game progression is too boring : each map, I use one long-range spell (that I picked at level 1) and a few buff, and that's it for every maps. Each mission requires the same gameplay : hit from far distance and move forward...
I followed a few video (Psyker class) with build and tutorial to better understand the game.
But for example, the gear affix doesn't bring quite a big difference.
Same goes for the spells, that doesn't bring much fun.

Some tips:
Seen a lot of reviews on here saying the game isn't challenging. Once you get past the initial story missions, you can select the difficulty at the start of every mission. I recommend +1 early, then increasing later on. Void missions with certain Tarot augments can be quite hard.
Seen some people say the game has too much small-increment grind. This is an ARPG. This is the genre. This game is actually very good at itemization, with no penalties for unsocketing gems or psalms. Crafting is expensive, so save your money. Leveling is very fast.

However, if you're thinking about this just because you're a fan of the universe: don't make the mistake that I did and please reconsider. For its price the only thing of value to you will be a lackluster story that you could get faster, easier and for free off of the wikipedia page's plot section.

To get straight to the point, I can't find any reason why I'd want to play this game. Honestly, most of my time in it came from me wanting to get my money's worth out of the purchase. It starts off fine enough, the story gets you interested in what's happening and you get to try out different weapons, items and strategies. However, that only lasts a couple of hours until you settle on something you like or want to do and realize that there isn't any reason to use anything else. Most weapons can do most things, and enemies die the same either way. You then learn that the gameplay loop is pretty much just: spawn into level -> walk forward -> mulch group of enemies in 5 seconds -> walk forward again -> mulch enemies in exact same way -> repeat until you've killed the enemies near the objective. There are, of course, different kinds of missions available, but that's what all of them end up being: just walk around and kill everything and interact with something if necessary. Of the enemies to kill, there are basically two types: enemies that die in seconds without second thought (can be ranged or melee) and those that require sustained hitting. That second group extends the duration of the mission by 10-30 seconds or so, so that's neat. I've only tried two of the classes so far, but from what I can tell it really ends up feeling like a point-and-click adventure by the end (or middle {or beginning}). If you've turned on auto-loot (which saves you the trouble of manually clicking on every dropped item), you can find an inventory chalk full of useless loot that you'll instantly sell or salvage when you get back from the mission. Sometimes, you'll have so much garbage in your pockets that you won't be able to carry it all! I don't look at loot at all unless it's relic level or higher, and even then it'll probably get scrapped. The graphics aren't really that good, the characters' animated vox portraits look like something out of the first Fallout game, and everything looks either blurry or pixelated wherever you go. The story isn't all that special, and doesn't do enough to make me even want to finish it.

Look, I like WH40k. I'll give most of the games set in that universe at least a good playthrough. That said, this game really just wasn't worth the time or money.",1610836456,1610837310,False,1,0,0.487084835767745972,0,True,False,False

Taking the first step to play was the most challenging part - I burned out on the action-RPG genre after many years of Diablo 2.  Ultimately, being a Warhammer 40K lore nerd got the best of me and I jumped in.

The story is pretty standard 40K fare.  You're an inquisitor, everyone else is likely a heretic, and you must bring them back to the Emperor's Light.  There's a few decision points in the story that impact character development (radical vs puritan) but they don't do much for the story itself.  Still, I enjoyed the story and wanted to see it through to completion.

The gameplay is pretty standard Diablo-esque clickfests painted with the 40K setting.  The two marry nicely, with 40K's various short and long-range weapons fitting with the various mobs.  The character abilities are interesting, though I didn't see much differences among the subtypes of each character.  Your character does become fairly overpowered by the end of the main story; this ends up balanced by the concept of the Emperor's Tarot.  This allows you to apply random modifiers to missions that increase the difficulty while also increasing your loot chances.  I used it a few times but I'm not a huge fan of min-maxing characters to get through the various modifiers.

Graphically the game is quite nice.  Weapon effects are especially nice and match up in my head with what I thought a lot of the 40K weapons would be like.  The environments are rendered nicely, though they are very very repetitive.  That's not uncommon for an action-RPG though.  I did notice Martyr pushed my laptop (Core i7-8750H/GTX 1070) harder than most other graphically intensive AAA titles.  I could imagine it being hard on a lower-end system.

There is a lot of extra end-game content the developers have made available in the various seasons and DLCs.  I've played through some of it, but with the end of the main story, I lost a lot of motivation to continue.  I did get almost 60 hours of gameplay but the repetitiveness of the enemies and environments kept me from wanting to bust beyond that mark.

Overall, it's a solid buy if you've got the hardware and an interest in the grimdark of the Warhammer 40K universe.  Yes, the repetitiveness in the endgame eventually ate away at the experience for me but I feel like I more than got my money's worth.",1610343665,1610343665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Was I left satisfied? - Well, yes, but it wasn’t an experience I would easily recommend to anyone.

[*]Overview
Good, ol’ diabloid set in WH40k; we get to choose from several classes of Imperial Inquisitors and fight our way through multiple story campaigns, as well as numerous, replayable side missions. We can fight solo or in a 2-4 party, facing off hordes of xenos and heretics; constantly on the lookout for new cool gear. That about sums it up.
[*]Story
We play as an Inquisitor of… some Ordo (I’m not sure if it’s ever clarified during the story), set to find a supposedly rogue Inquisitor last sighted on a Space Hulk called Martyr. As the story progresses, we learn about multiple plots surrounding the Martyr and its former owner, as well as participate in many conflicts that take place within the Caligari sector.
All in all, it’s best to experience the story with minimal spoilers, but I would keep your expectations low - this is not a full-scale RPG, after all. Devs from the Neocore did their best to stay true to the setting, but the overall story remains rather simple and a bit stretched out for my taste. They also did introduce a lot of their own elements (characters/chapters/orders/technologies/etc.), but they do fit in the WH40k universe, more or less.
[*]Gameplay
Straightforward, gore-y combat, with a plethora of both ranged and melee weapons, as well as a bunch of additional gear, like grenades, rosaries etc. Each weapon has different types of ammo/attacks that you can use at any time, switching between the weapons on the fly or combining different one-handed weapons however you please. Each of the three (four with the Prophecy expansion) classes has potential for a lot of various builds, so rest assured - you will be able to find the one that suits your playstyle the most.
In terms of progression - you have dozens of skill trees, both shared ones and those that are unique for each class. As expected, you’ll get to farm loads of loot, but be advised that it will take you [b]a while[/b] before you even get close to farming the most rare gear, let alone be able to easily craft it.
The missions are incredibly linear and straightforward, in 90% of cases requiring you to just go from point A to point B while slaughtering everyone in sight and looting everything there is to loot. Overall, in my opinion, the game starts off feeling rather drab and boring, but after ~10 hours or so, once you start unlocking cool perks and gaining access to a more diverse arsenal, the game finally starts to gain some traction. Same can be said about the story, actually.
All in all, Martyr is just a diabloid set in WH40k. It does have some unique, cool ideas, but it doesn’t feel like anything out of ordinary or something you would want to invest a lot of time in. If you enjoy endless grinding - naturally you’ll find the ways to entertain yourself here. If you’re just looking for some game to kill some time, preferably with friends - you can also give it a go. But keep your expectations low, that’s all I’m saying.
[*]Graphics
Visually the game is… okay. Don’t get me wrong - the artists did a great job at creating levels suitable for the WH40k setting, which is SUPPOSED to be grimdark; with its architecture following strict templates, but… man it gets repetitive at times. Essentially, you have 5 main types of landscapes, with small variations: desert, frozen desert, destroyed imperial city, imperial hive world and some sort of imperial installation (space station/spaceship/outpost/etc.) And each new location is composed out of a bunch of assets that you’ll see in any map of the same landscape type.
As for the visuals of characters/gear/enemies - everything is in line with the lore and pretty well executed. Not mind blowing, naturally, but pretty solid for a diabloid.
[*]Sound
Soundtrack and SFX are acceptable. Nothing to brag about, but they do the trick. As for the voice acting - some of the characters are executed fairly well, but some… Let’s just say that some actors were trying a bit too hard, so the results ended up being somewhat goofy =)
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
7/10. If you’re a fan of diabloids - I’m pretty sure you’re gonna have a lot of fun farming here, getting the best gear and getting to the highest difficulties. If you’re not - you will most likely enjoy a single playthrough, especially if you’re a WH40k fan, and then set this game aside. At any rate, it’s a all around decent game, which doesn’t excel at anything, but doesn’t have any significant drawbacks, either.",1610053650,1610053650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tl, dr: It's amusing, but not worth full price. Decent game but nothing out of the ordinary.

I did not get a refund, so I put the time into it, got past the troubles and managed to get it running. 

Although I stand by my previous statement (there are still crashes happening) I can now at least sink some time into it. It's decent, but I'd recommend to get it at a sale, if at all (which i nearly recommend you do for any game with a games workshop tag anyway, (this ain't the Devs fault, they made other mistakes, but nearly EVERYTHING with GW attached to it is overpriced and undercooked, and you can get better or equally good entertainment for a lower price elsewhere, be it a videogame or miniatures)

Old review:
I bought this at a sale, and now I am going for a refund. Some missions just crashed when I tried to load them, I got Authentication errors, and so on an so forth.

When I got it to run, it ran smoothly and was pretty fun though, for the maybe 2 hours that it worked. Still wouldn't recommend it, based on the possibility that maybe someone else encounters the same problems that I encountered, and wastes time trying solutions from forums/discussions, which drives the playtime close to the threshold for a refund.

I just don't understand why a 2-year old game can still have stuff like this happening, I should've listened to the reviews online before i bought.",1609509593,1609801988,False,1,0,0.501742184162139893,0,True,False,False

This is probably the best ARPG ive played. IMHO most ARPG kinda look and feel the same, so it was really refreshing to play something that was not in a fantasy setting. 

The 40K universe is a perfect setting, and if you feel intimidated by that, i actually think this is a good starting off point. Theres quite a bit of 40K names and terms, but you dont really need to have prior knowledge to understand the plot. I myself only know some of the basics of 40K.
If you are a 40K and / or ARPG fan this is a must play. 

The gameplay is quite different from what you are probably used to in other ARPGs. There are fewer enemies, theres a cover system and suppresion mechanic, combat is a bit slower and more tactical. All of which i love! You go on some really interresting investigations in the side missions as well as the main story which is something ive never seen in an ARPG. From what ive seen Neocore also changed A LOT since launch, making the game faster, full COOP campaign and much more, so make sure you are checking newly updated reviews!

In terms of build diversity theres just so much. Perhaps a bit too much sometimes. It can be quite overwhelming to get your head around all the various stats, states, damage types etc. Some of these things the game does not really explain properly in the games tutorials or journal. Rather you have to seek out the extensive compendium online. It would have been great if they included the complete compendium in the game itself.

Also i ended up playing with a controller which this game luckily supports. It just feels more natural to me.

Theres also A TON of content here, 23 hours in and i still have not maxed a class / character out yet, finished the story and theres still a ton of good side missions (in both story and gameplay) to do. If you get the complete collection, which has all DLC and the Prophecy expansion its even more crazy.

The only con i can think of is the constant online connection requirement, which kind of blows.

Basically if you like warhammer 40k and you like Diablo style ARPGS then you will like this game, but don't expect anything new or expect to have a out of this world experience.  

People were setting the bar a bit too high for this game, and to be fair the game wasn't exactly made by a  high budget company.  Are there a few things the game could have done better? Yes there is.  Could the combat and skills be a little smoother?  Yes sure.  Are there better diablo style ARPGs out there? Yes.

The game is a nice break from the normal classes of barbarian, wizard and rogue and the same old medieval setting.  The classes are basically those, but its nice to see it in a different skin.

Basically you have to like both diablo style ARPGS and warhammer 40k to like this.  If you only like one of those then you wont like this.  The devs have given this game some love since release so I would say its worth checking out on sale, but at normal price I would say no.

- No optimization what so ever. Had to cut settings because inventory!!! screens were lagging :/

Having just bought all the DLC and the game itself for only 28 bucks (due to the steam winter sale), I can say without a doubt  that this game is definitely worth it as it is now (with all the additional content)...as you can see i played this game for 9.7 hours...which is pretty good considering i literally just bought it 10 hours ago...it was so fun. I am only now going to bed at 4am. 

There are 4 classes, and each has 3 sub-classes. There are tons of guns, armor and other loot that you get regularly. Tons of side quests to do, an interesting and fully voiced story, you can adjust the difficulty for each mission (higher difficulty gets you better stuff and allows you to upgrade faster). There are great quality of life improvements like (auto loot, so you aren't clicking like a madman every time you kill a boss or rare enemy), you can easily sort your loot etc. 

TLDR: if you like games like  Van Helsing/Diablo but wanted one set in the Warhammer universe, this game is definitely for you. I have really enjoyed the game so far and will continue to play it for quite awhile. Since enough time has passed from when the game came out (And since there is so much DLC) and since its so cheap right now...definitely buy this game...there is tons of content, its interesting and most importantly, it looks great and is fun to play.",1609668435,1609668435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The maps are small and largely linear, the effects sometimes make it hard to see what's going on but most of the time they're incredibly underwhelming with the Molten Beam spell being a recycled lasgun effect. Psyker is the only class that can freely swap abilities, every other class is stuck with whatever abilities their weapon type has making class specific weapons the largest part of class identity. Weapon skills have little synergy with other weapons or no synergy even with themselves. Skill trees are universal with the exception of 2 psychic trees that can be largely ignored. There appear to be optimization issues as I still seem to have stuttering framerates with everything turned down/off. The game nails the aesthetic of 40k but that doesn't mean it looks great even at the highest settings. You can't change weapon skills so if you'd rather a certain skill be bound to Right Mouse instead of 1 you have to change the keybinds and potentially change it again when you switch to a different weapon.

But I can acknowledge the hard work Neocore games put into Warhammer 40k Diablo. If you go into it wanting the next best ARPG or some super neckbeardy slugfest through the 40k universe, then you're going to be disappointed. If you go into it wanting to play a rather straightforward ARPG with bolters, chainswords, and thunderhammers (oh my), then you're going to have a good time.

Are there bugs? Sure. It's a 40k title. There will always be bugs because that's the curse of the universe's games.

Does the maps and enemies get repetiive? Also sure. There's a set few maps that get repeated a fair bit and the enemies become fairly easily to outplay once you figure out their behavior patterns. But that's par for the course with most ARPGs anyway.

Could the game have some more class variety? Sure. 3 classes with 3 sub-classes each can be a little stale, but this was a proof of concept and I'm fairly certain we can expect new classes and content of that sort in future DLCs.

Is it the most faithful depiction of the grimdark 40k setting to ever grace your steam library? Eh, not really. You can 1v10 Chaos Space Marines and make them look silly in the process.

But it's a solid game with a decent main story, actually good voice acting, fun mechanics (heavy bolters are so damn satisfying), and something that most grimderp 40k games lack: wit and humor. The characters have a certain charm to them that makes you actually kind of give a shit about them and actually has you chuckling with their banter at times. 

Don't expect this game to change the genre forever. But don't toss it aside without a thought. Martyr is a solid ARPG and a welcome addition to the 40k games of the current generation.

7/10 would recommend.

UPDATE:

Gave this game another go a while after writing this review. Since then, the devs have done a ton of updating to the handling of Martyr. For those interested, you can read all the fun details on their 2.0 update post.

This game has seen vast improvements over its earlier life and I am pleasantly surprised. It's still not a terribly groundbreaking game in the ARPG genre, but it's a ton of fun once you hit your stride.

A couple points of note, both good and bad:

+ Graphics are quite impressive and the general scenery/atmosphere of the levels is pretty well on point.

+ Weapon and ability feel are on flippin' point. The feel and sound of weapons like the heavy bolter or the thunder hammer bring a happy tear to my eye. Your armor abilities are also satisfying to use. From the jump pack of the assault crusader class to the time manipulation of the eradicator assassin class, and everything in between it feels lovely in the midst of combat.

+ Leveling and gear gets a major thumbs up with 2.0. Before, your overall level was kind of janky to figure out. The best I could describe it as is similar to I level in FF14, but less intuitive. Now? Your level is based on... your level. Shocking, I know. It's simple, it's effective, and it makes sense. Items still have the usual color based rarity system, only now it's nowhere near the chore it used to be to get relic and archaeotech level gear (just wait until you've completed your first Void Crusade... By the Throne, it's glorious).

+ DLC is fun and adds some new enemies and such to the mix, as well as a couple new maps (praise the Emperor! Variety!) and the option to pay fate points to pay for them is pretty nice too. That said, if you can find them on sale, I recommend that over the full listed price. Also, ignore the Charbdyis Outpost DLC listing in your inventory. It was a pre-order bonus exclusive for console players that somehow wind up in the PC version's DLC listing. That's a bug the devs are aware of.

+/- Sound is both on point and meh in some places. Again, the sound of the weapons is beautiful and sparks joy. The music is ok overall. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice change up from blaring organs and indecipherable dog Latin chanting, but it often lacks the punch you'd expect in those tense moments of gameplay. A shortcoming in the sound of this game is that it often gets a bit congested in the middle of a massive fight. When you have 50+ enemies all using their abilities at the same time as you're slamming away on full auto with your heavy bolter, things get kind of noisy. So much so that at times the audio seemed to have some clipping issues as it struggled to sort out the cacophony of gunfire and screams.

- Finesse of handling definitely gets a negative point here. Not saying it's bad. But it's clunky at times, and often acts caddywampus when you definitely don't want it to. An example of this being directional based attacks that seem to go off in directions that you didn't want them to. This has had me repeating the line ""Thank you for hitting that heretical pillar/wall/park bench, but please next time prioritize the daemons getting all up in my face, please and thank you"" far too many times to count.

- AI is still pretty jank, truth be told. You'll have enemies pathing weird ways, allies rushing into minefields as if they were members of the Death Korps of Krieg, bosses locked in idle animation (not that I'm complaining, mind you, free damage is free damage), floating enemies off the map, I could go on, but you get the picture. Mind you, there's no more falling through the map (at least that I've encountered) and your character getting into and out of cover is no longer so finicky as it used to.

N/A Multiplayer. I'll be honest, I don't have many friends who play Martyr, let alone who have clocked the hours I have into this game... So I have not touched the multiplayer for this game at all. No idea how stable it is, but multiplayer isn't my thing when it comes to ARPGs. So yeah, tread that territory with the same caution you'd give the Ghoul Stars.

All in all, this game has come a long way and is definitely worth a look if you're a fan of ARPGs and WH40k. Again, don't expect it to blow your mind, but don't write it off without a second thought.

I enjoyed the game story (do take note I am a Warhammer fan and has read on quite a bit of the novels), and it felt good to see different characters came alive in the game (although I felt that the Space Marine should be the one doing most of the fight, no?).

The missions are a nice length -- the intro ones seemed too short to me, but they increased and are pleasant for a quick session.   You can change weapons mid-map -- I seem to recall reading reviews that said you couldn't, so perhaps that was changed in a patch.  

 I've mostly done an Assassin Sniper with a smattering of Assault Crusader ( I think that's what he's called ) and for either of them, I do love the shotgun.  The game has a reload mechanic for ammo-based weapons, so it feels a bit more like a shooter than an ARPG.  You do have to aim, for the most part, when using ranged weapons.  At first the things that seem confusing start to gel, as you try more and more weapons and realize the similarities in controls -- focused, AOE, etc., for each, although every weapon class does play a little differently.  It's also fun to combine weapons for dual wielding -- a sword with a pistol, or a different sword, can yield some fun combinations.   Also, heavy flamers are a real treat.  Shields are a lot of fun compared to other similar games that just add a block chance -- being able to use a shield actively to deflect is great.  I would definitely recommend, and I'd recommend putting some time in before a judgement is made.

This time it was down to £13 and i was really tempted. but a few reviews made me think about it. 

3 minutes left on the Steam Sale i bought it, WHY? because one of the issues was they was taking players for fools with a new game/expansion  (that was suppose to be free) and loads of DLC to buy.

The Space u can go around is decently Large i was quite surprised.

Similar style to Diablo and Grim Dawn.
typical 40k Story of Destruction and death to the enemies of man. 
Seems to be a nice Array of weapons

Cons;

Couple bugs discovered so far. Getting stuck on a console i was trying to hack

Loading in and found the character models sliding around the floor instead of walking

I'll just break this down into components.
Visuals:4/5. The art direction here is on point, everything just oozes warhammer. The problem is that there's a functional aspect to visuals as well as an atmospheric one and the functional aspect of the visuals is suffering. It's hard to see what's going on. I feel like I have this problem with every diablo clone that's in 3d and I am beginning to wonder if leaving 2d was a mistake for the genre.
Music: 3/5, it's nice to see something other than chanting and organs for 40k but for the most part the most I can say about this is that it's unintrusive.
Voicework: 2/5 There's a lot of spoken dialogue, and overall it's uninspired. Usually it's unintrusive, but occasionally it's bad enough to take you out of the experience.
Action Gameplay: 3/5. So, I think that skills based on weapon type is a great idea for this type of game and I'm glad to see someone try it. There's enough variety that just trying all the different weapons to see what feels good will take you a few hours, which is all good fun.  Once that wears off, though the flow of combat itself is in one of two places. Either you're zooming through everything with an outrageous clearspeed and it feels very smooth but not particularly satisfying, or you're getting chunked very hard by attacks and effects that quite honestly aren't signposted very well at all. Against daemonhost boss types I've been hitting them in the back and not seeing an attack animation come out of them, but I'll just take damage as if I were facetanking a combo attack. It's extremely frustrating. Overall I actually wish combat was slower and heavier. It would resonate with the 40k aesthetic better. On top of this, the keyboard controls are uncomfortable for action play and the controller has some serious issues with user interface. You also can't switch back and forth freely during gameplay, so you're stuck with either a clunky menu or clunky combat controls.
RPG Elements:1/5. You can't really assess a skill tree unless you make multiple builds, which I haven't done, but the gear system is literally the worst I have ever seen. Five levels of gear with randomized stat affixes and no naming system to indicate that this sword gives you shield on hit and that sword gives you increased crit chance. Even the highest rarity level of items are unnamed and entirely randomized! It's just so disappointing to me, because it's always such a good feeling to find a unique you can use, even if it's only for a while when you're leveling, and the unique being just a generic collection of random affixes just kills a big part of the appeal of playing these kinds of games. I like the feeling of having a legendary sword with a cool name that explodes when you hit people with it, and when that legendary weapon drops, I like knowing that whatever else may be the case about this sword, it explodes when I hit people with it. The character sheet is cluttered, because much like way too many games these days, there is a laundry list of stats which mostly don't matter in the slightest. 

I only recommend this game because it's on sale for a generous discount right now, and I would only recommend it to people who are diehard fans of both isometric arpgs and warhammer 40k who have exhausted themselves with the other entries in the genre.",1608870156,1608870511,True,10,2,0.65596240758895874,0,True,False,False

But for 20€ or less on a sale it's great.

Out of all the Warhammer games I've played I feel like this is one of the best introductions to the world.
It reminds me of ""Incredible Adventures of Van Hellsing"" a lower quality (B tier voice acting, lacking animations and a generic story) corny game that still has charm and worthy gameplay.
And for those who've played Path of Exile, the game basically consists of mapping over and over (Doing small quick quests back to back) with story in them or in between, not as linear as the Act running of PoE.

There are 4 distinct classes based on their unique equipment with some overlap:
Crusaders have firepower, and access to even more firepower on top. Heavy Guns as a class specific with grenades, missiles and turrets.
Assassins have all kinds of blades and high-power rifles to choose from, nimble playstyle and trickery.
Psykers have access to unique magical type attacks and categories with cross-class pistol options.
DLC Tech-Priests ride on roombas and chant in binary, your usual stuff.

In other ARPG's I don't always miss much when playing different classes, sure a Barbarian might spin and a Crusader might slam, but here all classes feel very distinct and multi dimensional when using their uniques.

The game is jank, but has a great deal of lore and enemies to read to get introduced to the Warhammer 40k universe. Not something I would add to the pile of the better ARPG games, but it is fun and unique in enough aspects to make it worthwhile.

And if you get the game I have to say here that all subclasses are practically the same but they have one unique perk not disclosed in the character creator and I highly suggest playing Tactical Crusader, Sniper Assassin or Aetherwalker Psyker.
You won't be locked out of any playstyles, but those are the respective subclasses that start with a good damage dealing passive the other subclasses can't get (Tactical/Sniper for example get a 100% damage boost in ranged damage while on the move), everything else is unlockable later.
Alternatively the Assault Crusader gets a melee damage passive if you fancy poking the heretics with sticks of varying sizes.
Also Heavy Gunner can be used for a stationary damage build, making the game even jankier than it is, but if you want to turtle then go for it.",1608856613,1608865378,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

I've just reached level 70 with my heavy gunner crusader and finished all campaign after more than 100 playing hours including the prophecy dlc (for the other 60 hours). Have tried a couple times of Void Crusades, which is pretty fun I'll say. 

IMAO, Inquisitor-martyr/prophecy is the best arpg of all time for casual gamer like me. I don't need hundreds of hours or complex build guides to know how to develop my character. Rather, I can try every thing I want to build my character and jump into the action parts of the game immediately. And, the action part of the game is why Inquisitor-Martyr stand out from other arpgs.

#Experience from Level 70 heavy gunner crusader, geared with few relics. 
I really enjoy the tactical gameplay in Inquisitor-Marytr. You can't just killing a bunch of mobs with big damages brainlessly as what we usually do in other D3 like games. In my most games with Impossible difficulty, I must utilize the map layout to beat the enemies. Using the cover to dodge the crazy range damage from enemies and making some decent damage at the same time behind the cover feels like I'm in the epic action movie. Sometimes I have to lure the mobs into narrow corridor to make the AOE more efficient. Sometimes I retreat to open ground to deal with heavy gunner enemy or melee enemy. Swapping weapons to deal with different challenges is also important. In a reasonable difficult mission, you'll do most of the actions mentioned above. 

There are three keys to make all these actions work well in the game. First, the map is small and tight. It's easy to find cover/ narrow spot/ open ground. Second, the pace of mobs is relative slow comparing to other arpg. It allows us to set some strategies before engaging with them. Also, all the actions above will be meaningless if the mobs just run at you within seconds. Finally, you can shoot ""behind"" the cover! It's a clever system that captures the essence of warhammer 40k games. 

We are not the crazy warrior jumping into the mobs in the open ground, or the rogues using all kinds of moving/teleporting skills to play around the enemies. Instead, we are inquisitors, who take the advantages of the environment to beat the strongest enemies.

You can still play the game in a traditional way with super gears or certain types of build. It's still a decent game.  

My only complain is that the Purity ""was"" wayyy better than Radical """"before the Warp Surge season"""". It' ""was"" painful to make decisions between Radical and Purity because of the awful balance. Thankfully, they have buffed the Radical in this season.

[b]Pros[/b]
• Solid Visuals, you feel like your in the Warhammer 40k universe
• Estiblished Lore from the Warhammer 40k universe to draw from.
• 3 Base Game Classes with expansive Skill trees + 1 From Prophecy
• Season ""passes"" - Means the game is constantly being updated.
• Devs are actually working on the game
• The Tech Priest added in Prophecy makes the game signficantly better because his personality doesn't feel like a sack of bricks
• Feels like a Warhammer Quest Board Game.

[b]Cons[/b]
• 40k Lore can be... special.
• Only playing as the Imperium of Man.
• 3 Options for Characters that are also gendered locked --4 with Prophecy
• Difficulty is all over the place. You're either bored out of your mind or wondering what the hell killed you.
• Visual look great, but effects tend to get blended in and adds to the ""What the F*** Just Killed Me?!""
• Responses from keybindings can be... awkward.
• Nothing is explained all that well, and if it is explained well it is hidden behind walls of text in menus that aren't very intuitive to navigate.
• The game engine is not really optimized all that well, and you can get random crashes and extremely long load screens. I did not play on SSD, didn't have one at time of purchase, so I cannot say if this helps at all.
• The Story can be extremely dry, and it doesn't help that everyone is a yes man or a battle hungry berserker that will do anything for the God Emperor.
• Armor Designs can be extremely hit or miss, this isn't a fault on the Art Team, and more an issue with what they had to work with.
• Environments can be extremely repeative.
• Can feel like the Warhammer Quest Board Games after a while.

I can tell devs work hard to make this game work, the polish is the right areas, but the areas that aren't polished really standout. I haven't played with a controller as of writing this review so I cannot comment there.

There are elements in the game that made me wish this was a Rogue Trader game which would've given them far more flexibility with characters, banter, and story telling. Having a few Xenos options would've been great as well. (AdMech does not count as Xenos sadly).

... and the game is exactly what you think it to be, an action adventure Diablo-clone set in the Warhammer 40k world - something I've been looking forward to for a while. It's not great, but it's good enough.

[b]Let's break it down[/b]

[hr]
[b]Gameplay wise[/b]
Mission structure is linear compared to Diablo's/Path of Exile's quasi open world structure, but this turns levels into smaller bite sized runs. Combat (melee) is a little stiff so the shorter runs probably work in its favour.

Inventory management is another thing changed up, you get 3 full sized inventories on your character emphasising focus on constant combat instead of inventory Tetris between each battle to make space for more. The idea is you don't stop, just pick up everything along the way and sort things out in bulk when you get back to your ship post mission. It works surprisingly well.

In terms of plot and mission design, it's pretty well done given the subject matter. The main campaign goes places and builds on world events and it's actually quite interesting. 
The standalone expansion ""Prophecy"" even completes the main storyline which is great.

Besides the main campaign you get plenty of random missions to do such as to eliminate everything, kill 3 specific enemies, destroy 3 structures etc. 
There are morality choices within the game, do you kill someone (points into Puritan) or spare someone (points into Radical) - you read that right, go figure. The game favours role-playing in order to max out either path, applying your own style of choose your own adventure to those decisions net you right in the centre 'grey area' with no actual skill tree benefits for being there.

I also don't mind the 'investigation' style narration and monologuing, this adds lore, context to what you're doing plus keeps it relevant to the inquisitors’ line of work.
There's also plenty there for those that enjoy working on builds, there's a ton on offer to min/max.

All in all, it feels like there's so much there to make this game shine out among all the other diablo clones, yet how it's executed is not quite there.

[hr]
[b]Audio[/b]
Audio wise it's decent as well, some background tracks are memorable, others are not, and obliterating a khorne bloodletter with a critical hit yields just as much of a bloody explosion as you'd expect it to along with all the ""sploshing"" sound to accompany it.
Treading on Nurgles infectious tendrils throughout levels gives off the unnerving sound of running barefoot through mud, so it's on point.

I do believe the game went through a major overhaul - combat and audio wise a while back, for what it is right now it's solid.

[hr]
[b]Graphics[/b]
Visually it looks great, plenty of things to destroy in the environment (pillars, bookshelves etc.) but it makes you wonder about the need given how high the camera is and this is at the expense of performance and file size (~75GB).

[hr]
[b]DLC[/b]
There's a ton on offer, there's probably 3 actually worth getting, the rest are standalone missions and cosmetics but if you're a fan then there's plenty there for you.

[hr]
[b]The gripes[/b]
[list]
[*]Only one type of fatality for all enemies in the game - you swish your weapon, enemy explodes into giblets, that's it. Bosses have their own but these lack any oomph factor - you climb a chaos dreadnaught (which feels unnecessarily long) and then pop the head off, it's as underwhelming as it reads.
[*]Multiplayer is a tad borked - you can't play everything in coop (Void Crusades I'm looking at you), and what you can (Assignments) benefit the party leader. It would be nice to vote on choices or at least make everyone feel like they're in it together. Player scaling isn't ideal either, your low level friends will die from one hit if you plan to run them through things.
[*]It gets very grindy past level 50 - that's both a good and bad thing.

It obviously has a cool setting and seems to follow the Warhammer lore pretty well (from my limited understanding).

The map generation isn't particularly interesting and doesn't help here. Different planets etc can have different factions but honestly they all are fought in the same way, so they don't really make any differences.

There are a few really cool missions where you work with imperial guard or where you control a bandblade/knight.

It mainly consists of grinding the same missions over and over to collect enough credits to upgrade your weapon for +2 extra damage. Basically all enemy types feel the same in attack and behavior patterns, whether they are Eldar or Tyranids or something else. Other ARPGs like Grim Dawn and even the years old Torchlight II do this a whole lot better with different enemies that require different engagement tactics. The cover system looks interesting at first, but is useless and not required at all in the end. The crafting mechanisms are good however, but without good ARPG mechanics they could've just as well be for a clicker game.

I've been fan of Arpg's since leaped into Diablo 2 about half a year after it's release. Didn't play it like masses of D2 hack'n slashers, but spent enough time to get the feels of it & that was over forty hours. Not mentioning D3 cause that was huge mess up disappointment on my taste buds. [b] Bought W40k: Martyr for thirty five eur via steam store. Introd. to Martyr: [/b] [u] It's also available as good old Table Top Game. Plot is intriguing  as a mysterious ship called the Martyr has reappeared after being missing for 5k years & transmits a distress signal. Nearly every mission begins with a fully well voiced intro. [/u]

[u] Storytelling is rarely the high point for Arpg, but the devs at Neocore went further & higher on this area & that's a good thing with this beauty [/u] <3 There are great cutscenes throughout the campaign & multiple characters the Inquisitor talks with over the course of play. So far after almost ten hours of relaxed adv. i've met some & enjoyed spot on dry humor in the banter that's bueno. As many know that gameplay & plunders are what most players think of first when comes to dungeon crawlers. [i] Yes it's good & bad thing. Martyr shines on that & on storytelling like mentioned above <3 [/i]
[h1] Something about Combat [/h1]
Players of any class can have two separate loadouts at a time & these can be swapped easily w one click. Each weapon whether ranged or melee has two to four attacks that give various effects in addition to damage. Armor piercing, aoe damage, damage over time (dot) & so on.  Encounters also include a wide variety of enemy & attack types & behaviors. Player should have have situat. awareness & active combat management. This is more of tactical Arpg & thus feels slower than say Diablo 3 or Path of Exile & i see this as good thing. [b] I love that you can utilize cam angle & it actually becomes a necessary part of advs. unlike in many Arpgs. [b] Grim Dawn (which is my 2nd fav. Arpg) has similar & D3 didn't.
[h1] +Pros [/h1]
Artwork, Visuals & Sountrack (Stunned by background artwork)
Spot on customization, gameplay, character builds (Oh yes) & mission selection.
Gear-based skills allows you to do combat the way you want.
Solid Voice Over done for couple classes & random characters that met so far
Based on W40k Univ.
[h1] -Cons [/h1]
Semi complicated stats system. There's tons of them.
Bootmapping in menus could need some improvement  
[h1] Summary [/h1]
While Martyr may have been rough at launch, the fine Devs @Neocore clearly worked hard to improve the experience through past year & half or so. [u] Ofc no one should not completely ignore negat. reviews, but should pay attention to the Fact that most of those Uberly Bashing writings are based on Beta days. [/u] [b] Thus they have nothing to do with the actual release client. Those are like Night & Day [/b] :) Since early this year this W40k DG crawler is fantastic <3 Currently at final month of year 6020 (2020 as too many call it) this beauty [b] isn't big mess like many wrote since 2y ago. [/b] 

 [u] 2.0 did massive overhaul & changed W40K: Inquisitor Martyr to shiny path that deserves support.

Not sure how the game was before 2.0 update, as of now it's a pretty fresh and fun take on the Diablo formula. There is a pretty competent end game content and most importantly of all...you get to do the Emperors work while playing this game.

Its a mix between van helsing and dawn of war 2, except maps are not connected to each other. they tried to connect the campaign adventure with story through dialogs, audiologs and notes. there is no visual adventure here like in traditional arpg-s. it feels like playing a rogue-lite a bit with the randomly generated maps and modifiers.

its like constantly playing a poor end-game content, but the game never started to begin with. A grindfest from start to finish.

+
good combat and character customization.
active abilities are tied to items (weapon, shield, belt and chest armor) instead of skill tree. potions are customizable too and tied to item (inoculator) as well, acting a bit like an active ability.
warhammer 40k.
""realism"", physics and gore.



-
Some weapon setup has no synergy at all and is way too weak to play. Melee+range dual wield is poorly done.
Weak level design, especially in outer areas, and 3D hills are terrible to look at and walk on.
Barely any content for MP. I thougt this game is MP focused. The best content is SP only.
terrible matchmaking and no way to create or join games, you just wait for queue.
The vehicle missions in campaign sux.
There is no unit collision, which makes the combat less engaging.
Story telling is worse than van helsing.
Overpriced product.
Instanced level design, it has no connection, no sense of adventure between them. Teleporting to missions from a spaceship-hub all the time.
Implementing cover system was a mistake and the destructible environment ismt exciting or add anything to the game.
Some of the progression/grind design is similar to F2P and console games.(well actually this is mainly a console game)
weak/average sound.
Neocore is ""forcing"" to buy the expansion. cliffhanger story and expansion items also occur in base game...but u cant play the new class in base game lol.
Cant replay the campaign
Weak or no death penalty.
Somewhat unresponsive cursor/targeting system.
The game should have used fixed camera and level design created for that in mind. now the game is  a mess. If u want to throw a grenade u dont know where the invis walls are, and gets blocked as walls and ojects fade away from specific distance.
Tooltips are not allways dependable.
Some blatant bugs and balance issues. (lot of them fixed in 2020 april patch)
Laggy multiplayer


would like to see:

friendly fire mode
bring back gear lock for missions, it does fit to the game
real co-op content
1 hand melee + pistol combo being viable, having some better new skill when both equipped

""The first Action-RPG set in the grim future of the 41st Millennium""
true

 ""with a persistent universe with a huge variety of missions, tactical, brutal combat encounters in destructible environments""
somewhat true

 ""takes the genre to its next level: an open-world sandbox game and a storyline influenced by the community of players""
marketing lies


5.5/10


2020.
if you are fan of WH40k and arpg in general, give it a try on a sale.

-Still no real co-op content. For example void crusades would be nice to start with.. Intel missions, Unholy cathedral etc...would be nice too.
-Melee+range dual wield is poorly done. I would like to use chainsword with bolt pistol for example, but is way to weak compare to having a shield. Sword+shield gives better damage, better defense and crowd control. Having some stronger new skill when melee+pistol equipped, could fix this problem. Or a bit lazier idea, just give us the 3. and 4. skill from pistols, same way when are using them in dual mode of same type, but we could use it with melee too.
-Add unit collision to the game. Running through enemies takes away from immersion and from intense gameplay. More strategic thinking will born when we can be blocked.
-Remove the cover system.
-Remove vehicle missions.
-Give an option for friendly fire mode.",1561851443,1607532725,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

If you are looking to experience the Inquisitor tabletop game on PC, this is not for you.  Things like the suppression mechanic make it feel like that's what they wanted to do at some point, but it's certainly not that now.  What you get instead is a grimdark sci-fi take on Diablo; which is enjoyable, even if not what I was hoping for.  Over-all, many of the mechanics feel like they are sort of implemented because that's what was expected of an action RPG, and not because they were actually thought out.  Randomised loot makes it so that you never really get attached to your gear, and you can't really plan a build.  On the whole you don't really FEEL like you're acting as a member of the secret police of an authoritarian theocracy.  You just feel like you're going on a dungeon crawl with guns.  There are also vehicle segments, but as much as they shake things up; they are exceedingly clumsy, and don't really add to the experience.

  The story is actually pretty good, but the delivery somehow doesn't quite land.  Once again, everything is good, but not great.

  I have not tried the game's multiplayer, so I cannot comment.


  Honestly, I DO suggest this game.  If you like Warhammer, 40,000, or are into top-down action RPGs, it's a clumsy take, but it's got some heart.  Much like Mordheim and Battlefleet Gothic before it, I'd have preferred to actually see a faithful adaptation of the tabletop game instead of what I got.

If you're a fan of W40K universe, get this game on a discount (I got mine at 70% off), it's worth at least playing through the campaign a few times with different classes. The aesthetic and atmosphere is pretty on point. The mission is quite long and let you experience the over the top engagement and dialogue that this universe is famous for. You also get to control a super heavy tank like the shadowsword, or an Imperial Knight to dispense the Emperor's righteous wrath upon heretics.

However, as an ARPG game, this game has serious flaws. The scaling is bad. The lack of explanation/information in-game is bad. Loot drop and stat rolls are terrible.

Now I got the full game with expansion and all 20 DLCs for 23Euro just to try it and oh man, it is a blast! I never actually listen to story in ARPGs as I like to get to endgame as soon as possible, but the story was good. WH40k is a great universe and the story interested me for the whole 18 hours. The engine is good and it means good gameplay = meaning the game is fun to play, its fun to kill monsters, its not D3 perfect gameplay, but way better then PoE (I have over 2k hours there), Wolcen, LE. The endgame is plentyful, there are vairous types of missions, activities, campaigns etc. Itemization is also good. Plenty of different builds for each character. An the 4 characters are completely different. 

So to sum it up - the gameplay is very good, story is good, end-game is good, build diversity is good, itemization is good. Will it ever be PoE or D3 big? No. But if you like ARPGs it certainly deserves your money. PS: season 2 is starting soon, thats another free new content.

Whats nice here is that you and your friends can continue fighting the hoards of all sorts, particularly with the expansion to drive the main story further, and THAT is a good story. Beyond that you can kind of make up some stories with your friends to coincide with the random missions and kind of add your own tales in a way as though the random missions will start to run together in story and such, your imagination and the fact they will change up on you in the actual game play can help keep a fresh frame of mind about your missions.

Go in with crusader style and though they SAY you're no Space Marine, it's damn well close to the Space Marine like experience and could practically count yourself given Inquisitor form. Some Astartes past have gone on to become Inquisitors as rare as that may be in lore. Go in with other friends choosing the class, you'll feel the Space Marine feels plenty.

With some interesting builds, the feel of a Heavy Bolter, and things like gravity guns that if you suppress an armored enemy you can use the weight of their own armor against them, locking big big boys in place, there's a smart way to handle most situations and some that seem nearly impossible at times, you'll be able to level up and find new ways as well of dealing with it no matter your class.

Due to PC issues I haven't played as much of my PC games and went on to play them on console, but the PC version of this, like many things born to the PC ideal first, as rare as those are becoming with big tittles, this one gets updating and smoother runs on said PC platform, and events are often still held along with other updates. The fact that the expansion is looked at as a separate game erks me a bit, but it's existence either way, and the fact it runs together with the main game as an expansion should, and that is what it is no matter how they sell it, means this game is with reason to still stay fresh for now to keep players going. 

Like any 40K game, its never perfect, but I found myself playing this quite a lot on my ventures when my PC was being worked on, and ruined by the builder, DIGITAL STORM, who you should never get to build your PC, like ever. Like DEATHWING, SPACE MARINE, and some others, where it's not perfect 40K fans that crave an active experience out of the RTS and other strat games that started making it more popular again those many years ago, this is another fun journey.

Sure there are bugs, some of them are funny and can be explained as warpcraft or other heresy with your friends, some of the more snooty types saying there's so much better out there in balancing and yatta yatta will leave. But that's just about any game anymore and I found the over all package is worth the buck, especially on sale where this game constantly finds it's self. Again as most games do these days.

See it on sale? Don't mind a top down game? Maybe even if top down isn't as much your thing and click to move is a lil outside of your usuals, give it a try anyhow. Moving to cover as a gunner, especially with things like a heavy bolter, can be a fun experience. And for those of you who like to chainsaw your way through things with a chainsword, or hit things with a really big one, or a really big hammer, where every weapon has at least two if not four moves, you might want to put your griefs aside and give it a go.

If you're a 40K fan looking to serve the Emperor and want a long building journey to come back too with others, you probably really should go ahead and pick this up if for some strange reason you haven't already.",1606828088,1606828088,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

527430,81159628,76561198014698469,166,8,6167,0,4380,1656003076,"warhammer 40k's setting is very unique. if you like arpgs, this game is currently the best that you can get. 

coming from poe/grimdawn/d3, warhammer is quite simple. the skill tree gives some choices to players, as of time of writing, it is still basic but basic can be good. 

power creep is not too crazy in the game. its good if you want to just chill and keep grinding. its a fun casual grinder. 

WARNING!!
1. this is not a pure isometric arpg, it does not have an optimized isometric view that other arpgs such as d3 has, instead you need to rotate the camera manually to better position your view. this can get very jarring and i personally hate this.  
2. the end game is feels repetitive fast. there are a variety of missions but ultimately some missions are draggy compared to others. 

PROS:
1. jump in and play, the game is simple enough that you dont need a 200IQ buildguide to play. 
2. NO SET ITEMS, some people want set items, but for me having no set items is a plus
3. CRAFTING is feasible. you can craft perfect items similar to how POE does, but without highly restrictive/rare currency drops. Very SSF friendly.
4. Shared passive tree, more or less shares the same tree between classes but some classes gain access to specialized trees. in a sense, this gives the player some choice in variety
5. Powercreep not so prevailent, players are not doing millions dps afaik.
6. switching skills/gear is not too difficult

CONS:
1. most of the passive nodes in the game feel like they make no impact. leveling up and assigning a passive and only getting a 1% damage boost feels meh. on the flipside the powercreep in the game is not too bad.
2. as mentioned in the warning, the camera rotation can get very jarring
3. the games simplicity can be too simple for some people's liking. 
4. skills are tied to skillsets. for example using a 2handed physical weapon will grant a 4 skill set, these skills will always be the same for any weapon of the same type. using a different 2handed weapon type will grant a different set of 4 skills, unique to this weapon type.  players dont get to mix and match, but imho it's a small issue.

There are some other stuff i  can nit pick but tbh, if you find it fun, just play it. steam has a 2hour window for refund anyway.

Try it for an hour, if you like it get it.

as for the 1001 dlcs available to the game, theyre mostly ""non compulsory"". unlike many newer games, you can BUY these dlc using INGAME CURRENCY that is FARMABLE. 

i actually opted to buy up the dlc during a steam sale to ""give the devs some support"" rather than just grinding it out.

i would put  the game somewhere in between POE and D2 (Poe coz of its crafting flexibility, D2 or perhaps 3 due to its simplicity).  

Try it and if you like it keep it! i liked it!",1606705768,1606705768,True,10,0,0.643728852272033691,0,True,False,False

Each class has completely different gear and play styles. You go the Heavy Gunner guy, and you can easily faceroll anyone bar the bosses. But if you pick the sniper, you will be taking cover and being more opportunistic with how you approach combat. I will also add that this is a slower-paced game than Diablo or PoE when it comes to combat. 

The levelling system is very perk-based, why the skills you have are determined by the gear you have on, so it's not just about the best stats, but also about the ability each weapon type has One of the classes, a Magey type that uses Warp Makics, does allow you to chose your ability if you have the right gear picked. He's also one of the more interesting classes to play with, as he has a bit of a risk-reward system going on.

The one thing that is kind of annoying is that if you have the expansion, and you play the base game via opening it, then you end up no gaining any achievements, so it is worth keeping that in mind if you are an achievement hunter.

1) Update the camera, the controls are awful on PC with KB&M
I hate always having to move the camera around, just have an auto follow option please, I don't understand why there isn't like all other ARPGs, I get you're doing tactical to be unique but add an option for people who don't like it

2) Refresh the skill tree - it needs an update
Skills points don't feel impactful

3) Re-do the ""good and bad"" concept
It's not currently  implemented well, I've finished that game and it's not full? I think you can farm it somewhere but that's just confusing

4) Show me what stats are options for when I re-roll values on item
e.g. like in Diablo 3 when you re-roll stats on items. In this game I don't know what I'm going to get when I change values seems odd that I have to look it up outside the game if I want to know

5) Tweak performance I have a high end PC and it sounds like a jumbo jet when I play (even on lower settings)

6) Clean up the animations
I made a 'whirlwind' build which was loads of fun but the animations were super clunky and choppy

The game could be really good, has a nice loop with the smaller mission size and lower tactical pace I really like that. You can just jump in, do a mission and keep doing them if you want. Nice loop. They've also been updating it slowly with seasons etc as well which is good.

I've been playing this game for 30 hours and reached level 45 with my character, a Ranged Crusader - half of the leveling progression, since max level is 100. At that point most games with looting mechanics begin to shower you with high tier items and you begin to see future high-level synergies and find more and more new ways to experience the game. Not in Martyr. And that's exactly why I decided to leave that review. I won't be dropping the game and if it suddenly makes a 180 turn I'll change what I wrote here. EDIT: I will be dropping the game because of the re-roll system and lack of clarity on RNG elements. The game is rigged against the player and I won't bother with wasting any of my time on it, as it will take too long to get anywhere near the amount satisfaction that other ARPGs bring compared to this game. Lacking itemization is made even worse by vile RNG.

[b]Positivity first[/b][list]
[*]Its a Warhammer game with a Warhammer feel and a Warhammer story. I'm not huge on WH knowledge, but the game doesn't feel like it betrays the universe.
[*]Visuals are great. Skulls and corpses everywhere, as well as daemons, Nurgles flora and huge golden cuboid guns. Game certainly looks Warhammer.
[*]Audio is also rather satisfying and fitting. Especially weapon sounds.[/list]

[b]The rest of the game is aggressively OKAY[/b]

[b]Its as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle[/b]
If you've played Martyr for 2 hours you know what next 20 hours will be.[list]
[*]As nice as the visual and audio elements of the game are, the gameplay side of the world design is mediocre. You either have corridors or vast open areas with visible and invisible walls both outside and in-between. I don't say that as a zealous open-world fanatic - I have no problems with running short-duration missions in confined areas if said areas are well-crafted. But Martyr has neither. There's no verticality and even cramped corridors manage to feel empty. Destructible cover is extremely under-utilized, so are the ambushes and enemy placement. Exploration doesn't feel rewarding, there are empty areas that serve no purpose everywhere. Most maps have next to 0 interactivity. Developers seem to have all the tools neccessary to make the world feel alive but didn't do it for some reason. You end up running through same maps with same encounters and it gets old real fast.
[*]Most variety when it comes to itemization and gameplay that I've seen so far comes from the quantity of weapon and equipment types. You have shotguns and rifles, swords and axes, crowd control auras and grenades, to list a few. Problem is - they all have limited functionality. I've been using shotguns and heavy bolters for my playthrough and haven't found even 1 that had a different mag size. You'd think developers would use core random stats, such as spread, reload speed, range and mag size to diversify the gunplay(because over half of the weapon you'll find are GUNS), but instead Items receive miniscule 1-15% modifiers of various stats, such as damage/defense/crit/proc chance/etc depending on the rarity. That should spice up the gameplay, but they feel so unimportant that in the end every weapon in its category behaves the same way. Some items also receive DOWNSIDES as you level up - longer cooldowns, lower charge recovery. The only relatively interesting items are super rare relics that, if you're lucky might have 1 insane stat. Compare that to other ARPGs that have several per-class sets of equipment with active and passive abilities that drastically change the way you play and Martyr doesn't look as appealing.
[*]Character progression doesn't help the situation as most of your power will come from passive effects such as 1,5% more damage or 1% more crit chance. You don't get new moves, just get to have 1% better functionality of your starting kit per level. After you spend 3-4 points on tiny % increases you get to pick a comparatively powerful passive, like health regen on critical attack. I tried creating another character with a different class to see if perhaps my ""dumb meat crusader"" is the problem, but Assassin has same weapon skills and same passive trees.[/list]

[b]IN THE GRIM DARK FUTURE, THERE IS ONLY ONLINE[/b][list]
[*]The game is always online. There is a passive-aggressive post from a developer that you can find at the games Steam community page that tries to explain the reasons for it. Your characters are stored on servers, so if the servers are under maintenance you can go ahead and play some other game HEH.
[*]Martyr feels like an MMO and it will really take you out of the grim-dark mood. Its hard to enjoy the universe because every time you finish a difficult mission you get to open a lootbox and a UI pop-up reminds you of daily and weekly challenges, as well as timed missions lmao. What's funny is that developers worked pretty hard to create all the immersive ways to access functionality of your home-hub, such as mission select screen, profile customization and so on, yet you get this dumb DAILY CHALLENGE thrown at you at the same time.[/list]

[b]The grind for the sake of grind[/b][list]
[*]Grind in ARPGs is the part of the gameplay loop and it'd be stupid to say that you should get all the best goodies with best modifiers from the very first attempt. However, in martyr you don't grind for the sake of getting new gear, you grind for basic functionality, such as weapon augmentation, item quality re-rolls and mission modifiers. There are so many currencies and lootbox(exactly what they're called in the game btw) types that I seriously feel like at level 80 game will award me with access to WARHAMMER POINTS e-shop. It reminds me of Korean MMOs where you have to buy CONDOMS for your weapon so that they dont BREAK when you upgrade them - and that's not a good thing. I wouldn't mind if I at least got some ""SICK KUH-RAZEE"" stuff out of that, but as mentioned before, grinding just to get a 5% increase for a stat you don't care about doesn't give me any joy.
[*]Item ""re-rolls"" are rather costly and are not completely random in the worst way possible. Every item has its own limited set of bonuses that replace one another. Meaning, that you can get an item that will be useless for your character no matter how many times you roll it, because ALL of its possible stats are useless for you.[/list]

[b]Sponges, sponges everywhere![/b][list]
[*]Most of the missions allow you to select difficulty levels. On normal difficulty the game is rather easy, not even boss-type enemies pose any threat. But naturally, with all the modifiers, RNG and grind you pretty much have to play on higher difficulties. Game forces that idea down your throat early on, because even your items will tell you to ""complete 5 missions 4 levels higher than yours without suffering melee damage"" to unlock their functionality. Once again, its fine by itself, but the way developers tackle the difficulty is your usual enemy sponging - you just have to shoot longer while being more careful about dodging attacks. You can also get stat modifiers for enemies. Basically, don't expect something ground-breaking like improved AI or even different enemy placement when it comes to difficulty.[/list]

""Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr"" is an alright ARPG, being set in the Warhammer universe gives it an advantage, but aside from that its nothing new or special. It has potential but it doesn't seem like developers are interested in using it and would rather make another Diablo clone.",1605783628,1605826373,True,11,0,0.642757236957550049,0,True,False,False

There's a ton of loot to collect and experiment with, lots of story and side-missions spread over a pretty huge star map, and an awesome visual style befitting the Warhammer 40K universe.

Do not buy it for the story though. While it is pretty faithful to the W40K setting, it takes some serious liberties with what happens combat-wise (a lone Inquisitor taking on a squadron of Chaos Marines is a bit of a stretch, and that Inquisitor also surviving/winning is an even bigger leap).

Still, if you're a Warhammer 40K fan it's worth checking out, even if it is only to admire the amazing and grotesque visual style of some of the environments.

The game isn't bad because it's too slow. It's just not very good because it's not very well made.

Now it's not remarkably bad, but it simply has a whole boatload of small flaws, bugs and baffling design choices. There's invisible walls, cover system is unreliable, sometimes shots go through terrain, sometimes they hit stuff they shouldn't. A lot of things that you'd expect to have a sound, don't have sounds. And I think at least indoor levels have no ambience whatsoever.

Ranged is infinitely better than melee. With ranged, you barely take damage with no downsides in damage or anything. If you go melee, you're a chump. You take much more unavoidable damage and getting kills is just way more bothersome than with ranged.

From the first moment you pick up a weapon, that's all the tangible progress you'll ever see. You will not be getting any new skills or game changing passives. You have Shoot 1, Shoot 2, Shoot 3 and Shoot 4. They're about the same, mostly. And you have passives in form of passives and perks. What you get get is maybe like +1 damage to DoTs, that sort of thing.

Levels are completely uninspired. There's two types: wasteland and wreck. Wreck has 4 room shapes and 90 degree angle corridors. That is it.

All in all, the game manages to sabotage itself pretty effectively. Whatever could be properly fun or good in the game is brought down to jankiness by unfun design choices, like discouraging weapon switching by introducing cooldown on switch. The game is riddled with this sort of little issues.

Playing with a controller makes the game feel better, but if you want to use menus with mouse, tough luck. It's controller only, or mouse only.

In terms of story or 40k atmosphere, meh, I guess it's okay-ish. The whole thing feels like there's nothing at stake, though. Everyone is pretty laissez-faire about everything, talking about Nurgle like he's your least favorite neighbor Steve, people casually name drop Grey Knights like it's stuff everyone knows about. No one has much of a reaction to anything, so nothing feels impactful. It is superficially 40k but I can't really point out to any design choices or gameplay or story moments that would *feel* like 40k.

Which is a shame, since without 40k holding this game up, there would be no reason for anyone to play it.

If you're looking for an ARPG, this is likely not it. It doesn't play like an action game. It plays like a janky strategy game, without strategy elements.

If you're really into 40k and don't mind spending time and money on a subpar game, Inquisitor is okay.",1605639673,1605723953,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have done a few tarot missions along the way and some assignments, and i have reached about lvl 60 out of 100 with this. Now up to this point, it was totally worth it. The game has some issues yes, the combat does feel a little clunky at times and the level design also isn't really what you would call diverse. 

Now beyond the grand investigations (main story lines) it gets pretty grindy. I don't actually know yet what comes in the endgame and i just don't know if it's worth grinding for it. You basically grind out the remaining content, tarot missions, void crusades, assignments... but all those pretty much feel the same. Obviously Arpgs are always just grind grind grind, but since the leveling takes so incredibly long, i just fail to see how it's worth grinding til 100. 

Now why do i recommend the game? Well i love Warhammer 40k and the storylines feel pretty good. I enjoyed it a lot and i'm probably playing again with a different class. So far i've spent 48 hours in the game, and since i got the complete edition for 23€, it is very good value to me. Would i recommend getting the complete edition at full price? Probably not. The leveling just drags on way too much for that and the content feels too monotonous. 

I have no clue if i ever reach max level in this game, maybe endcontent is amazing if there is any worth mentioning. I just don't think i'm willing to put up with the grind. But i might do it and update this review.

No matter which tier, color, material, etc that I choose, it all remains the base appearance. So customization does not work, at all, for me.

Another thing thats bugging the heck out of me, its the graphics. It looks great when standing still. But as soon as you move the character, the environments, and models get all fuzzy, and pixelated. It looks like a really bad Film Grain effect, and its really destroying the looks of the game. Im well above recommended specs, and have tried all combinations of settings combinations. Nothing seems to change this problem.

Aside form the initial reviews, my main gripe is that its an online game, and requires another account. I have too many accounts to remember as it is, and I despise 'Games as a Service'. So, I bought it at 75% off, knowing it will be removed at some point in the future.

Some of the timed missions can be a little too difficult, and Ive had to drop the difficulty on them all to complete. The Tech Priest one was brutal. I had to drop difficulty, and switch from a pure melee build, to a flame thrower, just to complete it! Theres another side mission, where 3 bosses must be killed, before they break through to a governors mansion. Same deal, but without switching builds

BUGS
Whenever I enter a mounted weapon (Which are completely useless) there is this odd graphical glitch, that leaves a line, connecting my character, to the mounted gun, for the rest of the mission. No matter how far I run. If I enter another gun, it simply changes the line to the new one.

Customization is finniky, and can stop working entirely. Remaining unchanged until the game is restarted. Im not sure what causes it, but it happens.

Enemy AI can bug out quite often. Especially the oversized bosses. They get backed into some sort of obstacle, and stop functioning at all. Sometimes they can walk themselves out, if you stop attacking, and back away, but not always.

As mentioned earlier, I believe the graphics are buggy as well, with minor texture flickers. The lag in large battles can cause a severe spike, and its quite regular, no matter the settings.

The Tech Priests garments will change appearances, when you log out, and back in.. Or even after a loading screen. I wore the same outfit, for several levels.. But it was a different model, and different color, almost everytime I loaded a new mission",1604094059,1604786824,True,0,0,0.440311312675476074,0,True,False,False

Decent campaign, but it really doesn't have an endgame that is worth your time. Grim Dawn has super bosses so the gear grind makes sense in that game, however, there is no point to the endgame as there is nothing at endgame you haven't beat boss wise earlier in the campaign. The endgame gear is there if you want it, but you really are just grinding gear to grind gear and do nothing with it. Also, the game doesn't show you what the soft/hard caps are for stats, there is no unique relic enchantment list ingame either. No offense to the dev, but there really isn't a community updating those lists outside the game, so put them in the game so we know what to aim for. Always hate having to reference guides outside of a game about stats and other things that should be listed in the fucking game. 

Get on sale like I did, play coop with a friend through the campaign or solo it, get all the achievements, grind 5 more levels and realize it has nothing to offer you long-term 5/10.

Ramping up the difficulty not only gives the enemy a large damage boost it also can reduce your DPS by 90%+, which just makes the game tedious. The loot system is painful - lots of perks but many are clearly inferior while RNG makes getting the ""good"" ones near impossible, any changes are random which means frequently you will spend hours farming to upgrade and get stuck with inferior perks, and of course after spending millions and all sorts of special crafting materials, the item will sell for a few K if you find a better one.

The gameplay is solid, but the scenarios and skirmishes you engage in are just too short. You can rapidly complete missions with various modifiers and difficulties, but by the end, you've spent more time on a loading screen than the actual mission.

Campaign: Great atmosphere, great set design, everything else is acceptably average.  

Random Missions: Your typical grind, not much variety - but if you want to crank things up to the maximum difficulty, you'll need to some homework minmaxing your gear. Doing 95% _LESS_ damage to all enemies is no joke.

Loot: You have about a dozen item slots, each item can have up to 5 modifiers, and there are about half a dozen different items you can put in each slot.  The loot cycle includes crafting, legendary items, rerolling weapon stats, etc.  The usual tried and true formula.

Classes:  Each class feels VERY different.  Don't decide whether or not you enjoy the game until you've played each class at least long enough to unlock their power customization.  I personally hated the Tech Priest until I found out that I can replace all of the mobile summons with turrets.  I still prefer the Psyker, who has the greatest variety of powers and an entertaining punishment for overusing his abilities.

Each class can be played at least 3 different ways.  You can focus on special class abilities, melee weapons, ranged weapons, or any combination of the above.  Many weapons and abilities have interactions with eachother, so there's a decent variety of options.

Bugs: There are a few entertaining situations where you can kill tutorial bosses before their cutscene, resulting in a conversation with empty air.  Pathfinding and target acquisition of allies is slightly inconsistent.  Nothing gamebreaking.",1604252525,1604252525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am absolutely in love with it. Yes it is repetitive and grindy, no doubt about that-- but if you do your research and somehow still expect Inquisitor Martyr to be tactics-heavy and ever-changing in every aspect of gameplay breeze of a video game with little to no min-maxing, then I don't know what to say. 
With so many thing to do, all in the style of a top-down shooter-- plenty of mechanics, quests, items and goals to strive towards-- Martyr is perfect for fans of WH40k who want to sit back, relax, feel like a total badass while having goals-upon-goals to accomplish.

As a 40k fan, I am glad this game exists. 
Digging through WH40K games near endlessly throughout the years- trying to find something which will scratch the same itch that Dawn of War 1 infected me with since playing it back in high school-- I found this on a sale.

As someone who hasn't played an ARPG before I have to say, this game is heavily underappreciated in my honest opinion. From lore-authentic arsenals of weaponry to nailing the grimdark atmosphere of the 41st Millennium, this game surprised me in nearly every aspect.
There are downsides of course-- crashes, soft-locking on some objectives and FPS drops to mention a few-- but from what Inquisitor Martyr offers, you can quite literally feel the passion that has been poured into this game. Playing, you will see that the game was made by a development team of ordinary (yet extremely talented) dudes passionate about the hobby and it’s universe-- not a lobby of corporate suits wanting to milk the fandom.

The customisation is extensive-- there are hundreds build options. Gunplay is near flawless. Setting is on point. Enemies are endless. Story is believable. Graphics are great. Soundtrack complements the entire product.

Overall, Martyr is an enjoyable and authentic experience with some downsides-- just slap Reshade on it and you’ll get borderline-AAA quality lighting adding even more of an edge to the whole ordeal. Sadly, there are no ways of mitigating bugs and you will need to hard-restart the game from time to time.

I’m glad that finally a good WH40K game came out from the pits of mediocre trash coming out for the past near decade. And thus, I am giving Inquisitor Martyr a positive review.
Also, I *heavily* recommend using a controller for this one, the comfort is just a cherry on top.

Be ready to fight for many hours in what essentially are brown, industrial corridors. Game has a lot of W40k jargon, most of it is meaningless and it is here for a sake of being here. Upgrade system is also lazily done, uninspired. I hope you enjoy getting that extra 1% per skill point or some highly situational 10% increase, because this is mostly what you get. Classes also are rather lackluster. Game balances around gear. What it means in practical terms is that you find legendary weapons and armor and you are stuck for dozens of hours using same thing over and over again. Story kicks up strong, but later becomes rather convoluted and silly with irrational betrayals and a lot of lore rape. They speak about quite mundane thing in W40k, pariahs and make them to be these super duber Primarch level Gods. However in reality story does nothing with them and only shows how they behave like psykers. That is such uninspired and cynical take on a story. Sadly entire game feels like that. It is just bunch of stuff slapped together for a sake of it being there.

I do not recommend this game. It feels like most generic ARPG with Warhammer skin slapped on it. If that is enough for you then play it, otherwise there isn't much value from this product.

This is not a game in quality of Diablo 2, Titan Quest, Grim Dawn or Torchlight. Quests are very repetitive and very grinding after few hours.

If you are burning with the devotion of God Emperor in your hearth to purging the unclean, burning the heretic and killing the xenos, then this game is for you. Otherwise, think twice.

Sound effects are somewhat satisfying. Bolter, Heavy Bolter and Chainsword sounds are especially satisfying.

Interior design of stations and ships are gorgeously fitting to 40K! Your eyes will feast.

Enemy variety is many. It's not like different color of same enemy. You fight with Nurgle daemons, rebel guardsmen, ogryns, different types of cultists, turrets, Dark Eldar, Tyranids, Eldar, Black Legion Marines, Plague Marines, Khorne Berzerkers, Alpha Legion Marines, Chaos Spawns, various daemons, Skulltaker.

Weapons and equipments variety are also many. Most of 40K weapons and equipments are in here. But there are only 2 types of armor and shield.

But it is very unrealistic in strength just for one Inquisitor. You can kill a Chaos Space Marine with few hits even you are just the half size of him and not enhanced as him. You can kill a Carnifex just with a lasgun if you shoot enough times. You can kill a Decimator daemon engine just with an eviscerator.

This game captures the feel of Warhammer 40k very well. The classes, the voice acting, the ART, the audio, it's excellent. Well, except for the incorrect grammar in the voice acting, which shows their attention to detail. Anyway. If you enjoy the 40k universe, you'll probably enjoy this, it's nails that 40k feeling.

Time for some buts. But, I'm pretty sure it gets no play testing in house. It's clunky, and countradictory. You have talents (perks, whatever, talents because everyone knows talent trees) that will flat out hinder other talents, despite being in trees that belong in the same build, and you can't even avoid it because of how the trees are structured. 

Dots. Damage over time. There are several options, bleed, poison, burn, and a handful of other debuffs. The other debuffs may stack, like Vulnerabilities. Dots? No, those don't stack. You can have all 3 types, but you can't have multiples of a type at the same time. They're also short, 2 seconds without talents (I think 5ish with talents?). There's a damage over time skill tree. There are equipment enchantments that deal with dots. But you still only get one dot of one type at a time. So dot builds don't work, since that's going to take FOREVER to kill anything. Nobody, NOBODY, will invest in the dot tree. The game has been out TWO YEARS and dots still don't stack, but there's a talent tree. How is this even sane, much less rational? Don't get me started on the lack of viable distribution for a dot build, either.

The weapon skills and talents don't really flow together as smoothly as they should. An example I'm currently irked about: Executions. It's a melee thing, sometimes (more with talents) you'll trigger an Execution on some enemies, which results in a brief execution animation, and a variety of buffs and enemy debuffs depending on your talents or lack thereof. But if you're using the greatsword, which I'm currently using, your main skill that you'll be using in large groups is your 2, hold it down, spin to win aoe that you can move around until you let up. But when you execute, you let up...and now you're waiting for the 6 second cooldown. You have a cone attack and 2 single target attacks as your other options. So you waste half of your buff period (with talents it's 12ish seconds) waiting for your spin to come back. It feels miserable and clunky, and if the horde of mobs is well above your level you'll really want those buffs/debuffs to proc...but if you put your spin on cooldown, you're going to die or take a ton of damage. Miserable choice.

I could go on, but I think you get the idea. The core essence of the game nails 40k, no doubt, it's quite good. But the details of the implementation are clunky and badly designed. You'll frequently be frustrated, annoyed, or generally put off by how awkwardly done it is on the details. It's like hiring someone to paint your house, and they do all the walls great, but neglect the trim. This game COULD be great, if they had even one developer with enough authority to push the decisions through that would fix it, like pretty much any developer from 99% of the companies out there, but they don't. It's so weird that they get the core right, and botch everything else so badly. So, thumbs up, but be aware of the mediocrity coming. If you can deal with it, it'll be a good time. If it'll annoy you excessively, it won't. I tend to hover right around the 50/50 mark.

Edit: Almost forgot. There's a DLC that comes with a new class, the Tech Adept. It's a pet class, with mechanical constructs. It doesn't have a pet bar. You can't set them to aggressive, defensive, stay, attack, etc. You know, the normal basic commands that are pretty much standard for a minion master in any game these days. Yep, they just hang around and act as if they're on ""defensive"" but don't cluster close enough to not agro everything you try to slip past. No pet bar.

Ultimately I would probably not recommend this game to the average player. It is enjoyable, but only in very specific ways, and there's a very good chance the average player would end up not enjoying this game.

Pros:
 - I really like the WH40k art direction; it seems very authentic, with some very good voice acting and is overall a great setting. I think if it weren't for this, I would probably hate this game.

(an aside regarding voice acting: there's a difference between acting/performance, and how a voice sounds. all of the voices _sound_ great. most of them are also well acted but some of them are not well acted at all (I think most gamers are used to this, where it's clear the actor hasn't even read and understood the lines they are saying; there's a bit of that here, but not tons).)

 - story is more interesting than I'd have expected (not tons, but somewhat)
 - diablo style gameplay is more or less good; there are lots of different ways to improve your character; it is fun to play with your character and progress them

Cons:
 - the gameplay is somewhat enjoyable, but only somewhat. it very quickly becomes repetitive, and is not particularly challenging either. in fact, it is *extremely* repetitive and uninteresting, but still does manage to be enjoyable enough for me to keep playing for now.
 - the enemy and item variety is pretty terrible. item variety in particular is noticeably lacking. I don't think I've played a diablo-clone with such poor item variety. there's only a handful of different items (I think one kind of item per slot, except weapons which have more like 4), and that's *it*.
 - the level design is pretty poor as well. it seems like the engine doesn't really support very complex level design, and most of them are extremely boring and uninteresting repetitive corridors. there is the odd outdoor map, which are nice, but they aren't very interesting either. the layouts are extremely forgettable.
 - the game seems poorly balanced. in some genres balance is not all that important, but in this style of game it kind of is. in particular the game is absurdly easy. the devs seem to have ""solved"" the balance problem by allowing you to choose from a variety of increasingly severe handicaps. at the end of the game it took a handicap of receiving over double damage, and dishing out only 38% damage, to make the game feel challenging. (I think this is a pretty bad problem, because in a diablo-style game, the feeling of the enemies becoming ever so gradually more difficult is a large part of what makes your character feel powerful, and how you explore all of your ability options.)

Despite all the problems, I am enjoying the style and some of the gameplay enough to keep playing for now, and I do plan to try more characters later. I would not _expect_ anyone to enjoy this though and would not want to risk recommending it to anyone. The only reason to play it I think would be if you want to play every last WH40k game you can, or maybe if the thought of a diablo-esque WH40k game sounds appealing enough to you that you don't care how poor the gameplay is (which is basically how I felt going in).

In the end what I enjoyed most about the game is the atmosphere, story, writing, and voice acting. Note that this was for playing as the Psyker, who had really great voice acting. I'm not sure about the other characters (the Crusader doesn't seem to be so well acted). But the setting and story are only very good, they are not fantastic, and all of the gameplay related parts of the game are mediocre at best. Definitely don't recommend in general, but if you want a pretty good WH40k story with a really authentic feeling setting and with some barely adequate diablo-style gameplay, it can maybe be worth a play.",1603034421,1603651951,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphically, it does look really great. It looks and feels like it should for the setting. Plenty of enemies abound from Chaos Cultist to Traitor Astartes (Death Guard, Word Bearers, Black Legion, Alpha Legion are the ones I've encountered so far). The levels have all sort of awesome environmental elements that simply are well crafted and scream 40K. UI is nice and clean.

Gameplay can be repeatitive and a bit grindy at times but not to a point where it detracts from the game. It has a two-tier crafting system which allows your tech priest to craft items for you providing you have all the required elements to do so.  The combat feels very 40K with lots of blood and gore. It feels awesome to wade into a mass of Chaos filth and simply crush them as you would expect an agent of the Inquisition to do. It's like interactive bolter/chainsword porn!

The things I do NOT like are some items do not come with information on what they are or even if your character class can use them (i.e. blueprints) and a quirky system in regards to equipment and how it effects your overall combat rating. A weapon that can do more damage or is seemingly less inferior may actually increase your combat rating over one that does more damage and is seemingly better. So one needs to look at an item's combat rating number which seems a bit backwards. Some features and game elements are not defined or explained well (such as skill trees and some combat effects) which means you spend time figuring things out on the fly as your in a level. Voice acting is ok- noting special.

However the good clearly outweighs the bad in my opinion. I really enjoy the game and as a 40K fan love the attention to detail. I do recommend the game and have not regretted my purchase at all.

UPDATE: The game has greatly improved via patches, balancing and gameplay improvements. It is a much more polished and overall improved product since my original review.  With over 190 hrs of investment in the game I still recommend it.",1538019665,1603388478,True,10,0,0.581064403057098389,0,True,False,False

The ideas almost fit, but the problem is that progress is very slow, attribute modifiers are not clear, map desing is tubular, and too often you have to kill all enemies in map to progress. One clear mark of the non-working design is the vehicle parts. Some mandatory missions have you drive or use a walker, but these missions are meaningless, since you arent allowed to fail, you gain nothing by finishing the mission. The vehicle itself is stupidly weak in strength and damage, and uses the same play mechanics as the main game.

I ra..gave up the game with 1 character total at level 67/100 because I lost the chase of a Wandering Servoskull for the third time. The walking grind needed to repeat the chase for a 4th time just isn't worth it. You could buy help from a vendor, who comes in only during weekends, and you can't store the help items.

Overview:

A month or so ago a friend and I were trying to decide upon a new game for the two of us to play, and as it was his turn to suggest a game we went with this at his suggestion. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning segments of the game, playing through the starting parts and following the tutorial which revealed that the game was sort of a mixture of ARPG and twin-stick shooter, which I thought would be quite fun.

Upon finishing the tutorial we played a mission or two which had the objective ""Purge"" and thought the game was going to be pretty fun, but after doing such we stepped into the story mission sections of the co-op, and were horribly disappointed. For 50+ minutes we found ourselves constantly shooting and hitting small enemies which were scaled for co-op (possibly for 4 players if the game offers that) in a terrible fashion by bloating their HP pools to TREMENDOUS values, and also cranking their damage values up to ludicrous amounts. We both scratched our heads and thought maybe something had gone wrong with the difficulty we had chosen and restarted our games and the session as a result, but nope. We were 4 levels over the recommended level but the story mission was a terrible slog which we progressed through with the help of our auto-turrets and hidding behind things.

We searched for whether this was a common problem, and found threads and information across Steam and multiple sites dating everywhere from present-day to the games initial release complaining about the co-op scaling, and how subsequent updates seemed to have fixed and also broken various things about the co-op. Most threads constantly talked about just how bad guns were and that if you wanted to get anywhere at all you needed to use melee weapons in the co-op portion of the game. From what I'd experienced, I can surmise that the information I found is right. When a game actively fights against you using whatever it is that you want, or goes so far as to make it so that it's almost unplayable, it's not exactly well-constructed.

I refunded the game as it was just barely still within the return window, and am quite disappointed at the games performance and what I'd experienced as it seems to be a good game. If you're looking for a co-op game within the Warhammer 40k Universe, you're better off getting Space Hulk than this game, and if you're just looking for a co-op ARPG/Twin-Stick shooter, there are PLENTY of better options available.",1603275262,1603276372,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

For me this game is 50/50, I like it and dislike it equally.   
  +1 RPG is well done, looks, feels, plays amazing. 
  -1 Immersion is poorly done, with story and the world feels unpolished, and gets boring and repetitive very quickly. 
In conclusion, this game is not for me :[



______________________________________________________________
Amazing environments, the level details, the feel, the weapons, the sounds, UI design, visuals! 
  Though story will be as good as Van Helsing, alas, I am 15hrs in and already board. 

Voice actor alone could of made this title, like in Van Helsing. But nope, there are good, but not good enough. Voice actor does not sound epic, badass, or unique enough. Main character just sounds generic. 
Dialogue alone could of made this title, like in Van Helsing. Close but no cigar, apart from mission into and mission objective there are no dialogue, no mystery, no intrigue, just simple wooden dialogue. 
The Mystery alone could of made this title, yet it was drowned by copy/paste shoot-em missions. 
  In the Van Helsing, the NPCs would be sent to secrete missions, THAT IS WHAT INQUISITOR DOES! but not in this title. 
  Environments alone could of made this title, but the defence/ resque, purge, assasinate, ets  missions maps all look the same, go though corridor and clear out enemies. Clear rooms in same exact way no matter the objective. There are empty rooms, just empty, no enemies no secretes, just a room, hope you had fun walking into it. 
  NPCs alone could of made this game, butsadface.
NPCs on bridge are just fancy looking shops. In fact, the bridge does not even look like a bridge because it is empty! There are no one else there but the shop(npc) characters, shouldn't there be at least servitors?! 
The soldier NPCs in missions feel clean/new and shiny and out of place, with only 3 lines of dialogue, and all move way too fast for their size making them look like plastic toy puppets.  
Missions alone could of made this game, insertsadface.  After 5 hrs of play I realized that missions are nothing more but randomly generated events with set difficulty, map, objective, loot. that just renders missions pointless! There is no purpose to do them other than grind for loot. 

Really wanted to like this game, but it breaks immersion so consistently that it is hard to get into it or stay into it.     

Why weapon icons look the same but have different 3D model?
  Why weapons do not have unique names but all Bolt-Pistols named (Bolt-Pistol)? 
Why can't preview the visual customization before submitting the selection?, lolz, have to pick armor, the color, and material, and pay 100K credits and then exit out of the menu to see what you new armor looks like?   Only to see that bright red you picked in visual customization screen now actually looks like old brown on the armor.  But now you are 30K credits short, and have to grind some more to not look like a turd. 

For me this was an Impulse buy after enjoying Van Helsing, big mistake. Cant trust this dev no more.

EDIT - over 30 hrs in Thoughts. 
Game delivers good RPG game play experience, and a lacking(unfinished) Warhammer experience.   
I was expecting to be immersed into the 40K universe, not happening. 
  Honestly if the bridge could get some atmospheric immersive love on it that would resolve alot of theme issues for me.  
  (ForExample)  None interactable animated npc menials and serfs walking about their duties, carrying tomes and scrolls, attending bridge control monitors, ets.  
 or
  (ForExample)  Generic animated visual with appropriate sounds in the forge UI during the adding a socket or removing a psalm. Instead of rightclick to slot, press enter to forge, done.

Do you want your games to be vibrant and colorful instead of dreary and dark and muddy, stay the fuck away. This is the game's Achilles heel. If you don't enjoy or can at least tolerate the themes/color pallet, I don't see you enjoying this in the long run.

One gear depending action (e.g. grenade or forcefield) (#3) and one special ability (e.g. turret) (#4).

I played it just for the story. Gameplay is repetitive and not satisfying compared to games like Diablo. Unless you theorycraft / min-max like rainman, you don't feel like a god and you have to take cover and run away to restore health all the time. Combine that with miniboss enemies that can heal? It can sometimes take a long time and grind just to kill a single enemy. This is also avoided if you do a ton of side missions, which it has a good system for. Every few hours, all side missions refresh, and there's a LOT to choose from. Also, there's mostly no punishment for death.

Visually/thematically, it's a treat. WH40k is a very single-note sort of theme -- anything you want, as long as it's grimdark and doomed -- but it's played very well here. If you want to wallow in the gloomiest of space-cathedrals where the only thing you can trust is your own chainsword, this is your game.

The co-op is terribad, though. You can't lock down your party to only your friends, and if you kick out the randos that pile in, the mission crashes out at completion without saving any gear and progression. Any game where 'co-op' actually means 'you're stuck with strangers' is a big strike from me.

The cover and targeting systems might work well for ranged builds, but I was there for melee, the bigger and more ridiculous the better, and it fought me the whole time. If you use the 'stay in place' key while attacking, you're immediately out of range from your targets, but if you don't, you end up clicking the ground next to the thing you're trying to hit, instead of hitting them. Considering all the other notes cribbed 1:1 from Diablo 3 (no shade meant; I love me some D3), I wish they'd cribbed the combat too.

As a single-player diabloid romp, you could do a lot worse. I was in it for other things, though, and it failed at them. Too bad, so sad. It was a beautiful space-cathedral while it lasted, tho.",1602893033,1602893033,False,9,0,0.584692537784576416,5,True,False,False

It's almost there, really.  It's probably great as a single player affair.  But there's this huge issue with coop that just murders it.

Imagine a scenario where you're playing in a coop group with your wife.  You've formed a party, but there's no other settings to set.  So you launch the coop mission.  You find some random dude in your party who is 40 levels above you (which is huge since you're like level 7 at this point.)  What can you do?  Kick him out of the party.  Okay.

Then you go do the mission.  You've killed the heretics, purged the chaos, chasisted the... whatever, for the effin' emperor.  Dudes got killed, loot grabbed, XP earned.  Mission compl... nope, lost connection to the server.  Reconnect?  Y/N.

You choose Y:  You're now in some new map with the rando you kicked.  You have kept no XP or loot earned.
You choose N: You're now in the main menu, with no XP or loot earned.

Now if this were a game in early access, I'd probably write an agonizingly polite post on their forums and ask them to lock down parties so others couldn't join, and maaaaaybe look into that server business.  I'd add a please and thanks too, because I am very polite.

But, see, it's not early access.  It's been released for over two years, closing in on two and a half.  This is some dire crap that needed fixing.  It says to me, ""Actually, we don't really care all that much.  How about some DLC instead?  ka-ching!""  And yeah, you can buy a mutant flying baby for a couple bucks, but you can't keep the game from crashing around your ears.

So that frothiness aside, it's... fine as a game.  It tries to play itself up like a diablo--I mean, it's all grimdark and shit, everything's all unpainted metal and grim and gray, there's a lot of burning heretics and for-the-emperors and all the crap you'd expect out of 40k.  It's not really a diablo so much as a realtime, top-down cover shooter, a sort of ""Gears of War meets X-COM in Realtime"".  Take cover, shoot guys, lure the idiotic AI into chokepoints that you trap with mines and turrets and spray down with automatic fire.  Cool.

But my wife wants to run up the middle and smash dudes with a huge hammer.  The slow and methodical gameplay doesn't suit that.  So back to the coop drawing board, I guess.",1602884647,1602884647,False,42,11,0.738964319229125977,6,True,False,False

You like the WH40k universe
You want a very satisfying ARPG experience
You like playing ARPGs solo

Reasons not to buy:
Memory leak issues make a significant portion of your playtime wasted in endgame, enough to discourage me from playing the game anymore
Gear/passive/ability choice/progression is illusion of choice and game devolves into crit/aoe/1-shot meta and only the gear that supports it is viable

Big talks:
I'm happy with my purchase because the game was on sale and because I got a lot of hours out of it. Even at full price it would have been kind of okay from a content tourism perspective. I'm happy to see a warhammer ARPG that I feel does the IP justice. I could keep doing the power creep grind, but the memory leak stability issues that started popping up around the endgame are making the game feel unplayable, and I do not see the game having much replayability or much variety in the endgame.

Solid game. Good experience. Gameplay and leveling experience is perhaps the best I've experienced in the genre, but the endgame falls a little bit short of that experience, especially if you were hoping to co-op as much meaningful content is SP-only. For me, this was a 95/100 AAA game (albeit with cheesy voiceacting and some stand-out lines from the character/Captain Voicecomms Buddy that didn't quite fit the feel of grimdank) up until the point where it became a beta-quality game when I started grinding for gear on level 80+ and it was basically a coinflip to see whether I could finish a 20 minute session and be rewarded for my efforts, or just sit there mad and having wasted a bunch of time.

--------------- Old review ---------- start under this line---------------

after having played this for 5 hours, I can say I will not recommend this game. even with a 70% discount for the complete game. I had to pay 23 euros for everything. 

the game feels clunky and heavy to play and somehow you are not just fighting the enemies it feels like you are fighting the game too.

and that is sad, because there are a lot of good things in this game. 
I enjoy the story, and whirlwind in a power armor with make me smile any day.
skill trees you open after completing different achievements, gives you a good feel of progression. 
you gain skill point for doing stuff on different characters. so, to max out you will need to play other classes too. And playing your “main” will ad a few skill points to new characters.

I am sure most people can find 5-10 hours of playtime in this game maybe even more. But when you are competing against Diablo or Path of exile, you have a high bar to reach. And this game is just not making it.",1602286106,1602852239,False,3,0,0.511904776096343994,4,True,False,False

No multiplayer?? One of my main draws to play this game was co-op, but ""multiplayer services unavailable at this time"" is all I get, long after completing all intro missions. Its always unavailable, and I dont know anyone who plays this, so the idea of quickly jumping into a coop game is dead for me, which kills 60% of my enjoyment of this game. The graphics are occasionally glitchy (blood and effects floating in/out of the floors?), load times seem long for what the mission areas look like, but overall the game keeps me playing...

Will I keep playing solo? Sure, as the progression, story, and graphics are fantastic, and I love the lore and overall 40k fiction, but the failure of good coop mode is a big deal to me. 

I recommend this with strong reservations, and if the coop mode never becomes useful, I will eventually change this to not recommended.

Everything you wield is intended to deliver complete overkill and grim-dark punishment to your foes.

If you are interested in the 40K universe,  you learn fast that you, the Inquisitor, have no fear of the enemy and welcome the idea of a glorious death in the light of the Emperor.

I am 6hrs into the campaign at the time of this review and I can say that the game has started to feel like the difficulty is scaling to my characters LVL. I chose not to use the XP boost that came with the delux edition of the game and it feels like early game there are lots of opportunities to LVL faster, which is not necessary, so for the sake of enjoying the base game I chose not to take advantage of such boosts and it has been enjoyable so far just playing the Campaign missions.

The lore is deep and the story is interesting, to fans of the 40k universe. Some reviews have toted that the game repetitive and a grindfest, which can be true, but coming to this understanding you are an augmented human with an arsenal of the 
finest weaponry from the Imperium at your disposal, you will enjoy every moment of tearing through daemons, xenos and heretics as your extraordinary skills should allow you to do.

The item customisation and variation is very deep and if this is of no interest to you, the game can be played without looking too deeply into the attribute and buff affects, however for those interested in such intricacies the game offers an abundance of options and playstyles.

I am yet to play the PVP or COOP so I cannot comment on that for now as I am still chipping away at the main campaign.

Short description:
You are basically an Inquisitor chasing a long lost inquisitorial vessel with some groundshaking secrets. 

Story 9/10
Hands down, best story in an Action RPG I have had so far. In your Journey you find many pieces of the puzzle to get a clearer picture of what is going on. You have to make decisions which influence your Character progression (Puritan vs. Radical).

Quests 9/10
I am level 51 and haven't finished the main campaign yet. Just did 3 of the many existing sidequests. I haven't even tried the other game mods yet.

Graphics 7/10
Not beautiful, but not ugly either. Sometimes Low-Res, but it catches the WH40K atmosphere quite well.

Map Design 7/10
You travel from world to world with your spacecraft doing missions. Even though the mission maps are unique, the setting of the map gets old. Either way you fight on Spacecraft or Spaceship Corridors, on the Top of Hive-Citys, in Citys or on Ice World. I would love to see Deathworld or just something green in between or a Desert World. The maps are also rather small. A mission will take you 8-15 min aproximately.

Classes/Progression 10/10
I am just playing a Crusader and I am loving the Varierty. You have so many different Weapons and Armors that chance your gameplay completely. 

Voice/Sound 8/10
Solid.

Camera perspective 3/10
The camera perspective per se is static. Depending on the map which can be narrow with high/Large buildings and elements in between,  this can lead to situation where you cannot target/see enemies close to you. Really awful. I have to actively rotate the camera to have a good view every time, which is kind of weird and should not be the case.

Combat 5/10
Compared to Grim Dawn, Diablo and POE it is pretty slow paced. Also this is tied to point camera perspective. It is mediocre at best, which is bad, since the combat is a core part of an ARPG.

TLDR:
Solid game. Buy on sale. Must have for Warhammer40K Fans.

If you buy it, you should get the base game + Prophecy DLC. Don't bother with the other DLCs as they offer only marginal things for early game (useless later on).
I played this for about 120 hours between 06/2020 and 10/2020.

The good:
+ It is 40K and the setting seems right
+ It feels rewarding to play and the drop rates for good items feel right
+ It is easy to get into and you aren't punished for playing the game your way

The bad:
- There are some silly things with the characters in game, who do stuff that does not make sense in the 40K setting. For example during the plot your character goes to middle of an enemy pack to talk some nonsense with the enemy boss, more than once. And after that you almost always have to fight all of them while being in the middle of them.
- It requires more content. There are only Chaos, Rebels, Aeldari, Drukhari and Tyranids against you - I would need Orks and Necrons as well as more diverse adversary types going against you. I didn't like the repetitive nature of the game as it gets old fast when you play the same map for the 40th time with identical objectives and locations as the 39 times you did the same map before. More maps and different mission objectives, with meaningful rewards, please!
- The game does not really help you to play it. You have to read through different guides and google stuff to get to do specific things. For example there are certain key bindings that have to be researched with google rather than using the interface to do what you want to do. Or that if you want to grind the system influence you should use Tarot cards to modify the mission to get 50 influence per mission, rather than playing 5 or 10 missions the normal way to get 10 influence per mission.

The other:
> The game needs more polishing and some new features from different more successful Diablo clones. For example an visible list containing ""what different things the item can roll with"" would be really useful when crafting / modifying the items.
> You have to make an Neocore account in order to play the game. But it takes like 2 minutes and you don't ever have to use it again.
> The other DLCs than the Prophecy seem kind of odd. They offer little rewards and don't really have an story, so they don't have any reason to play them through.
> I ran the game at 270 FPS, which made the game really unstable. I had to limit the FPS from the menu to stop the crashing. After limiting the FPS the game was stable.


I got plenty of entertainment from the game, so the review is a thumbs up. But I doubt that I will put more hours into this game, as there isn't anything interesting to do anymore. 
For my endgame I got to a lvl 92 psyker with Warp Blast @ 2400 DPS + Witchfire @ 1000 DPS, with half Ancient relic gear and 4 x blessing (+10% dmg each) running at 90seconds each.

I haven't yet made it to endgame, but there is a ton of content prior to that, and that content hits a lot of things that Path of Exile, Diablo 3, and Grim Dawn all miss for me. The combat is slower and more tactical than most ARPGs. You have to react to your enemies in ways you really don't have to in other games until very late. There's also quite a lot of build diversity, it seems.

+ Good graphics, enemy models, and skill effects
+ (Eventually) good enemy unit diversity
+ Environments are compelling, though they can get a little repetitive
+ Gameplay feels good - responsive yet not twitchy
+ The story is actually good imo, which I was not expecting in an ARPG, especially a Warhammer one
+ Lots of interacting mechanics to give veteran ARPG players something to play with

- Enemy unit diversity is slow to kick in. You're fighting Nurgle for a while
- Once you unlock all your abilities, your gameplay doesn't change much for a while
- Mission structure is a bit samey (but it's more variety than most ARPGs)

? Not sure how classes other than psyker feel

I bought this game to play with a friend for co-op but you can't drop-in like in Diablo or Torchlight. Instead, you have to complete a series of introductory missions before you can even invite people to play. I invited my friend and it triggered a bug which locked his single-player progress. He now cannot play missions unless he is in a party with someone else that can choose missions for him

Gameplay is very simplistic compared to the aforementioned games. Item choices per class are locked and variety is very limited. There is a lack of depth compared to other games out there which makes the game from brain-numbing and repetitive. This feeling is compounded by the constant repeating of the same voice lines and mission briefing over and over again. I'm actually tempted to play the game without sound

There's lag issues when playing co-op and you can't play campaign missions with your friends unless you are at the same spot, but it's really hard to tell where that is since you are not allowed to join co-op games till later. Missions are chosen Dawn of War style with various planets, sub-systems etc... you can jump to and fro but really it feels like a waste of time. There's no structure to it.

 you guys? It's so fun. It keeps throwing things at me too! It's scratching an itch for Diablo I didn't realize had gotten so bad. Beautiful animations and art, top notch sound- kinda meh music most of the time, but 'tis okay. Battle sounds are fantastic. I would recommend jumping into the controls and changing the camera control to something more handy. I had set up a WASD movement with EQ for the cameras, pretty good results. I'm tempted to set it up more akin to LoL, with my attacks along QWER and my armor/belt abilities as DF. Jump AND Teleport? Amazing for gap closing or kiting back.

Not really, but it masters its own formula so well, that it makes it hands down my favorite game in the ""Diablo-like' genre/idea of games. Endless amounts of things to do, addictive as hell, and overall a strong recommend. 

Each weapon type gives you different skills, each armor type gives you a different 'ultimate', different utilities offer a variety of options (e.g grenades, mines, shield, etc.). ""Healing potions"" in this can be augmented with different stat buffs, a card system for additional tweaking of the abilities and loot you get.... the diversity is how your appearance is influenced by your equipped gear.... oh my, the list goes on. I didn't even talk about the plethora of passive trees, perks, collecting stuff, deeds, exploration both in map and in the star fields. EASILY capable of hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of game play. Each Class plays radically different, each class has sub options to further diversify your play.... SERIOUSLY there is so much here.

Now, the game isn't without its flaws - I've noticed a peppering of graphical bugs here and there that can be distracting on occasion, and once in a while audio acts a little odd, but these feel so minor in the scale of what you get for a game here.

Figured i should put this in the title first so that people skimming the reviews will get a short answer on why i recommend it, i'll be going into more detail below. I've played a good amount of hours last year but never left a review. Seeing this is on sale at the moment, i figured it might be appreciated to chip in. 

First off, the bad. It's quickly repetitive and might bore many people that aren't inherently interested in the genre itself. Game design is somewhat flawed as it fails to provide new things to keep things interesting. If it doesn't grab your interest and maintain it, it will fade quickly. This is mostly so thanks to the somewhat mediocre campaign, there's an enormous amount of filler, slow progress and a story that - whilst not bad per se - fails to pick up steam to keep you engaged, a few missions are more interesting than the others, but as a whole it's underwhelming. (free play on the other hand is pretty decent, more on that later) The other issue lies with  build diversity. Having mostly played Psyker i have the broadest range of abilities to play with and i've tried almost all of it, but once you've found something that sticks with you, there's little reason to diversify or change up your build with possibly the exception of automata, which provide a unique challenge and require you to restructure your build and skills, but mission featuring those are unfortunately few and far between. Apart from that, if you ever decide to do change things up your build will quickly no longer function as intended and you're going to get hammered as enemy power creep kicks in. 

Secondly, the game advertises on an idea of 'randomly generated maps' which is somewhat true until you realize its just the same dull set pieces randomly stitched together, which will quickly become apparent. Not that it matters since most of the maps are 'open' with very little variation. 

While the devs have provided a huge amount of updates and a worthy expansion, none of them have really addressed the issue for me enough to really feel like it's going the best it can be. It's certainly a step in the right direction, but it still feels like as wide as an ocean, and as deep as a puddle, even though the puddle did get a bit deeper.

The good news though is that if it [i]does[/i] stick with you, there's a huge range of content available for you to explore. And that's a good thing, because the game actually gets MUCH better once you start investing some time into it. Particularly free-play can provide unique difficulty with the use of so called 'tarots' that can really drive up the challenge. There's a huge array of customization for your character, the levels, the enemies you will face and game modes as well. The Void Crusades have been a particularly good update in that regard, which are very challenging as well. Character progression scales well and there's always something to keep striving for - i've played well over a hundred hours and i have yet to find a so called 'ceiling'. (though im sure you can get to that eventually).

As for presentation, it really nails the 40K powerfantasy. Audio isn't that amazing, but apart from that, everything's got a real kick to it - and they're not messing around when they mentioned this game was going to get gorey. You'll find the usual iconic weaponry you know from 40K along with a few more unique ones and almost all of them feel satisfying to use. (though they might not always be good weapon picks - the heavy bolter unfortunately being one of them much to my dismay)

All in all, there's a real good amount of content to sink your teeth in, but i would really only recommend it to the fans of the genre. You're going to have to bite into this to really make it stick and let its strong elements shine, but before you can get to that point you may already have quit out of frustration or boredom and leave disappointed. 

I'm giving it a cautious recommendation for those who have the interest to pull through, but if you're on the fence about it, i would highly advise you to pass this game.",1602022394,1602298645,True,59,2,0.854311287403106689,0,True,False,False

---------------------------------------------Begin Quote----------------------------------------------

Played this game a lot and had a lot of fun. But:

- It's been 4 years.
- Improving the core of the game is always put after implementing new, broken stuff into the game.

Example: Let's put cars in! Good idea. However, controls and usage is bugged and nigh unplayable. Nevertheless they implement tires, batteries, spark plugs and whatnot instead of focusing on driveability and physics. 
Example 2: Weapon X is broken. It does not get fixed for a year. In the meantime though, you can now grow 5 types of vegetables instead of 4! Yay! 

What I mean with these examples is that needless stuff is getting implemented in a botched way instead of implementing fewer, more important (still not major tho) stuff more correctly.

Also the devs blocking everyone who disagrees on social media is kind of sad.

Update 08.02.2019

Now perma banned for speaking out against the lack of updates and fixes for this ""game""

Don't support this company in thier sly practices, this is why they get away with it, remember your wallet speaks volumes.

Update 23.06.18

Game is still garbage, still littered with bugs that have totally broken the coop portion of the game, features some of the worse grinding available, world events are just purge missions, over and over again, last world event required you to do 50 missions solo in the starter system so it didnt reward the players, the reward..... an emote and a lootbox that had green items at best in it, no uniques or anything, the community world event box was worse, it granted 100 rep with the starter tutorial sysem which 95% of players would of maxed already.

The new event is more of the same, this company loves to sh1t all over its playerbase as it did with the van helsing games.  STAY AWAY at all costs, forums are infested by blind lying fanboys that defend this extremly poor business practice as ""they will fix it"" excuses.  If you speak out on the forum your banned immediatly.

Currecny income in game in the form of fate has been reduced by 60% so you have to grind an insane amount to reach max level, this is done to delay the player while they think up new ideas for this so called ""3 year plan"" of content.

The release build is basically a even more broken version of the beta we got while the alpha actually worked correctly with what systems were in place, thats right... the alpha was better than the beta and v1.0 release.

Dont support bad business ethics and practices by buying this game, stay away and wait for something that is worth your money.

Beta Review Update, 

Update as of 28.05.2018

After now trying to get the game breaking bugs fixed in this game, I decided to try and seek helpl on the Neocore discord, only to be answered by a bunch of very ignorant fanboys that was PC was a potato and I should ""qq""

Well, you cheeto munching retards, I run a 8700k, 32gb DDR4 Ram with twin SLI 1080's, OS (Win10 64bit Ult)  is on a Samsung EVO 850SSD while steam is installed with games on a HyperX Fury 510/500 SSD.  This game runs like absolute garbage in multiplayer, expect 10-15fps due to some of the worse netcoding I have seen yet.  Textures missing, sound files missing or incomplete.  Insane amount of crashes just from maps not working or latency through the graphics API overheating AMD/ATI equipment.

------------------------------------------

Update after Beta Launch +4 hours

After playing a pysker for 4-5 hours my character is now locked along with my crusader gunner shortly after, the characters are unselectable on the title screen.  THIS SHOULD OF BEEN FIXED YOU FUCKING USELESS COMPANY!

Ignore the bullshit reviews you see of people have 0.5 hours of playtime on this game, most of the accounts are alt accounts that dont get played.  Megapull himself who is part of neocore admitted on a live stream that he copies peoples accounts to play and doesnt log them out, this results in the accounts like mine getting locked and then becoming unplayable.

Update as of 21/05/18

Yet again another delay in the release of a beta, A BETA! you cant even release a beta on time that you have stated so many times was ready!  The excuse this time was a 80FPS optimization, so this means that your game had zero playable fps in the first place.  This company are a bunch of f4cking liars, they just steal peoples money, as a founder I wont be backing any more games by this company.  Stay away from this title, your better taking your money and setting fire to it in a stone mug, you would get more enjoyment.

https://twitter.com/megapull

He still thinks that his time is better spent playing counterstrike rather than working on a game we have paid for, guess it was money for his alcohol.

Most accounts are now broken and no one can play, promised fixes by devs on 7/5/2018 but nothing, tried to contact them and we just get ignored, so fuck this game and its developers, I hope it doesnt release then due to living in the UK I can get a refund for a ""non working product""

Not to mention the bans that they are handing out for people who call them out on thier behavior, I hope more people read this and are aware of the terrible practices that Neocore have towards their early access testers.
--------------------------------------------

Dont bother with it, Devs should of got an Beta out ages ago for this title, instead they are pandering to the kiddy console market instead of fixing the PC release (which is what its originally developed for)  Will proberly feature on disc DLC and microtransactions.  Contacting devs about broken characters which they promise to fix by restoring your items and progression goes nowhere, lazy piss poor respect for the small community that tried to support them.

Game has no roleplay elements, no even a suggestion of them.

Game may change on release although this would require a massive miracle.

Bottom line....

An incomplete mess of a game with promised updates but eventual delays, nothing but empty promises so far from the developers regarding 100 mission types, there is no game on any media platfom that features this. Beta should of been months ago to attract more players. Company is focusing on console development rather than tuning the original release for PC.

This game is solely defended by fanboys such as Airsickhydra who cant see past lies from a company that clearly had a good idea to treat this IP with the respect it deserves after the atrocity that was DoW3 but have lost thier way due to pandering to the console market.",1525045716,1602236735,False,25,3,0.288237720727920532,0,True,False,False

I will note this though, if you aren't a fan of the Imperium of Mankind, and would rather play as xenos or chaos, then you're out of luck here... but if you don't mind playing as a throne agent, then you have a decent variety of options with 3 classes (4 with the prophecy DLC), and each of those classes having 3 sub-classes of their own. You can customize your character with various items, skills, powers, etc.

Inquisitor - Martyr suffers the same problems as all games of this design. It is simply a grind run where your attempting to find the best loot drops in hopes making your character more powerful. So if you played the likes of Diable 3 and every other clone there was you get the gist of what this one is about. The fact it is a Warhammer 40k game is just the coat of paint used for a sub-par design.

Combat is regulated to a 4 button system of light attack (that can be made into a combo), heavy attack and two special moves that depend on what weapons you are using. As expected  there are cool down timers on this. Movement for characters is very rigid and not flowing. Dodge mechanics are laughable at best as the are not needed. For what enemies you need to dodge you could just walk in a square shape fashion to avoid them. 

The classes you can select do offer a decent mix but are generic ones you've seen done before. They try to spice it up with subclass sections but again the options are meh. Additionally there is somewhat custom creation system that uses skill points for various trees and branches but the options offered are lacking. Mostly it is just generic items like a bonus to attacks, increased health, etc. For some reason a level up system was used but this only just provides more skill points to earn and unlocks some additional abilities with different types of weapon choices also.

The story mode was decent of what I played so far and the voice acting is decent. Areas are designed somewhat nice but are limited by a horrid camera that only provides a top down system of view. 

In all, I cannot recommend this one. If your someone that enjoys such games as Diablo 3 then this is worth a look. Though if you are someone like me who expected more well skip it because there isn't much to it. Grind areas repeatedly and loot farm is all there is really to this which doesn't hold my attention or make me invested in it.

They enviroments look great, but will begin to feel samey after a while, as do most of the missions, but overall this game feels like 40k and is genuinely fun if you enjoy the ARPG gameplay loop. 

The story isnt anything to write home about, its just there to tie missions together and introduce you to game mechanics, and it does a decent job of this. The gameplay is pretty standard for ARPG's and feels satisfying. Ripping heretics and daemons apart with eviscerators and raining down fire with heavy bolters is my preferred way of purging the enemies of man, but its always fun to expirment with different weapons and loadouts when you get new gear as you increase in level.

My biggest issue with the game is its pricing. 50$ for the base game,or 80 dollars for the ultimate which includes the prophecy expansion and all the base games dlc, which feels a little over priced for the game you get. Just wait for the game to drop in price or more likely go on sale, and then you'll be getting your moneys worth out of the game. 

Overall I give Inquisitor Martyr a 7/10, what really holds this game back is the barebones nature of the story, and the lack of variety in missions, raids and atmosphere. Also, adding more investigation and exploration to the gameplay to help break the repititiveness of the combat would help in the long run too.",1602178171,1602178171,True,1,0,0.512475430965423584,0,True,False,False

Enter player 2, this is where the shit show began. I bought this game to play coop with a friend thinking we could share the fun. There is no fun to be had here in multiplayer, we trudged around a map and got pretty heftily geared which was nice with lots of lovely purply items. We got to the end of the level and the game crashed. (we both run rigs which can easily cope with this game) Weird I thought but no biggy its an online game we will just re-connect, we got reconnected and had lost all items. I had lose level progression but my friend had retained his levels but not his gear. 

We entered another mission to smash more Tyrannid skulls, 30 minutes more game play and im pretty please with my new heavy flamer nioce :D. clearly the game wasnt as on completion of the mission I was stuffed like a turkey at christmas dinner again. NO GEAR NO LEVELS NO NADA. At least this time I wasnt alone. 

Take three, benefit of the doubt beginning to subside very quickly, needless to say got fucked again. 

Tedious like watching an orc collect wood for a fire we took to the glory of Reddit and other such outlets to receive the kind of information we should have pre-armed with in the initial buying stages. 

1, The servers are shit.
2, The multiplayer is heavily broken.
3, this was a problem on launch.
4, this problem still isnt rectified.

There are good recipes for ARPGs, and if you follow them you'll make a fun game.  You can even make small changes and substitutions and still have a good game.  When you try to write your own recipe you'll end up with a sh!t sandwich.  Thats kind of what happened here.  A sh!t sandwich dressed up to look like a beloved universe.

Just a little update, still don't recomend.  There have been improvements with the prophecy expansion, which was nice.  Gameplay is faster and more ARPG than it was before, but beyond that I struggle to even find the words to express how frustrating and tedious it is, especially at ""endgame"".  Game developers have a thin line to walk to balance a game so its not too hard but challenging enough to stay interesting all the while giving loot thats meaningful without showering the player with too much.  Neocore games fails at this pretty hard.  

Games Workshop should pull their license before neocore drives people away from them.

One last update to the review now that I've deleted my characters and uninstalled the game.  Too much important endgame content is needlessly time locked, 3 different factions to level up but you can only do 3 missions a week to get reputation rewards.  Crafting recipes that are randomly spawned on the merchants that only allow you to craft 5 times before the recipe disappears and you have to wait till they randomly come back.  I waited 4 weeks to craft a thing, got 4 crappy rolls and 1 almost ok roll and then couldn't craft more. Enough is enough.",1558806547,1602016665,False,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed this game so much on Xbox One I bought it again for PC. 

It's a top down ARPG, you can control the camera above and move it in any direction you want to (not like the camera in Diablo 3) making your way through the levels unlocking better gear as you go. 

Gameplay can seem repetitive on the top level, but if you keep changing up the weapons you use, you soon delve into the different levels of tactical nuance which can provide you with hours of enjoyment. 

Personally, I find it very addictive. It's a lot of fun and I'm still learning more and more about it as I go.

You get good choices on characters too, with the base game offering you 12-15 different types from the start. But you can buy the expansion and get a Tech Adept too (I haven't played this) 

For 40k fans, this is a must have. It fits within the lore as best as any piece of 40k can and the music, artwork is very faithful to source material and the gameplay is an absolute blast.

For the sale price of $25 I thought it was a good game, lacking some of the polish of its AAA counter parts have but still worth the solid 25+ hours it provided.

Set in the Warhammer 40K universe you play as an inquisitor, an agent of the imperium who can sentence worlds to death for the slightest hint of corruption. Receiving an order to investigate the Martyr, a long lost fortress monastery (giant spaceship) that has been ejected back into real space from the warp you start to uncover secrets that could tear the imperium apart and have to make a choice that could shape the Imperium of Man for millennium to come.

The game does both an excellent job of building the grim dark setting of the 40k universe, while also butchering some of the background and doing a poor job of explaining any of the universes overarching story. Having prior knowledge of the 40k setting is almost mandatory. You are only given the briefest introduction to what the inquisition does, how tech is worshiped and treated and the other imperium factions are barely mentioned at all (the different Inquisition factions are better explained in Prophecy). The setting of the Imperium (fascist religion who worship a corpse vs cultists who worship dark gods) is skipped entirely. This makes roleplaying options between radical and puritan difficult, as by todays standard the choices seem back to front (killing everyone is a puritan option, while sparing people is a radical idea). The main character of the game break long standing background ideas – the [spoiler] Alpha Pariah, (a soulless person who can neutralise warp presence and destabilises psykers powers) [/spoiler]. GW have set the precedence on some of their recent books, but it goes against nearly 30 years of background. One of the player character classes, the Psyker shouldn’t even be allowed in the same room.

Gameplay was good, as instead of never ending maps you get short 10-15 min missions (think torchlight), where you either have set targets to neutralise, all foes on a map, destroying objects or hacking terminals or rescuing and protecting weaker characters. When everything is done you teleport back to base, equip loot, sell unwanted items, upgrade stats and abilities before diving back in. The cover system was very cool, and not something I’ve seen in a hack and slash. Each character has a suppression bar, which show how likely they will be effected by effects (knockdown ect). Battles become very difficult when you start to constantly get knocked around, which is where the cover system comes in. You can also use it when using ranged weapons (if you equip them), and the AI does a decent job of trying to use it as well.

I would highly recommend focusing on doing the main story missions, until you have unlocked the morality options (end of chapter 3). Many of the DLC missions give good boosts to this bar and other than main story missions additional chances to progress on this are very limited and depend on RNG (Prophecy greatly adds to this). The game systems and options are unlocked very slowly (like morality, tarot cards, void missions), so you miss out on quite a few drops if you deviate from the main story early. You are constantly unlocking options for your character up until lvl 50, so there is plenty to experiment with.

The game suffers from what all hack and slash ARPGs suffer from, equipment creep. No matter how good the item is, it will eclipsed eventually by a higher level generic item. Luckily each character isn’t locked into a set build that focuses around equipment (the right abilities help, but it’s only a problem when you are at max level). Perks can be changed freely at the ship, and skill trees can be reset for a slight cost. I found myself switching between whatever weapon setup was most handy at the time (from ranged to close combat), and all the stats are in easily readable format. Each of characters plays very differently and has unique skill tree options, as well as some shared skill trees. Some weapons are shared between the classes, others are locked. There is also a crafting system where you can increase the lvl on loot or re-roll its buffs), if you really want to keep a certain equips for a while longer.

I found there was a good range of content to keep myself occupied after the main story. I didn’t hit the lvl cap where I would start farming for the best equipment, but that wasn’t an issue. you have a large choice of free flow missions to pick from, priority missions which, are a few missions strung together with a narrative linking them and some choices to make, war zone missions and void missions which get progressively harder as they continue but give better rewards. There are also challenge maps that have you fighting continuous waves of enemies for better loot

The stages that you traverse look like they come straight from the source material. It’s full of derelict spaceship corridors, frozen planets, destroyed city’s or death worlds. While each stage mostly forces you to follow a path there is tons of objects that look like they belong in that universe, and most of it is destructible. I really liked how every enemy wasn’t just cultists, but how it differentiated between renegades, cultists, daemon worshipers, daemons before you even get to the dark elder and chaos marines. 

Graphically the game looks good, but only supports up to HD, so on bigger screens some of the objects can appear blurry. There are tons of destructible objects (including cover), so when you are killing enemies stray shots put holes in objects or blow containers up. It does look like there was a high amount of work that has been put into it.

The voice work of the main characters was good, as some of the side characters (I loved the stilted speech of the tech priest). The crusaders inquisitor righteous speech’s sounds good, and there was enough humour in the comments between other followers on your ship that it didn’t get dull.

Multiplayer still seems active, it only took a couple of minutes to join a game, and loot seems to be unique per player. You can join a cabal and earn extra rewards for playing together. I think the game would be a lot more fun playing with a group of friends.

My thoughts for the DLC are under my Inquisitor: Prophecy review (https://steamcommunity.com/id/Carrionjr/recommended/1042800?snr=1_300_recommendgame__402) and hasn’t changed.

If you are wanting to get 100% achievements then you will need to purchase some of the DLC, as well as the expansion and be prepared to sink a fair amount of time into playing the game.",1600613439,1600613547,True,55,0,0.839380741119384766,0,True,False,False

Look, honestly, it's fine. It's a totally serviceable ARPG slathered in Warhammer 40k.

There's tons of stuff. The developers seemed to have added in every possible type of thing to this game. There's daily events, weekly challenges, achievements, unlockable challenges, piles of skill trees, tons of gear stats, customization for everything, crafting, cosmetics, 6ish types of ""currency"", random missions, difficulty modifiers, PVP, a cover system... the list goes on. Most of these additions (to me) feel like they were added for the sake of adding them, and they don't improve the game experience.

The thing is, none of those things really make the game more fun or interesting. Strip away all of that and what you're left with is a Diablo-like that is functional but not particularly fun to play. Again, it isn't bad... it's just, well, kind of boring. Every mission feels essentially the same-- trudge around either derelict spaceships or dull ground maps, killing lots of enemies. The story missions have about as much flavor as the randomly generated missions, and I don't mean that in a good way. Also, I wasn't a fan of the way the co-op play works. Doesn't seem like you can do the story missions together at all (or at the very least you have to be on the exact same mission/step) and that just leaves the randomly generated missions, which are pretty boring.

The game is bursting with Warhammer 40k technojargon, so if that appeals to you, it's got that going for it. On the other hand, if you aren't particularly interested in that sort of thing, be prepared to click through a lot of dialogue, 'clues', and lore prompts for a bunch of nonsense.

Again, it's fine. It's the definition of a 6/10 game. It's serviceable and functional in a world and on a platform with piles of other more interesting options.",1593871721,1600546470,False,35,1,0.695422947406768799,0,True,False,False

Like Grim Dawn, which is a much better alternative to this polished bore.

From a genuine fan of 40k, I can simply say: It's not enough.
Graphics are great, sound is okay, destructable envrironment is great, no stinky bugs I could find... so what's pissing in my Khorneflakes?
1. All maps look the same after a while, imperial ship corridors, lined by statues of Astartes with the occasional Nurgle infestation, ruined imperial fortresses and imperial industrial complexes.
2. Combat is just an endless grind. Grind down a group of enemies, move on, grind down the next group until you happen upon a boss and grind it down as well. The weapon variety is great, but feels... samey again.
3. Difficulty boils down to challenging yourself to do -the same- missions, but only dealing X% less damage and taking Y% more.
4. All this could have been saved by a good story, but I'm 25+ hours and I couldn't be less engaged by stiff characters uttering boring dialogue to send me to the next grind against a random enemy I couldn't give less of a sh*t about.
5. Your retinue of NPCs is mostly just an interface to interact with the game, their miniscule personality quickly boiling down to a bland console interface. The Tech Priest once made me chuckle, but remembering that makes me remember how boring the rest of them was. I couldn't name any of them, nor why exactly they are on my crew beyond being an interface.
5. DLC firework doesn't help a game that doesn't engage with its base.
6. It tries to be multiplayer, but frankly, I don't know why I should engage in either grinding other players or grinding NPCs together with them to get more stuff to grind further.
7. There seems to be a rather horrifying amount of ""life-service"", seasons, limited stuff, challenges of the week and other stuff to hook grindaholics.
8. Your rare choices between ""radical"" and ""puritan"" (which have been the only choices the game has given me, except for loadout and class) seem to boil down to ""empathetic but potentially hazardous"" and ""cruel but save"".
9. So many things you could micro manage, so much useless loot, so many 0,5% perks I couldn't give a rats' arse about... what for? Give me a Heavy Bolter and show me where the next heretic is in need of massacring, it's the only thing the game can do efficiently.

It's had a LOT of work put into it, and as a tactical isometric action game, it definitely achieves its goals.  When it was released, the developers had intended for combat to be slower, more tactical, and in their minds, more visceral.  But years of people blazing through D2, D3, and Path of Exile led to a misunderstanding between the customer base who bought the game at the time of release and the developers who made it.

The developers TOOK ON that feedback and sped up the pace of combat dramatically.  They also reworked some arcane systems and made it more Diablo-like, such as allowing you to tweak your gear mid-mission and its crafting system, which is VERY D3 reminiscent today.  

The gameplay is what you expect, spread between mysteries and investigations your inquisitor is checking out.  If the ""detective"" aspects of the gameplay were more fleshed out, I think this game would be a diamond in the rough; alas, the systems are rudimentary at best, and though the story isn't bad and oozes 40k flavour, there isn't any depth to it that goes beyond ""start mission, kill all the things, push these buttons, kill a boss, and pick up the clue.""

I do recommend it as a fan of isometric action games, but if you want a deeper investigative system, this is not the game for you.  If you're a Warhammer 40k fan AND a fan of isometric action games, I'd say this game has something to offer you.

TL:DR. The game is really fun, lots of weapons and different ways to play, the campaign is long and interesting, lots of interesting main side stories, plenty of random missions and stuff to farm, but it also has a fair bit of bugs. In general these aren't game breaking just annoying. Because of this at $50 I think i'd say this is a maybe. However, if you catch this on sale its worth it. At say $25 or less i'd say it's absolutely worth it.

The good!
Classes:
There's 3 different classes each with 3 subtypes of classes. While you pick a starting one you can easily switch between them by changing their equipment. Further there's tons of different guns / melee weapons / types of grenades / etc. You can really play the game any way you want and do well. While some weapon setups / combos will work better than others I didn't see any that I thought were blatantly weak / useless.
There's also lots of customization in terms of your character traits and perks.

Campaign / Side missions / Random missions:
 - The game has a main campaign that consists of multiple missions over 5 chapters. 
 - There's iirc 4 or so side story campaigns that each consist of multiple missions
 - There's daily / weekly challenges and unlimited side missions you can do. You can also activate cards that increase challenges for a chance at bonus rewards.
 - The main characters are voice acted well.
 - Lots of well written notes / journal entries that stay true to the warhammer universe.
- my 36 hours listed is almost exclusively the story missions. My friends and I only did a couple of random missions

The (almost) entire game is coop. There's a few solo missions in the campaign / main side story missions but everything else is coop up to 4 people.

The Bad:
Honestly the game is kinda buggy but most of them are just kind of annoying and not game breaking.
 - These are dedicated servers... that at least a few times a night will get rather laggy and annoying
 - When you complete a mission and have tons of loot you'll get back to your main deck and your inventory is empty.... don't worry you didn't lose your loot, it will reappear if you back out to main menu and start again. Otherwise it will just reappear in your inventory in the next mission or next time you come back to your main deck.
 - The game has a rejoin feature if you get disconnected. This DOES NOT work as far as  I have seen. Actually that's not fair it does work just not right. If you rejoin it will put you into someone else's game....
 - At one point we (3 man of friends) completed a mission and did not get credit for it. I looked it up and this has happened in the past for some people. The solution they said was to post on the forum and the devs would give you credit for it on their end.

Other than that, this game is trash. Constantly glitching, clipping, and stability issues. Angles of fire do not function correctly. For example, projectiles ignore walls in a game with a cover system and you are not able to shoot from higher ground to lower ground.

I was happy to ignore all of the absolutely trash design to swing a thunder hammer, fire off a plasma cannon, and hear the sweet ringing of the Emperor's bolt rifle. But the final straw for me was trying to figure out a particular game system for hours, only to find that the final boss is a Chaos Knight which I could literally do nothing against. As in, an imperial knight which has become corrupted. As in, a titanic war walker. And i'm one tiny human. Even if I were properly geared or had properly navigated this particular system, the idea that I am gong to take on a knight as a shitty little human is just ridiculous, even for Warhammer 40k.

This game is fun, engaging, and has a lot to offer when it works, which is most of the time if you're solo and almost never in coop. If you get in a group you will likely disconnect, but don't worry the handy reconnect function won't work at all. Heck, if you even manage to make it through a map with a group, maybe your loot will even show up in your pack. No? Oh, just go on ahead an reboot from the start menu of the game!

527430,74802801,76561198100467252,0,7,5461,0,3267,1679400389,"So i am torn on this game, and i recomend it because it is a solid ARPG and really pulls off the WarHammer 40k feel. However, the game has issues that hold it back. 
Abilities/Equipment:
Unlike Torchlight and Diablo your class dose not affect what skills and attacks you can perform, where you usually would have skill trees to invest skills to unlock and refine skills that match your play style, this game dose not have this. The equipment you equip gives you skills and abilities that you will use. 
Now this is cool at the start, dont like using a autogun? why not check out an melta gun? How about a chainsword? Or a shield and a grav pistol?  The problem that i ran into is that once i found a set up i liked (Heavy Flamer/Twin Melta), i just stuck to it, and never felt the need to change and this made the game feel a bit boring. I like when games give you skills that you can modify and adjust with your equipment, this can change up your play style and keep things interesting. The only skill points you can use give passive bonuses and while equipement do have some minor effects they just dont feel like it dose enough to keep the game play feeling varied. 
Mission types/Difficulties:
The missions in this game can be pretty standard and very from 'Rescue these people' 'Kill big bad' 'Kill deamon portals' and 'KILL EVERYTHING' (and more). The maps can be very from being open warzone, idustrial building, deamon infested ship. These maps can be big and open, or have small and compact. These missions typically only last 15 min at the most which is nice because it can keep you in and out of the maps. I only found the maps to be frustrating when you are on a large open area and then have to wander the entire map and take out every single baddie on the map. You can modify the difficulty with cards that provide a boost for drops and boosts the enimies. These can be leveled up which boosts their effects. 
Story:
I am new to WarHammer 40k but I found the story really cool. You are an Inquisitor, you are a super spooky who's job it is to kill xenos scum, mutant freaks, and those evil heritics. My only problem with the story is i found that sometimes i felt like it was padding for time by putting annyoing roadblocks to prevent progession. 
'I need to get to _____, ok we need to find ____, who has ____. So to find him we need to kill a bunch of ____, oh no it looks like ____ isnt here, go to ____ to find _____.' (this can get frustrating)
Other things of note:
The loot is pretty cool but drops are not the best unitl you get later in the game. Multiplayer is not the most stable, if you can find anyone to play with. 
Overall:
Combat is pretty solid and satisfying. The equipment puts a spin on abiliaties but can get boring. Story has interesting plot with some pretty cool moments. Pretty good game if you are new to WarHammer 40k.

I started with the Tech Adept, minions, eventually landing on 3 Kastalan robots. This has made it easy to learn the game in a more casual way. 
Information can be difficult to get  in this game, due to the fact that when it first launched it was a totally different game. The wiki and lots of builds were written for that first version. A few tips I found are:
When levelling up tarot cards, when a card gets to 10, don't level it yet. This will cause that particular card to stop dropping. Once you get all cards to 10, keep them there except for the ones you really want to level up. I started with levelling Venom, as it causes more tarot cards to drop. I also unlocked Perseverance, which gives a greater chance for consumables like Meme Virus and Intel. 
Rebus only comes on the weekend, keep that in mind. He first appears at like 8pm EST thursday night, as this is midnight Friday morning UTC. The cortex shards that you trade him for favour drop from Hunt missions, but you can only get 200 per week. 
Challenges come every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Experiment with gear, try out the different things they offer. For example, tech adept can have grenades, mines, a personal forcefield, self-healing, or another minion in his belt / armour slots. I always had minion there, then finally tried some of the other ones out and now I love the forcefield.

I really wanted to like this game. I am a big fan of the Warhammer 40k Lore and universe and like a lot of the fandom I am in an abusive relationship with Games Workshop, the owner of the franchise (I believe they have pretty anti consumer practices, like having a ton of paid for DLC to fleece more money from you in an already expensive game). This game is another good example of that. 

I actually really enjoyed the story. It helps a lot to know about the Warhammer 40k universe because there isn't a lot of hand holding explaining what everything is, which in my opinion is a good thing. Even if you don't know anything you'll figure it out, though you may be confused at times. The story arc and characters are interesting too, and fit well into the universe. (For the uninitiated Warhammer 40k is a grim dark sci-fi fantasy setting that focuses on over the top macho warriors living in a dark, unforgiving universe constantly at war with demons and aliens and evil gods)

The graphics and sound are pretty good, sometimes even outstanding. I did have weird performance issues and visual glitches at times (judging by reviews this is a common problem) but nothing game breaking. Definitely not a point in its favor though because I prefer consistency.

But where it all falls apart is the gameplay. I am a big fan of action RPGs and this game just does not compete with what else is out there (like the ones I mentioned above). Combat feels imprecise and sluggish, which is a huge deal when that is 90% of what you do. Upgrade wise, your abilities are based on your equipment and your skill points are these little incremental boosts (a lot of +5% type stuff). Parts of your skill tree are locked behind achievements. These ideas are not rotten to the core, it could be implemented well, but after only a short time I just did not care about leveling up or grinding for gear. 

I will likely revisit this game in the future, if only to see more of the story, but the gameplay feels like such a slog. it is definitely possible for a game to stand on story alone, but this is not one of them.

The frustrating thing is, its only specific maps which seem to have excessive mist effects or other wildly over the top effects like fully 3d rendered corpse piles with miasma around them. These specific maps are the only problem, and I only encountered maybe 4-5 maps like it in the campaign. But these maps, for me, are almost impossible to play through.

If the developers could somehow improve the performance of the mist effects on lower settings, it would perhaps solve my problems. Also I'm not sure that off screen textures are being properly removed and hidden when turning the camera (particularly those below the floors of the maps), which might also be adding extra strain on performance unnecessarily.

I realise this might only be an issue for people with older computers, but I'm around the minimum specs. I'll still recommend this game, since for the vast majority you'll never see my issues for yourself.

Have you ever played Starcraft and thought ""F*** it, I'll do it all with a hero unit""? 

By all logic, no you haven't but this is what it feels like. This takes you a far step away from what you know about the tabletop and throws you into a Diablo-esque crawler RPG. Instead of selecting multiple squads to wage full scale warfare on your foes you play a single inquisitor be it the wizard-like Psyker, the light yet lethal female assassin, the heavy hitting crusader in power armor, or the recent addition of the Tech-adept using machines and gadgets to take care of your lightwork. In this title, you're searching for a derelict fortress ship that jumped through a space warp on auto-pilot.I'm sure there's more to it than that but I'm thirty hours into it and that's about all I got for you so far. Sound is great with an epic symphonic score well in tune with the setting. Visually overall it may not be a 5 star experience but designs and textures are well thought out and the artistic liberties taken make for much cooler gear than you would see in the tabletop models. You will fight hordes of enemies ranging from single hit fodder like nurglings to nightmarish heavy units that no space marine should take on alone like predators and hell brutes. Don't know what a hell brute is? don't worry, you'll know it when you see it. Thankfully this title is balanced enough to get through it if you pace yourself and persevere. In lieu of that perseverance is cover. Though built like a dungeon crawler, you can utilize nearby cover for tactical firefights. This doesn't give you 100% protection but will at least give you some breathing room. Co-op is also an option if you need a friend to help you run-and-gun, or sword-and-board, or gun-and-board? Needless to say there are plenty of options. Don't fret if it looks limiting at first because these options open up as you go. Keyboard controls are what you would expect of a game like this. Point and click with a handful of skills and two weapon sets to switch between on the fly. This game does have controller support and is surprisingly good. layouts for the controller are unfortunately predetermined in a list but are dynamic enough that there should be a viable option for your preference. Using a controller actually gives you a more fluid gameplay experience but I feel the keyboard and mouse gives you more accuracy. Don't be biased and try them both and see which is a better fit. So in the end the narrative might not be AAA story building but I say pick this one up if you want an interstellar change of pace.",1596834737,1596834737,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

If you're avid fan of warhammer and a bit interested in arpg it's a solid buy. Game itself has good and bad things so lemme list that.

+Ambiance, you can feel the grim-dark warhammer 40k for sure. It feels like a 40k game. 
+Story and character, you're an inquisitor. Feared and awed by many, by your commands planets can fall. Heretics and allies will tremble by your presence alone. No one is safe beside emperor himself from your whims. Both story and dialogues are giving the vibe quite well.
+Skills and character progress, there are tons of passive skills that you can shape your character. With weapon skills and psalm codes combinations and even your healing potion you can customize, you can synergy many things and create something unique, different and refreshing for yourself. 

Now there are huge negatives too.
-Combat is the real ace of arpgs. If you get a good feeling of hit, combo and carnage you can enjoy more and play more. Diablo series are perfect example for that. Content wise they're severely lacking (d3 at least) but you can still go and play nearly identical seasons because of your urge of slaying something. At Martyr i didn't get that feeling. I played both melee and ranged and it feels mediocre, especially melee combat was hideous time to time. 
-End-game content, there are many end game content such as warzones, unique dlc missions , crusades etc. But it's all feels same. Only crusades are a bit unique because of it's high risk and reward mechanic that's all. 
-Optimization, if you're in DLC mission basically an arena where you constantly slay hordes of enemies your computer will get bloated eventually. It's insane to think how they didn't fix this crash issues yet. I mean, you're selling a DLC which people spent hours to farm score and item but get nothing because it will crash eventually. This was the main reason why i stop playing. And funny thing is i got a high rig.
-Because of this lack of combat feeling, end-game content and such lvling became more and more tedious. I saw their new addition ""season""s and try to open up a new seasonal character but couldn't pass lvl 10. Keep in mind, i grinded maybe fifty seasonal character both of Diablo3 and PoE.

Now after having bought and played it a little, I wouldn't even recommend to 40k Fans. The reason is that this game basically only delivers in terms of quantity, not really quality.

The graphics and audio is not bad, but the gameplay, level design and character progression is below average:
The game is not really open world, it simply randomly generates larger maps with the same palette but it really all looks the same.
The AI of enemies is really ridiculous and you're basically just slaughtering wave after wave, while your character is completely overpowered from the start(!)

The character progression doesn't generate any real motivation or sense of much progress, as the improvements in skills happen at a 1-2 % level at a time which is barely perceivable during gameplay.
More than your character the loot is important and the game just dumps a shitload of random items on you, which only differ in color and number. Having to sort and deal with all the crap/selling useless items is really tedious.
The UI and information design in general is particularly poor, in the beginning it took me much longer than in other games to get along/find what I was looking for/understand what what means (one example of this is the icons that reflect the 4 different attack modes your weapon can have. They pretty much all look the same. In the end it's like you have to try out each attack several times and memorize the button because you really cant tell by the icon what it is supposed to mean/the difference from one to the other...)

Final negative point, which was pretty big for me:
The ""story driven single player campaign"" is a joke. Its basically just like normal, randomly generated missions tied to each other, with boring, flat characters, no sense of excitement/suspense/any compelling story element whatsoever. Just like a lot else in the game, it feels like a passionless mass product.

I found this game to be really entertaining and it has a solid 40+ hours of gameplay in it, or as much as you deem your service to the Emperor to be. It is a grimmer and darker Diablo without the open-endedness as every mission is about 10-30 minutes. There is a story-driven campaign, random missions, intel-missions (harder randoms) and in the endgame you can embark on a mighty crusades, which have a mission tree to slaughter through! Truly the work for the Emperor never ends. The missions are pretty simple in structure, nothing that enough violence couldn't solve.

Enemies of the Imperium are multitude and you will be fighting against foul xenos, thrice-cursed Archenemy, and plethora of heresy and desertion. I promise you, you are going to fight waist-deep in guts and blood, cutting your path through flesh and bone. But no greenskins.

As any Diablo or Diablo-like games, you choose a class. I have been playing only with my very first selection, but it's combat style suits my gameplay well. And by the Emperor, does the gameplay immerse me completely! I have found myself standing firmly in a room full of hostiles with my tank-inquisitor, leveled my heavy bolter and delivered death to the enemies of the Imperium of Man, chanting [i]""Emperor protects!""[/i] while the enemy is shooting at me, only them to die a gruesome death me saying [i]""price for heresy is death!""[/i]. Also most common chants are [i]""burn, heretic!"", ""die xeno scum!""[/i] and [i]""in the name of the Emperor!""[/i]. So yeah, this game is for me.

If you like Diablo and Grim Dawn and other games like that, you probably like this game as well. If you are also a 40K fan, then you will love it as I have. Of course this game has its downs also, like the content of the endgame becomes repetitive and inflation in the equipment department. But those are problems all these kind of games have. For me, it is the world that matters most.

Earlier levels aren't that an issue but once hitting level 60 and above the real challenge start and constant craft and modifying gears its difficult as requirements scales and it gets a lot more costly.

I really like the Warhammer 40k universe and style and i am a huge coop fan, so naturally a warhammer RPG that has a coop mode should be a must buy. The problem is, that i actually never had the chance to expierence the Coop mode because its completley bugged for me and my freind.

The game itself is quiet good, although i had the constant feeling that it lacked a lot of polish. Some of the sound effects sound cheap and the feedback on hits ist not that great. The localisation is very cheap. Only text is beeing translated, but even google translate would have done a better job at translating the interface than the devs.

Those minor issues are of course nothing compared to the fact, that the coop just would not work at all.

You are supposed to be able to invite freinds to your party, after you finished a few tutorial like missions. After that you can roam around the bridge of your ship where you can buy and sell stuff, and from there you should be able to invite freinds to your game. At first, i did not even had the option to invite my freind. then after we tried the public search for a random coop match we booth were able to get random players to join our game but we stil could not play together.

There are alot of reviews out there stating all kinds of different problems with the coop, but no matter what we tried we just could not make ist work.

I did not think I was going to like this game as much as I do, but the 2.0 update certainly seems way better than the original version based on comparison videos that I have seen.

I would like to note that sometimes there are server issues regarding loot, disconnection, and lag, this seems to be more prominent on the weekends and is intermittent, I say this connected via fiber optic on a 500/500 connection that is wired directly to the modem/router combo via a CAT 6E cable which is connected to the 1GB port of the modem/router (overkill, yes I know).

Now that we have that out of the way lets get into the scoring, all of my ratings are done on a 0 - 10 scale, with 10 being the highest possible. Each category is added up and then averaged for the final score. To score a 10 it must be a 10/10 in every category.



Concept - 9/10; This is a pretty solid ARPG set in 40K, its not really like Diablo, it has its own unique identity for sure and I think they did a pretty good job of giving it a unique look and feek.

Graphics - 8.5/10; This is a solid looker, I have seen better but this is no slouch and the gore is fantastic.

Audio - 8/10; I am knocking a few points off in this for the rather bland and reused sounds for the weapons, it could be better and more diverse. The soundtrack though its nice, they clearly watched ""The Lord Inquisitor"" on YouTube.

Gameplay - 8.5/10; With the 2.0 update, based on YouTube comparison videos of before and after its now pretty good. In its original state I would have given it a 6/10, so its a marked improvement. Some things still feel clunky and unrefined and some builds are just not all that great compared to others, but its doing things right and they are headed in the right direction with the title.

Optimization - 8/10; knocking an extra point off of this for the server issues, otherwise would be a 9/10. I am playing this on a Ryzen 7 3800X and a GTX 1070Ti and I get 60FPS (locked in game) with maximum settings even in heavy combat. However lower end systems may struggle with this title and most games could always use a little more polish in the optimization area.

Overall - 8.5, things in this game come together well, and its unmistakably 40K Grim Dark, but not lighthearted, its true grim dark. This does not take current price into consideration, just how well all of the previous categories work together in the game as a whole, and this game does it well, I have seen MUCH WORSE.



Final Verdict: 8/10 
Recommended - This game has some faults/issues but it's a solid buy, you will not regret purchasing this game, I endorse this game.

So I only started to play this game because I was bored and a friend was playing so I will not comment too much on the leveling part since I just got boosted from 1-90 but i will comment on the campaign.

Campaign:
I've never really played any 40k stuff so much of it was new to me and I don't care about lore so it was an okay experience. I didn't like that I *HAD* to complete the campaign to even be able to play later in the game, I'd love if it was optional so alt leveling isn't that tedious.

Good:
- Entertaining gameplay
- Fast pace
- Loads of customization with items, passives etc
- A lot of different content that you can switch between to not get bored of one thing (this would be even better if the maps and objectives were more randomized tho)
I'd say an overall enjoyable game, but I suggest buying it on sale and not at full price.
- You can buy DLC content with farmable ingame currency (does not work with the expansion though)
- Flashy abilities that feel good to use (if it's not lagging)


Now to the bad, and some things are really bad..
- Co-op experience is a pure nightmare.. It lags so bad that you can be sent back several small dashes back and sometimes you just get ported back to an old spot. The servers are horrendously bad and this is one of the reasons i'm not giving this game my recommendation. This also happens when playing solo which is just bad.

- Some endgame content isn't playable in co-op. Now there are some stuff you can do co-op but it's limited to what's called ""random missions"" and you do not farm that for gear. The *real* endgame content which is actually pretty hard unless you got the gear is not playable co-op. I can't even find a statement from the developers if this is going to be possible at all.

- You are basically forced to play seasonal if you want some kind of relevant build help or you will only find builds that have legacy items that are not obtainable anymore. This is just bad design in my eyes, if you change a system because it wasn't good. Don't make the new system worse so that the old systems items still are better than the new ones.. Or make sure the legacy items are removed/disabled.

- Leveling takes way to long, after you reach level 60 it's basically going take you a solid 2 weeks unless you get boosted to reach max level. If you have previous experience with the game it wont take as long but it still takes too long.

To summarize:
Overall decently good game, it has loads of content and build possibilities. Items have decent enough diversity. You are very free to do what you want with your character. But as stated it has some major flaws when it comes to enjoyment of the game for co-op. They need to add more servers or make the co-op experience peer 2 peer (like every other co-op arpg does) but I'm guessing they have some major coding problems to deal with if they want to accomplish that.

What it does do well though, is 40k.  With a single caveat which I'll come back to.  This game is visually rich, and makes you feel very much like you've dropped into Games Workshop's very special vision of hell for our future.  The combat is mostly satisfying, and especially so if you pick up a hammer and start bashing skulls in.

The big caveat for 40k is the suspension of disbelief around the main character.  Those with any knowledge know that humans, even trained and armed humans, don't get around beating up on Space Marines, let alone the bigger badder nasties the grim dark has to offer up.  And you'll do a lot of this.  Every time I brain a space marine like he was last week's cardboard box left in the rain I cringe a little inside.

I actually liked a lot of things, mostly the visuals, atmosphere, voice acting and overall design. I also thought the writing was good even if the story ends up being a little underwhelming, clearly a lot of research went into the lore and immersion. But let's face it : if the game didn't have the 40k license I wouldn't have touched it with a 10ft pole.

It's clunky, unpolished, stiff, glitchy as hell (even the dialogs are glitched sometimes) and SLOW. Man the progression feels slow and unrewarding, only the story missions give any sort of decent XP every other missions (the one with limited respawns that you can do solo or with other people) give very little XP in addition of becoming quickly repetitive and stale.

I also don't like the way you progress through gear, the whole power rating thing is garbage, some weapon types/affixes are vastly superior to power rating but if you want to keep progressing you have to dump them for inferior weapon types with higher power. It's just like Destiny 2 where you have to play with your highest ilvl weapon if you want to have the best loot table, regardless of how much you hate that specific weapon. 

Long story short, I thought the ""action-RPG"" part of the game (story missions and side quests) was decent, but everything else, including the middle to long-term ""diablo-like"" progression through gear and build, is badly done, even if there's supposedly a fair amount of variety and possible builds you can go for.

[Edit] After giving this game another try I can say that it's improved considerably. The new tech-adept class from the Prophecy add-on is great fun, the Prophecy campaign's story is nice, the progression feels good in both XP and gear, there's a decent variety of endgame content to go for (warzone progression, void crusades, special missions high scores, etc...), the gameplay is finally decent (even if it's still a little clunky) and even the crafting feels good.

Granted the game still revolves around farming the same 30 something map styles with a dozen types of missions and about as many different enemy factions but it's not much worse than diablo 3 in that regard.

I feel like the game + addon is worth its price now.",1529369475,1594735616,True,0,0,0.578097283840179443,0,True,False,False

I'm giving it a thumbs down, but it was a pretty near-run thing as it has the makings of a good game but there are just enough problems with it that I nearly gave it a thumbs down.

First, the good ; As ARPG's go, this one is middling. Everything works, but nothing *feels* quite tight enough. It's slower paced (which I feel suits the source material) and the music and aesthetics are absolutely awesome! They have totally nailed the W40K vibe. In addition, the mechanical side of character customisation is great and they have a fantastic (imo) if ultra-grindy gear crafting system.

Now the bad... There is no endgame to speak of. At all. Once you've played the game for about 5 hours, you've probably seen the entire gameplay loop. You will be bored to death of the same missions, maps and enemies *long* before you get anywhere NEAR mid-levels.

In addition, while mechanical character customisation is awesome, aesthetic customisation is basically non-existant. For the Crusader and Psyker this is not a substantial problem, but the assassin has a floor-length pony-tail that is thicker than my THIGH! It's *horrible* and there's absolutely no way to get rid of it. Oh, and the tech-priest charges around on this little disk that's held up off the floor by some spider legs. Now... I could cope with a legless tech-priest that hovered. I could cope with a legless tech-priest sitting on a spider-legged chassis. But just *standing* on a disk? That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and no logic-worshipping scion of the Omnissiah would be caught dead doing it and again, there's nothing you can do about it!

In addition to the above, there's bugs *every*where. None of them are game-breaking in any way, but because the game documentation is rubbish, you can never tell whether some issue is a bug, intended design, or what. That extends to whether stuff is working or not... because there's so little information, you can slap an enhancement on your weapon, and never know whether it's working or not!

As if that weren't enough, since much of ARPG endgame is gear-grind, even if you're OK with the massive limits on missions, and grinding boring, repetitive stuff over and over... it's still pointless. Because the gear-crafting system lets you create a *perfect* piece of gear, at basically the same power level as you could find. Once you hit max level, if you've saved up your resources, you can basically straight up *create* a full loadout of god-tier items. What the ♥♥♥♥ do you do then? While there is a *infinitesimally tiny* possibility that a gear improvement might drop, you can already solo the hardest stuff in the game. What's the point?

Finally, the past few months (as of writing) they've been having constant server issues, resulting in massive game lag, connection drops and increasingly regular periods of ""get stuffed, no login for you!"" which is just not acceptable.

And at last we come to the more minor issues : Some of the achievements are broken, some of the ingame items and systems are broken, some of the localisation is wrong (which is fine for a once-off speech, but for a gameplay staple that'll play several times a mission it gets bloody annoying REAL quick).

And for my favourite *hated* item - poor communication. The devs are great people and super-responsive to the community... right up until they aren't. I reported a bug in January 2020. They said there wasn't one. I showed them how it was broken. They said they'd fix it. Then nothing... for months. Even when I specifically contacted support, they were like ""we're working on it."" Then they fixed it. Except the fix didn't work. Then they fixed it again, except the fix STILL didn't work. And so on.

Over all, so long as the game's running fine for you, and you don't mind the problems I've mentioned above, this is an OK purchase to while away a few hours in the W40K universe. This is, however, in *absolutely no way at all* anything near the quality and scope of Diablo / Path of Exile etc. If you're unsure about the stuff above, it might be worth waiting for a sale.",1579343179,1594727869,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are occasional problems, but the devs respond quite quickly if you post in the official forums. The crafting is cool, too. The devs seem committed to updates, as shown with the recent introduction of seasons (like leagues in PoE).

If you're into playing this co-op, the downside is that one of the big endgame options, void crusades, cannot be playing with other players. I believe that everything else can be done co-op. The other downside is that much of the info outside of game tends to be outdated (which isn't a problem with the game itself, but it does have an impact). Make sure to look for stuff after patch 2.0 when searching, as the game changed quite a bit at that point. The standalone xpac Prophecy also adds more story, as well as an additional class.

It started with about 7 hours of play over a couple days that went pretty well, as in no technical issues at the time. The gameplay, is meh. Combat is a bit clunky, I ended up switching to WASD controls and turning off click to move because it was just constantly refusing to register my clicks correctly otherwise. Some of the guns have very short range, but this is not visually represented at all, it will happily allow you to shoot them at stuff on the other side of the screen it just doesn't do any damage if it is outside of their range. Combat just doesn't feel good.

Classes are gender locked and there's only one female class, I knew this going into it and is partially why I'm reviewing this so late (I was waiting for a deep sale to buy). I'm not actually sure what if anything this means though, the passive ""trees"" are all generic and I think shared between characters, and ""skills"" are tied to equipment. Each weapon has 4 different attacks, some weapons are probably class restricted, like I didn't see any power saws on my assassin, but most of the weapons seemed pretty generic and like I'd be surprised if the other classes couldn't use Bolters for example. My idea going into it was to play 3 assassins, one for each starting spec, but the starting spec appears to just be choosing which armor you start with and you very quickly get all three (speaking of, armor has a skill on it, there seemed to be three for assassin, I found none of them particularly useful, they were just utility, though the one that created two clones that don't do damage may have been useful as a distraction for enemies). I didn't see much character building in the time I played, it seems in the end you are simply looking for a set of mods to get on your gear rather than making any sort defining changes to your character.

The story, I don't know. It might be appreciated more by big Warhammer 40k fans, I know none of the lore or anything though so it mostly like, ""Sure, that's a lot of words I don't recognize, but whatever."" The assassin VA was pretty bad and made it a bit more difficult to try and pay attention to what was going on.

Stopping there I probably would not have left a review, or I might have given it a thumbs up with the caveat of only buying it when the complete collection is like $25, which is around where the sales are hitting these days. Except the true issue with this game reared its monstrous head during my attempt to play and is the reason I am giving it a thumbs down. So this is not a newly released game, it came out over 2 years ago, so I was highly surprised to find that within a couple days of starting to play it the forums were filling up with complaints about people crashing and having their entire stash deleted. This really killed any motivation I had to continue. You see the game is online only, and fixing issues like this isn't as simple as restoring a backup, because nothing is on your PC. It got worse though, the next two days the game was completely unplayable due to server issues, many people couldn't even connect, many that could found they would lose all their items and progress after every mission, fun stuff like that. Of course nobody on the dev team is working on weekends when this happened, to keep their always online service running smoothly, which is obviously unacceptable.

1. If you dont like point and click, theres options to turn it off and you can change your controls easily, I changed movement to WASD instead of arrow keys but i still use middle mouse to rotate the screen and i kept everything else the same tbh. 
2. Controls are so easy to cuztimize its reason enough for me to like the game.
3. (Ik im only 10hrs in) but theres so much to do in the game but not in the slightest overwhelming. By this i mean you can just jump in and run around doing what you want, weather it be follow the main campaign or just explore and do what you wish.
4. Theres ALOT of cuztimization but its all neat n tidy together. 
5. even though i was a BIG fan of Deathwing and Space marine (simply because they were not RTS's) and i have a huge love for Dark Crusade and DOW1 Martyr is by far my favorite 40k experiance. 
6. Its warhammer 40k
7. Best voice acting and humour i've seen in a 40k game.

I'll end it on 7, always a good number.

If you liked the mechanics and storytelling of the Van Helsing games, you've always wanted to be one of the religious fanatics in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and you don't need giant enemy rushes to get your ARPG kicks, this is your game. If those things don't apply, this is a game you'll likely enjoy, at most, in small servings.

Fuller review:

I'd held off on this game because of the price tag -- for an ARPG, the standard full retail price is too rich -- and because the reviews I saw were generally mixed at best. I'm glad I waited for a sale, but not glad I waited for the one in which I bought this, because I waited too long.

ARPGs broadly exist in two categories: Ones with interesting characters and stories, and ones with lots of bang-and-boom-room-clearing-giant-foozle. There are some that elide the difference, some that balance the two, but as a rule, those are your options. This is one of the former.

Let's get the negatives out of the way first. Because of the nature of the game by mechanic and by story, you're fighting in intensely discrete set-pieces, which limits your ultimate range of movement and your ability to do enemy horde control. Your class and weapon choices matter, especially once you get going, but not quite as much as would be ideal -- tank-like characters don't have much more staying power or less mobility than wizard- or rogue-types. Melee combat is available to ranged characters and ranged combat is available to melee characters; while each class has noticeable advantages, you're not set for min-maxing unless you want it and try really hard. 

Positives: Good story, good-to-very-good voice acting, solid game mechanics, fun Warhammer-like powers and weapons, and some minor canonical blips -- a lightly-armo(u)red Inquisitor singlehandedly taking on an Aeldari light titan or horde of Chaos champion d(a)emons (what's next, beating up a D(a)emon Primarch?) strains credulity -- notwithstanding, you get a great sense of the weird, grimdark, darkgrim, depressing and at times cheesy Warhammer 40K universe from an angle that controlling the human tank of a Space Marine never gives you. The tower defense mechanic Neocore adopted for the Van Helsing games works well here, too, and isn't as shoehorned as the Van Helsing variant was.

The other thing Neocore does very well is give you characters to like or hate or love or some weird amalgam of the two. If you play Warhammer 40k video games without any regard to enjoying the physical and human scenery, you're doing it wrong, and this game won't be quite so appealing.

A key to enjoying this game is a good rule for most entertainment: Consume what you like, reach out a bit every so often, and take a product on its own terms. This is a game about strategically husbanding resources and leaning into one's character build to deal with enemies in constrained maps, with the understanding that if you're on top of your game, you can run away and live to fight another day, or bust through the enemy line and achieve a defensible or offensive position, or whatever. If you're doing this right, you won't end up on a bridge setting off pyrotechnics and spamming your healing potion/injection/whatever. You'll wear down your enemies, strike at weak points, and win by tactical awareness and good planning.

Anyway, on sale, a heck of a buy. At full price? I haven't bought an ARPG at full price since I got the preordered Collector's Edition of Diablo II, and I live an emotionally rich and rewarding life. Make of that what you will.",1594541333,1594541333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe it is because I have not been here from the start, but I am not seeing any of the issues others are seeing. I like the looks of the maps, from deserted monastaries, city ruins, space stations, and large planets, there is a lot of detail going on the the background. My favorite planets to look at are the ice planets. Seeing tanks frozen under the ice, to fighters crash landed on what little bit of land is present on the tundra, I really enjoy exploring those maps to the fullest.

The weapons are truly fun. I enjoy turning my enemies to slag using the multimelta, and watching their brethren burn on their corpse is truly fun. I also enjoy dropping a minefield on top of a group of enemies, just to hit them with an airburst grenade a second later and watch them all go down. There are laser guns for snipers, and melee weapons and shields for those who like to get in close, I just haven't had a chance to use them yet.

I put in about 5 hours on my first character, leveling up to 15, before deciding to try another one. I think anyone who has under 3 hours of game time has maybe completed the tutorial and the first few missions. In my opinion (for what it is worth) that isn't even enough time to get a feel for the character, let alone the game.

Inquisitor-Martyr has similarities to Diablo 3. But, I do not believe it is trying to be just a clone. The cover mechanic certainly adds a new element to this style of game. Especially when you pair it with buffs from the skill trees. It is a small mechanic, but makes the game feel a lot different. The multi-mob AI is actually fun to watch as well. When you turn a group of enemies into slag, burning on the ground, the AI will actually try to walk around it if possible. Some will even sit on the edge and try to avoid the damage. They don't just mindlessly run to their death, at least, not all of them.

There are some bugs in this game, sometimes it seems like if I am hitting the fire button, along with an attack, my character will get stuck trying to auto walk. I am not sure if this is an intentional feature or not. But, it can be irritating.

Otherwise, I have also been enjoying the campaign as well. I want to keep playing to see where the story is going. I also very much like the voice acting. I've just had to switch out my ""BURN IN THE LIGHT!"" to ""BURN, HERETIC!"" Which is just as enjoyable.

I picked this game up during the sale. Another downside is how much of this game is paid DLC. I think a lot of it could've been free updates. But, I am sure GW needed their cut. Its worth it on sale. Up to you on the full price. That being said, I also never paid full price for D3. Picked it up when on sale as well. So, I don't think anyone needs to rush out and purchase this. But, its worth considering if it is included in the next Steam sale. 

I may post another update once I hit 60 hours and have had time to get into the endgame. But, at midgame, there is still plenty to do and I have not gotten bored yet.",1594386893,1594386893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I feel like that due to the unique approach this game offers compared to other ARPG's it will put off some people.  I wish I had more space to explain everything within the game but unfortunately it must be concise. In summary this is a good game that fleshes out the Warhammer 40K universe and focuses more on popcorn-sessions and ""tactical"" game play and is worth getting for the single player experience.  Another safe bet is that the developers are still working on this game and have been regularly updating it for awhile so if you're looking for longevity you can rely on that.

     I will start by saying that at the time of this review I put in 88 hours with ~10 of that being DLC and that's all on my first character plus I'm not even close to being finished with him.  I also play this game a single player only and will unlikely play this game co-op.  I find this game to be very much enjoyable.  The music, atmosphere in the art direction are great.  Despite having a budget gaming PC this game runs well at lower graphics settings and only a handful of times have I experienced frame rate drops.  The voice acting is good although it's corny and cheesy to a high extent.  It feels like the game doesn't take itself seriously but I say that as a compliment.  A lot of it brings to mind Dawn of War and the dialogue in that game.  This game also does have a fair amount of bugs but from my experience they have all been minor and most of them have only occurred a few times, save for a glitch where the music stops mid-level.  Otherwise I've yet to experience anything game breaking and I have never had any issues connecting to the Neocore servers (this game requires you to be online even while playing single player so consider that before purchasing this game).

     The game play loop can get repetitive but there's enough variation to keep you interested as well, unfortunately you won't see much enemy variety within the base main campaign but it's fleshed out with side quests, the expansion and endgame content.  I do believe that one thing that will prop up your enjoyment of the game is whether if you enjoy the Warhammer 40K universe or not. If you're just an average ARPG fan and don't care much about this universe than you may not find this game fun since Warhammer 40K games tend to have a lot of things in common like a bigger focus on tactical game play, slower pace and heavy reliance on industrial settings which is present here.  If you're looking for an eternal grind then this won't be your game but if you want a game that focuses on the above that is also good for ""popcorn-sessions"" then this is worth checking out.  

     When it comes to the mechanics that makes this game more technically inclined it comes down to the suppression system, cover system, slower pace and the gunplay.  Your character and the stronger enemies have a suppression meter which protects you from crowd control based on how full it is.  It's a game to figure out if you should try to go for raw damage or crowd control first.  You can also try to use utilize cover and your enemies will to.  You can also ignore it or destroy it.  With the gunplay the skills are tied to your weapons and equipment.  Your skills aren't just damage dealers but some have crowd control abilities, do extra damage to suppression, and other things.  Depending on the difficulty of the mission the tactics may become handy or outright ignored. You can also carry two weapon sets at a time to use on a mission. I find this (being able to effectively change your skill set) to be a good thing because you can experiment and adapt as needed.  It's also easy to swap out a lot of your passive abilities as well.  

     There are enemies types from various different xenos races, multiple factions of chaos, rebel guardsmen and mutants.  There's also plenty of aesthetic tiles sets while most of it is industrial there are some outdoor environments which aren't.  Missions are shorter taking 5 to 30 minutes to complete depending on the objective and difficulty.  There are 6 to 8 unique mission objectives types with a couple dozen variants of those.  A lot of these you'll not encounter in random assignments or missions.  Missions can be random but the maps and they are played on are not, instead there is a decent pool of maps that are selected from for random assignments and missions.

     The main campaign with the side quest lines will take you roughly 50 to 60 hours to complete, this also including the expansion's campaign line.  The endgame contents will easily double that.  They are random assignments, intel missions, void crusades and the warzone.  There are also a few non-DLC repeatable missions.  Random assignments arm and randomly generated mini quest lines.  These get repetitive as there isn't much variety in the missions.  Intel missions are random missions that automatically spawn with difficulty modifiers.  The warzone is a linear and game campaign which progresses by selecting from a pool of 100 predetermined missions and is co-op.  The latter two deal with risk/reward mechanics to keep you interested.

     Void crusades are pre-made single player campaigns which have 20-30 missions and are not linear and have multiple endings save for one exception and these are obviously the mainstay for the endgame.  There also covert missions and hidden missions to unlock.  These take 1-6 hours to complete depending on how much of a completionist you are plus these are meant to be replayed.  These also have exclusive mission variants.  As of this review there are currently seven crusades and the developers and more regularly.

     DLC seems to be a high contention.  Ignoring the cosmetic items collectively I think they're all decent enough but nothing special.  I was suggests waiting until you complete the game before you buy any of them.  If you are going to use real world money I would suggest waiting for a sale and they're still worth checking out if you like the game or you can use in game currency to unlock the DLC.  The priority mission assignments take 30-60 minutes each and their narratives are decent enough.  ""Forgotten Arsenal"" can be ignored you're not missing anything while "" Maelstrom of Carnage"" and ""City of Suffering"" are worth checking out because they introduce new game modes but they're both different spins on time attack.  Basically, kill as much as you can in a time limit.  Both DLC had different timer mechanics.  These two are worth getting.

     There is enough content to keep you satisfied for dozens of hours and I see myself playing this game regularly for some time to come.  Even if you only create one character, finish all the quest lines and won't touch any endgame content there will be enough here to justify getting on sale.  If you do play more than that there's potentially hundreds of hours worth of game play depending on how many characters you make and how much time you spend in the end game.  

     Personally I'd not a huge a ARPG fan (but I have played Diablo 1, 2 and 3 along with PoE) I don't care much about end game grind once all the unique things to do are exhausted but I find there's enough content here to keep me satisfied.  If you are iffy about the game I would suggest getting on sale in trying out for a couple hours.  If the first two hours don't entice you then chances are nothing in this game really will as it is a repetitive game as are all ARPG's.  If what I have described interest you that I would suggest buying it.

I'll end by saying this isn't just a good WH40K, but a great one, despite lacking some polish.",1594351456,1594352111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most maps are nice to look at with tons of detail in the textures or props that are strewn about. The attention to detail is unfortunately contrasted by the fact that most maps are relatively small and are all essentially just a layout of corridors and box shaped arenas (yes, even the ones that don't take place on ships). This might not irk some people but it should still be mentioned.

I think the worst offenders are that loot variety (or lack thereof) and the game requiring a constant internet connection. Be prepared to use the same 3 or so weapons and look basically the same all the way through the game. Weapons and armor come with alternate abilities such as a different firing mode for a gun or a different ability for your character. These can dictate how you play your character but lack any of the flavor of set bonuses and the like that is much more prevalent in other games of this nature. The most interesting stat on anything seems to be loot find and loot quality, which strangely enough appears to actually do something in this ARPG. Too bad everything you get is basically just the same thing with rerolled stats and nothing to make anything seem special or fun.

I love games like this and I love Warhammer 40k but this is one of those games that is probably only for fans.

Otherwise the game still lacks a lot of polish and details that Diablo 3 has (for example, when you equip a item on a already occupied socket the item from the socket will move on the first free slot in the inventory instead of replacing the items that was equipped. And thats a big deal because if you have a item in the 3rd tab that you want to equip the already equiped item it will move into the 1st tab.... Other detail problem is the way the enemy units are displayed in the UI, you have to read a text to know which unit is a champion or a boss or a target, the enemy UI for all the units looks exactly the same, except that some have a armor bar). Other missed details... this is the only game or app or anything that has a map that doesnt show north... I mean, a map is totally useless if you dont know where north is, this game has 2 maps and none shows north, it's something unique. The game has some gitches when you move, the text label for the items on the ground just jumps all over the map. Also when you change the direction for the character instead of a smooth turning animation the character just teleports in direction you've chose. 



You have to grind A LOT, i mean, you cant even advanced on the campaign without grinding and grinding and grinding and...

The controls were made for the consoles, you cant even press on a skill button on the skill bar, you have to use the keyboard. You have only 4 skills that you will use frequently (and another 4 if you switch weapon but usually switching the weapons is not necessarily).

The weapons are quite varied, each weapon will change the skills on the skill bar, it is ok but if you find a level 15 weapon but you like the skills from the level 1 weapon you will have to decide what to do, make 1dps or get bored by playing with the more powerful weapon that is boring to play with. But what i hate the most is the fact that if you change to the secondary weapon you will get a timer for some of the skills. I mean, shouldn't get a timer for switching between weapons and not a timer for the skills after you have switched the weapon? this timer breaks the dynamics of the game, you cant just switch to the 2nd weapon and unleash hell, you have to switch to the 2nd weapon, wait... wait a bit more... and still wait AND THAN...... wait, the enemy is out of the range, you just had to run while waiting so you wont die a painful death....... I have never ever saw a game where you have to wait after you switch to the 2nd weapon, imagine you have to wait to use the ***pistol*** on ***Counter-Strike*** (chose any game you want where you can change the weapon... ANY!!!).

Another problem with switching weapons is the animation, you dont have a animation to turn the character around but you have one for switching weapons... and DAMN, is awkward because the weapons will not switch instantly, you have to wait........... it makes the entire gameplay feel unresponsive, i had to press like 4 times for the weapons to switch and than i could not make it stop, the weapon was switching on it's own.

The landscapes are very detailed and very diverse, you get to do the same thing on all kinds of plants, space ships, space platforms, hell, snow and so on. The level design is not great, you can hide behind some kind of boxes and barrels, the problem is that usually the boxes and barrels are usually surrounded by mobs so are mostly useless. Sometime you can aim behind the barrel (with some skills) and sometimes the enemy can aim behind a barrel making the hide and shoot tactics very inconsistent (but still i am glad that i can do it, is quite cool). The main problem with this hiding system is that you can not hide behind the most obvious spot, behind corners. In every game since Thief The Dark Project or Metal Gear Solid the corner was the main hiding place.... not on this game... probably the developer wanted to be original (lol). Not to mention that when you are in cover mode the weapon wont shoot as fast as before. It will ruin your DPS, why?!


The voice acting, sound and music are good, also the videos, not very exciting but quite mysterious. The story is interesting but hard to access, you have to work your way to the next campaign mission, you dont just get to play it as you would expect.

Another thing that i like is that you dont get tones of lame items as on Diablo 3, you get less drop and better.

The performance is quite good, the FPS is great and the v-sync gets the job done, it sucks that i have to restart the game each time i change some of the video setting, if you want to find the perfect balance between performance and visuals that will slower your task a lot. Anyway, with great FPS the game still feels slow because of the glitches that i have mentioned earlier.

I have played 1 mission on coop. I could not find any setting to chose what mission to play, i think it is random, i hope it is not just the same mission over and over again :D. On level 8 (a level where the player pool should be quite low) i have to wait ~3 minutes to begin, which is quite ok.

I (hope i) still got a lot of content to discover but the game breaking bugs and lack of continuity for the story mode quite ruined for me for the moment, also the cooldown for the weapon switch. It worth the price if you buy it on sale and you are a Warhammer 40k fan. The game still receives some patches so it could change for the better. The world is big and detailed, the art is very good but the gameplay feels lazy, is like the developer didnt wanted to go the extra mile to make it great, probably they saw no financial value in that.

If you're a fan of the franchise, it's a worthy 45h+ product (with the expansion) where you get to play as an Inquisitor on an epic mission.
If you're not that familiar with 40K, it's a decent Diablo/Van Helsing clone, a recommended buy if on sale.

GOOD:
- Great main story, worthy of the 40K universe, and even featuring some canon characters.
- Spoken dialogues, with above average voice acting on most characters. 
- Decent gameplay with loads of weapons and different playstyles (*but more on this below).
- Lots of side content to keep you engaged beyond the main story.
- Graphics and sound are serviceable, with armours doing justice to the fantastic 40K models, and weapons sounding good and distinctive for the most part. 
- Game still receives healthy updates (as of review), and even features seasons, with dedicated buffs and rewards.
- Relatively bug-free (**with one catastrophic exception, see below).

BAD:
- While there are quite a lot of tools available for customizing your character's playstyle, descriptions and explanations are scarce, so you'll have to do a lot of online reading if you want to have a better understanding of what's what. There is some community on Steam and Reddit, but most of the recommended builds are done for end-game, and they are more difficult to translate during your levelling-up.
- Going up in levels makes the game slower and grindier, even though most of what you're doing stays the same. For reference, I finished the campaign at level 65 (out of a maximum 100) and I lost all interest to play soon after, because I was doing more of the same, but now it took longer.
- *Even though the game is quite rich in build options, changing builds is cumbersome, expensive and time-consuming.  This means that, other than occasionally switching some weapons, you'll mostly stick to one build for the most of the playthrough. Which usually means using the same 1 or 2 buttons 80% of the time. 
- **The game has an 'always online' component, which can - and does - fail spectacularly. The most notable issue is that sometimes, right as you FINISH a mission and you press the button to return to base, the game gets stuck after your character leaves the area, but before the loading screen. This leave you helpless, staring at screen that you can rotate and zoom, but with no character or UI. The only way out is an Alt+F4, and that automatically erases all your progress in the mission (and any drops you may have gained through it - which will not be the same when you play again). The issue seems to exist based on the quality of your connection, so you won't know until you buy the game and play it.",1594008188,1594008188,True,6,0,0.573837816715240479,0,True,False,False

    [*]Some of the best depictions of WH40K in a videogame (at least up to par to the DoW games). All the grimdark you can handle.
    [*]Related to the previous point, the art direction is great (check out videos of the Starmap) and faithful to the setting.
    [*]Great battle flow, with a good ""meaty"" feel for the weapons, meaningful environmental destruction and a diverse toolkit.
    [*]An ingenious ""suppression"" system that encourages the use of cover, items (grenades, mines, etc.) and specialized skills. For a change of pace, you can forego those tactics and develop your character as a head-on basher, as in a typical ARPG.
    [*]Enemies are varied (Chaos, Daemons, Imperial Rebels, Eldar, Dark Eldar, etc.) and have interesting behaviors (they use cover, throw grenades when you're on cover, man weapon emplacements, try to surround you on melee, etc.).
    [*]Interesting progression (gated through well-paced ""deeds"" or achievements, as well as more traditional leveling). It feels there's always an achievable goal to develop your character.
    [*]Structured in short (15-40 min) missions that, while boiling up to ""kill everyone"", are kept somewhat fresh by the addition of small twists (environmental reinforcements, vehicular levels, varied goals, etc.), specially in the main questline.
    [*]Surprisingly entertaining story that is well presented though dialogues, written clues and other media. Nothing deep of course, but it keeps your interest and serves as a pretext to contact (and stomp) many of the factions of the WH40K universe.
    [*]Relatively long questline for a ""young"" ARPG, specially when the standalone expansion Prophecy is included.
    [*]Free-form missions in addition to the story-related ones, create a sort of open-world feel.
[/list]
On the less-bright side:
[list]
    [*]This is still an ARPG, so don't expect much more than mindless combat. I prefer when they mix this genre up with puzzles, dialogue choices and more traditional RPG features. There are some interesting features that break from the mold (e.g. morality system, clue collection), but I feel they could have taken them further. That said, ARPG fans are notorious for demanding D2 copy-pastes, so there's that.
    [*]There are some rough edges (small bugs, some missing animations, simplistic in-game cutscenes) understandable from a small developer but jarring if you're into AAA games.
    [*]Some (not all) voiceovers are poor, either in audio quality or acting delivery.
    [*]Doesn't always do a good job of explaining its own mechanics (although there are good tutorials, some additions are needed to cover both general system overviews and in-depth features).
    [*]The game was brought closer to the Diablo 3 template in the V2.0 (much faster animations, more arcadey feel), which I feel wasn't the right direction for this game. Still, this is still less arcadey and more deliberate than the average ARPG (a plus for me).
    [*]Related to the above, there's a lot of unrealised potential in the game's systems (specially when compromising to make it closer to a typical ARPG). Given the great enemy behavior and base mechanics (suppression, cover, etc.) some tweaking (higher enemy lethality, slower/costlier skills, further specialization of enemies), new mechanics and clever mission design (trenches, minion orders, optional vehicles) would make this a great real-time tactics game.
    [*]Some interesting features (e.g. tarot cards) seem to be left by the wayside or lost context with the v2.0 reimagining.

In the current sale you can grab this title for ~17 bucks. It has been two years since this title was launched and Neocore constantly kept working on it. There are still some things that bother me a bit like the missing skill-need for some builds (melee-asassin: put a weight on all your action buttons and you are done). But overall this is a 40k title with some atmosphere. Hack'n'slash wise the gameplay does feel pretty satisfying. If you run in a nice group - with some friends probably - you can definitely get some heretic-bashing fun out of this title.

Neocore did get a lot of flak for this screw-up in the first year. But I got to appreciate their work going into the right direction by now.

If you are into 40k you should give this game a shot if it is on sale.

// Updated Review from after release of season 1 and patch level 1.1.0:
// Not recommended

Good hopes have been purged. Not only mine but those of 80% of the player base when you look at the steam charts for this (dead) game.
It is uncomprehendable for me how anyone can lead this game into this mess and this is definitely a leadership problem. The dev team has some skills but the way the person in charge is stearing this abomination of a AAA game is insane.

By now the game world consists of two sectors with several systems and lots of worlds. Unfortunately every sector / system / world look exactly this same. Hell, even D1 had more variety when it comes to level design let alone Grim Dawn.

Items? Forget about it. 2D images of loot looks like they are taken from a bad title from some 90's game. Unique items? Dream on. Build variety? It is a joke. Bugged items and skills? This is where this title shines.

End game content which has been delivered after the release is a slap in the face. Warzone is nothing else put a single mission type with one of five maps with the same objective over and over again.

Think you can play this for better loot, advancing your skills or getting new cosmetic items? Not here, please look somewhere else.

Talking about skills. How about tying active skills to weapons and limiting them to 4. As an Assassin I get one skill out of this four which is actually useful in the endgame. Meaning I can hold the left mouse button for as long as the war room grind goes and hit [^], [4] and [3] occasionally to use utility armor skills. This is an incarnation of dull gameplay which you should avoid at any cost.

TLDR: Do not do it. Do not even consider getting this on sale. This is a truly waste of your precious time.

Despite the mixed comments in Steam Reviews - yes, it is damn good with a lot of potential. V1.0 still needs some polish but it shows what this title is capable of. Plus: The studio is very dedicated and open-minded towards the community. Also check out 40K Martyr on Reddit if you like.

Keep in mind Neocore is about 40-50 people strong. So it is hard to compare this title to Blizzard's D3. But you will see that this game is deep and the developers put a lot of love into it. Plus the road ahead for the next years looks very promising.

The game does struggle with bugs but I did not see any game-breaking stuff. If you are into 40k in general this is a must-have. Supporting this studio is also a good thing. Do not expect a perfect game. But you will get entertainment definitely worth its money european bucks.

I think this is the strongest 40k video-game title out there.

If you are not convinced yet, get a Van Helsing title from Neocore for a few bucks and check out the quality of work they are delivering.

Other than that: Being into 40k and not buying this title is considered heresy.",1528386575,1593968874,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

First of all, I love ARPG games and I didn't know the Warhammer 40K Universe. That said, I really liked that Warhammer 40K ambientation and atmosphere, it's really cool. It's like a mixture of Diablo with Alien Swarm. On the other hand, about the game itself I must say that I'm not impressed at all. The graphics are OK but confusing most of the time. The controls and gameplay are VERY clunky. For that reason it self the game is SUPER boring. It's less boring with ranged weapons. Still, in my opinion, it's clearly that they lost the chance to make the gameplay more like Alien Swarm, based on the player skills, and less like Diablo where you just keep spamming skills all day long and must rely on the character stats. The animations are not smooth, on the contrary. The voice acting is abysmal. The game has one of the WORST interfaces I have ever seen in my life. It's very poluted and confusing. The only thing more confusing than that is the navigation system. Yes, it's one of those 'where the hell I'm suppose to go' kind of game. In addition, the game seens to overwhelm the new player with a lot of unnecessary information. There is a survey inside the game. WTF? I could be wrong here, but it seens like every side mission map is a SQUARE. Yes! A FUCKING SQUARE ! How creative! Plus, there is no music on the missions. For the last, it's a fact that, soon or later, every game turns out to be repetitive, but that game takes the cake and bring this to a whole new level. The game starts to be repetitive right at the BEGINNING. It's  ATARI level for fuck's sake. In conclusion, pretty much everything about this game looks boring, the gameplay, the animations, the loot, the missions, the story, the weapon skills, the passives, everything. Looks like there is zero motivation to level up your character because the gameplay is not fun and there is nothing interesting to pursuit.

(I'm only 20 hours in and will update this review after more playtime)

The devs really put a lot of work into this game and the fact they worked on it tirelessly to improve it and get it to where it is should be acknowledged. Hundreds of hours worth of content, great animations, all guns have meaty feel with great sound to really let you immerse yourself in the 40K universe and power fantasy of being an inquisitor. I feel like this is a game made by warhammer fans for warhammer fans and if you don't know anything about the universe you will miss out on a lot of fine details and little touches that someone that knows what to look for will appreciate. Don't expect a diablo style AOE Spamfest this is a lot slower paced, with a cover mechanic. I actually prefer playing this with a controller. 

The game is 2 years old now and the developers are still adding content and seasonal events and challenges, so expect this game to last even if you buy it now.

The few issues I have with the game are performance based. I have a pretty hefty rig (Nitro 5700xt, OC'd 5820k, 16gd ram) but I had the game chug down to 20 fps in a few rooms. Not a deal breaker, but really unexpected. Also, when playing Co-op with a friend, there is at least 2-3 lag spikes in each mission where everything just freezes for a few seconds. Both me and my friend had the same issue at exact same time so its clearly server based. If the multiplayer lag was adressed I would be really clutching at straws for issues.

PROS:

-Great story
-Mountains of content
-Meaty feeling and sounding weaponry faithful to the universe.
-Variety of playstyles
-Attention to detail
-Updates and support from the team

CONS:

-Certain few rooms seem badly optimized or made and absolutley kill FPS
-Lag spikes in multiplayer
-Some graphical details seem aged (Vox caster transmissions look like they're from previous gen)

Now, go purge the chaos filth and slay the xeno vermin Inquisitor!

Inquisitor: Martyr is a third person action rpg, with a rather atypical structure. Most classic hack'n'slash (Diablo series, Grim Dawn etc.) feature more-or-less linear progression through areas and occasional side dungeons. I:M has us chase after heretics and xenos through a series of instanced and separate levels, only connected through the command bridge of our Inquisitorial vessel.
Maybe that's why I feel it is playing more like an offshoot of Dawn of War 2 rather than a full-blooded ARPG.

Without further ado:

[h1]The Good[/h1]:
- Very well done Warhammer 40k universe, complete and resplendent with accurate lore and equipment.
- Absolutely spot-on grimdark atmosphere, fully supported and supplemented by grimdark soundtrack and sufficiently grimdark voice acting.
- Lots of dakka. Tons of toys to play with. Even the humble ""flashlight"" is quite well represented.
- Rather interesting character classes, and well nested in the lore - it really feels like the game was made by 40k fans.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]:
- Some bugs still present, such as the tactical view not updating upon weapon set change and occasionally unresponsive controls.
- Animations are jerky and blurry sometimes (looking at you - ""shoot from behind the pillar animation"").
- Really repetitive missions. I know it's a hack'n'dakka genre and fragging thousands of heretics is the name of the game here, but after nth^2 mission where I have to hold F to interact with something while the enemies spawn endlessly behind me, it becomes somewhat... meh.
- The passives and perks/skills seem... irrelevant. I mean... I saw some builds and guides to character building on the nets, but when most of the damage-dealing and actual active skills are tied to your gear, the system seems nowhere near the depth of the likes of Grim Dawn or Wolcen. I have about fifteen unspent passive points on one of my characters and it doesn't seem to make much difference tbh,

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]:
- ""Cannot connect to Neocore servers."" I have paid for a single player game and a single player experience. Inquisitor plays like a permanently laddered MMO, where I am constantly included in the weekly leaderboards. Furthermore, if your Steam is offline, or something is wrong with the servers, or your internet is temporarily down - forget about playing the game.
Utterly disgusting practice.

Overall though, the game does scratch the 40k itch in this particular, satisfying manner. It may be rough around the edges but the experience is... brutal.",1593630936,1593630981,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

For me WH40K is more about horrors of processes beyond individual control. Personally I would have appreciated if game had more horror and roleplaying elements where you get to investigate mysteries and experience creeping fear. I imagine that something like playing colonial marine from Alien versus Predator would be better action story match as an experience.

- The game is very slow paced, which isn't ideal for a Hack'n'slash title, unless it's made with exactly that purpose in mind
- Optimization is far from good. My GTX 1060 + i5-7600k + 16 GB Ram can't run the game on High (not even max) settings with constant 60 FPS Framerate. Which also, really destroys the experience in hack'n'slash games.
- Endgame doesn't differ in any way from the first levels you encounter, the only difference is, the HP of enemies and your damage.
- There's not enough enemies on the map, the game feels like it should have been a first person shooter or an action rpg, not a hack'n'slash. You don't really Hack and Slash in this game :(
- There's really not too much weapons, and all they offer is 4 skills each. Can you imagine playing a game a lot and only using the same 4 skills every single time? That's just plain dull and boring
- The graphics don't look good, even on High settings, most edges seem roughed out. On maximum field of view, everything just looks bad. And let's be honest, you will not play a hack'n'slash game with the camera being close.

+ The story seems to be pretty decent, it didn't keep me engaged, but I can't mark it as a minus.

An action RPG set in the Warhammer 40k universe. Lots of lore, lots of blood and gore, but most importantly lots of loot! Decent amount of classes to pick from, lots of end-game content and now Seasonal stuff. 

Gameplay -  10

This game is an Action Role Playing Game or ARPG. You have a top down view, and depending on your weapons have either ranged attacks or melee attacks.  There’s a ‘cover’ system that I didn't’ use for a long time because it didn’t seem helpful.  After playing a melee character was able to figure it out.   You have 4 different classes, DLC adds in the Tech-Priest,  each of which you can pick 3 different ‘styles’.  I played 2 different Psykers it seems like the initial choice decides what types of weapons/armour you can equip. The second choice refines the weapons so you use some better than others.  However, there’s a huge range of weapons/armours to pick from. 

One of the biggest problems I had at first was the abilities.  They are not always tied to your character. For example, my psyker I could select up to 5 Psyker abilities to use in combat.  However, because I had a wand and a sword equipped, I was only able to use 2 or 3 of them.  Psykers can also equip a belt item that just allows them to use another psyker ability instead of their normal belt item (grenades, mines etc). But other classes don’t have this ability, the tech-priest has something similar by selecting which constructs/bots they can use in battle.  The other 2 classes, Crusader and Assassin are more melee focused, or at least they can be and have their own individual mechanics. Of course you can build your character however you want and there are many ranged and melee options.   Now let’s say you find a new weapon you want to try out.  Well if it’s different from what you had equipped before, it changes your first 2 abilities and possibly the other ones as well. 

I feel like I'm making it more complex than it needs to be, basically depending on what you equip you can change all your abilities/skills. 

The other thing is your passive skills.  There’s a good 10 or so trees that change depending on what class you are playing.  You start with some, but unlock others through playing and meeting ‘Heroic’ Deeds.  Those are how you customize your characters and their build.  Make sure you read carefully before deciding how to build your character.

Story -  10

You play as an Inquisitor of the human Galactic Empire in Warhammer 40k, all hail the God Emperor. Your job is to find and cleanse heretics and any kind of blasphemy, this can take many many forms and as an Inquisitor you have the authority to deal with these things as you see fit. Be that death, destruction or forfeiture of their property. You’ve stumbled upon a ship, The Martyr which was lost to the Warp hundreds of years ago.  You attempt to land on the Martyr and it’s auto defences shoot down your ship. You manage to survive but have no equipment.

From there you have a sort of tutorial that leads you through the Martyr, you find out that another Inquisitor was here and is looking for information into the Martyr and it’s former owner. 

You’ll have to leave the Martyr eventually and that ends the tutorial, you’ll then follow story events to find people to add to your ship, NPC’s that allow various crafting and customizations. 

Pretty solid story, heavy in Warhammer 40k lore. 
Note* The Tech-Priest has a different storyline.  He can’t play campaign missions with the other classes.  You can still do random missions and such, just not the story missions. 

Graphics - 10

The Warhammer 40k world is full of gothic imagery.  They do not disappoint with that at all. Ships full of Gothic symbolism, very nicely done.   They also have very destructible things in some of the levels. Most cover can be destroyed if you really wanted to do that. You can unlock cosmetic things such as glowing footsteps or servitors to float around behind you.  All keeping with the Warhammer 40k lore and very well done. 

Controls - Mouse/Keyboard 6  Controller -10

I didn’t like the mouse and keyboard set up. It just didn’t feel comfortable to me. I’m sure i could have changed the settings but I just didn’t want to be bothered.   So switched to the controller and everything was much easier.   Again this is just me, I know several people who prefer the mouse/keyboard combo. 

Repeatability - 10

The game has a ton of end game content, you can pick random missions, on those random missions you can add in Tarot cards that change the level/enemies in different random fashion.   Making a level super hard or super profitable.  The campaign missions you can change the level of difficulty by making the enemies a higher level than you , thus increasing eventual rewards. 

Music -  7

Fitting for the game and the genre. It didn’t stick out and didn’t distract from the game. It was there and it  serves its purpose. 


Multiplayer - 9

So multiplayer.  I tried with some randos. Didn’t work out well they didn’t know me or talk to me, just went on with the mission. We finished and parted ways.  I doubt I will ever see them again. 

Now with my friends we were able to play and try out the various classes. The enemies scale to your level. So my level 57 guy can run with your level 13 or a 70 with my 57 and they both can contribute to the fight.  With that figured out I stopped playing all my lower level characters and focused on my Psyker.  We(I) found that if you have the lowest level person act as party leader and start missions you can replay the missions you’ve completed.  It DOESN’T the other way, if a player has not the requirements (i.e. finished prerequisite missions).  My friends and I created a Cabal(a clan) and they give out Cabal quests as well. 

There were some issues, like joining a game I was told  I had left an online session. So I joined and had 2 randos halfway through a mission that I joined. They were surprised as I was.  The community seems small (the game is only 2 years old), however they were willing to answer questions I had in the Global chat so that’s a plus.

Randomly playing with friends the game would rubberband us around, it was annoying but not game breaking. The other bug I had was finishing a level and getting 0 of the items I picked up. I thought they appeared the next time I came to the ship, but I couldn’t tell (there’s lots of loot). 

On a plus side all loot is individual.  So grab everything you can and sell it or dismantle it for crafting. 


*Note.  Tech-priest can not do the story mode with the rest of the classes.  




Initial Thoughts: 

I’m a big fan of warhammer and warhammer 40k things, so this was something I really wanted to play.  

Soma Says: 

Sadly there’s not enough room for me to express how much stuff there is to do in this game. Every time I thought I was about finished there would be more stuff to uncover/do. I got the game on a sale forever ago for around 30 bucks and it’s given me almost 80 hours of gameplay.  I have yet to finish the game, too many friends to play with and switching characters etc.  However now that i know the levels scale between players. I can focus on my Psyker (Level 57) and finish the campaign at least. 

Is it a perfect game?  I would like to think so, I have had fun playing and discovering things. You unlock more and more weapons as you go so there’s always new things to do and try on that front as well.   I highly recommend this game.  There’s actually so much to cover that I've left out a lot. Cabals, weekly missions, rewards.  This is basically an ARPG/MMO.

I've played nearly all arpg´s on the planet, but this, is a fresh play stile that you haven´t in anyone of them out there. There are much character customization and game deepness. After 12 hours playtime, there are still new features that are unlocked.

If you think that there aren't enough abilities, play a little. There are much combination from weapons, abilities itself, weapon’s with abilities. But in comparison with other arpg´s, the abilities are not that much and that feels really fresh, because your passive tree and modification from item’s have a massive weight on your char and abilities.

I'm playing every arpg on hardcore mode (if is possible). Here are no hc-mode, but, you don´t want it in this game. The punishment in this game is, that mission got a ""die-counter"". If you died x times in that mission, you'll get no reward and mission is gone. Feels nice, too, it's not boring like D3 (even on HC). Later in game, there are a feature, to ""pimp"" your missions, with modifiers like, "" 50% loot quality"" but instead of three times die, there are only two times allowed to die. There are so much more, but, find out yourself ;-).

Lets start with the good stuff:
There are a RIDICULOUS number of character build options.  There are around 20 different specialization trees and another 30 or 40 passives you can slot to allow your character to be adept in specific areas.  There are 10 or so weapons available for each class and 40 or so abilities, so there is a HUGE diversity in gameplay approaches.  
So thats nice.

The neutral stuff:
Do you like GRIMDARK?  'Cause the GW franchises are Grim. And Dark.  If you like that, good on ya.  The NPCs are stock WH40K NPCs.  Kinda dickish and otherwise Uninteresting.

The bad stuff:
The game itself is boring.  You shoot a hundred little mooks. There are few differences in factions, particularly the commanders. But its mostly fighting lots of swarms of mooks.  But thats an ARPG right?  There are four or five mapsets.  Ship decks and various blasted wastelands.  None are visually interesting or remarkable.  
Worst of all, the boss fights are boring, unmemorable bang-fests.  I LOVE ARPGs.  This is a bad ARPG.

If you have not played them, please play these ARPGs instead. They are better designed, have better narratives, and are more fun.
*Grim Dawn is the absolute pinnacle of ARPGs right now. If you haven't played it, get it when its on sale.
*Victor Vran is a little different. Less character customization. But each map has 'challenges' where you achieve goals with timers, or limitations (no heals, no ultimates, only use this weapon) that make the map more interesting.
*Torchlight 2 is a little dated, but DARN its fun and cute.
*Lord Of The Rings: War In The North is a cute little ARPG.  As a stand-alone its just okay.  But it really gets fun with friends.
*While not technically ARPGs, if you haven't played the Borderlands 2 series, you can get them cheaply and its basically a FPS ARPG.",1593356862,1593356862,False,3,0,0.481040477752685547,0,True,False,False

Are you in doubt? BUY IT. Specially on the Steam sales. It is worth every penny!

This is an ENORMOUSLY FUN single-player/coop Action RPG based on Warhammer 40,000. It is composed of short 15-to-30 minute levels in which you must complete an objective and/or exterminate all enemies. It has a good campaign storyline and great graphics and sound. You control an Inquisitor, which can be a Psyker, an Assassin, a Crusader or, if you own Prophecy, a Tech Priest.

It also has seasonal events kind of like Borderlands 3, with its own campaign/storylines.

Its mechanics are very deep and complex and are frankly overwhelming. Many of the elements are not well explained and to be frank are more useful in the hardest difficulties.

Good: Story, Environment, Lore
Bad: Multiplayer, External Resources

I didn't play this game when it first came out as I was turned off by the slower pace of the 'tactical' elements.  However, with the updates and release of additional content, I decided to give it a try.  It doesn't feel clunky anymore, at least not as much as what I saw in the original reviews.

This game definitely portrays the environment I expected to see for the 40k universe.  I really like the way the characters react to one another and the grotesque abominations are definitely disgusting.  I didn't know much about the lore when I started but I watched quite a few YouTube videos after waltzing through these chaos infested halls for a while.

I still need to finish the story of Prophecy (because of getting sidetracked by different elements like DLC, other classes, events, etc.).  I don't know much about the end game (Void Crusades, I think) but I can at least see that's there's end game things to accomplish.

My primary issue is that it's very hard to find guides from exceptional players you usually see for most games like this.  In addition, co-op is hard to find, with the (seemingly) low player population.  I did manage to find a guild (cabal) so I do receive the perks, but they're not often on when I am and there's not much chatter in the general chats.

With 75 hours in, I think I've gotten my money's worth and will continue to do so for a while.

Pros:
1. The graphic. Though the aliasing is pretty bad, thus not amazing comparing to any AAA game, it is still pretty good for an ARPG.
2. The sound effects and visual effects. The sound effect is really good. When you are wearing a power armor and walking through places, the game makes sure to let you know that you are wearing a 400+ lb mini tank. When you are purging the enemies of Imperium with bolters, the game makes sure you know that you are shooting some mini rockets with a hand-held cannon. The list goes on and on. Although some melee weapons can feel a bit lackluster, but overall the sound and visual effects are amazing. 10/10
3. Strategical feelings in an ARPG. Unlike most other ARPG, this game does give you slower or more strategical gameplay with actual clip size for projectile weapons, over-heat mechanism for energy weapons and covers for both you and the enemy. It is definitely unique.
4. Unlock dlcs for free. This game has a decent amount of dlcs and you can unlock them with in-game currency called fate, which is fairly easy to earn once end game contents are unlocked. Although most dlcs are just cosmetics or just so-so story content, there are couple that can test your build or give decent reward.
5. Enemies diversity. Currently the game has 5 main types of enemies: rebels, chaos, eldars, dark eldars and tyranids. Each type of enemy has their distinct fighting style. This definitely makes grinding less repetitive.
6. Voice acting. The voice acting of this game is surprisingly good. Both your character's and the NPCs' voice line fits their personality. So unless you are playing the constantly screaming psyker, the voice lines that pop up from time to time definitely makes the game more enjoyable.
7. Item reroll. Okay this is probably my personal bias. In this game as long as you have the resources, you can reroll all the enchantments on relic items and all but one enchantment on archeotech/morality relics. And these relic items will be the gears you wear during end game. I absolutely love this. One thing I hated so much in D3 was that you could only reroll one enchantment on any item.
8. Perk unlock. In this game your skills are tied to the weapons you are using. So to boost your character, you put points in to passive trees and perks. Both can be unlocked by completely certain tasks, e.g. you get melee combat passive tree by dealing a certain amount of melee damage. I think it a pretty neat system.
Cons:
1. Progression can start feeling pointless. Grinding to the max level (100) is not that easy in this game, however after a certain point leveling feels almost pointless (usually after getting most of your dps passives, for me it was around level 70. So unless you are a perfectionist, switching characters after level 80 is probably the most fun way to play the game). At the same time, higher level items also doesn't necessarily increase your character's strength. I was using a level 60 weapon for a long time when leveling from level 90 to 100 and it doesn't feel that much weaker comparing to the level 90 one I picked up later. So I think the progression system can use some more tweaks to make leveling up character/getting higher level item feel more rewarding.
2. Unskipable main story. Aside from progression of later levels, this is probably what I dislike the most. If you start a new character, you still have to replay the main story again the unlock all the features. NPCs for crafting, random missions,  special shops and morality passive tree/items. All these require you to replay the main campaign to a certain point to unlock again. This just adds so much unnecessary grinds. Especially when main campaign is terrible for exp farming.
3. Story. The story really isn't the best. Pretty plain story of go there rescue that and come here kill this. And when you consider how lore breaking that an Inquisitor can just slaughter space marines, solo kill chaos dreadnoughts and even greater daemon, it becomes laughably bad.
Overall, if you are a fan of arpg and wh40k, you should definitely give this game a try. But wait for discount. The mediocre story and flawed progression system doesn't justify that 50 dollar price tag.",1593096971,1593096971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is gorgeous and the combat is diverse, and with the devs promising support for years to come this could easily surpass Diablo 3 as THE A-RPG franchise.  For the Emperor!

In all seriousness though, the game is a lot of fun but still in dire need of continued care by the developers. Fortunately, the developers have been patching the game regularly, though it is staggering the amount of bugs that still exist (it might be the buggiest game I have EVER played).

I would easily recommend this title to any fan of the WH40k universe, as it does NOT disappoint in that area one bit.  For everyone else, however, I would reserve some judgment due to the currently overly-grindy design of the ""Fate"" system and the utterly lacking-in-reward ""Priorty Assignments"".

There is a lot of potential here, and fans will easily wait for that potential to be reached by the developers.  I just hope everyone else can wait that long before losing interest.

Neocore, despite some bad beginning reviews, are showing a determination to continue support for the game.  The road ahead will be long, but perhaps patience will win out in the end.

Edit 06/23/2020 - The constant attention and love that Neocore has given this game, in addition to the release of the Prophecy expansion, has made this game definitely worth buying.

However the game is a lot better now, the devs sticked to it, kept updating and patching and now imo it's a pretty close to being a must have for any a-rpg/hack and slash games enthusiasts.

It's a very complex game, there's lot of different systems to learn, varied builds and massive lore.
This game require time and investment so i suggest you don't even pay attention to the plebs posting negative reviews with less than 2 hours played.
It's that kind of game you can sink hundreds of hours into if you get hooked.
Fun fact at the moment of this quick review edit i played the game for 80+ hours and only played with two classes out of four... (i played with psyker and tech adept)

The only problem i have with the game is that the end game is a bit too grindy and it can get boring after a while.
Anyway, with this game and Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem that's enough hack and slash goodness to keep me entertained until Diablo IV comes out. 😊

Well recommended.

I love ARPG's, I love WH40k universe. The setting, atmosphere, menus, and general visuals of the game are great. Almost every other aspect is not, it is very slow, in every way.

The cinematics are really nice but beyond that pretty much every element of this game fails miserably. For starters, you can't play coop from the beginning (huge knock for an ARPG that offers coop), the visuals are very mediocre, the sound design is horrid with weapons sounding like magic water guns, the voice acting sucks compared to other 40k games, the story is totally uncompelling, turning the camera is like watching a slideshow and very buggy, and much more. I thought the camera situation might be improved by using a controller but the game tells you that you must launch the game with a controller on for it to work, which is something that shouldn't be a problem with a game this new. 

Overall, extremely disappointed. The developers are also very uncommunicative. Before launch I made a post in the discussions about how I thought it was a mistake to not allow coop from the start of the game and one of the devs responded with some canned excuse about how the story they were telling could only be done in single player as if they had some crazy tech going on here (the missions are so basic I have no idea what he could have been referring to) and they immediately closed my post to stop any more discussion.

=============


edit for 2020: I made that  review 2 years ago and they fixed the game. It's actually fun now and I love the classes and subclasses. I just wish you weren't forced to pick a character that locked into something like one person is a warrior, another is an assassin, the techo mage, and I think the cleric version of Warhammer. I'm playing as the assassin now and she's fun with her sniper rifle and shotguns. I wanted to play an action RPG with guns and this was it.

I cannot see me playing this game for a very long time like PoE or Diablo 3. Why? Because the leveling is tedious and gets very slow after 60 (there are 100 level in this game). But my main reason why i dropped this game is because i got sick of non-random generated campaign missions i.e. i want to play my 2 other alts but i dont want to re-play the same locations over and over. In PoE at least you have random levels in campaign mode, but not in this game.

So yeah

Good
- Gorgeous detailed graphics (if your PC can handle it - disable in-game antialiasing and enable 4K resolution or 4K DSR scaling to eliminate blurriness, it goes even better with decent Reshade!)
- Decent music, voice and sound effects
- Badass ranged Crusader weapons, well, most of them
- Very fun Tech-adept summoning spec (Prophecy expansion only)
- Interesting story
- A very nice itemization
- Epic battles are EPIC! Look at this:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2136565487
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2136565781
- Gore is everywhre, at PoE scale or even worse... (no screens)
- Cool looking gear
- No microtransactions!

50/50
- Some campaign missions can be really dull
- Not enough interesting end-game activities (""carrots"" yum yum) to drag you after campaign. There are a lot of them, but they all the same mostly...
- Weirdly looking antialiasing if your PC cannot handle 4K resolutions or 4K DSR (i think you can fix this with Reshade/NVIDIA Freestyle sharpening)

Bad
- Tedious end-game leveling
- Non random-generated campaign maps
- A couple of annoying bugs that no one wanted to fix
- Some weapons just plain weak or over-nerfed, its like you MAY like something but why use it if you need 400%*amount of time to kill mobs vs ""good"" weapons?

On a side note - if you dont have patience to experiment with all classes and specs - i advice you to start this game as a Crusader Heavy Gunner (non Tech-adepts cannot play Prophecy campaign!) or as a non-melee Tech-adept (Tech-adepts cannot play Martyr campaign!). Other classes are fun too but can be hard to play mechanically (Psyker) or weak (Assassin), but most importantly - ranged Crusader is the most balanced class in this game weapon wise, so you will have a lot of weapons to choose for!",1592689901,1592690684,True,2,0,0.525000035762786865,0,True,False,False
527430,71083539,76561197997863811,0,12,738,0,722,1653008806,"I really, really wanted to like this game. It's great for 40k lore junkies like myself, and you see things like Chaos Daemons you just don't see a lot of from other games like Dawn of War. The weapons are fun to use, and while they are often pretty basic (e.g. most melee weapons are basic single target, basic area target, strong single target, strong area target), it is still satisfying to see the heretics reduced to red chunks as you mow through them.

My issue is the procedurally generate levels. Random map generation is okay in games like Diablo 2 because you are still advancing through the game and getting to the next level. My problem with Martyr is that all levels lead back to the same hub, the bridge of your inquisitor's ship. Do a level, back to the ship. Do another level, back to the ship. It just isn't satisfying. I don't know if your hub changes as you progress, but I couldn't be bothered to go much farther than I did.

A second point is the goals of the levels. For the most part you are either A: getting x macguffins, B: getting one macguffin hidden randomly in one of x locations, C: killing all the enemies on the map, or D: defending x locations from y waves of enemies. It results in all of the missions feeling the same. A mission I complete at level 20 feels no different from a mission I complete at level 5.

While I might revisit this game from time to time to get my 40k fix, I can't recommend it to new players unless it's on sale.",1592668773,1592668773,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game does require an internet connection, and I have yet to get it to run smoothly on a consistent basis, though if that is due to the game being clunky, or my internet not being the best, or some combination of the two, I cannot say.
I also feel like it needs a bit of work in regards to the morality system. I think it is because I am not a good moral mindset for the Imperium, for me their purist choices seem over the top, basically kill and reject anything that has been touched by xenos influence, be it through torture or whatever else. I may just be a radical thinker of course, but as I understand it, not all purists think that if an alien forced you to do something, but you ultimately remain loyal to the Imperium that you should die anyway.
Also as I understand it, radicals are all for using xenos tech and tend to be more of a risk to everyone by being willing to do radical things, like experiment with a xenos drug to control citizens better or the like which tends to put Imperial worlds in danger of falling to the enemy. Right now as the game does it, the radical choices tend to be more like, you know maybe we don't kill them right away and instead consider the circumstances and that they maybe should be sent for questioning instead so we can get better info on the enemy they spent months overhearing talk about their plans.
I haven't gotten all the way through the main campaign and a lot of morality choices so maybe the radical branch gets more radical, but I feel like they didn't make it radical enough so far to be considered such and it just seems like the more sensible option generally to get better results.
I do feel it gets repetitive after a while, while there are a ton of different mission types, they do tend to devolve down to murder the hordes of enemies that get in your way.

Now the good: 
All in all it is a Warhammer game and if you pick up the dlc it has a ton of content, not to mention the non-campaign, non-dlc content that is in there and constantly shifting, part of the reason it requires internet at all times is that there are events ongoing and tons of random missions, so you always have something to do.

Lots of mission types, and different gameplay features.

Item crafting, think similar to Diablo.

I created a cabal/group to get access to the cabal related tasks and such, very slow grind for a solo player, definitely designed for multiple cabal members, so I recommend finding a cabal that doesn't have steep requirements and have fun with it. You are always welcome to join HelloSolos if you just want to see what a cabal is like without any pressure to focus on it or to stick around if you decide you would rather join a more active cabal.

Warhammer lore and some interesting ideas explored, though I won't go into that since I don't want to spoil the story.

Multiple factions/races to fight, mainly a ton of chaos factions and eldar types, also tyranids and astra militarum, I've also run up against mechanicus units during a void crusade.
Maybe I haven't seen it yet, or maybe the followup game Inquisitor Prophecy will add more, I don't know, but I hope in time they add orks and necrons to the mix. This game has a lot more potential than it currently has going.

I've only played the psyker class so far, and only one of the three branches of that class, but there are other class choices as well that I may take a look at eventually as some look interesting.

The graphics are pretty solid and they have really nailed the look and feel of the 40K universe 
The gameplay is smooth and fast paced with very few bugs and glitches (as far a I can see).  
The game's storyline is quite interesting with unique characters, interesting story arcs, morality choices, and is steeped in classic and involve very specific aspects of 40k lore.

Oh yes, I almost forgot to mention. Get ready for some EXTREME amounts of gore. There is no shortage of blood, guts and dismemberments here. It is classic 40K and I LOVE IT!!

You get a choice of classic ARPG classes and sub-classes to start as, each dictating what kind of weapons you get to use and as such the skills available to you and there are LOTS of different types of loot to collect and different types of weapons and combos that you can use as you progress further through the game.
The Assassin for Stealth and Agility, The Crusader is your heavily armoured tank, the Psyker excels in Spellcasting and AOE damage, and finally The Tech-Adept is your classic ARPG pet class that can summon a small army of constructs in all shapes and sizes to obliterate anything in their path.

The voice acting is pretty solid and the characters are very fleshed out and fit in very well with not just the story but with the 40K lore as well.
 
At the end of the day, W40K Inquisitor Martyr is an absolute joy to play, no matter what level you are on or what class you play as, you are going to have a good time. This is clearly a game made by 40k fans, for 40k fans, and if you’re a veteren 40K like I am you are going to want to play Inquisitor Martyr in all of its glory and even if your only a new fan of W40K there’s a good chance you’ll like it.

Is well made, it shows very well the lives of the Inquisitors and of other factions and characters, witch has a good variety and with good voices and art. If you are not, you may lose a few story details, but it can be enjoyed anyway.

As an ARPG it has it’s good things and it’s bad things. Classes are well made, well differentiated between them and have a lot of options and personalization to build however you feel like. There isn’t a lot of selection for equipment (Since every class has it’s own equipment), but it’s not lacking. It also has some interesting mechanics, game modes, objectives and global events, giving a lot of stuff to do.

However, there are a few problems that really impact in the game. The camera is badly positioned, too close to the character, and making necessary to turn the camera to look around (Need that didn’t had in other ARPGs). The graphical interface gets the job done, but is ugly. Map design is particularly bad, most of the time just a bunch of corridors and rooms, sometimes too narrow even for some of the biggest enemies, with little exploration and pretty straightforward or very open maps with little to do. The game has some good maps on it and it has a lot of options of stuff that can be done, but it’s not utilized enough and it’s rare to find trapped chests, teleporters or tech-shrines. The minimap is too zoomed in to be useful and the complete map is completely opaque and, in some tilesets, shows the borders of the rooms like a PNG without transparency, making it ugly, and most of the time is useless because of the linear maps. Some particular tilesets, like the open world in frozen planets, show in the full map that there are SERIOUS problems with the maps and the tilesets.

Graphical performance is terrible, with microlags and options that make the entire screen blurry. Steam helped with an update to process compiled shaders, but the lack of optimization is notable. Playing singleplayer requires online, since the game is online-centered, but without making it annoying and it didn’t gave me problems. However, playing coop or PvP is problematic and it even made the game to crash.

In conclusion, I recommend the game, but buy with discount. The developers are active, so I hope that they improve the lacking parts of the game and optimize it correctly.

Warhammer 40k: Inquistor - Martyr is an action RPG similar in many ways (but also quite different in other ways)  to games like Diablo and Grim Dawn. You travel from dungeon to dungeon decimating hundreds of enemies in each one of them. The game has a good variety of classes (4 main classes, and each one has its own specializations) and LOTS of different types of loot. There's also a pretty good weapon variety and these weapons can be combined in several different ways. For example, you can use a plasma pistol in one hand, and a laser pistol in the other, or instead of the pistol, you can use a sword or an axe instead. 

Also, get ready for EXTREME amounts  of gore. There is no shortage of blood or dismemberments here. It's on par with games like Doom Eternal and Space Marine in this regard.

The game is set in a region of space known as the Caligari Sector, and you play as an Inquisitor, an special agent working for the Imperium of Man. Your mission is to defend the Imperium and mankind itself from the many horrors that are looking to destroy and/or enslave them. Your journey revolves around a legendary ship known as The ""Martyr"" which has reappeared after thousands of years missing. The Martyr holds a terrible secret, and its up to you to find out said secret before the enemies of mankind do.

However, things are not always what they seem, and throughout the game, players will be forced to make choices along the way, choices. Will you follow the laws of the Imperium to the letter, or will you take a more ""pragmatic"" approach to them ? Your choices will shape how the story will proceed.

You are an Inquisitor, the supreme law of the Imperium. Your authority ends only short of the Emperor himself and his Custodes. You're tasked with investigating the Martyr, a ship that's been lost for centuries. As with every story though it becomes something much bigger.

Pros:
- Short, procedurally generated missions
- Highly detailed environments
- Good variety of Classes, each with their own assortment of weapons and armor to support different playstyles
- Plenty of loot
- The Magos on the deck allows for endless customization of your items
- Although simple, the music is well done and matches the situation and environment

Cons:
- A single player game with no offline mode and literally everything, including inventory, is stored on the Neocore servers
- Easy to get snagged on unseen objects in environments, some environments have paths that are hard to traverse
- Character design is poor with detail you'd expect from a game 15 years ago
- Vox animations are lazy with characters following a looping animation while talking
- Character dialogue is lazy and uninspired. All dialogue is monotone with absolutely no emotion to mirror the situation. Some characters, particularly Chaos, are difficult to understand due to over used voice modulation. Guardsman sound goofy
- Game will briefly pause during events like competing objectives, heavy combat or loading in a large groups
- Game is still buggy 2 years later
- No new game+ which would be fine if the endgame wasn't procedurally generated missionsl
- Procedurally generated environments and missions grow repetitive quickly
- Main campaign is incredibly short, padded out with investigations from other Inquisitorial branches
- ""DLC"" (Priority Missions) is overpriced considering it is largely text based with a couple missions thrown in

TLDR:  Thematic and amazing customization of gear and skills, marred by server stability that's rolling the dice to see if it's playable or not.

Flavorwise, it's great to see a multitude of location tilesets and enemy forces presented; even to the point of light vehicles being some of the harder targets to go after in missions.  The three classes I've played so far have been quite interesting and different from one another, from the assassin filleting a few targets then going into hiding to strike anew, to the psyker raining down fire, and the tech-adept just bringing an army of robots along, and that's just how I've been playing them.

Which brings me to probably the most intresting facet to me of the game in that nearly everything is customizable.  There are a few weapons with class restrictions, but for the most part, you choose what weapon you want to use, which determines your autoattack of sorts.  Most classes have a variety of skills to choose from and can be customized in different ways (the psyker, for example, can add three different affixes to a skill to modify it, whereas the techpriest has specialized gear slots on their robots).  You have charged-use ability (like grenades, a force field, etc) and an ability from your armor, or you can slot them out for more class skills.  Even your health potion has slots you can customize that affects what it does and how many uses you get of it before needing to find a refill.  Crafting gear brings a ton of options as well, allowing rerolls of both listed powers and their values, adding sockets, special powers, etc.

We've been mostly playing the random mission system that opens up about level 30 or so, that gives you a decently-sized list of missions, each listing the level of the enemies, what enemy force you're fighting, the type of mission, and the tileset.  Then, you can add up to three modifiers of your choice to the mission you choose to do--which bring with them a random penalty from a theme listed with your choice--for example, one of the 'chance to increase the rarity of loot dropped' choices comes with a drawback of 'a randomized penalty related to death'--which might mean you get a penalty of dying once fails the mission, or you lose a quarter of your maximum health each time you die, or you start with one life but can earn more by killing certain enemy types.

That being said...

Server quality seems to be very touch and go--we normally manage a mission or two before running into severe rubber banding, disconnects, high inventory latency, frozen shopkeepers, or some other crippling flaw that makes playing the game almost impossible.  While there IS a 'reconnect to multiplayer game' option, I've not had it work once--and I've sometimes had it show up on login when I haven't played for several hours.  This whole issue is only made worse that the only option to play is online, so even playing single player can get you stuck rubberbanding.  

Other than the server stability and latency issues, the only other qualm is that certain features feel like they take too long to unlock--for example, that random mission option sort of exists from early on, but by manually having to find a world with some problem that needs Inquisitorial intervention, whereas at level 30 you get the option to just hit 'm' from your command bridge and get a list of twenty or so mission options.  While the qualifications seem to be account-unlocked, certain skill trees feel a bit difficult to unlock as well.",1591809444,1591809444,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a brutal, dark and literal meat grinder of a dungeon crawler. All the classic RPG elements are there: gear itemization, character skill/ability development, crafting and lots of violence. 

I'm starting to suspect that the Inquisitor doesn't actually believe anything, but is in fact - just here for the violence. 

One thing that could improve a bit is the camera control, it would be really great to see an ""auto follow"" or ""auto adjust"" feature. Essentially the issue is that as you proceed through a level the camera will stay fixed, even though it can be panned to follow you. 

Think if you're you're running west, by default, it will look like your character is running left in the zone. However, with a quick wheel click & drag, you can pan the camera so it looks like you're running north. 

If you're running around slashing and shooting on story mode, no big deal. But as your difficulties increase and you seek to challenge yourself, the camera moves from being passive to a tactical element of game play. 

I think there's room for improvement there. 

Others: 
- The lore and story are deep enough (I'm still new to 40k, but it feels really deep - but, I'm not sure it is). 
- The settings and graphics are 40k and super dark RPG appropriate. Classifying this as a Horror Action RPG is fair. 
- Systems are simple, but offer a lot of options for customization. 
- The progression feels good, and you can ramp up your difficulty as you desire. 
- I have an older computer, but I'm sure this would look beautiful on a modern system
- Have not done any Co-Op / PvP as my character is still leveling, but I did queue a few times - nothing really happened. 
- Bite Sized content, so you don't have to commit to long dungeons

Very good ARPG and a decent addition to your library of games if you enjoy that genre. Very grindy after level 50.

High Points: Uther's Tarot system of modifiers applied to missions.

Only 2 complaints, but they knock a few points off for me:

1 - Leveling slows to an absolute crawl after level 50/55. I have level 61, 30, 28, and 10 characters (one for each class) with the Tech Adept being the highest. If Neocore doesn't do something about the leveling experience post 50, then I doubt any of my sub 50 characters will go any further. Just takes too long.

2 - Loot drops seem to be very stingy for an ARPG. This is from a level 60 perspective. But seeing as it takes soooo long to level after 50 (see compliant 1) I may not get that much higher. I don't mind a bit of a grind but this is ridiculous.

You must also complete various achievements to unlock unique perks (passive skills) and even skill trees, the good part is that they carry on through new characters.

The best part of the game, however, is in the depth with which it depicts the 41st millenium. Apart from some dubious voice acting like for the Assassin inquisitor and the imperial guardsmen, there is a very good amount of lore and it catches the feeling of the setting quite well.

My wife and me played 38h in a row because it was kinda fun and we were looking for a good co-op game. with the sale we decided to buy this game and we really like it but in this condition the game is anly annoying and frustrating. The problems seem to exsist since 2018 and they become more and more worse when more players as usual are online. I really want to recommend this game, but unfortunately i cant. keep your money and play other games for co-op. even if you love the 40k universe like we do.",1590999870,1591225804,False,2,0,0.504550039768218994,0,True,False,False
