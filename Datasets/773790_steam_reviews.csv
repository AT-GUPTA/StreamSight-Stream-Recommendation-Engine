Deviate even slightly from a guide and your settlement fails. Great if you want to join the sheep.
I guess there comes a point when your settlement is large enough to handle a few setbacks, allowing you a little room to make your own decisions, but I got bored long before that.
Buildings menu is poorly laid out, it can take a long time to find the one you need. Pause is your only friend here, which makes the game last longer while adding zero interest.
UPDATE:  Seen a number of releases since my first review, my opinion however remains unchanged. Even if you ithrow in every available cheat the game still manages to kill any ""free will"" by imposing conditions as to which order things have to be built. People complain about diet before you've had a chance to sow any crops - try to get around that by establishing a fishing industry because it seems easier to get production under way and the game ignores you. It seems the devs anticipated a certain path and the game can only deal with that with no room for ""deviation"".
A really horrible game, yet it looks so good I'm totally disappointed every time I come back, hoping it's been improved.
The game looks so good it may well take more than 2 hours to realise you've bought a turkey.

The best part is the sheer depth, every part of each building needing to be collected and put to use - 1 plank at a time. Getting to see the constructions come together piece by piece, with the workers taking little breaks in between, it all slowly coming together in this way.. it's very satisfying to watch and each town/village/city you create will always have a natural and organic feel to it due to the way the paths form over time through ""usage"" and being walked on. I love building up around the naturally forming paths, rather than planning too far ahead before hand. Not trying to use any meta or particular rigid build order or placement makes the game feel extremely fresh on each new town. 

Once you have the basics set up and are self-sustaining food wise, you can continue to increase sustainability by expanding your farms and goods, importing cows for leather, building a shoeshop to eventually supply your citizens with their own boots and clothing.. or you can specialise in something, maybe Sunflower oil - guaranteeing a steady income from trading it in bulk. 

This game can really bring out anyones creative side and without the pressure/threat of raids or natural disasters it allows you to just play it in peace, either at 1x, 2x, or 3x speed if you want to get things done. I've never spent so much time in a city-builder type game simply just admiring and observing the little NPC's going about their day. 

Citizens will be born, grow up, play, work and live out their lives until death in your town, and you'll be there overseeing it all! 

One of the most underrated games on the market and 100% worth the asking price, I would recommend this to anybody looking for a game to just relax with or for an indepth city management / building game.

The best part of the game is the gridless building setup. Being able to set your buildings down in however you please and watch your town grow in a organic and asymmetric style over the years is really enjoyable and captures the realities of towns and cities in the time period (18th century). I am especially pleased when I am able to surprisingly fit a building in a space that I would normally think nothing could fit in. You can create beautifully cramped or open towns that look unique in each attempt. The only other game I've seen capture this well is Foundation.

Other nice things that Ostriv does that I haven't seen other games do is the farming. The quintessential way to amass food in any city-builder, farms are amazingly represented in Ostriv. The nutrient usage requiring crop rotation and fallow seasons is something I have only seen done in Farthest Frontier. It's a great layer of realism and strategy added to the city-builder category. The grid-locked farms create beautiful enclosures that grow to something resembling the same landscape you would see flying over some farms.

A few things that I would like to see Ostriv have is a random map generation, more towns to trade with, and more types of buildings and progressively more complex buildings and industries. Also, steam workshop support is always great for smaller games. Everyone compares these building games to Banished, but most people forget that Banished was never really officially worked on after its release. The Banished modding community did a fantastic job continuing to keep interest in the game and innovate on game mechanics.

TL;DR - Ostriv is a fantastic game if you are looking for a historical city-builder and felt a strong attachment to Banished. It captures those emotions of creating a thriving little town on the cusp of greatness and expounds upon the genre with things like free-form building placement, seasonal hiring, and intuitive farming.",1706750757,1706750757,True,4,0,0.579234957695007324,0,True,False,True

In my opinion most important thing in this kind of games is well balanced infrastructure, economy, pacing, and this game is severely lacking in these. I read the patch notes and plans of the devs, and overall they seem like very likable people, but I dont think the vision meets with the reality of the game. The visuals of the buildings are very detailed and nice, it is nice change from other games which have just *pop a building*, here you can see the whole process of building the slot, plus people growing their own garden is something I really really liked, thats very nice touch, so all that is very interesting, thoughtful and clearly made with love, but visuals overall are lacking. There is lot of focus on things that are not important in city builders while lot of major and necessary components are missing. It is still better than the one with beavers, but still much worse than Banished and similar. There are no issues technical point wise, I saw some crashing experiences and not saving etc, I didnt encounter any issues regarding technical side, it runs like butter, but cant imagine sinking hours into this, there is no goal to strive for, gameplay is dull and there is no progress scale. You have access to everything from get go, you just keep building and hope people wont leave until you are done building the next building, it is miserably executed, too slow paced, and lack of any progression scale, reward system or achievements, some motivation to *keep building* or do anything really is massive. The infrastructure and economy lacks are game breaking at this moment and I dont think the overwhelmingly positive is deserved, neutral, yes, for alpha, but it needs lot of work in all departments, it is not enjoyable to play at this state. I am mainly giving it thumbs up because of the price, which is fairly low for this and if you dont have much experience with city builders, I think you will not exactly perceive the massive lack in important areas there is, or at least not for hours, you will just think that *it is part of it* or *I am just bad at this*. If you are experienced in this genre, go back to Banished and maybe see this in few months/years.

How is this not fixed yet or is there a magic trick I don't know and the game don't teach?

Also the fact that the game is still in EA after almost 4 years is a big reason to hold off with the buy.

Hard at the beginning and pretty linear until you get your village running. Economy is simplistic. For me the biggest pro of Ostriv is the building aspect with detailed and nicely animated building-phases, you see the buildings growing with every brick that gets delivered to the construction site. You can place buildings wherever you want without grid system. This leads to villages that look more organic. Every citizen is has its own life, name, family, wealth and job. The ""Wuselfaktor"" (as we name it in German) is high. And highly satisfying to watch at all your little people living their lifes. 

Maps could be bigger, production chains deeper and there could be more variety in buildings, especially for production. Some are really missing like a bakery, a hunter or a furniture manufacturer.

Edit:  Now that I've been playing for a couple of hundred hours I say this game stands up.  It is just as much fun in the middle and late game as it is in the beginning.

It was 8:30AM when I tore myself away from my PC. 6hrs of sleep later I set it running, just to get through the construction list.

I made it further each time but hit a brick wall on farming production.  The amount of wheat produced was disappointing.  I couldn't figure out how to feed it to hungry villagers.  If the villagers run out of food they move out and your production halts where those workers were employed.  I also couldn't figure out how to get oxen to plough the field.  I got a pasture and cow shed set up but there were no buttons to order or spawn cows.  One of the early stumbling blocks was nail production and that alone caused me to abort an attempt.  You need a charcoal pit and a smithy before you start building a lot of buildings.  You also need a carpentry shop to repair carts.  There was a seemingly endless chain of these snafus that kept causing me to quit and start over.  You can't go by the prompts the AI gives.  What I hated was there being no way to go back and repair damage from a mistake.  Once villagers disappeared it was difficult to recoup.  And hunger was a constant problem.  I just don't have the patience for this game.  Perhaps it is for advanced players of economic sims only.  I'm apparently not advanced enough to make a go of it.

So if you find yourself looking at this game, chances are you're looking for a ultra-sim city builder that you are beginning to realize doesn't actually exist. You've probably been searching youtube, steam, and all the likes in search of that ultra specific niche game to satisfy your urge to watch a village or a town build from the very ground up. And let me tell you . . . you have found it. Ostriv is THE game for you...

In a few more years.

At the moment, I've put in 32 hours now and I have a nice little town of 100 people and that's it. I've done the game. I survived my first few winters, the food is plentiful and the resources are many. In fact, in terms of balancing, I don't recall ever having an issue (EDIT: THIS IS NOW OUT OF DATE, DIREGARD). This is my first and only save and I was able to succeed completely with no real challenges, which I think speaks to the poor balancing of the game. In all honesty, there's a lot that needs work. And I hope, I really hope, that this game is brought to its fullest potential at some point in the future (once the dev's are able to return to normal lives obviously. Godspeed to them).

But with all that being said, you should still buy this game. There's nothing else like it. Not a one. What is here - the bare bones that is - is perhaps one of the most satisfying gaming experiences I have ever had. I play at the slowest speed. With every new building plan I place I eagerly zoom in and watch them build it log by log, clay by clay. 

So if you find yourself looking at this page and really thinking, hmmmm, should I buy this game?

I think this review tells you everything you need to know to make that decision. 

TL;DR

do you like ultra calm, ultra sim low content city builders ---> buy game

are you looking for fast paced, exciting high-content/dlc city builders ----> don't buy game

thanks for coming to my ted talk


edit, 54 hours later : Much more content and buildings have been added and I can thoroughly say I am enjoying this game and have high hopes for continued development by the devs. If you play on the slowest speed, which I really feel this game is meant to be played on, there is easily 80+ hours to be had here. I'm probably only halfway to having rowhouses with my current amount of playtime. YMMV if you play on a higher speed.

Okay, lets start by saying I'm an AVID world building/sim gamer. I've had this game on my wish list for a bit and loved how it looked in the videos. I didn't read any reviews, because not everyone has the same taste. 

The premise of the game is fantastic. Graphics are good, I like how you can see buildings be put together, and how with time, theres a path wore into the ground. 

So heres what I dont like: 
- Starting off, you have until about mid-Nov to get 9 houses built so you dont lose any of your original. I learned it takes about 1 month per house. But you have to take steps in building other things first before that. So the most I've been able to get built before snow, is 4 house with the 5th almost done. It would be nice if they would all stay and when they become unhappy to a certain point, then they leave. If that happens, I could possible have an additional 2-3 more homes built. Once you lose those people, its HARD to get new ones in. Theres no wonders who just happen to pass by. No you have to ensure that you have certain things before people will come to your camp. Well,  if I don't have barely any people, its just gonna be a lot of sit and wait ( which is boring!)

- So I tried getting a black smith station built and place an Iron Mine, however, there was no marker on the ground or map on where the ore could be. Theres no options that I've found on the map overlay to show them either. 

- I do wish there was an option for sandbox mode where you can create your own game — like how much food, how many people, etc.

- Also, from what I can tell from the game just by looking. Theres no option to just upgrade the houses, you have to demolish and place a better. I truly think that if you place a better house over top of the current one and just add on new stuff, it would be awesome. 

- The CLEAR TREES is by far the worst though. It needs to be a box grid or something a lot smoother. It is currently like drawing with a pencil and if you happen to hit a tree, it will get a sign to remove. This is a very tedious task and can be made so much better. 

Once theres an update I will be playing more and posting a revision to this!

I think this game is a great simulation of rural town building. It is hard to learn the steps of getting a successful town but once you learn how to, it's smooth sailing and fun. While the game updates once in a blue moon, it must be taken with a grain of salt as the developer has reasons for focusing on other issues. Here are some pros, cons, and ideas of improvement for the game.

Pros:
- Unique building style and the buildings work with each other well
- Graphics are amazing (although laggy for low-end computers)
- realistic simulation, with seasons, economy, trading, people needs, and more.

Cons:
- Game gets boring late stage, after your town starts building rowhouses, the game gets repetitive.
- Still buggy, although I experience no game breaking glitches, I've heard of some.
- Some things seem unfinished, one example is that the treasury (money) has no big consequences if you go into debt.

Ideas for improvement:
- The community loves this game, making it mod-compatible would be the best thing this game could do for us.
- The game already has many buildings, but every building looks the same to another. What I mean by this is that one granary looks like the one built next to it, all the bridges look the same, etc. While the houses have variation in their design, I wish we could build custom bridges with diff. designs. Same with other buildings. Steam Workshop mods could greatly help in this if the first idea for improvement is ever implemented.

Overall:
I love this game, I come back to it from time to time to play it, even if it hasn't changed much. If your looking into buying this game, don't be scared, try it yourself and refund it if it isn't up to your taste.

I should add a comment that I have stopped playing this game because of what I see as a design flaw.  It is far too easy to get to a state in the game where people stop working because they have saved up plenty of money, so they don't need the income.  As a matter of fact, it is hard NOT to get to this state (at least, it is for me).  Yes, I know, you can build a town hall and adjust the economics, but in the games I've played, by the time I do that, and can reduce someone's pay 300% (or whatever), they've already got plenty saved up.

Once you get to this state, the villagers stop building...and, well, this is a city builder, is it not?  A city builder where the people refuse to build isn't a city builder any more.

If you then get food storage and market stall and set storage to buy from locals then find the ones most supplied and set them in the market stall provided you have excess jobs you have filled the requirements to attract people so build more houses. The more people at the start the better and the more labourers available for the farm in March the better so I often sack people from jobs that I can for March to get the lots planted quickly. Once the town hall is built you can set this automatically. Then Trade is needed after this to start selling charcoal and buying iron etc I also buy salt so I can do dried fish and then build on other things as I have other buildings.",1698166508,1698166508,True,5,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Supreme leaders of the gaming world. You made a game with every small detail included in a city building game that one can dream of. Where were you my whole life.

To be honest, I have played for some time till i discovered on Steam and immediately jumped on to that journey. This game is mind blowing and a real big thanks for the experience.

The updates are getting better also which is good as we get more and more content now. (Will still get the additional expansion when i get a extra buck)  but the given content is already a nice hand full.

In the long run this game must please always stay in Early Access mode so that you never stop working on it.

It has a really good transport system, where everything can be moved by hand > cart > wagon. carts are what you'll be using 80% of the time, and wagons only late game. I haven't seen many other historic city builders have such a good transportation mechanic, most just have workers moving a number of good to the place. 

And the construction is fantastic! 3 phases in each of collecting goods there, and then building the frame, and then building the actual building (more like 2 phases). Deliverymen deliver goods from say the lumberjacks to the building, it's faster since they're dedicated to do it by their job, and the constructionmen can then focus on simply building the other buildings that already have construction goods there. 

My only problem with the game is that it's entirely building based. What i mean is that there isn't really roads or anything of the sort. people go from 1 building to another, and the paths are formed overtime. It's an amazing mechanic and it all works really well.

It doesn't have the typical flaws of such games, like settlers being super inefficient and stupid (like starving on their way to work, hello Dawn of Man).
Great aesthetics. You can build an idyllic village or a bustling industrial town and both would look good and pretty realistic. The music is nice and authentic to the period and place.
The best part it's still being actively developed and features are being added on a regular basis.

I hope the developer will add some new functionality for bigger towns/cities. After a certain population the micromanagement becomes a little bit tedious.
Like automated trade. I'd love to have a ""sell surplus over certain limit"" button, instead of how it works now.

1. Everything in the game works well.
2. The economy is fairly deep, but in a simple and straightforward way.
3. The graphics are a very nice compromise that looks good, but not so good that it does not allow the seamless depth of internal game calculations in a game like this.
4. The audio music and ambiance is nice and contributes to a relaxing game play, no matter how intense the impending starvation or villager abandonment might become. 
5. The villagers take awhile to seek employment, but once employed they are pretty well diligent with their jobs. 
6. There is also the option to prioritize between jobs by adjusting the individual wages for each job.
7. Winter is coming, and in this game it matters. Water travel and industry that slows or stops in the winter will stop in the game. It might be a bit more realistic if water travel slowed to a low percentage and/or extended time, rather than completely stopping, as trade to open ports can still be accomplished with sleigh and sledge.

Cons:
1. I would prefer more starting map options. Especially an option to allow the player to determine game difficulty by the ability of adjusting resource availability on new game maps, with several levels of availability, rather than the predetermined fixed values of 'Unlimited' and 'Limited'. A seeded or random map generator would also make for added replayability.
2. It would be nice for those of us from the West of Europe, if produced items such as 'Salo' and 'Horilka' included something similar from our Western/USA vocabulary, such as 'Salo(Fatback)' and 'Horilka(Vodka)'.
3. The new villagers can take awhile to decide on a job.

The whole system works well and I am excited for new elements and surprises. Ostriv means island in Ukrainian, and this game is an island retreat from stresses of unwieldy/cumbersome economic management and conflict (of other games). Tasked with developing an 18th century Ukrainian village from the standpoint of a town manager, complete with sharovary. The villagers build according to your planning and farm fields according to your set-up. I love the building mechanics. In Cities Skylines, buildings go up in a second when infrastructure projects actually take decades. Here it can take a month, or more depending on how many builders are employed. When fully employed it looks like those Amish barn raising videos, which is pretty satisfying. When the carters take a break on a bench under the poplar tree, it seems satisfying for them as well (instead of lowering their heads in sorrow). Crop rotation mechanics and trading take a little to figure out, but they work well. For myself, the cultural/historical touches are particularly lovely, with family dynamics and different living quarters all playing a role in the society that builds up.

I like the sandbox build but I think the formula for food mix and amount is set too high for smaller groups. You're almost forced to quickly build a trade center before you can even get your farms set. And even if you manage to do so, it's either people are starving from lack of money or not enough balance of said food. In those times, food was food, didn't matter what type it was. I can see balance being a target if you had the health clinic available for medicine, but not when you are just starting out with less than 100 people. And balancing money so your people can afford the market and not bankrupting yourself is very difficult as well. Seems like the algorithm needs a little work. Aside from that, it is fun to watch people run around and just do their thing. I would like to have more decoration options and control over the roads they make. Maybe allow for entertainment like music festivals or something. Market Stalls, Granery's and especially the Warehouses are limited to the amount of resources it can hold. I think the farmers should sell directly through the market and skip the Granery. That would free up space for other needed items. Maybe give the farmers their own personal stall whenever they have excess vegetables or honey they need to sell for money. Not only would that provide a job for them, but their income would be their own and we can tax farmers separately from the other residential housing, hence giving us more income for the town coffers. I have yet to see the storymode on this game, nor have I seen any updates on the Health building that was supposed to be included into the game in upcoming patches. I'm not sure if the Dev's gave up on this game. I really would like to see more updates on this soon. I put yes to recommend this game for sandbox builders out there, but the game needs more work and the lack of story does put one to sleep during this game.
Edit: Everything above is still accurate, However.. the balancing is still off by quite a bit.. The food portion has improved recently with more options of home farmers selling goods. But the financing is still off. It is nearly impossible to balance the income vs the payouts with the need of trade or third party mods. So I am changing my vote to Negative because not only is this game incomplete but it looks as though the devs have moved on to other projects and have rendered this game as TOO DIFFICULT to play.",1634237472,1691541536,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,True

New features have been added from time to time which is an achievement given that the game is being supported in the midst of the war in Ukraine.

It may be an early access game but if they decided this was the game it would feel like a complete package and leave me satisfied.

From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by its charm and attention to detail. The graphics are stunning, with picturesque landscapes and beautifully designed structures that bring the world to life.

One of the standout features of Ostriv is its realistic simulation mechanics. The game truly makes you feel like you're managing a growing settlement, as you navigate through the complexities of resource management, trade, and infrastructure development. It's incredibly satisfying to see your town flourish under your careful planning and decision-making.

The level of depth in Ostriv is impressive. The game offers a wide range of buildings and technologies to unlock, allowing you to tailor your city to your own unique vision. Whether you want to focus on agriculture, industry, or cultural pursuits, Ostriv provides the tools and flexibility to create a thriving community that reflects your strategic choices.

What sets Ostriv apart from other city builders is its emphasis on historical accuracy. The game is set in the 18th century, and the developers have clearly put in a tremendous amount of research and love into recreating the era. From the architectural styles to the authentic sounds and ambient atmosphere, Ostriv transports you to a bygone era in a way that few games can.

Furthermore, the developers have shown incredible dedication and engagement with the community. Regular updates and bug fixes ensure that the game continues to improve and evolve over time. The support and responsiveness of the development team are truly commendable.

In summary, Ostriv is an exceptional city building game that excels in its attention to detail, realistic mechanics, and historical accuracy. It's a joy to play and offers endless possibilities for creativity and strategic thinking. If you're a fan of the genre, Ostriv is an absolute must-play.",1689325755,1689325755,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Advantages:
1. slavic setting;

5. I like that all the small NPC has their unique names and I like their thoughts;

Disadvantages:
1. The game became boring in 20-30 hours when I understood all game mechanics.

I love a realistic city-building game that uses a non-rigid-grid system because IRL we don't have grids. We just freely draw things.

Therefore this game uses that. I'm going to list down things I love and what I wish this game would have.

Likes

Infrastructure

1. Grid-less building system. This is important to build along the terrain. hilly, river, valley, we can follow the flow. And your city skyline will look beautiful as it follows the terrain profile.

You can make your city looks organic and every building is built like a lego pieces. You can employ only one builder and  he can still construct the building fast as this depends on your efficiency in your logistic system to deliver the building material to the sites. So the masterbuilder only needs to wait there and build it piece by piece. You can see the project management diagram and the timeline as it is constructed. When the wood is needed and when nail is needed.

2. Citizens walk-path creating a ground with lesser grass. Thus you can see the area in your town which are busier or not due to the grass-less ground. To me, I never found such mechanic in any city-building game except The Foundation. Though The Foundation is too cartoonesque and I dont really like the way it looks.

3. The resources system that is similar to Banished. Here you have to identify where your citizen is and know where to find a strategic area where a market the supply chain of a market is feasible. You can see what your citizen is selling on the table (its so much fun seeing your other citizens going and buying it)

So you can see the product being carried by a worker who can opt to carry with their bare hands (lesser quantity), or by cart. You need to build a cart shed where a carpenter needs to build and maintain those damn carts (because it breaks due to wear and tear) and a worker needs to attend the cart and on standby mode to deliver things across your busy town,

There is also wagon system where it needs a living horse. Yes, and the horse needs to be fed by hay and that hay needs to be harvested only on mowing season which is summer where it will dry on a hay dryer. Its so realistic that every part of your living city needs each other as it grow.

Economy

4. Economic system here is the nearest to the actual world. After playing this game, it helps me to understand better the basic economic system in the world we live in. 

Every citizen have their own amount of savings and you pay their salary and tax them based on that amount of money circulating in your city. So in early stage, your citizen will be poor and will work any job if there is any vacancy. No matter how low the salary offered.

However, in late game, they will get richer and no matter how big your population is, you will have to tax them higher so that there is a tension and struggle for them to keep paying the tax and in return go outside, and work, this is why in a developed country, the tax is high and the economy is high, the income disparity is low. So they will work their ass off to pay your implemented tax.

This game taught me that a person needs to create value in order to prosper, the town needs to produce something and sell it to other region for it to prosper and get extra money circulate into the system.

4.1 Another thing is your citizen can sell things to you, and you can buy them and tax them. For example, there is a big ol land, first, you can charge them house rents like in Tropico. Second, you can tax their land size, and how do you think they gonna pay the rent? Yes, by selling produce that they grow on the land back to you, and you sell the produce like cucumber, pumpkins, and etc back to the other citizens. Isnt that fun.

It is a living economy system and its organic.

5. The production chain is complex (not complex enough that it tires and bore you to a chore)

Like I said, everything needs each other.

Farming

6. Farming system. In Ostriv, you have to apply crop rotation practice because the soil will be deemed useless once the nutrient is eaten by the crops harvested. and people back then uses cow dung as their organic fertilizer, so in an optimum situation. You need to rear cattle and let them eat and poop in one of your farm field to make it thrive again.

If you have multiple farms, you need to manually choose which farm to grow what and which cattle to eat and poop where, so you can hire a manager which bring us to the next point I love about Ostriv is that the function of a manager that can really be seen.

7. Managers. In other games, usually we hire manager just to make it more efficient by certain percentage and it can be translated in multipliers. But here, the manager really work and take away the multitasking so you dont have to. That is what a manager for right. Again, another realistic element. The manager will automatically implement your plan to grow which crops for the next season and next season.

8. Function of the managers. - Seasonal Hiring is another form that I love. This is to increase productivity and making your crops production more optimized as people in the past really romanticize the agriculture element because what do you want to eat if nobody is producing the food.

So, most citizen will not do anything else and only focus on growing foods. On early stage of your city development, food are scarce and your citizens are not many too. Therefore they cant work 2 job in one time. seasonal hiring is the solution. 

So you can have the same citizen to work on your Smelter smelting iron ore during the off season, and working on your farm during on season. Therefore, you still pay them wages and they still in return provide you with the service for you to achieve your goal.

However, you cant engage a seasonal hiring system unless you hire a lady chancellor in your town hall. This is what people miss about when they creating a city building game or management game, they don't really put functionality in roles, be it governor, manager or a supervisor, etc. This game is an example when someone makes a game with love.

The developer shows that he truly understand what a city builder player wants. We perceive something as in real world. We want to work hard on early stage and will wish to be more relaxed in later part of our life. And focus to develop other parts later in a more relaxed way.

Same goes in game, we do things on our own and later we hire people to do it for us. This kind of mechanic is lacking in some management game although the name 'management'.

Dislikes

Although I hardly hate this game because it doesnt really bother me but its worth mentioning in order to improve this game further and so that it can be polished with every update and overhaul.

1. Linear path of the citizen walking. I rarely see any game in the world uses a system that if a citizen / subject of the city walks and collided with other citizens, it moves away to avoid being collided. Here in Ostriv, the citizen is walking in a straight line and still penetrates the other citizens. It is more realistic if carts and wagons also have to wait their turn to go through at an intersection.

This is also the same with the incoming carts and wagon from the outside town, it should wait their turn behind the other cart / wagon before doing business in the trading post / trading dock.

2. Lack of modular system in buildings. I wish the building have the options to build extra modular component and it can be used to increase efficiency or any other feature.

Maybe you can build a wagon shed and add an extra module for added wagon parking spot.

Or a farm with an extra dwellings where a laborer can live and sleep there during on season to increase efficiency.

or perhaps an up-gradable warehouse / granary / or production chain building which uses nearby extra space for the module to be built.

Relaxing and authentic soundtracks. Attention to detail in every part of the game from families' genealogy to the varieties in the vegetable garden. You must hire the most suitable workers for every manufacturing in your village, gather resources, harvest crops on the field, and build various buildings for trading, production, etc. 

But Ostriv isn't about war or strategy. The game only provides experience with market relations with your neighbors, at least at this review posting time. 

If you are interested in how the average Ukrainian village looked like in the XVIII century or just looking for a relaxed city-building game with attention to detail I would totally recommend this game to you.

That it's a single dev project hasn't held it down, and you can tell it's a passion project.

The old Ukrainian inspired setting is great, I love all the supply chain mechanics so far- and while it's a little more chill right now than Banished, it may be getting harder with more complexity being added.

(Really the way it's 'more chill' is that if you go bankrupt you are always saved by a 'loan' but to be fair balancing economy in this game to NOT go bankrupt is something I struggle with anyway so it's just as well lol)

My favorite mechanic is the vegetable gardens that some village houses you place can build- where if you give them enough land you can buy back excess veggies to sell in markets yourself to those who live in the smaller houses and row houses.

I admit my least favorite mechanic is the automatic generation of paths/roads along very traveled routes, just because it does make it tricky to try and have decorative green areas, you have to be quick to fence them off with the decorative fencing.

But all in all, despite being early access, I've played over 300 hours of the game in the couple of years or whatever I've owned it, and Alpha 5 guarantees I'll be putting in hundreds of more hours.

[b]Ostriv[/b] is an absolutely wonderful and charming survival city builder. It feels a lot like [b]Banished[/b], but makes some vast improvements over this predecessor. 

The biggest thing that stands out is that it does away with the grid so we can make realistic, organically developing villages and towns. Also, the level of detail in the animations is amazing. Your village really comes to life as workers move each commodity around, and even market stalls accurately represent what they are selling. The village houses can even have their own gardens, and residents can sell food to a granary, which can then be sold in the market! Finally, the building models are outstanding, with a lot of nice details like embroidery on the market stall awnings. The village houses mix and match a lot of modular design elements, and I have yet to notice two that look like copies of each other.

Despite this being early access, what is here so far is more than enough to get a great building experience with layers of complexity to residents' needs, the village economy, trade, and the supply chain. I have yet to want to build something that isn't already in the game [i](Edit after another six hours: I would like to see more food preservation options, but spoilage was just added in the most recent update.)[/i], but I'm excited to see how far we can go with this in the future!",1687386673,1687513622,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's slower and more deliberate than some other builder games, but it's super fun to watch the detailed building process for each building. You can literally watch each post and plank getting placed. Building a large, self-sustaining town feels like a serious accomplishment. You'll feel some decent challenge in learning to balance your budget, to expand deliberately without overdoing it, and to keep your work force correctly sized. I love how paths generate where your villagers walk, it gives everything a naturalistic, lived-in sort of look. The game presents a good challenge without being overly punishing and the continued development is great, with new buildings and resources having just come out recently. The farming is pretty neat in the way that your fields have limited nutrients and you have to decide on crop rotations so you don't exhaust the soil. Building up to more complex supply chains is tough but feels rewarding.

It might not be exciting for every person, but something keeps drawing me back to this game.

I try to keep my people happy (supply them well with the things they consume), and go about building the production chains and so on.
The game has a ""raw"" feel to it, not polished.  It is not possible to have fine grained statistics about your production and consumption, only yearly (and year to now), many tedious, repetitive things:
1. Filling market stalls or stores with a particular good as much as the storage capacity of the stall/store (they would only take 100 at a time)
2. General micromanagement of things (one example: I want to set all the chicken coops to keep 10 hatchlings, you have to manually go over each coop)
3. There is no place for one to know, for example, how many citizens are not looking for a job, nevermind who they are.
4. When citizens leave a job position on their own, you may not notice (for example a brick factory with several workers won't show any issue if there is one or two missing), or even if you notice, you don't know where the former worker went, or why.
5. There is no blueprint mechanism, every single building gets added by the player, one by one.
6. Using the snapping tool for rowhouses generally skews the buildings in unpleasant ways, before v5 update 2 when the corner rowhouses were introduced, the footprint of the buildings were 90 degree angles, and the snapping would work.  Mysteriously, with the introduction of v5 update 2 (when corner rowhouses were introduced) there are no more corners, but a diagonal that does not snap well.

Despite the annoyances, the game has a lot of personality to it that makes it very enjoyable.

Finally, I liked a lot that I submitted a bug report and it was acknowledged within a few days and corrected within a week.

The gameplay is solid, and it manages to be challenging but fair on every stage of the game. The unique selling points are properly integrated with the mechanics rather than added as a gimmick or put in just for the trailer. The graphics, while simplified, can still effectively convey the atmosphere of the game. I have never felt lost even once while playing because the game gently guides the player without railroading them by integrating what is usually a separate tutorial, quest, and hint system. The game seems to have a subtle message, even though there is no story - it is effectively delivered by the gameplay itself. And the cherry on the top is that I played for 20+ hours and I experienced absolutely no technical issue, which is already a significant achievement compared to other early access games.

[hr][/hr]
Let's get straight to the main unique selling point. Unlike in other city builders, we're not creating yet another communist utopia - we're adding actual capitalism to the mix. The local currency is no longer just a generic, averaged-out ""happiness"", where half of the people can live in a misery as long as the other half compensates for it with hedonistic decadence. Here, we're working with actual cash, and each household has a separate budget that they use to satisfy their needs. All the resources you produce are sold on the market, either to your villagers or to the neighbouring towns. It's not enough for your town in general to prosper - all the people in it have to prosper as well. You can't just raise the taxes and compensate for that by building a nice park, because your people won't be able to afford food. You can't just ignore annoyed people until they go away and get replaced, because they participated in the local economy so they are richer than the people that will replace them, and the economy would be bleeding money. You can't just let people hoard wealth, because it's the flow of the money that keeps the capitalism healthy and makes jobs and markets meaningful. So obviously, I ended up reinventing socialism, so everyone can live fairly comfortably as long as they keep contributing in at least a basic way. And I did it not so much out of personal preferences, but because that seemed like the system that would work the best in the long run here (and because I actually saw the simulated consequences of the alternatives).

The best thing for me is that as long as everything is properly organized, the town does run smoothly without constant supervision and micromanagement. Get something done right, and you can move on to the next challenge. But if you mess something up, you have to keep putting work into maintaining it. However, you still actually need to grow and progress, because the only way for everything to work smoothly is to satisfy all of the people's needs, and that pretty much requires at least one of each kind of building. And each building has its own needs, and you need to keep the logistics and infrastructure capable of handling everything, and so on.

The game is relaxing without being boring, and it probably just replaced 2 or 3 titiles from the list of my favorite games that i periodically return to every once in a while for that very purpose. I have lots of minor comments, but not because the game is lacking in any way - quite the opposite, it's so close to perfection in simplicity that every imperfection, however small, will get noticeable. And even if further development gets delayed or interrupted for some reason, the game is already worth its cost as it is.",1686243237,1686243279,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

Is it the most complex? No, not at all. It lacks micromanagement features such as dedicated trade routes or supply lines, instead relying on supply pressure from warehouse settings and such, and production chains are rather simple. However, there's another level of sophistication in the way that villages can be designed and laid out, or philosophies of arranging the economy between trade and internal economies, and the systems behind that lend themselves to the atmosphere of managing an 18th century country village. It won't be an efficiently managed capitalist society; it will be a rural mercantile early modern settlement, and that's perfect to the theme.

It's also quite a pretty game. The smoking chimneys, the flow of the villagers from the village centers and market towns, children running to their friend's houses, and the wagons plying the desire paths of trodden earth. The naturally developing organic layout of a gridless builder, that can be as organized or chaotic as one wishes, with a flexible enough system to support whatever layout you might desire within reason. It is as good a game of design as of function.

It can still chug at higher populations as each villager is simulated, living, eating, going to the church and tavern and surgeon, changing jobs and dying at the end of a long life (hopefully). It does crash every fourth or fifth game, but that's more likely a result of my elderly computer, which otherwise can run it quite nicely, so it's difficult to blame the game on these issues from my end. The fact that it can run well on my machine is a miracle.

(running on i7 -970GPU -32Gb RAM) That took me 97 Hours of play time so for £20 and in Early access not bad I would say.
AND I absolutely LOVED it, what an awesome game this is. The build animations alone make it worth £20.

Its a hard start so make sure you watch some YouTube vids on the how to set up the first 9 houses. after you get past the first 2 or 3 winters its a lot easier. BUT KEEP AN EYE ON FOOD  for both humans and livestock.
 I hope in the future some updates will fix the current issues that are in the game (yes fully aware of the devs predicament in a war zone hats of to you (all).)
needs to have more clarification as to how many staff are actually needed to run each building as its not that clear.  Uneven ground is just too common on some new maps and needs to have a land editor. warehouses get full very fast it would help if you could just sell off stuff from a menu without the need to speak with next door maps. Tree felling is just too slow needs to be much faster. When you dismantle a building sometimes (most) the wood and nails are left on the spot in a pile and so you can not rebuild until its moved which can take OVER a year in game time. I am sure the MILK needs looking into as its extremely hard to make any and as for cheese never saw the light of day in my run through not once.
All said and done this game is simply beautiful and I do hope it can be polished up in the coming months if not years (wars allowing).
Well done to the team running this its superb work.

I'd love to be able to see the entire family tree of every person, even the deceased and when you clicked on a grave it showed what they looked like and their family tree still. Seeing all the generations even if they passed away would be fun.
The new row houses are so great! I'd love to see different shades or maybe some stay stone and others turn white.

The way you have to manage economy is what got me curious. You pay wages to your workers, but you have to get that money back to you again. So you manage house and land renting prices to tax your citizens and also the price of the products you sell to your villagers (like food, clothes, processed goods...)
Houses can come with garden so your citizens grow all the food you need and more. Because you can buy the food that your villagers produce and then sell it to your other villagers, so all your people have access to that food....

It has really deep and nice mechanics:
-FARMING: Lots of animals and all of them useful resources, 3 tipes of nutrients in the soil, crop rotation, fertilization using animals,also what you feed to the animals...
-BUILDING: super detailed animations of building creation, they have entry points, and gridless. Also some of them you can modify the shape.
-LOGISTICS : You can build carts and wagons, carts can be used by any villager or have special ""carters"" which can help deliver any resource in your city to its destination. Wagons also the same but with horses and much bigger amounts of resources.

It's very addictive and I recommend it to all my friends that like city builders and resource management. I would love to see market stalls visually adjust to what items are being sold. For example a stall that sells fruit would become colorful and abundant with fruit. A fish stall would display fish. A stall with clothes and boots would show clothes and boots. A stall with meat, eggs, spices, etc would display these. A vegetable stall shows veg being sold. I think it would give life to the markets and town just like a real market! I do have trouble creating hay on the drying racks for my cows so I would like to see a better description, like does it need to be harvested from a fallow field or any area with grass on the map. My cows die a lot because of this. Different types of cows and chickens. Maybe ducks for eggs and down feathers. Maybe add blankets, scarves, gloves to the textile. I would love if we could customize the gardens in the 'house with gardens.' It would be cool if the villagers were able to harvest fruit trees planted from the decorations tab.

There's a wide variety of buildings useful in different ways, economy is complex.

Trade is necessary and very realistic, every map has a drawback with certain resources being inaccessible making trading a must. Stack what you got and trade for what you need.

There's also a concept of purchasing goods from local producers. The houses you can build can have gardens in their plots, you might have someone who has bees and produces honey, and another person produce a bunch of onion and or garlic, or even a little bit of everything.

You can purchase the goods from them to sell at market stalls automatically, and further stimulate the economy. There's a lot of depth to this.

Choose from many maps with different terrain features and get to building. Build farms and house plots with farms as big or as small as you like. Build homes with farms and the people feed themselves. Export Charcoal (or anything!) to make cash, and you have a basic economy going! And from there, you grow!Even at alpha 4 the game is incredibly polished. A self sustaining city is attainable, and luckily you can trade for anything you can't find yourself on the map. Intuitive supply and production chains, wonderfully managed seasonal labor (you have to mod or micro manage this in other games) and a complex economy to manage.Building a town hall immediately is essential to manage money. Once you can figure out the best balance for your money, growth becomes very manageable. So excited for Alpha 5! Buy now though, because the game is already incredible and only getting better. And you can support Ukraine and help them return to the peaceful idyllic steppe land they deserve.-------EDIT AFTER ALPHA 5!!-------Major upgrade! So many quality of life improvements that I didn't even realize I wanted! Incredible update and very impressive considering the conditions!

City that grows and expands organically. The music perfectly accompanies the leisurely and medievalesque rhythm.

Although it isn't finished yet - the developer is from Kharkiv, Ukraine, and I have tremendous patience and understanding for the challenges of developing a game during a full-scale war where repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure lead to widespread and sustained power outages - everything that is in the game works beautifully. Eventually I get to a point where I feel like there are no more milestones to strive for - growing the town big enough for a tavern, etc. - but I love the game so much that I just start over with a new settlement. This game is really great comfort food for me while still being enough of a challenge to keep me interested. One thing that I especially enjoy that makes it stand out from other city management-type games is the very specific sense of time and place. This is a settlement/village/town in Ukraine in the 1720's, and that is infused throughout the whole game. Your townspeople all have individual names, and you can hover over and see their wholly Ukrainian names - Oleh Carpenko, Olena Kravchuk, Olha Simonenko, Dmytro Shevchenko, Mykhailo Kovalenko, etc. Along with the fairly standard and common potatoes, beef, milk, and wheat, products that can be produced, purchased, and/or traded include horilka and salo, along with sunflower oil, beetroot, cabbage, honey, buckwheat, and horseradish, which continually reminds you that we're specifically in Ukraine. 

Things I'd love to see or that I'm looking forward to being added as the game gets finalized:
- a brewery or distillery so that I can produce mead or horilka myself, rather than trading for horilka with other towns
- a creamery or similar dairy building where I can produce cheese, butter, and cream
- iron deposits so I can mine iron myself rather than trade for it
- apiary so I can produce honey in quantities rather than buying it from villagers or trading for it with other towns
- addition of the health buildings currently labeled ""coming soon"" in the buildings menu
- perhaps the ability to farm vegetables so that I can have a stock of carrots, cabbage, beets, etc. without being dependent on whatever extra the villagers with gardens are willing to sell me
- Steam achievements, because I love collecting them and having these little mini-goals to strive for in a game like this where it's just ongoing management

Nothing really changed, expect more buildings...

Bugged buildings which not working at all: 
Easy starter things like set up storage and fill up with special stuff, SIMPLY NOT WORKS, after 3 Years!

There is no logic or fluent resource chain process. 

You just build them, watch simulation, hire workers, wait 10 minutes, fill up the storage, set work off, REPEAT...

If you're expecting a fluent logic villager build simulator with an existing working economy process, this isn't the game you're looking for.

All what you get is kinda like Unity Assets you can plop down and watch, there is simply no real logic Village life behind.

It's more than a slow editor watching-the-construction Simulator, because you simply have nothing to do, nothing to worry about, everything is too easy and too fast to collect.

There is a reason why there is no ""cheat"" mode with endless starter resources, otherwise you would see and play everything in 2 hours refund time...

NO real gameplay lets you expand to improve production lines, new technologies, no adventures, just no difficulties at all.

I really would like to love this Game and build 1000+ Villager Town, but whole Game mechanic already bugging out with 20 Houses and 30 Villagers...

Simply nothing let me come back and play on, good we get !MANOR LORDS! soon.",1676227207,1676227675,False,3,0,0.301493942737579346,0,True,False,True

I was very excited to see where the development of Ostriv would go, and got my hands on it as soon as it was available in early access. 

I have been so impressed by the attention to detail and the overall performance of the game, I haven't yet seen any lag when my towns grow very large. As it is still in early access and active development, there are areas that are lacking, but recent updates have addressed some of these issues very well. I believe they have also done a little bit of re-balancing, which has improved play a lot.

As others have mentioned, once you set up your supply chains and balance your economy there is not a lot to do, other than to continue placing the same buildings and growing your town - in my experience this is a thing that happens in almost every city management game, especially ones with a limited number of buildings/supply options -  but there has been a lot of improvement to this game in the last two years, and this has continued while the devs' country is at war.

-Gridless building
-Don't have to build roads; roads get created over time depending on usage by villagers
-depth of building management, including workforce distribution, crop management
-trading with other towns and also with your own population
-pace of game; it's slow on normal speed but feels nice and relaxing. It can take a few in game months to finish constructing a building
-those building reflections in the water, so pretty
-hopefully much more to come

Cons
-Biggest con for me is the optimization, especially when it comes to cpu. It's almost always at 100 usage and hopefully it can get optimized in the near future.

Its a game that has truly been created with love and care, you can see it in the details that are everywhere in this game.
If you are expecting a brutal survival colony build, no absolutely not. There is little punishment but the occasional family leaving due to hunger, lack of clothes or boots to buy or poverty. But that doesnt affect your village/town much. SOmeone else will move in and just take over.
The only thing to manage properly is your start and the money but once you have mastered that and make sure you never run out of food for your animals, there is little to nothing that can actually go wrong.
Which is also abit of an issue.
Once you have built everything that the game currently offers and produce enough, the only thing left to do is build more of the same and finetune the production/demand. Which can become abit boring and repetitive.
but obviously it still is in full development and in early acces, so its bound to become more than what it is in its current state, i just wish the dev would hire a bunch of guys by now to speed up the process instead of 1man show.

all in all, if you like this sort of slower building games then Ostriv is highly recommended. If you like more action and challenge i would say look elsewhere or come back at a later stage when development is further ahead.


The start is the crucial element and there is only one way to go pretty much.

Such as a fisherman taking what seems like a long time resting when Food is running out and there isn't enough food to feed the village. As well, there doesn't seem to be enough food items that you can set up in the beginning without pilling on the need for other buildings just to use it. How are you supposed to feed your village if you have to wait too long into the game to set up any kind of food production, and then that food production just can't keep up.

...I believe that they need to work on that function with the villagers resting so as to get more work done. Or at least add in some basic food production for the beginning of the game, such as Gatherer's. Something that you can get going early on that doesn't require too much extra work and resources to be able to store something edible for your villagers. As well, chances are, if you were hungry you would be more worried about finding food, rather then to sit around being lazy. That Take A Rest function in the game makes your villagers far too lazy, and it seems like they can't get nothing done until they're complaining because they're out of food.

...Because of that matter, the Take A Rest function I haven't quite figured out if I really like this game yet, or if I'd rather just play Banished. At least in Banished the fisherman can fish year round and doesn't necessarily need a boat just to do so. Need something. That season setting also messes up the game since it seems like during the winter there's nothing the villagers can do about food, just sit around and starve. While meanwhile, us as players can't really do much to try to prevent that from happening.

I bought this game, expecting it to be a lot like Banished, so far though I'm almost regretting buying it. So yes, in question I believe that the developer has to work on the Food section of the game, as well as that of Health.",1670965039,1671077020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Es hat eine sehr gute tiefe zu Details und ist zwar doch recht leicht zu erlenen (Danke google), aber trotz aller Tipps schwer zu meistern. Nach knapp 27 Stunden habe ich nun meine erste, richtige Siedlung und nähere mich erstmal den 100 Einwohnern. Das einzige, womit ich noch Probleme habe, ist das Finanzsystem des Spieles. Da muss man viel rumprobieren, um das jeweilige Optimum zu finden. Generell greift vieles ineinander und ist voneinander abhängig. Als Beispiel: Bezahle ich meine Siedler schlecht, weil ich sparen möchte, setze aber die Preise für den Markt zu hoch, können sie sich nichts mehr leisten und es kommt kein Geld mehr in die Staatskasse. Dazu kommt ein finde ich fast einmaliger Sog aus dem Kreislauf ""Problem-Lösung-neues Problem-Lösung-neues Problem"" etc. Alles ist so wunderbar voneinander Abhängig und verschachtelt. Ostriv ist definititv mein neues Lieblingsspiel im Aufbau-Genre und hat Anno 1800 abgelöst. Meinen Respekt an die Entwickler. Ihr macht einen tollen Job und das Spiel ist jeden Cent einzeln Wert. Als Abschluss noch: Das spiel ist gemächlich. Auch mit Zeitbeschleunigung. Wer den schnellen Erfolg sucht, ist hier falsch. Entspannt bei einem Gin zuschauen, wie die Siedlung langsam wächst ist das Motto.

Ostriv is, in short, a masterpiece of a build-up game. It has a very good depth of detail and is quite easy to learn (thanks google), but difficult to master despite all the tips. After almost 27 hours, I now have my first real settlement and am approaching 100 inhabitants. The only thing I still have problems with is the game's financial system. You have to try out a lot to find the optimum. In general, nearly everything is interconnected and interdependent. For example, if I pay my settlers badly because I want to save money, but set the prices for the market too high, they can no longer afford anything and no more money comes into the state coffers. In addition, there is an almost unique pull from the cycle of ""problem-solution-new problem-solution-new problem"", etc. Everything is so wonderfully interdependent and intertwined. Ostriv is definitely my new favourite game in the building genre and has replaced Anno 1800. My respect to the developers. You're doing a great job and the game is worth every penny. Finally, the game is leisurely. Even with time acceleration. If you're looking for quick success, you're in the wrong place.

I wish there was more information explaining things - like how to perfect crop rotation. Or how taxes work. Or where to find some of the resources before you decide where to plan out your city. But all of these things I expect will be ironed out before full release.

But the graphics are so good. The snow coming in and melting away feels so cool. And the fact that people make their own paths? That's so f'ing cool. I wish more games took that route instead of making you build roads. Some games it makes sense to build your own roads (like Anno), but other games, like Manor Lords or similar games, it doesn't. Please encourage other devs/games to do natural roads. I'm sure it's probably moderately difficult to implement cleanly, but it's SO satisfying when it works. Captain of Industry is another good example of self-generating roads. And it's awesome to watch. I'd play games where things automatically make roads all day if I could. 

Imagine if they made a driving game that makes roads where you drive. It's the closest thing to real life that most games get to. 

Sorry, got off topic. Buy this game if you want to play a town simulator that doesn't take itself too seriously and is easy to chill out and play. The hardest part is keeping up with the population sometimes.

Very enjoyable.

Love the detail. Soundtrack. Commerce system, and balance. 

Needs more goods and services. More clarity on how the economy works. More ability to produce goods. More variety in Trade partners; their needs/offerings should vary, prices should be negotiable. 

I enjoy running up debt. Their should be reward for not running up debt for extended periods. 

Hope the dairy, and alcohol production come soon. 

Educated population should be more productive and creative. Uneducated should be able to gain skill points for staying in one particular role. 

Technology becoming obsolete over time with innovations and advancements in productivity please. After a town has entered the 1900s they shouldn't still be using wagons, and push carts.

[Edit as of 20-6-2021] So apparently the devs have read this review. Or maybe it was just never intended. But  i just played the game again. to see how things had chanced since my last attempt at playing. And its going in the right direction. For one, you can now choose if you want to hire only woman or only men for a task or if you want both to be an option. The game still has a preference for certain tasks if you don't mess with the options. but they do override the default when chosen. Kudo's to the devs for that.
They have also made the finances in the game a tiny bit more clear. but the default setting for how much your workforce earns is still not balanced to anybody new to playing the game. However there are guides on here you can use to help you get past the first 3 years.
Still a work in progress, but the devs are hard at work, looking at how this game has improved in the last year.

Good Early Access city-builder that has lots of potential, some uniqueness, interesting economy and is already a lot of fun! I didn't notice any bugs in gameplay yet and there is quite some content already. I'm looking forward to what else is coming!
You can enlarge the UI (font is pretty small in certain areas), but the dialogs don't adapt, so at larger scales you end up with unreachable buttons outside your screen.

Long version, mostly listing what stands out to me:
The controls were very intuitive for me. On the top right of your screen you see buildings currently waiting to be constructed and I love that you just drag & drop those for changing the construction priority! I like that much better than the typical way of selecting a building and giving it a priority number or high/normal/low or whatever.

The game plays in the early 18th century in Ukraine, so jobs are separated into jobs for men and jobs for women, or both. That's an interesting choice for such a game. For some jobs the default can be changed, for some it can't. E.g. workers in the Smithy are always men.

For some buildings you can adjust their size. Fields and orchards, which is pretty obvious. But also if you choose to build houses with gardens, you can adjust the garden size and change the position of the house within the property. There are different models for the houses (randomized), they don't all look the same.
There are family trees, household wealth and the content of their house's storage. You also have the possibility to give them financial help (a litte bit out of the city funds). If they run out of money, they'll leave your village. Lack of food variety is another reason for them to leave. If you have free houses and enough jobs available, people will join your village.

I like the whole economic system. You pay the workers and laborers from city funds. Families pay rent for their houses to you, plus land tax if they have a garden and other taxes you can set if you want to. They grow fruit and vegetables in their gardens, which they either consume themselves or you can buy from them. On the other hand, you can sell your products to the families (food and also things they can't produce themselves, like firewood). As soon as you have a trading post, you can also trade with other villages.
One thing I found weird in the beginning, is that there are no iron mines on the maps (there are multiple to choose from), although you need iron/iron ore in order to be able to make nails for construction etc. I'm someone who usually doesn't like to trade and prefers to be self-sufficient in this kind of games, but together with the rest of the economy system here, I don't mind.

The construction animations are nice and detailed. Other animations could still be improved upon, but the village looks lively already.

Another thing to be improved: It feels like font sizes are all over the place. I could read most of the things fine, but in places it got so small, that I had to make the UI larger (which thankfully you can). However, dialogs aren't responsive, so that at larger scales you're missing options and buttons. 130% seems to be the largest feasible without functionality loss.
I didn't even notice this until I googled how to demolish a building.",1667497338,1667497338,True,1,0,0.467289716005325317,0,True,False,True

Pros:
a. Non grid based building, so you can build wherever you want.
b. Adequate types of buildings

d. Trade allows you to earn credits, apart from taxes on income and land
e. Some maps feature more resources than others
f. Ability to assign minimum employees and have the structure be productive
g. No Combat!

Cons:
a. Insufficient dashboards. It is difficult to keep track of crops and some attention is required so that all your fields don't go fallow at the same time
b. Goods committed for trade with one city are not deducted till they are picked up by the trade caravan. Sometimes this leads to committing the same goods to two trade partners at the same time.
c. No indication of locations where well water is good for human consumption.
d. No indication of cost of each building
e. Some produce is meant for buildings that would come up in future versions. Barley for example can currently be used only for feeding some livestock.

That's unremarkable aside from the fact that the country the developer lives in is currently under attack by the second-largest military in the world.

Ostriv already currently beats the functionality of Banished out of the box. It also doesn't have a number of the gameplay problems that Banished has; things scale much more reasonably. There are some features that are clearly still in development, including an economy, health/education/governance systems, and closing the loop on some of the production cycles. 

My only concern, since raising concerns in the past has gotten results from the developer, is that the game doesn't have a great endgame.

While the game seems promising, in the future that is, for now I cannot recommend it due to it being nearly unplayable. The management aspect of the game is quite interesting, the graphics are amazing for an independent developper, especially from an impoverished nation such as Ukraine, but the game crashes all the fucking time.

There are small glitches which are easily fixed, and those are mostly easy to bypass but the game's constant crashes make it unplayable for me, I have checked and I am not the only player to have this issue. Sure this game is in alpha so glitches and crashes are expected but even after starting the game my game crashes at random between 10 and 30 minutes to hours after, if my city's population goes above 100 it crashes upon launching, sometimes even on the menu screen.

The developper tells you to send reports about crashes and I understand why but if I posted about the regular crashes it would take me hours, and with his home country under invasion from a superpower at the moment I doubt he might be able to look much into it. Updates are also very slow and as far as constant crashes go, have solved little to nothing, the issue does not come from my computer either I have checked.

Overall I would say wait a LONG time before buying this game if you want to play it seriously, only if you wanna test it or support the developper (the reason I bought it was because I like to buy early access independent games to test them) should you buy it in my opinion, education and health branches are also being developped and I appreciate that greatly but before that please fix the fucking crashes.

My previous review of this game was a little unfair. While it is strange and inconvenient that a game currently being developed has issues launching on current OS platforms, once I got the game up and running it's a genuinely enjoyable experience. Like in my previous review, this game has a level of historical authenticity and attention to detail that is rarely seen. The dev has really done their homework when it comes to architecture and has taken great care to make the buildings and towns in the game varied, lively, and interesting.

There is something of a learning curve when it comes to settlement management, while it's not very complicated, it deviates from the norm just enough to make me feel like I'm new to the city building genre (in a good way). The UI is familiar and simple enough to know how to use but unique enough to give me pause and think about how it works. The production chains are complex but not overbearing and executed in a way that you don't often see in city builders. Likewise, the trade system can be as complex or simple as you need it to be. It uses one of my favorite ways to visually represent trade by using a map interface, making trade less of a chore and more of a fun feature. Budgeting in the game however, can be a little confusing at first and it takes some time to get your bearings on all the options available to you. There's a lot of information to take in on your settlements economics but you are given quite a bit of control over the cash flow of your town. With a little time and tinkering it becomes second nature to navigate and adjust as needed.

Graphically this game can be a little underwhelming, that's not to say that it's bad but doesn't quite hold up to some other indie city builders that have come out in the last couple years. The building models are well detailed and textured but the characters leave a bit to be desired though I'm sure that's likely to change as the game develops. Likewise, the terrain at times feels barren save for the forests and rivers that dot the maps. There is some detail to the flora though, in the warmer months you'll see reeds and lily pads all along the rivers and grass grows on the sprawling fields. However there is a lack of bushes, rocks, or any other ground cover other than grass. One of the nice things to see is how your citizens will change their outfits to fit the time of year, it's also nice to see some variety in the clothing models used.

Things I'd like to see
-More ground cover such as shrubs, bushes, rocks, and flowers.
-Wildlife and a Hunting production chain
-Some variation in the building models for municipal and production structures
-(Maybe) a simple defense/militia system and associated production chains (though I understand if this just isn't in the cards)

TL;DR
With all that said, Ostriv is a fun, refreshing, and familiar take on the city building genre. There's very little bad about it other than getting it to work on some operating systems, but even that has a lot of work arounds (I'm using windows 10, I had to use the windows 8 compatibility work around). 
If you like city building, like history, and you're looking for a refreshing experience, pick up Ostriv.",1616002727,1658648013,True,0,0,0.459685534238815308,0,True,False,True

The fact that they can have their own gardens and grown their own food to some extent is something i've sorely missed! and editing the house layoute..! Finally!
Does it need more work, sure! But I would rather call it fine tuning whats already there.

The game drops you in with barely any tutorial or directions and the player needs to figure things out on their own at this stage of development, something that is fairly easy for an experienced city builder. 
There is information and instructions on how things work but you will need to read up a bit, checking the tooltips of buildings and good ol' trial and error.

Built a somewhat decent village.
Decided to give everybody a piece of land so that I have some more time on food chain development.
Result: 5 years into the game my budget fluctuates around 20 hryvnias and the only ones keeping me from diving deep below zero are my boys from Derkachi who periodically need some charcoal. 
Why? Because it's a Ukrainian village. If they have land - they don't need your market stalls because they already have all they need. So you're paying them salary that will sit in their pockets until their shoes get worn after which they'll lift off and go to another city because you don't have the only thing they were actually willing to buy.
Beginner tip for now: unless you're into trading - go for cows, having an ox is essential for several self-sustained production chains and horses are expensive.

Great economy, great attention to details, I'm having a blast.

10/10 would give everybody land and go broke again.

This game came out over two years ago and it was in a relatively early stage of development. Entire categories of buildings were missing, such as health and religion. It could not be called a management game in any capacity, instead it was a pretty town builder with no game mechanics behind it, which I paid 20 Euros for.

Development was extremely slow throughout the whole 2 years. The explanation given was that the dev decided to take a meticulous approach to stay faithful to historic realism. This is something I could get behind, were it not for the fact that it resulted in almost no progress in 2 years. This is where things started to feel fishy.

Fast forward to mid 2022 and the game is abandoned for good. Now, I understand that the situation in Ukraine is horrendous. However, it is customary in life that if you collect money for a product, it should be delivered or the money paid back.

I am all about safety first, but a game dev can't just say something along the lines of ""I can't do this anymore because I have no access to my computer atm."" What? Is that the excuse for abandoning the game? What if your hardware breaks down? The entire game is lost? Was everything wholely and exclusively stored on your personal computer?

People in this line of work can sometimes be refered to as digital nomads, meaning they can pretty much work from anywhere because their work is portable.

I know this is a massively unpopular opinion, and like I said, I do believe that a war in your country can cause this to happen in many ways. However, we paid you and we waited and waited for unreasonable amounts of time. I'm really only asking for some honesty as to why development was so slow and why it stopped entirely, as a customer who paid you. Is that too much to ask?

Honestly, at least lower the game's price to 9 Euros or something so that people don't get accidentally scammed.",1585578853,1652173423,False,0,1,0.46875,0,True,False,True

The game for an alpha really is quite great already, I ran into verry few bugs and whenever I had one, reloading the save resolved it every time. 
this game really has some amazing graphics and amazing mechanics, the way you have to micro manage the workers, the fact that you actually can follow the production line of stuff makes this game really satisfying. 

this game is also really relaxing and calming to play, may it be the amazing sound track, the gentle graphics or just the calming atmosphere in general. 

the only thing the game lacks a bit is a tutorial, because in the beginning you have just the right amount of stuff to build some specific buildings in a specific order, and knowing it gets really difficult at times .

Even though this game is far from complete and has its issues, it is already quite fun to play. Based on the roadmap, some pretty cool features and mechanics are still planned for the game, so I hope Yevhen and his team get to finish it in the future.

Ostriv is pretty unique for a city builder. There's a bit of a learning curve as there isn't really a full manual, so you have to restart a few times until you understand how everything works together. Every family and every building you add to your village impacts everything else. From labor, city budget, crops, food varieties, clothes and shoes - you have to balance it all and keep balancing so you don't go bankrupt, starve, or lose everyone.

A lot of the mechanics remind me of Dawn of Man - things like carts and queues, visiting traders, and animals having offspring. If you enjoyed that one, you might also like this. Gameplay is also pretty slow like in DoM. You can increase game speed but it still takes a few seasons for production chains to be constructed and for villagers to settle.

There are some similarities with Banished as well, and while both games have a bit of a learning curve (*just a bit lol*), it seems that the Ostriv team has been learning from Banished's mistakes. In the early game and later on as you trigger certain events, you'll be guided by a tutorial of sorts to construct needed buildings. I'm sure there are some people who don't mind starting over 50 times before they get it, and you'll probably restart Ostriv a few times too. It's nowhere near as brutal as Banished, though.

Obviously for a game in alpha stage, there are some issues mainly from the game not being complete, so there are certain items that are available for you to sell in the trading menu but you can't actually grow them? The UI is ok, the direction they're going for is good but some windows need improvements. For example, the Chicken coop should make feed selection more obvious (I didn't notice it at first, bought like 10 chickens and they all died immediately because no food in the coop, but tons of grain in my granary).
There's no iron to be found on the map (I actually like this realism because the majority of feudal villages didn't have an iron mine :)) so you have to keep buying it, which means you need to keep producing some extra goods that you can sell in exchange. This drives up labor cost which further depletes your budget - as I said, there is a thin balance and I'm sure it will be improved later on when the devs are able to get back to it.

Overall, a decent game already with an impressive roadmap that I'm really looking forward to be implemented. Sadly, it looks like it will take some time...",1648794713,1648794779,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Here is a list of features that you probably won't meet in other similaar games:
[b]No roads[/b]
In Ostriv you're not allowed to create roads. Your citizens will do it themselves by walking and trampling the terraing. It gives the game much more organic look of medeival village.

[b]Absence of standard grid building system[/b]
In fact there is no grid system at all. You can place you buildings anywhere you want and rotate them as well. Also it's possible to edit shape and size of house gardens, on which people will grow some crops and also pay taxes depending on their teritory size.

[b]""Step by step"" building animations[/b]
Builders in this game are not just hitting empty square with a hammer until the building magically appears from nothing in a moment. You can observe every piece of material being carried and placed right where it belongs, that makes building process extremely fascinating to watch.

[b]Citizens are actually living their lives during the game[/b]
Every npc in your village has his own name and his family. They go to work, pay taxes, grow older, raise kids that will grow up and mary some other grown up kids to create new families. The only thing is missing there is villagers happines rate and for now they only need food and clothes to be 100% happy. But maybe this was literally how it works in those times, idk :)

The game has a lot more to develop but at this time it's already playable and fun.

So before you leave your negative review also be reminded he is in a war and his life is on the line before you make assumptions of this being a crappy game etc. He does not sugar coat anything and is more transparent than any other game developer I have seen on steam or any other platform to date.

Graphics are lovely and if you want a few hours of nice gaming them maybe this is ok. Also if you want to support a Ukrainian developer then I assume this is a good option. However....

Normally I wouldn't be keen on a copy of something but Bannished hasn't really been properly developed so I'm prepared to overlook Ostriv simply being a (poor) copy of Banished. I will also make substantial allowance for something being early access but only to a point and I understand from various comments that there is zero commitment about when future developments may be released. My main complaint is that I get the impression that the game was poorly designed from the outset and this may mean future developments will be poor compromises or difficult because of the early design decisions. Had the game been well designed from the outset most of my complaints would simply not exist.

So the graphics are great and it potentially appears that the original game design was focused on graphics and copy the base idea of Banished without thinking about how it really works or will evolve. That said, Ostriv does do some things much better than Banished. I love having a counsellor who can enable seasonal work (but there are big issues with managing and prioritising that work). Also the graphics are lovely.

The labour management is horrendous. You can have jobs that are beyond critical and workers ignore them and go to something that needs absolutely nothing doing for it and finding nothing to do they just go home. Another example is trading where the worker at the trading building my have just gone of to collect something to store when a trader arrives who then patiently waits. The worker comes back with the item for storage and ignores the trader and decides it is time for some rest and by the time they get back from the rest the trader has given up and left. (also see my comment below about livestock)

There is insufficient statistics/info to properly organise and manage everyone. 

Most of the problems and weaknesses are masked because by default ""allow migration"" is enabled once you have a mayor (which you have from the outset). What this means is that any family that goes bankrupt, you cannot cloth or cannot feed just gets kicked out and replaced with a happy clothes fed family with some savings. Its a fix all bodge. Basically you have an endless flow of people, money, clothing, tools to cover up any and all problems. It doesn't, however, fix things like all livestock dying out.

The supply chains aren't developed, the buildings can't be upgraded, there are so many limitations it would take to long to list. The maps are hopeless and all pre-defined. There are virtually no resources other than trees. The only other resources that exist in the game are stone and lime and both of those are extremely limited (extremely) and inaccessible (initially until you build a bridge). Unlike Banished there are no options to forage or hunt. 

Keeping animals is relatively straightforward until none of the workforce bothers to sort out mowing grass to produce hay (and you can't direct them to do so) and then all of your animals die. So cows and other animals need hay. It doesn't matter how many hay stacks you build you cannot direct any workers to mow and collect the hay and they may decide randomly doing nothing or checking on buildings that need absolutely nothing doing is much more important than mowing grass. Thus no hay and come winter all animals die.

I would happily leave a positive review for an early access game if I could see the weakness being addressed but it just feels that many of the problems actually stem from fundamental problems originating in the core design of the game",1646688525,1646910749,False,2,0,0.478707164525985718,0,True,False,True

This game has a [i]lot[/i] of potential - it's clear how much care and attention has been put into it; building-construction in particular is a work of art, and you can watch houses get built plank-by-plank. I'll be keeping an eye on it but, for now, there are a few things that really limit the enjoyment potential of this game:

[list]
[*] The early-game build-order is set in stone; the game uses a sequence of resource crisis as a tutorial of sorts (this is good), where you need to get everyone housed before winter, then you need to get a blacksmith before your nails run-out, then you need to get a carpenter before your carts fall apart etc etc - and the game doesn't let go until you're smithing imported iron ore and tanning the hides of your cattle farm for clothing - [i]however[/i] the resource-buffer between these crisis is so thin that deviating will mean the end of your colony.  This will probably be fixed once mining etc gets added, but right now it's a bit frustrating to be forced to chose between surviving and a less-than-perfectly-optimal build-order / city-layout.

[*] There's some weirdly baked-in sexism in the in-game jobs; only men can be builders, only women can be weavers etc.  The game allows you to select only men / women as labourers for any job, but the workers are restricted by gender for some reason, and it feels verrry weird.  This can be simply solved by extending the labourer toggles to the workers as well, so hopefully that feature will come sooner rather than later.

[*] The game really struggles performance-wise; it's early-access so that's to be expected to some degree - but from the outset the framerate halves when you're looking at trees, and it steadily goes down as your town grows - even on a high-end GPU.  If you're sensitive to low-framerates then that's definitely a reason to wait a while longer.

[*] Not a dealbreaker and, again, early-access - but there's a number of UI & UX issues that have probably become invisible to the dev that need ironing out; mouse-movement working strangely compared to other titles of the genre, keyboard rotation being so slow as to be unusable, UI elements getting in the way when you don't need them and not being visible when you do - etc etc.  This will likely all be resolved once the project gets to the stage where it takes priority over gameplay features - but until then it's another pain-point and reason to hold-off.
[/list]

the only gripe i have with the game is that not all items can be produced in your village and managing an economy kinda sucks. it's very slow paced as well, lots of time spent will just be waiting for things to be built or produced but it really adds to the very comfy and chill atmosphere. 

worth the money, definitely a game i can relax and watch a movie or youtube while playing.

The management tools are sophisticated enough to avert micromanagement while still getting you the feeling of managing everything away from death and disaster. Most impressively you build everything in human sized steps which contributes into the game a lot of prolonged cathartic release into the tranquil serenity of leaving behind problems.

There is no tedious road building because this is the 18th century and the footpaths trodden by your people around points of interest is really the only necessary sign of somewhere being a ways. There is a certain comforting discreteness and simplicity to grid referenced buildings that you might have an adverse reaction to the tools Ostriv hands out for you to build with but that uncomfortable feeling almost makes it all that more special.

+ every thing is rendered, every villager exists, you have exact number of villagers running around on your screen as you have population 
+its is alittle hard to get started in it, but here is a good order to start,

start near reeds and trees, build a forestry, employ two workers there, build a clay pit then 9 houses(houses with gardens are better), then a thatchery and employ one worker, then build a smithy(smithy needs a charcoal pile to work) and carpentry and employ one worker at both, you might need to take a few workers off the build team to get this, then build a farm, farms can manage in the early game 3 large fields with a small work force but try and get teh farm set up afore the winter is over or just after it is over

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

Ostriv is a game developed and published by yevhen8

The game offers some nice graphics and environments, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same and has a really great aesthetic

Ostriv overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a good simulation strategy game and to play in short bursts

Found it randomly one day and wanted to give it a try even though I've never found a colony sim that I've ACTUALLY liked. I've had it since Sept 2020, and I've replayed it about 3 times in total. The first time was to figure out mechanics since it is the first time I've gotten attached to a colony sim before, the second time I got to about 75 people 'til there wasn't a whole lot to do (2020), and this playthrough is my third one which made me decide to write this review. I've managed to get up to about 650 people and I'm still going. I've tried getting into colony sims before, but they're super limiting on how you build (forced grid/building clicking/no open world concept) but this one lets you carve your town out of a beautifully crafted and scenic Ukraine countryside. The graphics are awesome, with realistic water and land. (the art styles in games will make-or-break it, so this is a huge factor for me personally) You have civ's that walk around and go to their little jobs; and don't even get me started on watching them build structures! I love that feature so much! You can really get a sense of truly building your town from the ground up, and it makes me really appreciate the hard work that the dev puts into the game.
I, for one, think just this alpha snippet of a game is fantastic & I can't wait to see what the creator ends up doing with the game, and how much more they're planning on adding to it. If you're thinking about it, and want to get invested in a colony sim, I HIGHLY recommend it. 

Now that I've explained how awesome it is; I do have some constructive criticism that might be useful.
-Once you get to about 400 people, it does start to have VERY minor functionality problems. you'll click on something and you'll have to wait a second while it loads whatever you're doing. It doesn't happen every time, only once in a while, but I wanted to mention it. (not a super big inconvenience tbh) 
-I started getting loads of ""white lines"" from my Forrestry to a ""Planted Trees"" area. It caused lag, as well as two crashes even with smaller tree fields/not full storage.(the game auto saves often so I didn't lose any progress) I've gotten lines from other buildings, but they typically go away after a while, but the Forrestry lines did not. The dev has explained in-game that they're working on fixing it; but I wanted to mention it here.
-It might just be me, but the Economy is hard to get a handle on. I'd love a tutorial on the Economy of the game and maybe some pointers on how to effectively tax everything when you finally get the Town Hall. I can go from 6k to 1k in the matter of 2 months because people are out of money and I have to change the taxes/wages again. 
-There's really not a lot of guidance in the game, so be sure to pay attention and read what every building needs to be able to produce. 

Tips on what I've learned the hard way;
-There's a cap on storage buildings, and that's totally fine but heed my warning; because you're planning out by hand how the town is laid out, BE SURE to have appropriate amounts of storage buildings planned throughout the town. I've noticed that sometimes the civ's won't get things out of storage if the Warehouse or Granary are too far away from stores/market stalls. 
-This might seem simple to others but make sure to check all storage of all buildings. I've accidentally killed off all my sheep because the storage was full of wool and they couldn't take in any hay and there wasn't enough laborers to get the wool out in time. :(
-Make sure to plan a graveyard/chapel area. I threw one down in prime a real estate area and you can't relocate the graves. 
-The first time playing it, I haphazardly put down some buildings without realizing that they needed another building placed prior to produce items. So, just make sure to read descriptions and see if they need another building before the one you're trying to build to produce. 
-Sheep/Cows- Hay. Pigs/Chickens- Wheat. My animals have starved to death bc I didn't know this. (could be common sense, but alas I have none.)
-Apples and Charcoal are goat. Tbh they've been the only thing that's saved my economy from the brink of bankruptcy a few times, lol.

Some things I'd love to see;
-I'd love to see sickness and MAYBE a plague in the city (there's already a ""health tab"" in game so they're clearly working on bringing a doctor into the city, but I wanted to say that i'm really looking forward to it and see what they implement.) 
-Be able to buy seeds from your civ's/trade for them from neighboring cities once you hit certain expansion markers. (Some civ seeds arent available to be grown ""commercially"" but i'd love to have a bee/pumpkin farm. Crossing my fingers for those eventually.)
-I'd also really love to be able to change the colors of buildings/fences/decor, but that's nothing major. 

All things considered, this is a pretty stand-up game even in Early Access. I don't have any major complaints, as all of them are listed in this review, and I definitely think it's worth giving it a shot.

This city builder is one of great potential and reviews that worry about the pace of developments need to take into account the fact that this small studio is structuring since last winter at the very least and they do not crunch their work. (it is in fact one thing the creator declared as of winter 2021 in a post.) 

I recommend people hesitating to read the news of the game for the past year and see how quality, historical accuracy, gameplay and fun is at the core of this studio. This game is not going to be abandonned, but for those that have a small gaming budget, yes you should put this game in the wishlist and wait the next big update coming in the next months (not yet announced but mentionned earlier this month).

This game has many defaults, but if i had to note the pace of patches and updates, and what they bring to the table in terms of fun and fixes. I'd say this game deserves a 9/10 for making the game playable and fun while we wait for more content.

For the people with money on the side who wants to experience something new and original, I definitely tell you all to BUY IT NOW. 
It is worth the price as an investment.

I got this game in Alpha 2 and have seen it grow and develop over the years since then. (See Yevheniy roadmap map on the games website ostrivgame.com/home/). Back then it was good, functional but you could see more was coming, and it has in spades. The game has become deeper, richer and more complex, and made the gameplay absolutely fantastic. Every time something new arrives, you know it’s there for a reason, it has been well designed and tested.
For me Ostriv takes the great features from games such as; Banished, Foundation and Dawn of Man and gives you the freedom to openly build what you want, where you want it. I love the ability to build things in a random oddly shaped way, rather than being stuck to a grid.
Sure, there are some minor issues, late game play is a little dull and repetitive, but quite frankly you get that in almost every game, including the AAA games such as Humankind. The pace of development could be faster, but this is a single individual designing this, not a major house and the work he has done is awesome.
I really hope Yevheniy can continue to develop this in line with his roadmap. Personally, I can’t wait for the for the campaign aspect and what that will look like. Also, how the religion and entertainment will be fully realised and what effects that will have on the population of my hamlet.

I would like to share my impressions of the game.
First of all, I followed her progress since 2018 .. when she was not available on Steam.
And even then I really liked the idea! Very few bodybuilders have a similar micromanagement system (somewhat reminiscent of Banished) but much more interesting and cool for me.
In addition, it is regularly updated, as far as I know the developer was once alone (maybe now he works) but he never stops working to improve the game, fix bugs and add new content. So if you are thinking whether to buy .. do not think! Buy .. the price is not sky-high!

I swear... the level of detail the small (singular?) dev team have involved so far is absolutely astonishing! Wage price prioritisation, growing own food which even takes into account the size of the garden, seasonal working, can't have humans drinking from the pier... Fantastic!

I spent a good amount of time providing feedback during my playing having seen that during this Aplha period the Dev(s) actually listen, read and respond to the alpha players.

However I will also observe here that by my current experience the dev has a long way to go... which for a lot of people will limit any purchasing of this in Aplha.  Mechanics including economy, trade, etc are still very limited, in addition to the resource trees.

The job situation is a catastophe to say at least. Some jobs are not taken at all which leads to massively problems and your town is falling apart (again)

    [*]Building animation as per actual construction order. Its a very sweet feature made in minute and accurate detail by the dev.

Food is another thing that's hard to come by,  to build a farm, it takes ages to grow, to catch fish, you need to build boats first.

Migration of new people is difficult because of the immediate need for food, and without food, people leave making it even more difficult to build new buildings and grow /transport food.

It’s nearly impossible to place a building straight, and the terrain doesn’t flatten, so you end up with a crooked building half buried in the ground.  Ugly.

#2 The game seems to be designed so you have to do exactly what the developer intended, or all of your people leave.  It’s much worse than Banished, in this regard.  There is a very short window of opportunity to build the houses before winter, or people leave and impossible to catch up after that.  
There are never enough people, and to make it even worse – some jobs can only be done by men!   Seriously, why this complication?  Then,  you run out of food and don’t have enough variety……
I have not been able to get very far – and I am sure that is in part me – but I’ve played Banished and been successful ….  And I didn’t have to start over a million times!
The building animation is pretty cool, but it seems to take a very long time to build things.  I like the building que, and the fact that you can put certain buildings on hold.  Graphics are decent and overall it seems to have potential.  It’s obviously a work in progress.

Jury is still out – I will try it a few more times and if I can’t get past the 2nd year – I’ll consider it a donation.

Jobs and economy structure, population chart and the way people are distinctive, all are beautiful.
Patches and upgrades are spot on most of the time.

Then why am i downvoting?

The game in its current state lacks purpose and continuity / replayability.
It never feels like a genuine living community and soon you are out of options to add to your townfolk.
Updates take way too long, probably due to the number of devs working on this project. (is it just one?)
At this pace it will take years for this game to be completed, if the developer does not give up, before that of course. Steam cemetery is full of such games, unfortunately.

- house system: houses have gardens so they can grow their own food, giving you more flexibility in the winter months or until you grow enough to start farming.

- ox/horse system: I'm sure it will be developed further, for now you can add ox to your farms for better soil regeneration. Horses help transport things a LOT faster around your village.
- trade system: very well put together already

Beautiful graphics - sure, it's a medieval village, but the way buildings are being built, the actual gardens, farms - they look great.

Great stuff:
+ Fresh take on the genre. Never would I have thought that I´d spend hours building 18th century Ukrainian town from scratch. 

+ Music is fitting and very beautiful, a true pleasure to listen.

+ The management system is well thought and extensive, but not too complicated. Assigning jobs is easy, but it did take me a while to understand how laborer/worker system worked, and how seasons affected the village's workload. Assigning working seasons and hiring builders saved my village several times, so remember to build that construction office.

+ Watching the little villagers go through their daily duties is entertaining. They work hard but also take little breaks and go chill on benches if you remembered to build them around the village. After their long day they relax in tavern. Unhappy villagers will move away, so keep them clothed, fed and give them a roof over their heads. Little bit of money during hard times won´t hurt either, and you can decide to give your more unfortunate villagers some financial aid.

+ Attention to detail is amazing. I´ve never seen a crop rotation in a building game like this, and I was amazed how thoroughly it had been thought. You get to experience the whole chain from field to the table, and this applies to animals as well. Chickens and other animals don´t magically appear to your coops and sheds, you have to actively trade for them and take good care of them once they arrive. You have to ensure that the chain for their food supply and storage works as well all year around, just like with your villagers. Otherwise the reaper man will pay a visit and then you have to start the process from square one again.

+ Game is not easy and it is surprisingly well balanced at this stage already. Balancing the workload and food/supply distribution during different seasons was pleasantly hard. I didn´t live in an Ukrainian village in the 18th century, but I trust the devs that this is a fairly accurate video game depiction of those times. 

Not so great stuff:
- I´d like better notifications if some part of the production line is halted due to an ingredient missing or lack of workers/laborers. Maybe some more logs and controls for the villagers too?

- There is a bug where villagers just freeze and do nothing. This sometimes prevents the game from progressing, if the villagers were doing something crucial like in my case, taking clay from clay pit. One villager blocked others from using the pit, so all building was halted. I noticed that saving and restarting game seemed to fix this.

10/10 game even at alpha stage. Can´t wait to see the new things promised on their roadmap.",1627421517,1627421565,True,23,0,0.740003883838653564,0,True,False,True

The biggest hurdle here in the first few hours of learning the game, is figuring out how to prioritize your people. The rush to get housing in the first year has proven a real challenge. I have yet to get all the houses up before winter hits, which puts a strain on the workforce. I had to restart SEVERAL times, because I have come to realise you need all 10 of those families to get through the first 3 years.

Once you get those houses built, the tutorial stops helping you. Not that it does a lot to begin with. You find yourself scrambling to figure out what comes next. In Banished you didn't want to build houses up too fast, the concentration was food. Well, food is still a struggle in this game too. I LOVE that the houses have their own home gardens to supply them, but there is still everything else they need in supply. Oh look, their cloths are wearing down, they are running out of good shoes. 

And then.. the game killer. The Economy. My first game I got to year 5 before I was broke and my families started moving out. 

This is definitely a micromanaged game. And not gonna lie, the economy side of it may be what makes it less fun for me.

What I would like to see in future patches? How about we start with some stable animal. Chickens or goats or something to help us build those second tier needs like clothing. 
What's up with the limit on seeds for our farms? I have traders wanting onions and carrots ect, and only my houses are able to produce those?
How about a sandbox game for players like me who really could care less about micromanaging wages. I spend half my time firing people from positions trying to save gold in holds to be able to trade for things I can't even produce yet.

I am still working.. I am still trying to figure it out. And I really hope there is going to be workshop abilities and sandbox modes to this game. Plenty still to fine tune, and I am gonna stick around and see what happens.",1625966531,1625966531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some patches have now passed. Let us look on the Game now :)

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2539853014

Short summary. Much has changed, but old problems remain.

-> Finances:

- Same probs like an year before. Workers with an ordinary long way to work (..and also market) have so often no money or time to buy food quickly.
- Set prices, tax etc. (like an year before) to zero and you earn with your first export of year all costs for your settlement of an Ingame Year. (best: characoal, sunflower oil)

Is this a Problem? No... but its not an good Simulation.

Devs tries to fix this problem with the new ""farmer houses"". This Buildings can create more self-sufficient
by the villagers, when they plant their own food in the Garden. Good Idea, but not the great ""solution"" for the pathfinding/jobfinding probs in the Game.

-> Manager / school system:

- Nobody need it really. When i play a game, i will manage my farms (or everything else). Nobody want to play a Game with out anything to do in the map. Come on dev !
- When you dont play with managments, you also need no school system :P

-> Religion and Health system:

- After 1 year of alpha their is still no Health System in Game :(
- The topic of religion is implemented very well. Nobody needs it really, but the 2 buildings are sweet :P

-> Goods, transportation, storage, supply and demand:

- Here you can see the strength of the game. Lots of goods, lots of supply chains.
- As a player you have a lot to do here in order to have enough goods in the right place at the right time. Very well done devs.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2539852939

Conclusion:

Personally, i suspect that the game is now well beyond its own zenith.
New content comes in, but very slowly. It's almost as lengthy as the game plays itself.
However, if you are looking for a game that does not stress you, you want to switch off after work or you just want to watch the bustle on your map, then please continue to support the developer.

It is an soooo cute Game.
I´ll wait another year for the next review :)

Greetings E.

Hey,
I have spend 32h into this Game now.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2086736771

Game works fine and the graphic is cute enough, but...
in the Game absence so many statistics.

- How many payed a family real for food and other goods?
- Which business needs how many of my product ?
etc.

I have invest 12h to check the economic simulation
- Why are so many family rich, when others with the same Working Situation are every time in their lifetime poor?
- Why are family rich, only while they have an ordinary looooong way to go to work and they dont have enough time into month to buy any things at the market? Familys in the near of market and also in the near of their Work have so often no money. 

I´ve have start so many tries to find an balance between poor and rich, but the only concept which really works without any trouble is -> set Prices to zero and give them for work 0,10 gold. with the first export you´ve paid all costs for one year. Thats not really a hugh Simulation at the moment.

The Game is nice, i hope when it find the way into beta it works fine.
At the moment it isn't really a recommendation for that price.

I really like medieval games that feature hard labour instead of wizards and magic. I've tried Banished and Foundation, and while these games were [i]good[/i], Ostriv comes along and smacks them both.

There are a few cool features that I didn't see listed in the game description or from reviews so i'll state them now before getting stuck in.

[h1]Amazing Animations[/h1]

I was immediately blown away when I saw the first buildings going up. They are animated PIECE by piece, meaning you get to see every panel, plank & clay wall being put up. This must be utterly painstaking to animate and plan for in the modelling process. Foundation, timber and then interior walls - you gotta see it in action.

There's no 'banging a corner with a hammer', each part of the building is carried (by hand, cart and eventually wagon) to the construction site, and then erected by the workers once all materials have been received. I LOVE when games do this, it gives a real sense of immersion. Bravo to the solo developer for these amazing animations. It's even better than Soviet Republics construction process.

[h1]Farming and Soil management[/h1]

Your farms take a little bit of planning in Ostriv due to crops eating the plotted farms nutrition. You have to cycle between crops to not use up the fertility of the fields. If you do, you have to miss a year by making the field fallow so the fertility can regenerate. Fallow means dead for those who don't know.

Thankfully, when you eventually get livestock - you can set your animal barns to use these fallow fields to help with the regeneration. Also, when you have ploughs (you need animals for them), ploughing makes fertility more efficient.

It may sound daunting but it's really not, I highly advise looking on the wiki for a great image of meta crop cycles. Make this the first thing you do if you want to get stuck in.

Using cattle to help the farms is an awesome feature, If you have a full farms on the go you can also make dedicated pastures for them. It's a simple toggle switch on the animal buildings to 'allow fallow field pastures'.

[h1]Modular Housing[/h1]

There are two choices of houses in this game, one is just a house by itself and the other contains a garden. The garden house allows you to not only move the house in the construction plot via pins, but also you can move the fences too which allows custom garden sizes and shapes.

This lets you have beautiful housing sections in your town, and the gardens are important because the villagers will grow their own crops/food in their plots for themselves. You can also set your granaries to buy from locals for their sweet vegetables/honey at a cost of course. A very organic and cool system, probably my favourite if I had to say.

No need to painstakingly decorate each house with fences/plants because the villagers do it for you. Houses look organic all fenced together with plants/food growing - it's very satisfying right out the gate. 

[h1]Dynamically formed paths[/h1]

I've seen this in Foundation but Ostriv does a better job. There's no need to plot paths as your villagers will wear down the terrain to form eventual paths. This gives your village another +1 in the organic-look department.

Worth highlighting because it's just another immersive feature in the game. I'm fairly certain paths fade too, so if you have built something afar, it will eventually settle back down to one singular main path, rather than all the trails from the construction workers, if that makes sense. 

[h1]Easy villager & Job management[/h1]

I liked Banished but juggling labourers and active jobs became very annoying in the mid game. Ostriv keeps it simple by having labourers as a separate type of job. You assign paid workers to buildings, but labourers are basically freelance workers that automatically are called upon once needed from your unemployed pool; They are useful for a lot of buildings!

These guys are the life savers of your farms and transport related buildings (Moving food/items etc). Charcoal burners for example, do not have a dedicated job-slot so are reliant on labourers. It just feels right, and how a village would be run. There's no annoying gaping holes in the workforce like in Banished.

Initially when you start you may struggle with people leaving jobs, but with the Town Hall you can adjust wages up a few % so people don't leave critical roles (Farm Manager, Boat builder, 2 Lumber dudes). Just keep building houses so you have labourers ready to slot in when needed. 

Certain job roles can only be performed by men, which leaves a large women labour-force. I highly recommend using women for Granary work/markets/farm labour. It's good to have a few unemployed women for these purposes. The town hall will allow you to see the unemployment rate.

[h1]Villagers are named and are smart[/h1]

I like it when NPCs are named and have families in games. They grow old and die and their kids take over. Time passes month to month for a whole year in Ostriv so granted this takes a while. Your villagers go about their business each day and also take rest which is essentially the games form of sleeping.

Fun random praise: BENCHES are actually animated and are functional for resting periods. I haaaate when city builder decoration objects are not used and accounted for mechanically! So bravo again for this.

Villagers will go to your markets to buy food and clothing (important, because if they don't have clothes, they'll move out) and do their job. They can become destitute if they don't earn money, but you can throw them 5.00 coins to sort them out if you desire. 

They will complain about lack of food variety but I don't think there are any adverse effects or happiness stats/efficiency mechanics yet. As long as they have food you're good.

[h1]It never feels easy, in a good way[/h1]

Foundation & Banished kind of reach a point where things are easy, you have huge surplus of everything, but there's a sense of dread every year in Ostriv. Do we have wheat for the animals? Sunflowers for selling?! Did I remember to check the farm cycles before spring?

There are finite elements of the production processes in this game. Limestone is limited which is used a little later into your villages life, and things like salt/cloth production are reliant on a mid/late game product-chain. 

You HAVE to trade Iron because there are no iron deposits or infinite mines [yet?]. I kind of like this as trading is essential for survival at times. My tanners are slow AF so I'm always buying in Iron & Leather because the curing process takes 6 months and metal is always being produced for cart repairs and horse tack stuff. You will need to buy buy buy. Thankfully everything is cheap and you never feel too cheated.

Trading really feels like medieval trading like a real village would of done back in the day [i'm assuming]. You can also sell stuff to other villages with trade posts/docks. Buying livestock, selling stuff you've grown/made.

My tip for you early would be to invest in sunflower oil. Grow sunflowers, make them into Oil & Sell. It's the easiest of the trades and if someone wants 3000 Oil, it's a good 400 coins which is very good; this leads me into my next segment...

[h1]Productions feel limited & Trades can be difficult early on[/h1]

For now, the game is heavily reliant on food and animal produce for trade goods. Despite what I said about liking trading, I really hope there are some more early game options such as foraging and creating low-tier products for sale.

A starting village won't have much to trade. The best basic thing I've found is Charcoal, and eventually Sunflower oil. Charcoal is pretty much unlimited due to the foresters being able to build sustainable tree-nurseries which in of itself is another great mechanic in this game I wanted to fit into this review.

I have to cut this short but AMAZING game, lots to come and it's in active development.

The attention to detail in both gameplay and graphics is stunning - it's the only sim/building game that I've ever cared enough to think carefully about how to place buildings and beautify their surroundings. As an example, when placing a house with its own garden, you can change the size and shape of the plot and re-position or even rotate the building within that plot. And there's no single generic 'house' - although you can't choose the style directly it will be randomised (within certain parameters to fit the overall style) as will the crops and plants grown in its garden. When you add the ability to place fences, trees, benches and so on anywhere you please it's easy to create a realistic look.

The gridless format allows for the development of a natural looking settlement and fortunately the path-finding is up to the task - watching a wagon of imported goods thread its way through your village is brilliant.

At the 10 hour mark I've barely scratched the surface in terms of production buildings. Yes, it's a fairly slow burn as others have said, but you can use the time to plan ahead, decorate or study the actions of your villagers to figure out improvements. Alternatively, just use the time controls to speed things along. I can't see why anyone thinks the game is 'brutal', I'm three years in on my first play-through and

Its setting is unique and one I personally love, its style and aesthetic therefore is something you really can't get elsewhere aside from Cossacks 3, which is an rts rather than city builder. It is grid less and focuses on organically developing your town. Ostiv is far from the easiest city builder in the world and if you aren't a city builder veteran you should probably look at some guides. This game is in early access, but the devs are constantly bug fixing and adding features and a reasonable pace. Once you get the hang of it it can be quite relaxing. The graphics and music are excellent. The farming system is unique and more complex than other offerings in this genre, which is a plus. The trade mechanics are good. There are a wide variety of buildings with varying functions. This game is gridless and the villagers form paths organically which is a great feature I'm happy to see becoming more and more mainstream in this genre. 

I don't think I've encountered a crash or any serious bugs. The occasional graphical issue, resolved by saving and exiting, hasn't been an issue for me more than once or twice. 

At the price of $25 I'd say this is a good buy for people who like medieval/early modern city builders/colony sims. The game can be initially challenging, but once you're established the challenges become financial and management. It is, as others have said, as slow burn, if you don't mind that then I recommend it, if you really prefer to see things get done quickly/immediately than maybe this game isn't for you. This shines when you take the time to plan out aspects of your town and lay the foundations for industries or expanding your settlement. If you're unsure, waiting for a sale isn't a bad idea, I'd also recommend checking out Let's Plays of the game if you're not sure what I mean by slow burn. The devs are active and this is a passion project which will continue grow, so if you don't feel like paying full price just yet that is understandable, although I personally do not regret buying without waiting for a sale. I think if you enjoy games like foundation, or other more slow paced sandbox city builders, you will enjoy this game.",1622670737,1622670737,True,13,0,0.659071445465087891,0,True,False,True

It's quite similar to Banished but offers way more depth and content. You build your small village up from the ground, place houses, workshops, wells and so on. Especially cool is the farming system. The soil features three different nutrients and different crops require different amounts of these nutrients to grow. Consequently you'll have to figure out a system of crop rotation, including fallow for optimal efficiency. 

There are a few visual bugs, but they'll vanish as soon as you quicksave/quickload, so not a huge issue. I experienced a single crash but didn't lose any progress because of the frequent autosave.

The first year is paint by number and I can watch a full movie on normal speed.  Plop down a forestry, nine houses, carpentry, smithy, town hall in the first year.  Plus maybe a cart storage, charcoal pit, Storage shed and a granary.  In year two you probably want to get you trade center up and maybe a farm with a lake water source.  

One thing that is annoying is the storage is super small becoming full quickly.  Especially when the forestry can hold nearly 40,000 resources.  In the second year after the mad rush to build nine houses or should I say slow rush.  Your people are already running out of food diversity.  Before you even have the ability to grow / fish / trade for other foods.  And this is after building nine houses with gardens where they can grow food.  You can partially mitigate this by having your citizen sell food and let other citizen buy that food.  But it runs out quickly.  If you get your trade up quick enough you can fix this problem before anyone dies.  You also may be able to get in a season of farming in the second year.

After the town is stabilized you can grow but outside of this the game really does not have much going on.  The economics of the game are strange where you not only manage the towns money but also each household as well.

Definitely worth picking up for the price. Especially as Ostriv has so much potential.

Only downsides for me are that it can feel quite slow at the start and I often have to look up a lot of the mechanics as it doesn't provide you with a lot of detail as to how things work. 

Being an Early Access Game, it can feel empty at times but with time, there's so much that could (and I'm guessing will) be added that would give players' settlements more personality and make the world outside of your settlement feel more consequential and alive.

The game is absolutely beautiful. It's peaceful, relaxing, soothing...just everything you would look for in a game. I'm not a huge fan of the soundtrack. It was nice to begin with but it gets very repetitive after a while. This seems to align aptly with the game itself as it currently is. Once you work out how to keep a town of 100 people fed in a self sufficient manner whilst making your exports far outweigh your imports you hit a wall. You have a town that grows it's own food, you are making money year in year out, and your large exports only add to your treasury. Some people are happy to wash, rinse and repeat but I find this a bit pointless.

The game has massive potential, but it is a little concerning that the game has been in motion since 2018, really only has about 10% of it's road map complete and I haven't seen a huge amount of evidence that things will speed up.

if that doesn't somewhat tell you that this game has been very enjoyable, idk what will.

But allow me to provide some insight on why I enjoy this game the most out of a lot of other city building games.

1) The joy in simplicity:

What I love most about this game honestly how somewhat forgiving this game can be. There's no real threat that will destroy your playthrough and making your heartache beyond the common occurrences if you don't plan things properly.

It's a simple, relaxing, city building game with a pretty low bar of entry. 

There's so much joy to be had at building a small little village that turns into a town with little to panic over too much. It's a game that's perfect for you if you just want to unwind, and build a quaint little town for a few hours.

2) It's all in the details:

You can literally see your buildings being built little by little over time as the foundation is built, and the pillars go up before eventually topping it off with a roof.

I absolutely love and adore this as that's something I feel is woefully missing in a lot of city building games like Anno, for example.

What's even more impressive is if you actually read the developers blog, and how he basically breaks down the amount of work and detail the team puts in designing the elements that comes with planning and designing each individual building and the steps that the NPC's will take to build it.

The developers literally even create a timeline for each building is made, with things like resources required and milestones for the builders in each phase as you see them acquire such resources and reach such milestones by the exact time and date they (the builders) plan towards.

And there's even more details that I miss in my playthrough that I only realized after reading the developer blog posts like how each production building actually shows the work being done in detail, or how every door in every building operates dynamically.

It's really cool, and I just love the amount of work put into it.

3) Music to my ears:

Look, this game doesn't have some top notch orchestra music playing in the background, but there's something about the choice of music that helps elevate this sense of relaxation while playing the game.

It's simple, but again, it just oozes a sense of ""just kick back, relax, and enjoy building your town man"" to it.

I do hope more songs get added in though!

4) Where does the future lay?

Having played this in April of 2021, and seeing videos of others playing online, there seems to be a slow burn of progress of updating the game over the years.

But almost every person whose video I watched about the game had mentioned how with each update, the game just adds something better and better and it almost always compels them to play a new play through as the joy of building is so prominent in this game.

I'm hoping that the game continues to update, and perhaps, in a faster way.

But again, I do not want the developers to rush at all.

i love everything about the game, and I love the amount of work and detail they put in.

There's some bugs here and there, most prominent for me is white arrow lines showing up after I played over 24 hours or so, but seems to be resolved by re-loading the game.

Hoping that get's fixed soon, but other than that, fantastic game!

The GOOD:
- This game is beautiful! From the variable cute little houses, to the snow thawing off the roofs, to your little citizens putting up each individual beam and slathering clay on each individual wall
- A fairly deep and robust economy system that responds to inputs and outputs, and does not run itself
- The map is large and has plenty of room for expansion
- You can watch everything happen: trees are felled and do not return, carts are filled with supplies, and then dropped off in the actual location they're needed; every piece of equipment exists and is used; oxen and draft horses sit waiting inside of buildings they're being used to operate. It's something so many city builders get wrong
- There is no grid. This is a city builder where you make the city, and the grid responds to the organic needs of the citizens
- It's just plain fun

The BAD:
- Once you've figured out how to get things going in the first round, a little bit of the fun is taken from subsequent playthroughs (but not ALL the fun by an means)
- The snapping of buildings with snapping available can get a little wonky
- Nothing upgrades (unless you count getting plows for your farms), and there is a very limited library of buildings ultimately
- The landscape is a bit limited

The NEUTRAL:
- This game has a pretty steep learning curve if you haven't watched a more knowledgeable player do a playthrough on YouTube or somewhere else
- No variety in buildings of the same type other than the civilian houses
- Some keybinds may not be ideal for every player

Overall, I recommend this game, and it is clear that more systems will be added over time. For now, well worth the asking price!",1617642189,1617642189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I really like the fact that this game gets into the free form construction and away from the grid snapping form.  I also really like the construction format:  This is as if you are actually watching them construct the building, placing each peace on building and taking the materials from a resource pile.  I dislike the fact that other games that I have do not do this; excellent work yevhen8, keep up the good work.  

One thing that can be changed is the camera movements while zoomed in close:  The speed in which the camera moves around, (forward, backward, left, and right), this should slow down equivalent to how far you zoom in/out:  The closer you get the slower the speed.  Currently the speed is the same.  While zoomed all the way in you only have to barely tap the key to move the camera and can easily find that you are no longer looking at what you want.  Also, this speed should match the speed of the panning so that you can better circle an object without continuously having to press keys.

All I can say is that if youre looking for a settlement building game that is challenging without feeling time pressured, has loads of depth and is really fleshed out with options, has amazing graphics and animations (no guy with a hammer on one corner of a building- you can see individual roof beams being put up) then this is is. And its still in early Access! Ive seen full release titles that offer much less. The attention to detail is amazing, and its clear that the developer (who was operating alone but has brought on additional staff I believe) has fully focused on delivering a truly quality product. He has put a post on steam explaining why its still in early access and, long story short, its because quality and pride in the product being offered is at the heart of it. Integrity in games publishing seems a rarity these days, but its here in spades with this developer and with this title. I urge you to get it if youre looking for a settlement building game.

For instance, not having a family tree, the education system wasn't implemented at all, and the glitches. Now since the last two updates i'm back to playing and it is so much better now, education system still needs more work, I've noticed a glitch where I have two schools but the same kids that are going to one school are also going to the other school, and also continuing to be enrolled in adulthood, leaving no room for new students. There is now a family tree implemented which is awesome for people like me who are more into the generational game play. I'm excited for medical buildings to come, and a place for the town people to make more detailed meals. WE NEED BEES. Kids should be able to help with farming, and animal husbandry as early as 6, and more harder jobs by 15.

There is really no hand holding beyond the first maybe 10 minutes. You get a very limited ""quest"" chain to build a lumberjack area and 10 houses. Beyond that it's more or less just build your city. 

But be careful of your budget and managing food needs. Those will sneak up on you fast and ruin all your hard work. I've had quite a number of colonies fail on me within a year for those two reasons. I'm not complaining sometimes learning on your own is more rewarding then being told what to do. That being said the UI and some more info on the budget and goods storage screens would be greatly appreciated.

As of this review the game is fun and playable for city builder, management and sim fans. That is, I think, until you master that learning curve and can manage just fine.

Building a realistic village in 18th century Eastern Europe and making it work is really fun. It was very easy to understand the gameplay without any tutorial and the game kept me awake many nights for 'just another thing to do'. It took me some 2-3 games to understand the economy and how to make money. That was the most interesting part of the game, as different to other city builders, this one has a circular economy, where the wealth is distributed between the player and the settlers and, if not for exports, the amount of gold in circulation is the same at all time. Only exports will add more gold to your city. The gold will be payed to your villagers as salaries, who in turn will give you back the money for goods they will buy from the markets and for rent. Having a good balance in wealth distribution is the difference between enough money to build or import stuff and no money to do those things. 
I am really anxious now for the future updates, as I would really love to have all buildings available, as I would like to play scenarios or a career. I hope that in the future this will also happen.

I look forward to what Yev have in store with the next update and from what I read it will be a nice update.

I would wait on purchasing a copy of this early access version until a significant update comes out.  I purchased this game originally from the dev's website, as it wasn't yet available on Steam, back in 2019.  I learned quickly that the computer I had at that time could not run the game very well and only played it for a few hours.  It was intriguing enough for me to keep the game.  Unfortunately for me, I lost the update link the dev provided when I purchased it.  

So, I decided to purchase the game again when I got a new computer.  I went to Steam and purchased another copy of it from there.  There were some pretty interesting new developments from the older version I had and I was very happy with it.  Like many on here state, it is very much like Banished without very many production chains.  

After playing for about 60 hours, I have to admit that the game is getting boring.  Since there has not been a significant update in quite a while, I am beginning to think this game has been abandoned but hold out hope.  IF the dev performs a significant update that will change the game, I will highly recommend this game.  But, until then, I would recommend saving your money or spending it on some other game.  

Now, about the game itself...

This game has a lot to love about it in its current version if you are a fan of Banished.  Though it has limited production chains at this time, I can see the potential for some very interesting production chains in future updates and, when available, in future mods.  This game currently has very little in the way of tutorials, so the initial learning curve is very high if you don't use one of the many excellent guides provided by other members on this site.  I prefer not to use guides and figure things out myself.  It took a few tries to get through the first year, but I eventually figured it out: forestry, clay pit, thachery, farm, house, house, house, house, smithy (with at least three charcoal pits), house, house, house, house, house, carpentry, granary.  This gets you through your first year.  Build depending on your personal strategy from there.  

This game does need a lot of work still.  I look forward to future updates.

Here is what I would love to see in the game:

Deeper production chains.  Milk can be churned into cheese and cream, for example.  Clothing options utilizing more resources.  For example, some clothing can be made with textiles AND leather.  (Why are we not getting leather from pigs?  How the hell are we supposed to invent football without pigskin?)  More flora and fauna indigenous to the Ukraine area and appropriate processing buildings for them.  A friend of mine who lives near me is from Ukraine.  He has told me that one of the foods they like to eat is beef or goat wrapped in grape leaves.  Goats and grapes would be nice.  A winery maybe, to process the grapes into wine?  And, I would like to see a map that is never ending for unlimited expansion of the city.  If not possible, maybe just larger maps.  Mining would be good for iron and salt.  More cities to trade with.  Of course, modding capability.  Finally, I would love to see rabbit as a food and skins source.  Though not present during the time period of this game, beaver has been successfully introduced to the area and might make a good food and skins source.  Or nutria.  

A map suggestion:  A coastal map with access to whales, clams, fish, etc.  Though, I honestly don't know if there are any whales in the Black Sea.  

These are my thoughts as of this writing.  I am hopeful that the dev will introduce more updates in the future and more frequently.",1610398782,1610398782,True,14,2,0.63906252384185791,0,True,False,True

The developer has a great attention to detail, dedicated to building a great game, has big ideas and plans for the finished product as well as being many years in the making.

Game is interesting and feels fresh but lacks all sorts of communication from the team or whomever. 
Last update on the blog was months ago and generally there's nothing being updated. The game quickly gets boring after you figured out how to deal with things. At a certain point you just build with no purpose. Better buy Banished and mod it til it breaks, but don't invest any money (well do what you want but this is my input) as long as the game is not out of the early access state (if it will ever get this far). Seriously, read into the blog, the roadmap, everything but you'll see that the devs completely ignore you (the most important stakeholder) and everything around.

As the years progress (i'm currently at 1768 or thereabouts).. will the development of the town reflect this in time?

Also regarding families and relatives that share the same family names.. it would be good if there was some type of indicator to be able to link families in different homes (so you can identify them).. and that they inherit the money left behind when relatives pass away. 

Re feeding pigs.. as they consume so much, it would be good if there was some garbage collection system to would allow you to leverage this as the pigs food, rather than consuming your crops.

I don't see any offers of sheep for trade?  would also be nice if other towns wanted bark and thatch for trade (maybe even firewood)

The way it comes together, visually, is unlike any other city builder. The visuals are quite in-depth. The way each house is built in stages as the resources arrive is very immersive. The entire thing so for is more like artwork, in my opinion. The fences around the houses can be contorted and don't have to be straight or uniform like most city builders where houses get dropped in a cookie cutter fashion. The way you create fields around the farms is quite pleasing also. I really like the ""non-uniformity"" of it, for lack of a better term. I will put in one little wish in this review, that you could place the fields with more than four points, so you could create more unique field designs. 

I was frustrated when I first purchased the game. I had a graphics bug that wouldn't even allow the game to open. I sent a note to the dev, not expecting to hear anything back, or expecting to receive some canned email on things to try.

Not just the game itself was important, but it was important to the dev that people were enjoying the experience. 

I can't wait for more updates to this game. Hopefully other game developers take note and learn something about how to create a city builder.

I don't recommend going too hardcore on this one for the moment. It will certainly be a great game sooner or later, but for now it lacks content and the game time before reaching late game infrastructure is too small. To put it short, in the current version of the game, development is hindered by the fact you can't have more than a dozen builder.

Firstly let me get this off my chest.... the updates are not as regular as an AAA title, because it's a one man development team and ""IT'S IN EARLY ACCESS!!"". I swear people leaving negative reviews didn't read the EA notes,  especially:

Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
“I won't lie, it may take years to make this game what it deserves to be. There may be long delays between updates when development meets major design challenges. But that's what it takes to create a masterpiece.”
(please refer back to the store page for ALL the EA notes and advisories)

Now I will go forth and give me YES recommendation review.. 

The game is so worth it, even now in EA. There is plenty to do, yes some game mechanics are not available yet, but that gives us all something to look forward to right? 
From the outset the moment you pick which map to play (I'm sure more will be added) the graphics and style of the game is beautiful. I love the feeling of a rural, slow paced builder which develops over time and this is one gem for that. The village develops nicely into a town and I have not come across any particular bugs that make it game breaking. From city planning, to farming, to trading.. this is all there now! It's in a very playable state and I would recommend to anyone who loves this genre.

It's a Very good older times city builder and quite similar to banished (prob the best banished clone i've come across if it only had the content updates to keep up with it).  The game has so much depth to it from walking on ground to make paths, to you having to build actual boats if you want to fish in the fishing dock, and crop rotation to name a few.  The sound design is fantastic and very fitting.  The amount of content is decent....but this brings me to my second point

The amount of end game content in basically non existent.  There is literally only one house type.  This game has a VERY slow update system from devs.  Its one that's good right now but you'd maybe have to shelf for 6 months to a year before it being playable again after your first play through.

Side note, the trading system with the other towns is a really cool addition but PLEASE balance it, there is basically no reason selling higher tiered products for how incredibly cheap they can be bought/sold.",1603313166,1603313166,True,3,0,0.540846765041351318,0,True,False,True

Whilst no tutorial is a minor hindrance the lack of resources such as stone and lime stone makes progress a problem as you have to buy it, especially limestone which you need to create lime, to allow leather to be tanned and shoes made. 

This is also true of the complete lack of iron without which you cannot build houses, farms etc. There are not even any resources available to create iron so you rely on buying it from other villages which means you need a trading centre and without population you cannot produce the materials to sell. I honestly believe this  is a major shortcoming in this game and needs to be resolved at the next patch issue and certainly before the Beta testing starts.

Having said all the above I am enjoying the game and credit to the developer who until recently was working on their own, although I believe there is now a small team working on the game.

As long as you have an industry that can export several items you survive.
There is a lot more to do though and the key question is what's the mission of this game? Maximum state coffers? Or largest population? Or war? I'm not so sure.
The game is at the moment kinda static. No upgrading of buildings or people through education. Everything stays the same once you have built it, other than the path people walk and snow every winter.

Been playing city builders since Settlers 1993) Yeah am a bit old now
Version Alpha 0.2, 34 hours played
Village 300+ residents
Every type of building built
8 restarts at varying stages to learn the ropes

[h1]QUICK REVIEW[/h1]
For those that don't want to read an essay
By today's early access standards this is way better than an Alpha
Very positive feedback from me, stable, rarely crashes (3 times in 34 hours of game-play),(And when it does easily rolls back to the last auto save with just a few minutes lost). 
Feature rich for an alpha and a lot to do and micromanage.
Most systems are already in place which just need expanding, e.g. more content adding and a few tweaks to management. (See his [url=https://ostrivgame.com/home/] Roadmap [/url]
A few minor nuances but easily worked around, nothing to stop the enjoyment of the game
A selected mix of Banished and Rimworld with much more appealing game-play.
Micromanage Buildings, Manpower, food, resources, crop rotation, storage and trade over 4 seasons which does effect everything.
Sounds and graphics all good.
Animations are terrific. (Just watch a video of the foresters carrying logs or the plough working or the builders building and labourers dropping off building supplies)
GUI in general ease of use, very good clear and intuitive

[h1]MORE IN DEPTH REVIEW [/h1]
Placement of buildings can be pre-planned if the game is paused (Deleted rotated etc)
Build order can be changed, individual build orders paused.
So in theory with enough game-play experience you could plan out your entire village before actually building anything
Once experienced and having the right management and buildings in place (The town hall) you can automate a lot of the tedious stuff but still leaving enough to keep you busy tweaking.
More specifically You can set the manpower peak and offpeak season for any production building, allowing you to set the required manpower for each month
Examples:
	Farms are super busy during sowing and harvesting season and need all the manpower they can find during those seasons. So with the town hall built and a councellor in place you can set other buildings offpeak times to coincide with say the harvesting season, allowing you to reduce the manpower in those buildings freeing up a large labour force for the farms to hire, otherwise you will not get all the crops in
	[spoiler]Rivers freeze over in winter allowing you to recuce the fisherman to 0 and increase your available labour force for elsewhere.
	The tannery has to be constantly manned during batch production, any failing in achieving constant supervision will cause the batch to fail.

Good:
Concept is cool, seems like the right track for an early alpha.

Bad:
No upgrades for anything
Game crashes whenever I save
Very difficult to see what your people are doing.  Surprise 50% of your people are unemployed for no reason even though you have 50 open job requests
No ability to set defaults for buildings
If someone leaves the manager job for two seconds it screws up a year of farming potentially
Unable to prioritize jobs.  Everyone will flock to building when there is nothing to build, but the one person assigned to keep your critical cow/chicken/horse infrastructure alive will leave to move to build and with no warning you will lose all your livestock wrecking your economy.
No alert or warning when resources low: IE water for cows, they just immediately die
No prioritizing carrying
Economy doesnt really matter much, settings to control pay + cost of market goods + rent are just modifying how much money your people are spending overall and making, not really making a difference individually.
Not obvious what many choices / options do due to lack of tool tips, or tutorial, or any information.
500 available jobs, everyone refuses to work no matter the pay.  AI is miserable.
Got a list of things to be constructed? Well the first item is missing a single nail so no one else will work on anything until that nail is produced, or you micromanage your list.  Even then they wont begin delivering until the first one is completely done.

Make charcoal burning a vocation.

Perhaps more options for houses? Fancier ones charge more rent?

How about a total limit for the warehouse or granary as well as choosing what is in it.

The things i love about this game;
My favourite thing is the path/road system. It so cute! The villagers just bed the paths in where they walk.
I love the graphics and the animations they're really nice.
The attention to detail is amazing, which for me really add a lot to the game.
There's so much more i love about the game but i'll let you discover it for yourselves. 

Things i would like to see'
A better/longer tutorial. After you've built the first few homes it only tells you what you need to build if you're running low on something. 
Story mode, which i believe is coming to the game. 
One more thing i would like to say, for me anyway it's quite a complicated game. It has to be like this so that its realistic i understand but it takes some getting used to and in my case quite a lot to googling. 

overall i would definitely recommend the game to anyone who loves city building. I forget its still only on alpha so i'm very excited for what is to come :)

I would like to point out a few things from my experience of playing city building games.
1. There is no bakery as yet. If I am producing flour then a bakery should be there.
2. if there is a lack of laborers, things are not fetched by workers. like for dried fish you need salt. but the fishermen do not get it from the granary or the trade house. this should not be the case. if there is no item then the worker should be triggered to get it.
3. There are no prosperity triggers as yet. once the village reaches a certain stature the wants and needs of the populace should become diverse and buildings should become upgradable etc.
4. It lacks any kind of events. Without events like natural calamities  or looter attack etc. the game is not all challenging and will bore the player once he/she has built everything. 
5. why can't we mine iron? its only available by trade....why?

However, like any game, whether it is in early access or not, it needs a few tweaks to make it really good. These are:
1- Optimization. A critical point for this game, it really needs a complete adjustment in both ram, cpu and gpu performance.
2-Food and Money. This also needs some adjustments, not as severe as in optimization but it does need them. The money is spent too much, leaving you with the only option to make really big adjustments to your population if you want them not to move due to lack of money to buy food. With food, it is spent too fast, a family coming to consume (in my games) much more than they need, leaving the possibility of buying from the others.
OPTIONAL:
1- Rebellions. This would be great, and you are surely wondering: ""what is it based on?"". Well my dear user of Steam, it would be based on the fact that populations that do not have access to food, water or that do not have money, will rebel against their corrupt or inefficient mayor and go after their head.
2-Creation of Kingdom. This would also be good. Once your game has reached x population number, you have the possibility to create a kingdom and put yourself as its King.
3-Invasions. This for me would have to be put in another update. In the game map you can see several cities, so that as your city grows, it is pressured by other cities to join their kingdom. If those pressures reach a critical point, that city will invade you, and you, as the person in charge of your people, could defend it until death, or be a coward and surrender or escape.
8/10. Fierce of those adjustments, a very good game that promises a lot when it leaves the access.
Buy it if you want to try it, or wait until it leaves the access.

I love the idea of city builders but outside of Tropico 4-6 I never quite got into any of them as things like traffic control is tedious - so a City Builder in this period was always going to be appealing to me.

At first I was confused as to what was important for the city. But the guide helps you understand what to build first, which was very useful. The first thing I noticed is just how enjoyable it is to watch something being built. Yes it may take forever for the required resources to arrive at the building; but the whole building process is enjoyable and a great mechanic. 

In my first attempt at the game I underestimated the value of ""Nails"" and so after the first hour I pretty much had to start again. This time, ensuring that the key materials for building and the maintenance of Carts was crossed off (after realising just how important carts were for carrying decent amounts of materials.) Upon my second attempt, the other issue I created for myself was importing far too many goods (cows, dried fish, flour etc), to the detriment of my town's bank balance. Before long, I was in deficit and couldn't send messengers anywhere to amend by exporting products. Although it didn't stop any of my villagers from doing their jobs because I had no money to pay them, which I don't think is supposed to happen. Note to self: Exporting is THE 2nd most important thing you can do.

I look forward to my 3rd attempt of getting this right. I understand this is a game in development so I expect there are a lot more options to come. But at this stage, I foresee myself getting mastering the economy section of the city builder, and then getting very bored. Hopefully this can be alleviated. 

A few considerations/suggestions: 
- Graphically, this game isn't outstanding at all, this is more about the gameplay and mechanics, if you came here for aesthetics, you'll be disappointed. 
- Could do with more variation in the soundtrack, not necessarily always music.
- Could have more weather variations than just sun and snow. (Rain, Thunder, Wind etc)
- Variation in trees and grass: thickness, height etc.
- One higher level of speed. (12x still isn't fast enough when your waiting for a building to be built) 
- Do children not work or go to school? We don't even see children in the game which is disappointing. 

All in all, love the game. Will definitely keep playing. Love the farming system as well. And I definitely love how it's a little bit of a puzzle/challenge. Keep up the good work.",1595510709,1595510709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its still in early access you can see that the game is far from finished, but what is already in game is pretty good.
I loved the way buildings are built, its just awesome watching workers laying foundations, and erecting every single beam separately  etc.
Also the management mechanics in game are very interesting. The crops rotation is great, which other game forces you to take crop rotation into account. Option to use unemployed citizen as parttime laborers is great idea.  

The seasonal hiring mechanic is great. Let me explain what it means.
During sowing and harvesting season you need all your arms on fields. So you can set your non essential buildings to close down during these months so ppl go work on fields instead and then during winter when there is no work on fields or fishhouses you set those buildings to not employ anyone and instead put your ppl into buildings that are processing harvested crops, like weaver, tailor etc.
And you don't have to do this manually, you just set it up and then it will happen every year.

OSTRIV: You start the game off with all of your settlers. The way you get new ones is that they are born and grow up. You assign  workers to the buildings. Some buildings you put a manager in charge. The tutorial is helpful. There is a clear progression of what buildings you will need at the beginning of your colony. There is also trade with other towns. The trading feature cannot be ignored like other sim games. For example you want to have a chicken farm or milk from cows well you have to get some animals from your neighbors the game just does not give them to you.

pros: music and graphics.  If you like to mange all aspects of the economy you can, such as how many workers at each location what items you want to grow and what you want to trade etc.  
Cons: time moves VERY SLOW even on the fastest speed.  Often it is hard to figure out how to get your citizens to go to work or do anything when they are at work.
Improvements:  Budget, you can go in the red all that you want with out any consequences. Maybe levels that you can choose such as level 1 no financial limits and no natural disasters, level 2 some financial limits like you could get loans and natural disasters. 
A tutorial on the difference btw storing items in a  warehouse or grainary vs the trading post vs. chicken coop or smithy. and how that impacts if citizens can get to the item to produce something or eat. 
More decorations for the city. 
Education and wellness buildings.

Ostriv looks really nice, and is a nice adult-take on The Settlers (without the combat), and is very detailed in managing economy and workforce to provide results.

However, due to this nature, the game is rigged to fail with it's economics, it's settlers, and it's production. Certain items can only be purchased through trade, which requires a successful economy. A successful economy can only be established by having a successful production. A successful production can only be established by a productive work-force, and a productive work-force can only be obtained by fulfilling their needs of being paid (economy), feeding them various foods (production), and ensuring the have enough work to do.

The only positive drawn from this design is that you have no attachment to your workers at all. They are, in this case, identity-free, mindless drones. You aren't bothered that they'll move out because they're unhappy, unpaid, or starving, since a new family will move in moments later, picking up their work. So, you just wait for the next harvest season to roll around, where you can create sunflower oil as a food resource and sell the excess to prevent you from going bust.

Oh and that's another issue. No matter how you ""balance the books"", you're either going into debt, or your workers are, or they can't even afford food to survive. You can't export any resources that you're in massive supply of (wood for example), so you just keep stocking it up so you can clear more land to build more buildings for more mindless drones to occupy.

That's the game in a nutshell unfortunately.

I really like the UI. It's simple, down at the bottom, and is not weighed down by too many options. I understand this may change, but I'm hoping the developer keeps the simplicity.

The names of buildings and stuff are a little too small. I wear glasses, but I still sort of strain to read what the buildings are. Not a bad thing necessarily, just a minor detail.

The map is wide a great wide open view. I really like the height I can zoom out to.

The natural life I can hear all around is great. It reminds me of sleep sounds you can listen to on YouTube.

Welcome to 1600's village life, manage your people and thrive! 

Pros: 
Game play is not affected by software quirks that I have seen and runs smoothly.
AI pathing is as direct as you can get, highly efficient.
Resources for the most part are straightforward as you'd expect (if it's not on the map you probably get it though trade).
Lots of specific and or direct tweaking to operations on the fly, every building is more or less capable of a great deal of specific alteration for running preferences. 
Nice to look at graphically even on potato mode.

Cons:
The economy system needs to be played to be fully understood (or just leave your people dirt poor).
Structure snapping can be a little off or just downright strange sometimes, overall outline may be shown but there appears to be a minimum interior distance not shown {houses specifically} that makes putting down tight patterns a chore.
Other than leaving the pay at a certain building set to higher than average Workers and or Managers may wander off and start a new job at a different building {Trade and Farm buildings specifically} and this can cause critical problems for plans or deals you may have running (Manager dipped out and next field rotation to grain/fallow stopped or incoming trades are not bought/sold without manager present). 

Suggestions:
Perhaps more towns to trade with in the future?
Add Iron lodes to maps and use Stone Mining building to get at the Iron?
If possible add a coastal map and a salt-works? 

To the Devs:
Keep one doing what you are! This is a great game, moreover it PLAYS great!! A joy to just poke at or get super involved in. Well done!",1590220516,1590220516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are a few things I would change to make getting started more manageable. Such as having more people to start with and allowing women to work all the same jobs as men. I find it's hard to get everyone a home built before the cold hits, meaning I lose a couple of families before I even get the town off the ground. Also having children between the ages of ten and 15 do labor work would leave more time for adults to do proper jobs. Which at the moment, end up being a lot, and quickly. 

I have yet to figure out a way to actually keep the town profitable and am really glad that whilst village funds are in the negative, it doesn't stop me from making trades with fellow towns. For this, I think having an 'unlimited' game play option or varied options in the game play menu to turn on and off features, such as soil degredation, animal starvation, money, citizens complaining about food variety/citizens leaving because of a lack of food variety. Just things that can be turned on and off as someone plays the game and gets comfortable with it.

It can be hard to keep track of what resource is in which warehouse. I can see from the menu that I have 2000 potatoes... But I have no idea where those potatoes are and for some reason, neither do the villagers. The same thing happens with all sorts of things, from wheat, hemp, iron, nails... They just kind of, exist but are also not able to be found or accessed by people needing them for work or sale.

I also find wheat is used up very fast. Even with a handful of livestock, I am left with no wheat to  make flour and too much livestock means lots of starved animals because no matter the field or how many fields, I just cannot make enough wheat to feed the animals that need it. 

I also think that starved animals should be taken away for slaughter, rather than just, going away as they currently do. Just maybe, making less meat and than a healthy animal. 

There are some more things that might sound negative, but I think I need to play a bit more to really give much of an opinion on them. 

Being this game is still being made, don't take what I have written as a negative. The game is fun as it is, and with funding and time I can see it turning into something amazing.",1590148037,1590148037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ostriv is a detailed 'ant managment' sim centered around an early 18th century Ukranian settlement. You take 9 families from living in tents and out of crates to building a village, then a town with farms, butcher, shops and more. You can get pretty detailed on how many workers are at each farm, hiring and firing as needed. You can decide how much laborers get paid, pay more for in-demand workers if certain things need doing, and enter into individual trade deals with neighboring cities. 

I've sort of maxed out most of the possibilities available so far and I would happily keep playing it for a long time. A helpful wiki is online to guide you through things like farming, and trying various buildings and setups as you build 2 or 3 towns will get you through most things like farming, raising livestock and trading. 

Features that are yet to be added, I think: trade boats & wagons, sheep, education & health structures, more government buildings probably (right now there's just a town hall), plus religion (haven't built a church yet but that may allow hiring a priest or you have to wait for a priest, etc.)

Features that would add a lot more realism to the game (not sure if they are in the pipeline): an actual graveyard instead of individual burial plots, maybe death/injury from workplace accidents and starvation rather than just old age, iron & salt mines, more rock areas for quarries, and skill levels in various jobs for individual citizens for faster work maybe? (like the Foundation game)

Issues I'd like to see resolved: 
- I would like to eventually see more help with things like livestock dying from hunger or thirst - a balloon pop-up appears over houses that want more food variety or are starving/out of water, so livestock buildings should have something similar rather than you finding out they are short of hay by seeing a notice of your pig or horse dying. 
- The entire village will often complain about lack of food variety - I'm not sure if this is because my biggest town so far doesn't have pork products or the markets were only in one area, so I've re-opened the pigsty and added some market stalls around the town to see if that resolves things. There is an overabundance of wheat, potatoes, beef, chicken, fish, milk, eggs and oil, so this is just guessing really. 
- Very few seem to have milk, fish and beef, so I don't know if this means a typical Slavic diet needs more pork products? Maybe it's the cost of these items, but if there's a full economy meant to be in the game at some point it means the milk and fish will be extremely cheap. So, not sure about this. At the moment I'm just cutting the number of staff and wages for these industries.

So I like Ostriv. In 46+ hours of playing I had one crash but the autosave and especially the speed of saving/loading meant that there was no frustration. The graphics are good, the music is adequate, the GUI is refreshingly efficient for this genre. No problems with path resolution or weird citizen behaviour (you know, little people getting stuck or deciding they want to spend the rest of their lives at a remote map location until they starve).

That being said, back to being grumpy:
It is expensive for an Alpha release. There are a lot of things currently missing from the game (like more trading, more building types, education, health, entertainment, map locations). Some random events (positive or negative) would also be appreciated as it is very easy to reach the point where the game basically runs on autopilot. I'd also appreciate effective radius of production buildings as in large towns the little people frequently pick jobs at the other side of the town, effectively breaking the supply chain by casually walking throughout half of the working day just to reach their jobs/houses.

I sincerely hope Ostriv makes it to the pantheon of city-building/ management games as there is a lot of potential here.
Recommended for the fans of the genre looking for alternatives to pass their time in quarantine, best wait for the full version for everyone else- especially with this price tag.",1589278538,1589530901,True,11,0,0.637588024139404297,2,True,False,True

Firstly: It's early access, don't expect a finished article, there are bound to be bugs. Start with an accepting and forgiving mindset and this game will eat your hours up.

Starting simply from a camp to the urgency of building homes for your campers before the winter comes, you can build a whole town, industry, and more! This game seems to operate on two levels; one being a simple design and build sandbox but the other being more a chess like social development game.

You always need to think ahead, what materials you need to produce the next building or item, for example starting out grass collecters early so you have ample supply of hay later for horses and cows. Building supply chains from warehouse to warehouse and granary to granary and of course, trade post to warehouses and granaries.

Certain industries depend on certain items, make it, move it, store it, use it, create it, sell it. For everything, and this is only the start! 

Each family is different, has a family tree, they die and you need to create plots for graves, the job management and allocation needs tweaking and I'm sure it will, but there are ways to make workers flood from one job to another, say in August to harvest, set the farm salary up to 120% and everyone rushes to fill those jobs.

Admittedly I'm running towns in debt as I don't think the economic side is nearly developed enough yet, buying resources is handy, selling them hardly worth it.  Each part of the Island should be rich in a resource the other needs, and as such the local macro economy could develop around that, say wood, stone, lime, livestock that would give you a tradeable advantage (and income) over the others.

I was looking for a game that just allowed me to build and manage, no completion, no armies or animals coming to smash or raid you, just a collection of things to build, use and manage and this game already has it, and promises so much more! 

I've done 30 hours so far on this game and probably only just got to grips with all of it, on my fourth play, with pretty much everything built.  

I'm already planning my next set-up based on what I learned last game, and that for me is what gives this game its ultimate value, it's so very playable, and every play will be different and better than the last.

With far more to come, I can't wait until it's finished, and would be happy to demo/bug check/report on it moving forwards - love this game!!!",1589491468,1589491468,True,16,0,0.704403817653656006,0,True,False,True

Pro - graphics are good! I like how detailed the actions of the people are..you get to see the builders actually building a house like a carpenter would, the forestry people carry logs, the slaughterhouse worker takes a dead pig in a cart to the slaughter house. (Those are my favorite features). You can set game play 3 speeds, Trading is fairly easy, you can rotate your buildings to whatever angle you want, It's challenging, which I enjoy, like real life there are steps you need to accomplish before another. (for example, if you want your animals to survive they need a barn and food) I lost many animals to starvation trying to figure that out.  I like that you pay wages and take rent and that you can increase or decrease. 

Cons- there is no tutorial that I saw, I like that if you click on the building associated with your question there is some help but it would be nice to actually have a help section (I am sure it is coming though) The seasonal management is one of my favorite features as well! That is a huge positive over Banished.

Suggestions -  1)Right now you either have to click town hall or put scroll your mouse over the cashflow icon to see your resource level. I would like to have a box box I can move around the screen that can be turned on or off that is a real time of your current resources. I like knowing my resource level all the time.
2) I would like a button(s) in the trading post, barns, farmhouse, to empty the resources that have just been harvested/trades or not needed. For the barns if you empty them the labours take everything out including the food for the animals and same thing with the trading post - the labours take out everything even what is for trade. 
3)would like to be able to see where all my workers are without having to click on each building. Even if on the town hall you can click a tab or something where you can see all your buildings and all the workers and hire or fire from that tab...and maybe see the stats for unemployment and available workers.  Even something that links the storages together rather than having to click on each one to see what they have. Id' really like to just have an area where the big picture is all in one place.

This game is awesome! Especially since it's in early access and still has a bunch of planned features.
I'd say it's definitely playable already, and I'm still getting tonnes of entertainment out of it with 19 hours of playtime.
It's got so many different mechanisms, and all of them for the most part seem pretty balanced. The only unbalanced thing so far that I've seen is pigsties. They produce too many pigs at once, so they're too young to slaughter when you get to the limit, so they just use up a bunch of food.
Other than that, the economy feels pretty balanced, trading with other towns is really cool, and the way the work stuff is set up, with on and off seasons, laborers, and setting wages per building or overall makes balancing your own towns economy super easy.

I played this game for 5 hours with 6 restarts just trying to survive for the first 2 years, but couldn't; I had no idea what I was doing and the game doesn't guide the player in any way besides ""hire 2 workers"" when you start the game by building a forestry.
The mechanics don't make sense to me: everything takes an incredible amount of time to build and there's nothing to do while you wait.  .  .you just wait; (on the plus side of that, you don't need to worry if you wanna send a text, answer a call, check your email etc., you won't really miss anything.) It took (in game time) 8 months to build a fishing dock and boathouse, by the time I was finished it was winter and you can't fish. It also took four months to build a farm and then it was passed planting season; needless (perhaps) to say, by the end of winter I had a town of 9 people and nothing functioning.
I was hoping for a new ""Banished"" of sorts, but this game, at present, is overly, needlessly complicated in my estimation.

The attention to detail evident in construction detail, seasons interacting with other mechanics, and early supply chains is a positive sign.  For my initial 7 hours of play I did not encounter any bugs, crashes or frustrations.  So far so good!  But this is not yet a game, and should only be purchased by people who are fully aware that they are testing rather than playing.  At the end of the day this is an Early Access title in Alpha stages.  

As an experienced player of building/management games, I had to restart only once to account for a starvation death-spiral.  Shortly after that, less than 4 hours into the game I felt I could comfortably be revenue-neutral indefinitely and that left me with only the goal of ""build more"" of the few dozen buildings on offer so far.  Perhaps if I had less personal experience the learning curve would have felt steeper and more satisfying.  Hard to know!

I continued to play for a while to explore supply chains I hadn't built yet, but it felt like there was very little ""game"" left.  You start with 1,000 gold, pay your workers a salary so they can pay you back rent and also pay you back for food you sell them in stalls.  Some households get richer and richer while others inexplicably get poorer and poorer for the same work, even requiring you to manually give them money out of your treasury to feed themselves.  So you sell chain-end goods like shoes to nearby villages when their traders visit you every year, and keep your balance in the black.  

If you manage this poorly, all your money gets stuck inside households as ""personal wealth"" and if you manage this well, you roughly break even, and get to enjoy watching your villagers go about their daily tasks season after season.  Another reviewer mentioned that the quickest way to break even is to set wages, prices and rent as close to zero as possible, and that's basically true, revealing the emptiness of the current economy.  It's alpha, so that's fine.

- Workforce management is a burden. There is no central place to manage the workforce and buildings are constantly looking for workers. If you increase the salary percentage you get workers, but then they're probably leaving their jobs elsewhere in the city which ends up being a game of cat and mouse to keep production going. Not ideal. 
- Production chains are not clear. You end up figuring it out on your own, no help system. 
- Animals cannot be bred in the city, you need to get them from outside with trade post. 
- Trade posts can't establish connections to other cities when there is no manager. Good luck hiring a manager when the game goes into the workers from hell mode. None of the citizens are doing work if you don't up the salaries.

Sure it's still in alpha and therefore lacks some features what would make the game better on launch.
The game is playable in this condition, but i think the game lacks variety at this point.

Income is too low or the product values are too low.
I was constantly -10k (stable tho) until i got 600+ villagers and was able to get back from the grave.

This however took around 50 game years and that is way too long.
Tho you don't actually need money to make anything (as long as you have iron, salt etc. in stash), heck you can still buy stuff from other villagers when you are -10k on money.


What i think this game needs to add/tweak are:
Builders, there are either way too little builders available or they are super slow.
Even having max 8 builders with carts/vagons they build stuff forever. They need to have their own building.

Upgrades:  mostly for buildings, they would be costly at first but would give better performance out of them in the long run. More workers (and faster), new products etc.

Skills: Just some basic ""Physical"", ""intelligence"", ""Strength"" etc. 
Specific building types would attract those that fit in the category to work in those careers.
They would also be better in that job than someone with misfit job.

Soldiers/Barracks

It would be great if suddenly some random rebel group would sack your village and without soldiers they would burn (destroy) buildings, steal/kill villagers and so on.


some basic road customization/ forcing route what villagers must follow to prevent them using shortcuts.
these are niche stuff but it annoys me the hell out of me when you built a bridge over some dirt shore and people will still walk through the mud and won't use the bridge next to them because ""there is a shorter route"" (also makes fences to lock-on tho bridges so there is no gap for for people to slip by.

Happiness/temperature effects.

atm. you can do anything for wages/rent and people wont do anything about it, if people would be unhappy they wouldn't be as efficient workes and vice versa. (This could be specially towards the mayor to tangle the villagers problems).
Cold: People would eat more to stay healthy and require better (craftable) winter gear so they don't freeze. 
Winters would also make firewood crucial to have in stock.
Warm: people use more water than usual, specially if some sort of heatwaves are added (which would affect crops as well).

Market stalls:
Change them so the unit that makes the sold stuff, would automatically sell those goods on their own. You would still need some shop/marker stall to sell them, but the people that makes them, would also hire people to sell them. 
You could also list what said items cost, but at your own risk (no sells, no money, too low price and you get no income.
Each shop should have their own ""money"", based on how well they sell or produce goods. with enough money they can hire more people and invest in upgrades for their shop.

Money:
Had to go back to this:
There needs to be very high priced stuff to buy so the folk who has money could spent it.
Currently it's hilarious when most of the villagers has barely any money, and then there are few of those that have 0.5k money or more. Problem is that they don't spent the ""extra"" money to something ""higher class"" stuff.
Taxes: You could set taxes for invidual shops/pay-grade/ location/job

And Trading post should be able to sell everything you have in Granary/warehouses without limitations.
It is little stupid that you may have 10k on something in warehouse that the merchant wants, but because atm. you don't have that items stored in your trading post (and don't have time to move them there) you  miss the deal.
Also selling the goods could be changed to format where the buyer village sends a messenger with a letter what they need/have. (Remove the x days timeline requirement) and the workers at the Granary/warehouse will fill the Trading post with said items. Only when the request would be fullfilled, your messenger sends a note to the other village so they can come and pick them up.
OR they could pay some fee if you could bring the stuff for them.
This would ofc. require upgraded trading post to have that feature available.

This slows down the money drain if you build town hall quick enough - no one complaining yet :P

I sell sunflower oil, potatoes, textiles - coal/firewood if I can. Get plenty of farms, set them to only employ women (and only women seasonal labourers) - men seem to be in need for other jobs like fishing and blacksmith/carpentry and so women help with the buffering. I haven't seen any benefit for having managers yet.

If you keep expanding slowly, rent will keep you afloat. I've been $2k+ for a while now.

---- My review 10/10

This game is unbelievable. The passion of this dev, he's thrown in all the small details that makes this game feel alive:
- Builders create paths as they walk across grass multiple times
- The way the snow melts in march...ohh my
- Builders throw up beams and panels one by one (nice that the building doesn't pop up out of nowhere!)
- The way the water shimmers and reflects the reeds...I think I'm in love
- NO DUMB WORKERS!

As you may tell, I've been wanting a good game like this forever...Banished (you're ok), there's a few other clones out there that are ok too - but this game has incredible potential to top off the love that's already been poured in.

I enjoy the serenity, the music, the relaxing cycle. Much like Banished and other season city-builders, you'll find yourself scrambling to gather the appropriate resources (food) before winter hits. Farming is the most important mechanic in this game, but finding an appropriate amount of workers-to-food ratio is difficult. You'll have to pull workers from other less important buildings come harvest time. Good luck remembering who went where. There's some flaws with the game...lack of content I think is the biggest one. I understand this is early access so I don't consider this to be a surprise or necessary a big con, but it's hard to define early access anymore. I wish there were links to other local settlements or any kind of endgame at all. Once you reach a certain size and are stable, there just isn't much else to do besides grow. There's a finite amount of mining materials and some materials you have no way of obtaining aside from praying to RNjesus for salt, lime, etc. 

Overall it is a fantastic game to sink a couple dozen hours into in its current state. If you like city-builders it's a must have to the collection. I stopped playing it because one of the updates triggered a game crash upon loading my city. Again, early access, but if it crashes you just quickly relaunch. The game is pretty lightweight and takes hardly any resources to run, so that's a plus. I would like to see some kind of a research tree. There's holes in the production chain...i.e. Why would I produce textiles/clothes when the people don't give a dam(n) if they have them. What's the purpose of lime/quicklime aside from selling it? Shouldn't we be creating glass with it for producing some advanced things? Balance the PIGS! Jesus, those things eat like pigs. There isn't enough food supply in the continent to keep a decent supply of pigs. Content...please add deeper meaning to the production lines. Also, make the kids of parents actually start working at a certain age and make it clear once they do. 

If you can look past the nitpicky flaws I was referring to, you'll have a fun and serene experience. I will revisit this game in 6-9 months to see what was added.",1588086596,1588086596,True,1,0,0.51032644510269165,0,True,False,True

It is your basic build-a-town type of game, but I really enjoy the historic aspect of it. It is difficult at first to figure out how to take care of the needs of your village, but it is fun once you get the hang of it. The dev is doing a great job with it, and health and education buildings are in the works. I can see a future for this game and a lot of ways it can expand and offer a lot of functions. 

I have only experienced minor bugs, nothing major (only once has my game crashed, and for a second one of the villagers was an odd green color when they were working). Thankfully the game autosaves!

Some things I would like to see in the future: Health and Education functions (currently in development), different housing options once your city progresses more, allow children to work at age appropriate places (like the farm), marriage between villagers (like once the kids grow up to adults; there's a lot of children when people settle...once they grow up what do they do?) and then having to build homes for them, not just migrants, and more functions for the kids in general. More information on the functions of how to ensure each building or production works. More decorations and maybe add recreational buildings or activities for the villagers. It would also be cool to be able to get mail or the newspaper, something to link it to real events happening around this time. I also can't get a hang of the economy aspect...it would be nice if it was easier to make money, but thankfully doesn't impact my village too much.

This is still in pre-release, so there are still features missing, but there aren't any missing parts that obviously detract from the game and all the features that are included have a very high level of polish.  It is also a little bit dense to get through - there is only the most basic hand-holding from the tutorial to get you started, and from there you're on your own to discover and learn how everything works.

Pros:

2. Very peaceful to play
3. love the graphics and animations
4. Free placement vs grid allows more freedom of building placement.

Cons:
1. Job placement can be frustrating when you are trying to fill a role and the citizens available will not take the work.

1. Have some form of indicator on what the citizens skill sets are
2. If town needs resources the citizens should ""step-up"" to help meet the need regardless of skill set/ preference.",1587882953,1587882953,True,2,0,0.50437319278717041,0,True,False,True

Hand down to your sir!!!

You build your Ukrainian town from just a small camp in the 1800s.
Very relaxing music,Graphics is ok...Good Mechanics and Game realism is good as you watch buildings get build in detail.
I did enjoy playing this game in Early Access. 
The developer has much more in mind and makes me both hopeful and excited for future updates....

How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
“The current roadmap is as follows.
campaign (story mode)
more production chains
more statistics(production, consumption, trade etc.)
improved trading: trade by sea and by river, negotiations, discounts, reputation
education, religion, entertainment
crime, justice and security
more types of housing(row houses etc.)
more types of bridges, paved roads
orchards, more crop types
improved graphics and optimized performance for bigger cities
Linux (and maybe Mac) support
more weather effects
cats and dogs
more believable behaviors, social activities, animations
products quality, spoilage

I've played Town Building Sim games for decades and I must say honestly I have never played anything quiet like Ostriv.  Without spoiling anything the very first year you think you can willy nilly play but no there is a goal and let me tell you if you don't jump on that goal you will not make it.  But the way the game does its tutorial is unlike most games where they say ""build a forestery, now build this, then build that, etc..."" this game says to build one item and possible another, then thats it.  But that's not it.  I'm not going to say what else needs to be built,  you will find out. 

 Then lets move to food production.  Oh lord, I ALWAYS fail at food production in these games.  Unless its something simple like ""pick berries-hey they can live off berries forever YeY"", Ostriv requires farms and fisheries and other foods and I can't tell you how many times I have restarted a new game because these villagers said they didn't have enough food variety.  Then they leave! I'm like ""heck no you don't leave my game, i'll restart!"" and I did, only to make the same mistake each time.  So I watched a ton of videos, read guides, learned different ways to build a village in the first year to include a farm & harvest. 

In all this I have to say was a lot of fun.  I have a ton of sim building games and I must say solving the food issue was the most fun I had had in awhile.

Ostriv is really kinda similar, just a different theme, 1700s Ukraine instead of some random medievil era. The game looks great and plays nicely, you need to build up your economy quickly and house your citizens before winter comes, or they will all leave. Its fairly in-depth with a detailed resource tree (that you need to keep googling to keep up). For instance, to make shoes you need hay ---> cows ---> slaughterhouse ---> tannery to make leather ---- > also bark from trees and lime ---> 6 months later ---> a shoemaker can start making shoes. 

I think its kinda hard, you seem to run out of money very quickly, and for some reason even with a population of 50 to 70 with two farms and like 10-12 fields, they just cant produce enough crops to feed everyone, and livestock start dying quickly. Think its something to do with soil nutrition, but I cant figure it out. I've done a bit under 10 hours, maybe its just me, but my interest it starting to wane slightly as a result. I'll come back to it in a bit to see if its changed. 

Could still be a bit buggy as its early days, but certainly worth a look in if you like Banished and Forest Village. There aren't many advanced buildings yet (Education, religion, health etc), but they should come with more updates as the game progresses.

I think the biggest weakness in the game as of now it the trade system.  Many people on reddit and else were have mentioned that earning money is a problem.  If the trade system were rework so that excess goods could be more regularly exported, that would help greatly.  There is rarely a demand for the early game products that your village can create (wood, etc).  This is critical as your early village will most likely lack the production capacity to produce the items that your neighbors want (boots, meat, etc.)  While the game lets your village run on a deficit, you won't be able to buy iron, and as you cant produce it, it eventually takes a toll on your village.  The payment to create a trade route should also be a one time cost.  

Otherwise the game is fun, and has a decent aesthetic value, however the trade/money issue really effects the game.  While I'll admit that I am not the most savvy player, I do believe that built an managed my village decently, having play many other city management type games, including Banished which is similar.

So far this is really good for early access but there are a few changes I think need to be made. One would be a tutorial. The learning curve is quite steep, especially those unfamiliar with the genre. The management aspect is very detailed and requires constant evaluation. I really like the economy aspect but there definitely needs to be something more in game to let players know how they can effect it. I quit my first few towns because I kept going in the negative before I realized that is typical when first starting. 

Food management is unbalanced I think. Initially its OK, but when your town gets to about 100 there is just not enough people willing to work to support the whole community. It cant be just adult men for most of the jobs.

That being said, I'm finding this game pretty enjoyable.  Yes, it's a bit like Banished! and no it's not like Banished! at all...

How it is not like Banished!
1) No gathering/zones
2) No mass influx of immigrants to overwhelm your town
3) Not nearly as many houses needed
4) Much nicer graphics
5) Your town can virtually die and you can still save it. (as long as you have the trade center)
6) No building grid
7) paths and lanes are generated by foot and cart traffic only

How it is like Banished!
1) Same type of game essentially
2) Resource generation style game, with feeding your town at its core.

Really nice things about this game:
1) It's apha and actually works rather well for such an early access game
2) There is some challenge to the game
3) Great music
4) Nice maps, sure there will be more to come
5) Very relaxing
6) Organic flexibility, yeah. 
7) Micromanaging style builder

Bottom line, if you enjoyed Banished! but hated that the development of that game died, this could be for you.  There are enough differences and in depth play that it feels fresh.  I would compare to Sim City vs City Skylines, but not as demanding or asset heavy.  If you have to have crisp grid like square lines due to heavy OCD issues, then you might go nuts.

Things the game could still use: (I am sure we will get many of these, I think)
More maps or a map editor
Optional grid-style tools (perhaps a mod one day)
More decorative items
Some mild terraforming (there is a current bug if you misplace a building in a certain way and delete you leave a big crater and you can't get rid of it easily)

I was a bit nervous about buying this game, but am very glad I did. 
For anyone familiar with Banished, this game is quite a close match to that game in most ways.
I can't say enough how much I like the detail given to the day-to-day graphical processes. Watching a Village House be built--or any building for that matter, is a pleasant experience. It gives the look and feel of the people actually building right down to nearly every process. 

The game still needs some polish/features added to it, but it appears the developer is actively working on that. For example, I'm hopeful that there will be more variety in the houses that are built in future releases or updates. The same applies to all the buildings. I'm anxious to see and/or contribute to the future development of this game. I had no problems whatsoever with installation and the game is stable/has never crashed on my system.

Pros:
* A lot care went into the small details that many in this genre simply don't bother with.
* The graphics are fine, nothing fantastic... but very well done.
* The music is well done, however it did cause me to almost nod off a couple times . :)
* Lots of great reviews. Difficult to find games that have that on steam.

Cons:
* It's you against starvation. There seems to be little else, no combat whatsoever.
* The game does not explain itself very well. You're just thrown in, good luck.
* The maps, while not bad looking.. are very flat and barren. There are only a few presets to 
  choose from.
* The game seems to glitch from time to time for no reason. 

Some examples:

* My town quit making nails. I shut off every single production and fired everyone except nail 
  production, nada, game over.
* One of my towns simply quit lighting the fire that produces charcoal. Again..  I shut off every 
   single production and fired everyone, no go, game over.
* One of my towns folks simply quit getting water.. Was fine for 20 minutes then poof everyone 
   is dying of thirst. 

What I wish to see in future updates:

* For gods sake put a texture on those house stoves/chimney's It looks incomplete as the 
   house is being built. I understand it's white when the house is complete... still... a small 
   texture would go a long way.
* Give me a ground level first person view. Half the fun is seeing my work up close.
* Explain what I need to do better in game. It took me 10 minutes and a help request in forums 
   to figure out how to transfer a cart.
* Give me more clustered information on population such as who can work and who can't Half 
   the time I was clicking hire and just hoping someone would show up. Not very clear.
* Clean up pathfinding, I just ended up with a massive spiderweb of roads/paths that made my 
   town look like crap. I like the idea but in use it's too much.

I understand it is an EA game but as it stands now today I afraid i'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. I own a lot of these games and this simply brings less to the table and honestly no real innovation. It's not a bad game.. but it's not a good game either.

- Buildings be able to snap into place when placing them instead of having to rotate them and then things being uneven.

- Easier ways to make money
- Be able to make large grave yards instead of placing 1 at a time
- Easier ways to manage animals, ( keep them alive )

First, the game is hard, and my first few attempts ended in bankruptcy and starvation. I don't usually have time for gaming due to work but good old Covid has given me a lot of time indoors, so I struggled with this game for a while. There is a guide but I like to play organically and let the game teach me. So the pros; the buildings are quite pretty and realistic looking. The depth of the game is amazing. Cons: There is still a lot that is in development and I would like to see those 'In the works"" become reality. I also feel that it is a test of your patience, building up to a moderate city takes a long, long time. I also wish I could have two or three different building crews so I could build multiple buildings at the same time. Things I have learned; a big one is allocating workers to help collect the harvest in August. Also, to stop the financial bleeding you need that Town Hall built fast but you wont be able to until the second year. The first year you are forced to build a certain set of building in a certain order or you will lose people. The Town Hall allows you to reduce all the rates to almost zero which slows down the speed of monetary loss quickly. I recommend if you have problems get on here and ask people who have already played, most will help you. I posted a negative review initially due to frustration but I know now to just ask questions, I got some great help.

Still in Alpha, but I havent noticed any bugs yet. Its the right kind of hard - took a few goes to get a town up and running, and the challenges dont stop there. Youll always be looking to improve your supply chains.

Attention to detail in this builder is probably the best Ive seen, and ive play A LOT of city builders. Watching the builders put together your buildings, using carts, carrying around the foundations of the building is a a really nice touch.

LOVE:
- Supply chain mechanics for resources (food, clothes, materials) is really in-depth and provides a level of challenge as it takes realistic amounts of resources, buildings, and workers to produce items like flour or nails for example.
- I really like the immigration requirements. It's a lot more real with food, job availability, etc. whereas in other games all you need is available housing and they just show up.
- I think the trade system being based off the demand of other towns is really neat. It requires you to be a bit more strategic with trade
- The style of the buildings and game is super cool

Things I'd like to see in the future:
- Stuff they're still working on like additional buildings, health/education, etc.
- It'd be cool to choose what the houses look like in terms of variety
- I wish I could store more resources in the trade building or at least be able to build a trade auxillary or something to store more resource types to account for trade

It already has some amazing features if you're a veteran of the city-building/colony simulator genre. Things like the crop rotation mechanic, roads forming organically by repeated routes, and building ""gantt chart"" style progression are really groundbreaking. It seems to really focus on realism and it shows.

At the moment as it's in early access, it's lacking some quality-of-life things right now as you'd expect. It's a little tough to tell when and where a production chain breaks until it's already too late, and it can be difficult to troubleshoot sometimes especially when starting out. It can also be pretty difficult to balance your budget, for example I basically had to put my economy in deep freeze early on, dropping wages and market price way down, but it took a while to figure that out. 

Because of some of those things, in its current state it may be a bit unapproachable for more casual players or people new to colony sims, but given its current progress and roadmap, I really have no reason to be concerned that the developer will address those things in updates.

I love that I have overall control of this but also am a passenger watching it happen.

1. The game seems to take place on the black sea on the world map, but there isn't an option to build a port town, ocean going vessels, ocean trade, ocean products, salt, etc. There is salt in the game, but at this time you have to buy it.
2. More interaction with the Orthodox Church.  Rituals, priests, the implications of Russian Orthodoxy
3.  More clear about being Russian settlers, Ukrainians that are settling the town, and possibly create conflict.
4. Have Jewish relationships be incorporated in some way, along with Cossacks.

EDIT:

It'd also be great to use logs instead of wood in some of the construction, and for oxen to be involved in the construction of large buildings, such as using ox powered cranes.  

I'd love for my town to be able to grow into a city with an aristocracy, political conflicts, and churches with domes. Are we in Novorossiya under the rule of Prince Potomkin?",1585361834,1585369883,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,True

Currently no villager ambiance such as chatter or npc interactions although the animations are decent and the clothing reflects the time and demographics. 

Nothing glorious yet as there are limited maps(yet plenty large and should easily cover a good number of weekends. No tutorial yet but if your familiar with games of similar make then its not hard to figure out priorities after a couple playthroughs. 

Overall i'd say if you only can get 1 game and its between something finished and you know you will enjoy and This i'd say follow it for a while until you seen enough to know you will get entertainment with what it has or will have. Otherwise the game already has enough hours to keep ya busy.

So far, the game is great. Couple of issues, you can't redefine the keys; being a leftie, i always switch WASD to arrow keys. Redefine doesn't recognise the new key press, only the mouse click. Then you are stuck; you have to delete the Ostriv folder under your Users/Documents folder.
As soon as i put down a Tannery, everyone in my town left, i mean everyone. 0 population. It was Winter, and it seems population dwindle 10% or so over winter, but i am talking ghost town, then all my pastured cows starved. Maybe it was something i did, but my town was on the comeback. Also, the requirements for quicklime may be a bit extreme. I couldn't even make two batches with the amount of Limestone on my entire map.

Anyway, great game, couple of suggestions: When dealing with messengers, please default the number of items to sell to the number of items, of that type, in your Trading Post, it will save having to switch back and forth.

For quite some time I never imagined anything knocking the crown of the king of the survival city builder from off the head of Banished. For a while I thought the title may be claimed by LIF: Forest Village, but after development of that game was eventually abandoned (sadly) no other serious contenders came forth...until now.

Ostriv is a game like few others, a survival city builder. As previously mentioned, it was made famous by Banished back in 2014 where you build a town and have to keep your citizens alive by providing food/clothing/heat/etc. However, it is not an easy genre to get right as make it too easy and it becomes a bore, but make it too difficult and it becomes impossible. Ostriv manages to thread that narrow gap pretty well.

One of my absolute favorite features, and one I can't recall seeing in any other game other than Stonehearth, is seeing your citizens build every building piece by piece. I was delighted when I put down my first forestry that the actual timber foundation pieces were placed one at a time. The deck frame was built timber by timber. It was wonderful to watch and a little detail that shows just what kind of game Ostriv is striving to be: slow paced but active.

Another feature that I see rarely is pathfinding based roads. Meaning, you the player do not place roads but they form naturally based on the paths the citizens find. It is gradual and I didn't realize it happened at first, but I eventually started to see the paths the citizens themselves created. You will never really be able to create nice grid-based settlements, but they will appear more organic than contrived.

Some other great features:
- Full production chains (eg. iron + charcoal = nails).
- AI automation is pretty well done. There is little micromanagement that I saw.
- Trade with other settlements.
- Builders will build based on what materials they already have on site and focus on one project at a time.
- Disused paths will disappear.
- The game tells you what you need, but...(see below).
- Current Alpha is better than many finished games.

Some things that are not quite so good:
- Tutorial is not that great and the game is unforgiving. It has a nasty habit of telling you you are short on some material when it is almost too late. For example, I was told I needed a smith because I was running short on nails, but didn't have enough nails to build said smith.
- Only four maps (currently) is a little bit of a bummer.
- Limestone is hard to get.
- I still don't know where to get iron from.
- Building styles are a bit lacking. Now I realize this takes place in Ukraine and the buildings are styled around that, but I get bored with my towns looking the same all over.

If the devs keep doing what they're doing my cons list will likely get shorter and shorter. This is an amazing alpha that looks far better than many finished games, so they are doing very well so far. So time will tell, but Banished has another contender finally for King of the Survival Citybuilders.",1584728049,1584728049,True,97,3,0.854879140853881836,2,True,False,True

The game is emminently playable, if a little feature-bare in some areas as of the current version (Alpha 3). I have only encountered one bug, which was purely visual so far (15 hours in).

Only one thing to keep in mind. I love slow-paced games. I've played some of the slowest-paced games out there. This one is the slowest of them all. For me, that's part of the appeal, but you have to invest a long time into a build before you get anywhere in this game.

When the people start demand food variety,  you have lost:
1. They stop migrating to your place.
2. You can't produce new food types. (if you sack people, they leave the town it seems, bug?)
3. You run out of food and money and people leave.

Couple of ideas:
1. Have 5 years or so where food variety does not come in to play.
2. Or food variety demand increases with each year gradually.

Works fine on linux (PopOS + Steam Proton 5.0.4), just had to remove the ""allow post-processing"" game display configuration.

I'll recommend the game because it's ""early access still""

The timeline is indeed starting in the 1800's.

Tutorial. W-A-S-D, Q-E, Zoom-Recede.
Great graphics.
Great music.
Different game speeds. Seasons. Years.
Individual character names, skills, home/work/entertainment, & family trees. Needs. Births. Old age.
Able to see architecture blueprints, supply, needs, & construction.
Resources grow back. Trees, animals, fish. Choices of crops.
Trade with other towns, markets, barter system.
Roads & bridges.
Disasters. Disease. Unhappiness.
