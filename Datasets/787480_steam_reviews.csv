I finally decided to pick it back up again once I found out that they were releasing the Apollo Justice trilogy onto Steam. So I was like, you know what, let me finish what I started. It was kind of a pain to get through JFA, since I stopped playing at the point of one of the most remarkably terrible chapters. I wouldn’t recommend starting Ace Attorney and then just dropping it for a long while because I had to refresh my memory on a lot of previous cases since I had forgotten the main plot points of them (which is not a good idea since the game is very driven by its past cases). The game normally gives a short recap at times, but I’m very detail-oriented, so I wasn't satisfied with how brief it was. I straight up read through several wiki pages just to remember what had happened previously. However, once I got back, I got back to playing NONSTOP. I remembered just how fun and enjoyable all the characters were, and honestly, I loved the challenge of trying to figure out the mysteries behind each case. Although I enjoyed all of the games equally, my favorite one hands down was Trials and Tribulations. And the final achievement that the game gives you for completing the whole trilogy had me bawling. 

My only complaint was that the lawyers did not smooch at the end. I will always have a little soft spot for the gay lawyers (and Gumshoe).",1708896199,1708930592,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lots of content for the price.

Ace Attorney is a courtroom drama vn with some detective investigation in between, I don't like VNs that boil down clicking through dialogue and only ever giving a ""yes/no"" option every now and then to make a save point at, so basically any VN that includes more gameplay has preferential treatment from me. I might have given a positive review to danganronpa games, but the bat***t story and school (eww) settings in some are far worse than the more grounded and charming scenarios of these games. The gap between the two series in my eyes is big, and I prefer PW:AA a lot more.

The visuals are upscaled, traced and smoothened out from the old pixelated releases, they tried to keep them as similar to the original sprites as possible, which while playing it safe, is probably the best choice for such a beloved series. Some of the visuals might look odd in such high resolution, and there is no setting to switch back to old sprites, so it's not perfect exactly, but I have few complaints. I like the charm to the spritework and the 3 games have a very specific artstyle that stands out. It might not be the best looking gameboy game, but for the cartridge limitations etc. it looked good for the time.

Sound is pretty much the same as (I believe) DS ports, the music is higher quality than the gameboy releases, and while sound effects are probably better too, they are VERY crunchy at times. The fact that visuals have been upscaled and recreated, yet the sounds are as compressed as years before does stand out quite a lot, the loops are naturally also still very short, so things like rowdy courtroom crowd looping is very noticable. The music composition though is outstanding, and one of the big reasons people still remember Ace Attorney games.

Gameplay is a bit simple, but still rewarding, investigation sections involve point n click mechanics, looking for items, talking to people, using items on people to progress, and from game 2 onwards - interrogating minigame to discover secrets.
In courtroom you get several part statements from witnesses, press on them for more details, sometimes uncovering additional parts, and selecting correct evidence on correct statement part to object. Sometimes you have a multiple choice question, or you point to specific element on a photo/map to prove your point. Each mistake costs an amount of health, which without using saves can be a bit restrictive with how much text you would need to skip past again. The HP part is not perfect, but it often acts as a decent pressure gauge, as more important points will also penalize more on your bar.
Lastly, the first game had a DLC in its nintendo ds rerelease, it's a longer case and it includes some new things (which stand out by being absent in chronologically next 2 games), some of the evidence can be inspected as 3d objects, there is a little interactive segment to check for fingerprints, and there is even a short 3d video cutscene, that you will pause at correct time to point out a contradiction, something that was only possible on static images in other entries.

Lastly the story, the first game is a classic and works perfectly well as a self contained piece of writing, it was a critique of japanese judical system at a time, and the main characters reflect that, even disregarding that aspect, the narrative is solid and well put together, with only the samurai case feeling as a bit of an intermission. The second game is a bit rough in my eyes, it pushes a theme very strongly in an overt way at the very beginning, just to sit on it and seemingly do nothing until the very end. The starting theme in question is just ""what if we did it the other way around"", where defense lawyers can be the immoral ones. The second (first real case) is decent and it sets up a lot, while coming from the first game, revealing that a spiritual aspect is no longer implied, kind of disappointed me, it is a set up for better things to come out of it. Third case feels like extreme filler, although I did like the conclusion of it. And lastly the fourth case, which despite the game feeling weak, is one of the best cases in the entire series, the twist might be obvious at that point, but the way it flows is executed really well.
Then the third game, rarely do I see the third installment to be the best, yet this one happened. There are two cases set in the past that add to the main narrative, while the 2 standalone ones feel a LOT better than the circus one in 2, the fact that the game doesn't start with a big dream sequence metaphor helps these 2 cases feel natural, and despite being a bit disconnected from the narrative, they also add to the character development, besides just being good on their own. Then there is a case that closes it all, all 3 games, takes setup from second game and all of the additional context from 3rd, the character development pays off a lot, even pulling on my strings a little, despite me being a cold stupid f***k. Things that seemed like anime nonsense were executed in such a smooth and convincing way that even on second playthrough I felt like I was going through this story the first time. I could easily recommend checking out PW1 on its own, and if its quirks are fun enough to push further, I think it'd be a disservice to stop before reaching the end of PW3.

I don't know what the optimal price would be, I think I paid around 20 bucks, which is quite a bit if you just want to play the first game, but for all 3 classic games I'd say it's worth it and then some.",1708170090,1708170090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The pacing is glacially slow, and the dialogue is not exactly riveting. Furthermore, I had only gotten as far as the 2nd chapter of the first game when I already hit a logic problem; the clear and obvious answer was apparently wrong, and after racking my brain I went online to find the solution, which turned out to make no sense.

In this trilogy, we'll play as a defense attorney throughout fourteen different cases. As this job demands we would have to examine the crime scene, search for clues, talk to witnesses, defend our clients, have a blind faith in them and finally willing to discover the very truth until the end.
Although this visual novel is not one of my favourites it is indeed  freaking good. All the sections of this game are absolutely incredible. I'll talk in full detail about those:

-The soundtrack is unbelievable. There's not a single bad song on the trilogy soundtrack. Each one is perfectly designed for transmitting the right feeling or sensation at the right time. These might become a little repetitive though.

-The characters are well written. Every single one of them have their own background, their own goal or objective and their own development. I must mention the fact that every character is there for a reason and everyone have something to do with past, current or future cases. Or even they have conections or secrets between themselves that we'd have to uncover.

-I think that the cases themselves are the best and most important section about this visual novel. Every new case that we have to play is better than the last one. Not just better but more mysterious, more entertaining and more unpredictable. Just like the characters, the cases are not random. Most of them are linked to each other and we will realize that sooner or later. Of course, not every case has the same lore or talks about the same murder or situation.
Every case is different than the previous one. And of course, I have to mention that not every case has the same length, some are shorter and some are larger.

-The hours worth of gameplay is something to stand out too. In my experience, it took me 106 hours to complete the fourteen cases. It could sound like it's too many hours but you won't get bored a single minute playing this game, I can assure u that for sure.

I'd like to mention the only negative thing about this visual novel though. That is the lack of a patch about the Spanish translation. I understand that's an issue for the people who speak Spanish but don't speak English. It's kinda sad that they can't have the oportunity to play such a great visual novel just for that.

Anyways I deeply recommend you to buy and play this visual novel, you won't regret it. The people who are into series or movies about crimes, attorneys and law stuff, like I am, they must play this too.

You know why I love Ace Attorney? -- Because it takes a mundane, boring-ass job and turns it into this hype dramatic courtroom drama. Lawyers just weren't cool before Phoenix Wright came along!

The first three games of this game are so similar in game-play & story-telling that I can't really pick them apart individually. But I'll say that Trials & Tribulations has the most consistently awesome cases, so I'll pick that one as my favourite of the trio. BUT that is also due to how Justice For All and Ace Attorney were building up to that finale conclusion in Trials & Tribulations. Albeit the case ""Rise from the Ashes"" is single-handedly the best case in the entire series. It's so fricking good, it's one of the most epic cases to ever possibly exist, to ever be written in any media whatsoever!
I mean... these are linear visual-novels, which is something I'd otherwise never really enjoy; but the writing in them all are so good that I completed all three. As a guy who doesn't typically enjoy those types of games, this is completely unnatural for me, let alone spending 75 hours in one. Yet they hooked me so much that I would spent HOURS per day just reading all these insane dialogue sequences, while I'm on my tippy toes, with my jaw hanging, experiencing the best video-game writing I've ever encountered. Basta! There so many iconic & memorable lines & moments throughout this trilogy, that they never leave your mind. You'll think back fondly to so many parts of this game with a huge grin, as it's all good memories. It's full-throttle top-tier writing all the time!
And the amount of 'Chekhov's gun' presences in this game is simple baffling!

You go up against all these prosecuters & murderers who are out to get Phoenix Wright, like they got the spiteful fire in their eyes and all.
Seeing the breakdowns, and finding the contradictions................ ohh so satisfying! It's some of the most satisfying & exciting moments in my history of gaming, ever.
If you haven't touched this trio of games before, do yourself a favour and buy them ASAP! Pronto!

It's like, the plot of these games are so bat-sh!t insane -- Like Phoenix Wright is defending his arch-nemesis childhood friend 'Miles Edgeworth', in a murder cases which Miles admitted to committing. And the prosection is led by Mile's former Sith Lord who's never lost a case in 40 years!! You wanna talk drama? Go tell all your bachelor shows to screw off! Come play Ace Attorney! You're in for a ride, laddie.



[h1] Achtung, baby! Let's rock! [/h1]

oh...my...god...
The soundtrack for these games some of the bests on the market. I've never experienced anything like it, not to the same degree. The sound-design is just simply outright unfathomable.
With all the blazing notes, and catchy rhythms; it all just seamlessly flow together into this elegant, beautiful maestro pot of elegance & rancid power fantasies; forming this majestic soundtrack to wonderfully go alongside with the game. To remove the soundtrack of this game is to remove so much of its very own spirit. Ace Attorney is only half itself without its music. The scenes & score slither together to bind a formation irremovable, as one are just not as powerful if not without the other, as they build on-top of each other. The music further emphasises the epic & sorrowful occasions to be held throughout the game, just like how the epic & sorrowful occasions emphasise the music. With only one, you only got half the experience. To experience one before the other is to lessen the experience to when the two of them conjoined.
It's so beautiful, it's so great, honestly.
And it's straight-up all bonerjams too. I can't explain it... it can only be understood the best audibly when accompanied with its possible contexts.
I listen to the soundtrack every week, it's great!
Still, I prefer Ace Attorney 4, 5,and 6's scores overall; but these are really wonderful regardless!



[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy is one of the best gaming experiences one can play.
This is a game I feel I can recommend to everyone: noob, pro, non-reader, reader, dumb, smart, young, old; doesn't matter. I believe this can be an experience every demographic can enjoy! Just be capable of reading, at least. haha

It is a fun game, with funny characters, deep lore and a lot of joy when you find a contradiction! Nobody is safe from assumption, and if it gets too hard you can search the internet for a guide.


On the other hand, it is an extremely hard game. Sometimes, while you’re investigating, you might forget to do something and get stuck in that point of the game. You can always count on a guide to help you though.

All in all, This game was worth the hours of fun, even though I got stuck many times and had to look up a guide. It is a great game, and it’s got more cases to present in other Ace Attorney games!

I would rate each game as follows (1-5, worst to best):
AA: 4*
JfA: 3*

The standout cases were: Rise from the Ashes, Bridge to the Turnabout and to a lesser degree Turnabout Memories, Turnabout Sisters, Turnabout Beginnings. You can probably see a pattern: the cases tied to the main story are more to my taste in general but it's not always the case: The Lost Turnabout.

The games also have one of the best soundtracks in history, which is no small feat.

——————————————————
66小时成步堂三部曲结束，评价的话第一部9/10，第二部3/10，第三部7/10，第一部多2分主要在于初见新鲜感+没勾玉，勾玉系统属实太垃圾了。比较喜欢的案子1-4御剑案、1-5警署检察院案、2-2灵媒案、3-2怪盗案和3-5叶樱院案，都是案子本身有让我“哇，这个点有意思”的设计以及逻辑相对正常、推理相对流畅的。1-4巧妙在三人伪密室（电梯）的第四者，1-5的影片推理+同一人两个被害地特别有趣，2-2正当防卫到完全无罪，3-2犯人移动装饰来伪装日期+一罪不二审，3-5利用信息差降灵保护自己。虽然这几个案子都有瑕疵和令我暴躁的逻辑点，尤其灵媒案和最终案，但瑕不掩瑜。讨厌的案子2-3马戏团案、2-4王都楼案和3-3真假律师案，只能说是逻辑崩坏、胡乱吃书、全员降智、前后矛盾、故弄玄虚、部分触发苛刻且无提示。第一部初见真的好玩，互扔异议特别搞笑，第二部游玩体验奇差，好在第三部又恢复正常。整体下来最喜欢的人物还是千寻，温柔但果敢坚定；除此之外，成步堂、御剑、真宵、系锯刑警、矢张、彩芽、雾绪的人物塑造都很好，难得玩一款单机游戏会对这么多角色高好感。
最后再补一句，古早游戏里的男凝真的让人很不舒服，这游戏里太多猥琐男npc了，每部都有一个，像是什么游戏kpi指标一样，只能说看在古早日本游戏的份上我原谅。
————————————————————————
第一部真的很有质量，有趣且有逻辑，但第二部是什么鬼啊……再故意夸张我也无法接受狩魔冥动不动就法庭上抽人鞭子，你们立本法里没有故意伤害罪吗？？
灵媒案逻辑逆天，灵媒被附身杀了人，成步堂不希望真宵背负杀人的阴影所以想证明真宵的“绝对无辜”我尚且可以用“灵媒被附身时不会做梦”来洗，但检察官和法官和整个法院的人全都在认为“灵媒确实被附身了”的前提下还坚持灵媒有罪，啊？？而且姐妹长得根本不像，在被拍到了那么清楚的正脸照的情况下竟然是靠“化妆”这个理由就能说这是姐姐伪装，你这不是化妆，是易容吧？？
马戏团的案子简直一坨垃圾，凶手不能探出窗外看到受害人的位置，于是放了个10公斤的大箱子在楼下，并说受害人会因为知道这是她以前犯错的证据而弯腰搬箱子，所以能确定位置……但你原本想杀的是那个13岁的女儿啊？？？你放的箱子1.上锁了没人能看到内容物，2.内容物全是胡椒粉瓶，受害人搬走毫无意义，3.又大又重你指望一个13岁小女孩儿看到箱子的第一反应是去搬？？更荒谬的是扔半身像砸人还能拽回楼上，一路上竟然没有半身像和墙体的碰撞摩擦声，半身像在砸死受害者的时候竟然还正巧把受害者身上穿着的披风挂上了…………你哪怕说指挥猴子呢…………这个案子我看完最大感受是：狮子雷恩真惨，被马戏团动物表演了一辈子，老了还因为小女孩儿放的胡椒粉打喷嚏而伤了人被枪杀。
真宵被绑架的案子更是一个逻辑崩坏+吃书的合集，杀手脸上缝线这么明显的特征，成步堂硬是在第二次见面没认出来？杀手名字这么特殊，甚至都写在案情记录里了，成步堂再次听到这个名字硬是一点反应都没有？？游戏世界观设定了三日法庭，到第三天一定要做出有罪无罪判罚，结果第三天法庭上法官说明日再审？？？而这时候成步堂竟然反对明日再审，因为他要拖时间让警方找到真宵？？？你今天在法庭拖再久也不如明天再审拖得久啊。
玩第二部全程不断提醒自己别带脑子别带脑子，然而又会因为条件苛刻且没提示的剧情触发锁卡关。上一部碰运气出示证据成功的感受是“哇这个我没想到，但合情合理！”，这一部我直接穷举成功的感受是“你还能这么水剧情啊？”
玩第三部之前先给个差评。第二部烂得令人发指。

After checking online, the primary task of a lawyer is to propose suggestions to the court according to the law for the defendant's innocence or lightening, mitigating or exempting punishment. 
He can do both guilt and innocence defense. When doing guilt defense, he can agree with the prosecutor's qualitative opinion on the case, but he cannot completely agree with the prosecutor's view as a second prosecutor.

Capcom has somehow decided that mods will ruin their reputation. I assume some hyper-religious useless twit of a corporate officer took offense to the various nude mods for RE 4.

Twit:
""Oh, no, Ada isn't wearing clothes!
""Devs, why did you put this in the game?""

Devs:
""Uh, it's not us, Twit-sama!""
""Yeah, it's modders, Twit-sama!""

It's a case-related interactive story where your character, a defense attorney, is put in some pretty comically impossible situations.  A lot of character reactions and mannerisms are pretty dang hilarious, like you would expect from this form of Japanese entertainment.

The cases throughout the episodes often relate to one another, but not always.  There are two forms of gameplay, investigation and trial.  Investigations involve reviewing crime scenes, speaking to people and presenting evidence to get more information.  Trials involve figuring out what truly happened by cross-examining witnesses for contradictions either by pressing their statements or presenting evidence, and by further proving your case by making decisions.  Most of the time, you really, really need to know the ins and outs of the case.  This game does NOT forgive you very easily for being all willy-nilly about pressing and presenting.  You must do so with meaningful purpose.  If you screw up enough times (in few cases, only one screw up will fail the entire trial) the verdict for the prosecution will be handed down and you will have to start all over.  Not to mention, the game does not spare you in making you feel like a total loser when this happens.

The biggest beef I had with this game was the fact that your opponents, the prosecutors, and a few disagreeable witnesses, act like the biggest freaking d0uchebags ever.  The second was that the judge(s) are complete imbeciles and will hastily disregard all of your decisive evidence just because you pressed the wrong freaking statement or something stupid like that and they possess no actual spine and basically let the prosecutor run the whole dang show.  I found myself calling my computer screen lots of derogatory terms because of this.  My wife:  ""What are you doing down there??""

In the end, the stories are entertaining, the cases are interesting and the investigation/trial work requires you to think through everything in great detail, or you will not succeed.  If you're a good puzzle-solver and are a fan of legal themes, then you would like this game a lot.",1705330944,1705330944,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sad as this is one of my favorite games, but I care about integrity and ownership more than brand loyalty. Anyway, DRM is cancer. Stop spreading it.

Former positive review:
Ace Attorney is a series about arguably competent lawyers fighting in a kangaroo court to appease or threaten the judge into taking their sides and I think playing the games is a human right. I'm going to go off on a limb even and claim Ace Attorney is the best visual novel series ever made, or at least the best I've ever played. 

Sure, you could just watch a YouTube video on the games. You know, if you suck. Playing the games for yourself and experiencing the nonsense that goes on in this heaven-forsaken courtroom firsthand is definitely the best way to play, though. Make up your own jokes and baloney along the way and all that good stuff.

Also if it wasn't for some of the very explicitly Japanese-y content, you'd be unable to tell this game wasn't originally in English. The translation is stellar. Some may not like that the games had, and continue to change character names from the original Japanese, but considering a lot of the names are puns you'd be unable to understand if they didn't change them, I think it as a whole makes the game more enjoyable to a non-Japanese audience. Not to mention typos and grammar errors are few and far between which, for a text-based game series, is not an easy thing to check for.

My only complaint is that not enough of this series is on PC. NOT. ENOUGH. This trilogy and the Great Ace Attorney duology are the ONLY ones. Dammit man, I just want AA: Investigations on PC. Is that too much to ask? What about Apollo Justice? Dual Destinies? Spirit of Justice? There's so much of this series limited to platforms that aren't PC! I'd be glad to pay another however much it'd cost for a second trilogy with the other 3 games, or an Investigations collection or whatever.

很早以前玩3DS的时候就听说过这部作品，但当时以为自己不会喜欢文字/剧情类游戏。最近看到各个平台玩梗的人越来越多，而且都是好梗，趁这次打折入了三部曲。

剧情方面要着重夸，其实当玩家被代入到游戏中时，自己也会猜测真相。甚至很多时候，玩家自己的解释都能自圆其说，但是游戏依然可以给出意料之外的结局。而且这些故事不单单是悬疑推理，还加入了宿命论、神秘主义和寓言故事的元素。让我甚至觉得有种看《岸边露半一动不动》的感觉。

把人物之间的情感以在我看来隐晦内敛的方式融入在悬疑故事中，同时又真正让玩家真真切切体会到了角色之间的炽热情感，在我看来真的是非常难得。

游戏性主要体现在调查和庭审，个人比较喜欢庭审过程。询问和指出矛盾是游戏核心，尤其是寻找库存中正确的证据并加以解释这一点真的对我来说很有吸引力。调查方面，感觉最突出的点是气氛，也就是真相慢慢显露的过程。不过有少数调查感觉有些重复了。",1704827967,1704827967,True,1,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

- Super interesting and well written story
- The best of the best Capcom has to offer if it comes to visual novels / adventures and they nailed it
- No stupid DLCs or ripped content, just a remaster of the classic DS game. 
- Excellent music
- Only 30€. You need to understand this is the price for the whole trilogy, back in the days every single game of this trilogy was priced at 40-60€, inflation not even included. You really save giga money buying this even at full price. 
- Your chef is super hot... Like really hot. 

Cons: 
- They could have also remastered Apollo Justice, the 4th game of this series but whatever.

EDIT: They did exactly what I wanted, they put the Apollo Justice Trilogy on Steam too. Now you have all 3 trilogies here on Steam.",1589715599,1704406616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This VN has got some of the most uncomfortable controls of any VN I have ever played. They're scattered all over the keyboard - one minute you're pressing space, then tab, then escape, then J, then you need to use the mouse for something else. It's absurdly byzantine for a VN, as if the game was programmed by an octopus.

You can't flick through text quickly because there are constant animated interludes that slow down the dialog. When you're not in the courtroom it takes 27 different button presses just to walk 2 rooms over and talk to someone. And you need to constantly walk 2 rooms over and talk to someone because the next piece of dialog only unlocks in one place if you follow exactly the perfect sequence of events in another place, and then you have to go back to the first place and do it all over again for the next dialog unlock. This game feels like a relic from the dark ages of point and click adventures. To be fair it is 20 years old, but even for the era this is offensively bad.

I might be able to overlook the hideous controls if the game was actually good, but it isn't! Everything in the artwork is rooted in Japan, but the translation explicitly sets itself in America so the dialog never matches the artwork and every scene feels weirdly hollow as a result. I know the whole gimmick is that the cases are bizarre, but no matter how much improbable nonsense they pile on, nothing ever gets wacky in a way that's actually interesting. It's always a kangaroo court. The judge puts up arbitrary roadblocks for no plot reason, it's simply a trick to make the player's life more difficult. All the characters are shallow and - even worse - stupid. You can sit there as a player and know exactly what happened but the game won't let you solve the case because you didn't pick up the right object or ""press"" on the right witness statement yet. It's just infuriating.

On the upside, the music is good, and the first time you see ""objection!"" it's totally meme-worthy and hilarious. But then it happens a dozen more times. I kept playing thinking that perhaps on the next day or the next case something new would be brought to the table, but nothing ever is. All the jokes are played out after the first half hour. I just cannot understand how people enjoy this game. It's so slow and frustrating and dull. There are so many better detective games, point and click adventures and visual novels out there.

1) With three games in one (Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations), this remastered and bundled trilogy is expansive and affordable.
2) The Capcom Sound Team made fantastic songs that accompany the setting well, making for many catchy tunes on this soundtrack.
3) This trilogy gives an immersive setting with unique gameplay elements and a story that progresses through the various chapters offered, adapting concepts and ramping up difficulty. The ensemble of characters and moments will leave you wanting more and wondering what could happen next in the plot – with many “turnabouts.”

The Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is a memorable and well-crafted cult-classic trilogy you should add to your library.

The game overall it has a certain silliness that really brings up a unique charm and personality to it and all characters personalities and traits really makes you get attached to each case and story that you get to solve, the game has a lot of content and different cases/chapters and definitely manages to maintain its consistency on the overall quality, with every case and story having really memorable moments, characters, OSTs, plot twists and well writed storyline and plot.

The trilogy consists of ""Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney,"" ""Justice for All,"" and ""Trials and Tribulations."" The game has received widespread acclaim from both critics and players. Reviewers have praised the compelling storytelling, the well-crafted characters, and the unique blend of adventure and courtroom drama. On platforms like [url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy/]Metacritic[/url], the games have consistently high scores, reflecting their quality and appeal.

The core gameplay is divided into two primary phases: the Investigation Phase and the Courtroom Phase. During the Investigation Phase, players, in the role of defense attorney Phoenix Wright, gather evidence, interview witnesses, and prepare for trial. This phase functions like a point-and-click adventure, where players interact with the environment and dialogue choices to uncover clues. The Courtroom Phase is where the game shines. Players present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and find inconsistencies in testimonies. This involves carefully listening to statements, choosing when to press for more information, and presenting the right evidence at the right time to expose lies and contradictions.

A significant aspect of the gameplay involves using logic and deduction. Players must think like a lawyer, making connections between pieces of evidence and witness statements to solve the case. The game is heavily character-driven, with a cast of memorable and quirky characters. The interactions between these characters add depth to the story and gameplay.

The Trilogy excels in storytelling. Each case is packed with twists, humor, and drama, keeping players engaged from start to finish. The narrative is compelling, and the episodic nature of the cases makes the game highly addictive. The gameplay requires players to think critically, making it a mentally stimulating experience. The satisfaction of cracking a tough case by piecing together evidence and witness statements is unparalleled. The character development is a standout feature. Phoenix Wright, along with other characters like Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth, grows throughout the series. This growth adds an emotional depth to the game, making players invested in their journeys. The courtroom battles offer a unique gameplay experience that sets the series apart from other visual novel games. The tension of finding the right evidence to present and the thrill of breaking down a witness's testimony is exceptionally gratifying. The game’s art style is charming, with well-designed characters and environments. The soundtrack is memorable and enhances the mood of both the investigative and courtroom scenes. The game is accessible to newcomers to the genre and offers substantial replay value due to its engaging narrative and character interactions.

In conclusion, ""Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy"" is a masterpiece in the visual novel genre. Its blend of engaging storytelling, challenging puzzles, memorable characters, and unique courtroom gameplay makes it an unforgettable experience. The series has cultivated a passionate fan base. Fans appreciate the memorable characters and storylines, often citing the trilogy as a gateway into the visual novel genre. The games have also had a notable cultural impact, inspiring memes, fan art, and even cosplay, demonstrating the strong connection players feel to the series. Long-time fans of the series have expressed appreciation for the updated graphics and the accessibility of having the first three games in one package. Newcomers have found the trilogy to be an excellent introduction to the series. There's also a sense of nostalgia for players who experienced the original games, as the trilogy brings back fond memories with improved visuals and sound. While overwhelmingly positive, some players have noted the linear nature of the games and the occasional frustration when the game requires a very specific piece of evidence, which can lead to trial-and-error gameplay. However, these critiques are often minor in the broader context of the game's reception. Whether you're a fan of adventure games, a lover of good storytelling, or someone who enjoys intellectual challenges, this trilogy is a must-play.",1680646062,1703366694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It does not fix all of the typos and errors which is embarrassing. Any basic spellchecker would have tagged the typos when this game was released.

There are some characters (Mia) and poses (Old Von Karma finger wag, angry Edgeworth, some Atmey) that are just ugly and look off. The worst part is that it doesn't fix the problem during the investigation sections that old point and click adventures used to have with there being one solution to advancing and it's not ever obvious what the solution is. It gets compounded in the later games when progressing requires presenting evidence AND profiles to progress investigation. Some logic puzzles are still broken in terms if its actual logic, they didn't bother to fix ""plot holes"" if you want to call it at, in the remaster.

I recommend this game to any person that likes puzzles, logic, visual novel or just want to try something new.

The first game in the trilogy might be the one that is the most rough around the edges, but it still holds up, and the case 5 of the first game might be one of my favorite.

The second game (JFA) is where the writing really took off for me, and it also made investigations a LOT better with the introduction of the Magatama. I like Franziska as the prosecutor, and it may have the weakest case (case 3), but it has a kicker final case.

The third game (T&T) is actually amazing, it takes everything you've learned from the two previous games and mix it in the perfect twist and logic that you could see in a game of this type. It ends on the best case the series ever had.

I've completed this game a number of times already on different consoles, and I will most likely play it through again in a year or two, the same way you would re-read a good book or re-watch through a series of movies you've enjoyed (Like Back to the Future that I watch probably every year at this point).

I used to play this game as a kid on the 3DS whenever my friend and I slept over. A straight up classic. I downloaded this game for nostalgia reasons and to find out how it ended (we would restart the first 2-3 cases whenever we played).

The game is about up-and-coming lawyer, Phoenix Wright and his journey into becoming an experienced lawyer. You play as Wright as he investigates and participates in court cases for various murders.  

I highly recommend it to those who are a fan of the detective genre as this game has a lot of investigation sequences as well as the actual court trials.",1702287742,1702287742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First game is good, laying foundations and introducing you to the franchise. Kinda bare compared to the sequels, excluding rise from the ashes (im saying that retrospectively, that's not something You feel while playing the game), but really fun nonetheless.

Justice for all is kinda boring at times, but still relatively okay. It is introducing some good game mechanics tho. 

Trials and tribulations is a 1000/10 game. Absolutely top tier and makes it worth to play the first two games just to experience this one. Especially the last case, It's pretty insane. Can't believe I've never played this game before.

[h1] TRILOGY (AS A COLLECTIVE) [/h1]
There are a number of things consistent throughout the series and aren't exclusive to any of the three games included in this HD remaster. Most of these are not inherently ""bad"" per se, but are things that you should should be aware of to know what you are getting into. Worth buying on sale.
[list]
    [*]You have to agree to a third party EULA 😔
    [*]This game is a visual novel. You have to click and progress. The game progresses through the dialogue between characters. This can be painful at times (especially during investigation chapters).
    [*]As the story is linear, you should play all the cases in order to understand the background for some key cases.
    [*]Furthermore, due to the dependence on story, this game has almost no replay value.
    [*]This game is meant to be a comedy. It does deliver, in my opinion.
    [*]This game sometimes requires specific evidence or gameplay to unlock achievements. I would recommend having a window open to an achievement guide to make sure you do not miss it, as some cases with achievements are several hours long, and there is nothing worse than replaying a case because you forgot [spoiler] a lunchbox [/spoiler].
    [*]Each case in this game spans from 1 hour up to over 10 -- I would not advise trying to play an entire case in one go.
[/list]

[h1] PHOENIX WRIGHT: ACE ATTORNEY [/h1]
The first game in the series that introduces important characters. I would consider this the best game in the main trilogy, but that is just my opinion. 
[list]
    [*]Most memorable characters are introduced and developed in this game.
    [*]2/5 cases focus on characterisation, 2/5 are meant to be humourous, and 1/5 is a mix of both.
    [*]None of the cases (except maybe the first one, that's a tutorial so it doesn't count) have an expected ending -- you find yourself feeling exactly as Phoenix does throughout.
    [*]Best soundtrack out of all three games. Most famous AA themes come from this game.
[/list]

[h1] Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice for All [/h1]
Weakest game in the trilogy, as a consequence of being a sequel. Worth playing JUST for the satisfaction of the last case, which had me nervous on the edge of my seat the entire time. Probably the best game in the whole series to date.
[list]
    [*]Two notable characters (Three if you are playing beyond this trilogy) are introduced in this game.
    [*]Most cases are weaker than the first game's ones.
    [*]You solve most cases in this game before Phoenix does. After you solve it mentally, the dialogue feels like hard labour to get through. 
    [*]Soundtrack is good but doesn't hit the same as the last game
    [*]Did I mention the last case?
[/list]

[h1] Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations [/h1]
Good game, some people consider it the best in the trilogy but I think that depends on how much you enjoy the new characters. 
[list]
    [*]I don't think any cases in this game suck. [spoiler] hold on I forgot about the fanservice-y one that one is annoying for obvious reasons lol [/spoiler]
    [*][spoiler]3/5 cases are linked to each other, [/spoiler]creating an overarching narrative. Interesting to see how they all connect -- everything comes neatly into place at the end. [spoiler]Additionally, there are links to cases in the previous games[/spoiler]
    [*]All cases in this game have some interesting twists and turns that are not similar to the previous two games.
    [*]Soundtrack is also very good, but doesn't hit the same as the first game, as aforementioned.
    [*]Last case is so long. It has a satisfying conclusion, but just might feel too long. I would recommend playing it over several days (or less if you are an epic gamer) because it is exhausting to get through all that dialogue. 
[/list]

[h1] is it worth playing this game? [/h1]
This game is overall an enjoyable experience that I would say holds at least 70-80 hours of gameplay. I do believe that it does appeal to mostly casual gamers, so make a decision on whether a lawyer anime visual novel is truly something you'd enjoy. I don't think it's good enough or cheap enough to buy it off-sale, so just wait for Capcom to inevitably drop another sale of this game -- usually available for at least 50% off.",1700430091,1700430209,True,32,0,0.784521162509918213,1,True,False,False

This trilogy because of that definitely has me wanting to go and play the other games that were made after this. 

I will say however, I do wish that some quality of life fixes or improvements were brought over with the porting of these games to PC or any other modern console. One big one I was wishing for was maybe some sort of case overview for that specific episode/case that would be a lot better than just the court record. Often enough, there were times I had to take breaks and I would come back with not a full memory of what transpired in the investigation or trial phases. This would result me looking up a guide since I wasn't sure of what happened or just plum forgot. Maybe some sort of improved profile system which would clarify what an individual has said whenever you were talking to them at a given day or trial sort of like a log of everything they've told you about? I also kinda wish we had an improved travel menu for getting to place to place since it's quite tedious with the current one, but it is what it is. 

Overall, if you are looking for a good story based game, this one certainly delivers as stated and really has you think sometimes very hard. Sometimes the rules behind evidence or getting someone to speak is tricky, but despite these frustrations, I quite enjoyed the series and would recommend it highly.",1699580954,1699580954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Ace Attorney trilogy is one of the most renowned visual novels on the market and -- as I am to prove with the following evidence -- its popularity is justified. 

The hallmark of Ace Attorney games is, of course, the writing. Clever and saturated with idioms and wordplay, the text mimics the way people think and talk to minute details -- onomatopoeia and interjections included. While a slog at times, especially when reading through parts already experienced, the pace is usually brisk. It is important to pay attention to every line of text, as every utterance had been written with purpose, to strike a point or deliver a punchline. Many lines have a setup that pays off long after they are mentioned -- paying attention thus feels rewarding.

Characters deserve its own category -- they are incredibly varied. Though caricatures in an absurd, fantasy universe, they behave logically: they stay true to their beliefs, their reasoning and motivations are believable, may they be a sister from a mountain temple or a prodigical prosecutor. It is fun to unearth who and why holds a grudge, whether a person had been an accomplice to something, or what they are secretly plotting.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3060868390

With the novel's old-school flair and over-the-top characters, reading through a case may well be fun even for those who typically prefer action-oriented gameplay over stories. Abundance of animations, sprite variants, and clever uses of the game engine almost make one feel as if though they were watching an anime. Because progression is achieved through examinations and making use of evidence, Lotta engagement is involved. Though alternating between two modes adds variety and obviates staleness, longer chapters typically require more than one session due to exhaustion.

This brings us to several technical issues, or rather annoyances, which I take with the game: The option menu is severely lacking, text cannot be neither backtracked nor played automatically, and the number of save slots is insufficient. Most egregiously, it is impossible to mute text effects without muting all other sound effects. 

Soundtrack, however, is on point. Spanning over one hundred lively, electrical tracks, the albums endue the trilogy with its trademark charm.

What more is there to say then, other than that Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is one of the best, classic visual novels on the market? If you decide to dive into it, you are in for a lot of jokes, murderous surprises, emotional twists, overly dramatic gestures, and best of all… objections!",1698255211,1699369273,True,24,0,0.737897276878356934,0,True,False,False

In all seriousness, this game did so much for me. I was in a really awful place mentally before I got this game. I had no motivation to do anything and nothing to look forward to. Then, I discovered this game. Technically I was already aware of it. I knew it existed, and that it was about some silly blue lawyer. It wasn't until I saw someone play it that I had the desire to play it myself. So, I put it on my wish list and bought it as soon as It went on sale.
Suddenly I had something to look forward to every day after school. Not only that but the characters were endearing, and fun, but most off all relatable. I got particularly attached to Franziska and Maya, and their stories and issues. It was comforting to have characters I could relate to. 
Ace Attorney didn't cure all my issues, it didn't just make them go away, but it did help. It helped pull me out of that awful depressive episode, and I couldn't be more grateful. 

My previous review was made at 69 hours, a haha funny. This one was supposed to be the same, but I wanted to give a more serious story to go along with it.",1666849250,1698359268,True,3,2,0.538960278034210205,0,True,False,False

I enjoy narrative games, like the ones made by Telltale. Someone suggested to me that I try this one and seeing it was highly rated, I figured I'd give it a shot.

At its heart, Phoenix Wright is a puzzle/logic game. Phoenix is the titular character, a rookie defense attorney who quickly assumes control of his own law firm. Gameplay circles around Wright's efforts to defend his clients and unravel criminal conspiracies. Interface is mostly through mouse/hotkey use, though a few puzzles involve using keys/sticks to rotate objects. The ""cases"" involve two major phases, which are sometimes repeated over several days, of investigation (where PW questions witnesses and searches crime scenes for evidence) and the courtroom, which involves cross-examining witnesses and presenting evidence found during investigation.

Up front, I'll say the storytelling in this game drew me in. While the dialogue was middling, the plots themselves were often intricate and nuanced, and went down roads I wasn't expecting. PW develops his confidence across cases and has a pretty good character arc. Relations with recurring characters--notably prosecutor Miles Edgeworth--is multi-dimensional and again, basically well-written. If I end up going further, it will be just for the stories. (Edit: I ended up finishing, just to see how it played out, and I was disappointed. Compared to the first two parts of the trilogy, the story in Trials and Tribulations is a jumbled mess that just didn't work for me, which is a shame.)

The courtroom interactions are mostly fun, with objections and counter-objections being thrown around. Prosecutors and witnesses will often sabotage PW's strategies, forcing the player to keep thinking. All I can tell players is to pay attention to everything that is said and pore over every piece of evidence. Nothing is timed, so don't feel rushed; stop and think things through. There is no penalty for pressing the witness, to try and wiggle lose more incriminating evidence or get them to lose their cool. Using evidence to object, however, can ding PW's rep with the judge if incorrect ... and if the judge loses his patience, he'll declare against the player, sending you back to the main menu (or latest save) to do it again. So present evidence with caution. PW's sidekick characters will often drop hints, which can help if you're stuck.

Sadly, the other half of the game--the investigations phase--is mostly clunky, boring, and repetitive. In many of the cases, it involves slowly traversing the various areas (which means backtracking over and over), exhausting the speech options of characters/witnesses present, and presenting evidence to spur their memories. Much of it is counter-intuitive and guesswork, and it all grows old very quickly. You cannot advance without collecting all required evidence--which makes sense, in a way, as you need it to win (see below). I absolutely detested wading through these screens again and again, trying to find the one thing I'd overlooked in order to advance the story.

Also, I think the humor will be hit and miss for players. Some landed for me but not all. If you're not into ""zany"" humor, this might fall flat.

And while I enjoyed the courtroom drama, at times the events are too far-fetched, even for this level of story. Specific instances are so far over the top--like prosecutors  and witnesses openly threatening or hitting people in a packed court--that I rolled my eyes a lot. Worse, it felt like so much was there just to stonewall obvious, and effective, points of defense by the player. Getting the defendant cleared on a technicality, such as the prosecution withholding key evidence or tampering with witnesses (which happens in almost every case in the game), should still count as a win, right? Not here. This is why you had to collect all evidence in the previous phase, because there is only one way to win. Thinking outside the box is necessary to find a solution ... but only the *correct* solution.

Back on the plus side, the game was stable, installed fast, and ran well. I didn't have any glitches or crashes. The minimalist, cartoonish art style plays right into the game's tone, and I laughed at some of the comic anime-esque character reactions. The sound is solid but the repetitive nature of the effects made me mute the game after a while.

The bulk of Steam Achievements look as though they will come naturally in gameplay, though a few are miss-able, so guides out, if you want to get them all the first time through.

I told myself I'd get about halfway through before writing this, to see if my opinion changed. I did get halfway, barely (I botched the final trial of the first game in the trilogy twice before winning). I see the appeal of Phoenix Wright, from the engaging stories, to some of the meme-worthy expressions. But after churning halfway through, I can sum up my feelings by saying, ""Meh.""

Pros
- Immersive, well-written stories
- Decent, multi-layered puzzle action in courtroom sequences

Cons
- Boring and frustrating investigation sequences
- Outlandish characters grow annoying or even cringeworthy
- Narrow paths to advance or win cases

Ace Attorney is great. I've played a few cases each year ever since I started learning Japanese, and it's always great fun to come back to Naruhodo & Co and their antics (and with each year, it gets *that* much easier to follow along!)

A brilliant v-novel, that's what it is. At this point, I get so deep into the murder mystery aspect that I forget that it's in Japanese... that is, until you get to one of the super weird roadblock moments. Peeking at guides and seeing the weirdest english-i-fied names is super weird (Itonoko is [i]Gumboot???[/i])

->For those interested in playing 逆転裁判 in JP:
There's no furigana, and the vocab can be difficult at times. On the other hand, there's no time limit, each セリフ is pretty short, and you can gleam so much from the context that playing and understanding this game becomes at least ""doable"" within a... reasonable time period. The first time I tried (@6months) I got absolutely nowhere. At ~18 months it got doable with a lot of effort. And now, at 2 years, it's... still a challenge. That's not unexpected. These characters are treasures troves of yakuwarigo to an extent I have yet to find in the books I've read or movies I've watched. You could write a sociolinguistics paper on virtually every sentence that O-kyou says. That's part of the pull, isn't it? The challenge that drives you forward. ... Good luck.



---[2022]---------------
Great way to get some JP reading practice.

My only gripe with the game is that the first case is super tight and well made, but as you move through the game you spend more time combing through areas searching for the way to get back to court than you do having fun with the dialogue and the characters you've come to like. I can see why this game is structured the way it is, but it's still those gyakuten saiban, CHOTTO MATTE moments that I remember fondly, not the 10 hour search for the next clue in the superhero case (vandalism is GOOD and PROPER, btw).",1685740485,1697228444,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alright, did I pick this game up during the 2020 Steam Summer Sale play all of the first game and half of the second game just to not play it again until the Summer of this year 2023... Yes I did.

However don't let goofy fact about my experience deter you from playing this phenomenal collection. The music the stories and the characters are the best parts of this game. I enjoyed solving the cases and contradictions and rarely had times I needed to look stuff up, and let me tell you the satisfaction of thinking about how the evidence can help your case and it actually being right was great! The final case in the third game was the best case with amazing twists and turns every second something felt like it was going your way.

This game will always find a way to make you laugh and smile and that is just another reason as to why this game collection means so much to me. I love it so much that, one day I can't wait to replay this wonderful title in all of its glory!

 Now, leaving the comparisons behind, let's talk about the game itself: Really good mystery game, with interesting stories and mechanics even tho its a Visual Novel!

The first visual novel I ever played, I've played the original trilogy back on the DS (over 10 years ago). I replayed the trilogy again in 2019 on the Nintendo Switch and still enjoyed it. And once again booting up the game again after some years, the same wave of nostalgia hits hard. I just got this to add to my Steam library, but looks like I will be completing this game for a third time lol. Nothing beats Phoenix's iconic ""Objection!"" and ""Take that!"". Never gets old.

I don't often re-read visual novels, but this one is just that good. The same goofy characters, fantastic soundtrack, and the polished artwork is just as I remember it. There is something to enjoy about the story even after multiple playthroughs. It's around 50+ hours to complete all three. If there's any PW game you should play, it's the three in this Trilogy. This Trilogy is peak Phoenix Wright as I know it, and is required to play before even playing Apollo Justice.

Some only bad thing I can say but I'm just nit-picking at this point.
1: you don't have the liberty to make a million saves like you can with a traditional VN
2: there is no chat log, so sometimes you may accidentally skip over important dialogue that can't be seen again

The music, the visuals for its time, the characters, the character development, the character designs, and the plot progression are nothing short of perfect. Phoenix Wright's Ace Attorney Trilogy completely reignites the passion of the boring everyday courtrooms you see in real life into a dramatic, high-octane court case filled with timeless twists that will catch you off guard no matter how much you think you grasp the situation! Play the game first if you genuinely want the bonafide Ace Attorney experience. Don't start with the anime, as the charm of many things in this franchise is YOU figuring out the mysteries as Phoenix Wright.

It's tough to believe this game was developed so long ago, as its plots still rival any works you may see today. Besides a few references, this game does not feel out of date at all, even today!

Even if you may not be into the broader choice of visual novels, this is one of those games that anyone can get into if they appreciate solving mysteries and seeing through the eyes of Phoenix Wright, a rookie lawyer, as he uncovers the truth of a variety of well thought out murders against prosecutors that are just as amazing in how their roles are played in the court. With ace attorney comes a variety of lessons, morals, and sections where you can empathize with the characters involved and their motives for doing certain things.

Warning that Ace Attorney may not realistically portray the courtroom, defense attorneys, or prosecutors that we have in real life; however, it does paint a story, the journey of what being a lawyer means. A lawyer is still a human, and humans are bound to make mistakes. However, the courtroom is not a room of perfection but a room of justice and truth. Ace attorney clarifies that a clean win record means nothing if the whole truth is not found.

I recommend this game to anyone who loves the mystery genre with a bit of supernatural mixed into it. It may take some time to get used to for it to impact you as it has me, but it is worth it for what you'll end up witnessing and experiencing with this masterpiece of a game, a roller coaster of emotions. Buckle up as you are invited into the insane world of Phoenix Wright, uncovering mysteries and defending clients as both detective (figuratively) and Defense Attorney (literally) alike. You may need to find out what you find next.

My only regret is that I did not play this game sooner. You do find yourself feeling short of content like me when I wanted more; however, I also have to admit that everything was neatly wrapped up with the third game. I felt immersed in the world and its characters, so much so that I wanted to experience it again.

I have to look at  a walkthrough more time than I would like, and often the steps I need to take is not make sense to me like press on a statement that is not at all suspicious just to get another key dialogue.

I just think that given how arbitrary it is, it would be good if you can select an option to just turn the penalised limit off.

I can't emphasize enough just how much I adore these games and the profound impact they've had on my life. They've been a wellspring of inspiration, enlightenment, and transformation for me! I used to create Phoenix Wrongs, which were animated and video-based comedy sketch parody videos inspired by the series. It was an absolute blast, and the Ace Attorney fanbase is truly one of a kind.

This series boasts some exceptional music, unforgettable and endearing characters, a perfect blend of humor, and writing that can take you on a whirlwind journey from heartwrenching and emotional to bittersweet and even tragically poignant moments. It's an absolute rollercoaster of emotions, and I can honestly say that I've never regretted a single moment I've spent immersed in this incredible series. It continues to captivate me to this very day!

In the world of law and legal lore,
There's a trilogy we all adore.
Ace Attorney, Phoenix's quest,
In pixelated suits, he's dressed.

In courtrooms filled with wacky tales,
Where logic and absurdity set sails,
Phoenix Wright, the defense's star,
Takes on cases bizarre, no matter how far.

With Maya by his side, a spirit so bold,
Their bond is worth more than gold.
Together they face the strangest of crimes,
In this world where justice oftentimes rhymes.

From Steel Samurai to Turnabout Sisters,
Each case, a puzzle that twisters and twisters.
The characters are quirky, their antics are wild,
From Gumshoe's blunders to Edgeworth, so mild.

OBJECTIONs fly like confetti in the air,
As the truth is sought with determined flair.
The Judge, forever clueless it seems,
Adds to the game's comedic dreams.

From Larry's love life, always a mess,
To Mia's mentorship, a guiding caress.
We laugh, we cry, we shout, ""Hold it!""
In the world of Ace Attorney, we're always in it.

So here's to Phoenix and his legal parade,
In this trilogy, our hearts are swayed.
With humor, heart, and cases so grand,
Ace Attorney, you truly understand.

Through pixelated screens, you make us cheer,
For a game so funny, endearing, and dear.
With OBJECTIONs loud and justice in sight,
Ace Attorney Trilogy, you shine so bright!

[i] [Scene: A beautiful wedding ceremony in progress. Phoenix and Maya are standing at the altar, about to exchange vows. Miles Edgeworth is sitting in the audience.]

Judge (Officiant): Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Phoenix Wright and Maya Fey in holy matrimony.

[Phoenix and Maya exchange loving glances.]

Judge (Officiant): If anyone here has any reason why these two should not be joined in marriage, speak now or forever hold your peace.

[Miles Edgeworth stands up abruptly.]

Miles Edgeworth: OBJECTION!

[Gasps from the guests. Maya looks shocked. Phoenix facepalms.]

Phoenix Wright (whispering): Not again, Edgeworth!

Maya Fey (whispering): Seriously, Edgeworth? Now?

Judge (Officiant): Mr. Edgeworth, you cannot object at a wedding without a valid reason.

Miles Edgeworth (blushing): My apologies, Your Honor. Force of habit.

[The guests chuckle nervously.]

Judge (Officiant): Very well, please take your seat.

[Miles Edgeworth sits down, looking embarrassed.]

[The ceremony continues.]

Judge (Officiant): Now, if Phoenix and Maya have prepared their own vows, they may exchange them.

[Phoenix takes a deep breath and starts reciting his vows.]

Phoenix Wright: Maya, from the moment I met you, you brought light into my life. You've been my rock, my support, and my joy. I promise to love and cherish you for as long as I live.

[Miles Edgeworth starts to stand up again.]

Phoenix Wright (panicking, whispering): No, Edgeworth, don't!

[Maya grabs Edgeworth by the arm and pulls him back down.]

Maya Fey (whispering): Stay seated, Edgeworth!

[Miles Edgeworth sits down, grumbling.]

[Phoenix continues with his vows.]

Phoenix Wright: I promise to be with you through the good times and the bad, and to never rest until I've found the truth in your heart.

[Maya smiles and wipes away a tear.]

Maya Fey: Phoenix, you're the Ace Attorney of my heart, and I promise to bring the spirit of the courtroom into our everyday lives. I'll even let you win objections sometimes.

[The guests laugh.]

Judge (Officiant): By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.

[Phoenix and Maya share a passionate kiss.]

[Miles Edgeworth can't help himself.]

Miles Edgeworth: OBJECTION!

[Phoenix and Maya break their kiss, looking exasperated.]

Phoenix Wright (frustrated): Edgeworth, seriously?

Miles Edgeworth: My apologies again. I just can't help myself.

[The guests burst into laughter, and Phoenix and Maya finally share their first official married kiss.]

[End scene.]

The story is both edge-of-your-seat exciting and slapstick hilarious, with ridiculous characters that make me belly laugh. I loved April May as a witness. The general gameplay isn't bad, but it can be tedious especially in more difficult trial sections where you need to chain it seems like endless amounts of dialogue ""presses"" in exactly the right order to get the desired outcome, but apart from that I've been loving it.

The characters are very rich too, whether it be their backstory or general character, because the characters are extremely memorable whether you like them or not. My favorite character is Gumshoe. He brings me joy

Witness: Well, as a player, I found it to be an exceptional video game experience. The storytelling is second to none. It's like being immersed in a gripping courtroom drama, Your Honor. The way the cases unfold, the characters' development, it's all meticulously crafted.

Lawyer: Meticulously crafted, you say? Could you elaborate on that, Witness?

Witness: Certainly, Your Honor. The evidence, the testimonies, and the way the player must piece together the truth—it's like presenting a legal case in a court of law. It requires critical thinking, attention to detail, and a keen sense of logic, much like the skills required of an attorney.

Lawyer: Fascinating. And how about the characters in the game, Witness?

Witness: The characters are incredibly well-developed, Your Honor. They have distinct personalities and motives that come into play during the trials. It's like witnessing the dynamics between lawyers, witnesses, and judges in real-life courtrooms. You become emotionally invested in their stories.

Lawyer: Emotionally invested, you say? That's quite intriguing. How about the game's music and presentation?

Witness: The music is exceptional, Your Honor. It sets the tone perfectly, just like the atmosphere in a courtroom. It enhances the drama and immerses you in the proceedings. The visual style, too, complements the game's themes and narratives.

Lawyer: Thank you, Witness. Your insights into the game's storytelling, characters, and presentation are quite enlightening. In your opinion, would you recommend the ""Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy"" to others?

Witness: Absolutely, Your Honor. If you have an appreciation for intricate storytelling, engaging characters, and the thrill of a courtroom drama, this game is a must-play. It provides a unique and immersive experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally satisfying.

787480,145372236,76561198150291509,0,2,277,0,277,1678556692,"I LOVE the Ace Attorney games - every single one of them. They're my childhood and a nostalgic escape in my adulthood, I have racked up thousands of hours playing them all through more than thrice on my Nintendo DS...but when it comes to the Steam version of these games I have one solid reason for not recommending. 

Part of the gameplay is to search for evidence in crime scenes. In the original Nintendo platform versions, this manifests as a red target cursor that you move around the screen and click on things (anything you want) in view on your screen. If you click on useless items, you'll get useless answers. If you click on useful items, you'll get useful advice. You've no idea what to click on sometimes, you have to make links between what you know in your head which leads you to look for the right item to click on. OR you can mindlessly click till you find the right answer - your choice in the end. Part of the fun is not knowing what to do sometimes, scrounging around with frustration until you finally get it right and then it all falls into place. 

HOWEVER, in the Steam version of the games, this part of the gameplay has been changed. 'Useful items' (or at least items with unique dialogue) in every crime scene you're supposed to search for evidence has been flagged with a magnifying glass. 

Now I know to most people, this won't seem like a big deal and to other they may actually prefer it at first glance (as I did initially) but here's why I now despise the choice to do this:

Flagging all the useful items you're supposed to click in each scene completely removes any investigative aspect of the gameplay and reduces this portion of the games to nothing more than a click through story. This is NOT what the original games were about. Now I know that Ace Attorney is the kind of game where you do have to find the right move to progress and yes it can funnel you a bit. And yes, I get that you could just mindlessly click around till you finally clicked on the right item and could move on with the story but you had a choice - this is my point. You could try and make connections in your head and search the scene for items that looked interesting - even useless items you clicked on could sometime trigger hilarious exchanges between the characters. And because of the opportunity for fun dialogue, it was fun to struggle to find the answer (whether you were trying to work it out or not). 

Flagging all the points of interest right up front COMPLETELY DESTROYS this aspect of the game. I couldn't even get through the first actual game because I was so bored. Flagging points of interest up front does actually make a difference. I don't care if in the end I can click mindlessly till I land on the right thing, I want to feel like an attorney playing detective. I enjoyed clicking on things I thought were relevant but turned out were just scenery because that's part of the detective work. Sure you can choose to 'ignore' the flags, but that's like handing someone an answer sheet that's always in front of your and saying you can choose not to look at it. It.makes.a.difference.

Not to mention, flagging everything worth clicking on reduces the instinct to look around at the actual visuals - no it's not a Greek tapestry but it's still fun enjoyable visual content that you just end up not bothering to look at and enjoy because you're drawn to the 'right answers'. Part of investigating the scenes in AA is looking around for clues. Not just looking through pre-approved clues like you're ticking boxes off a list.

I'm bitter about this I know.

So if that aspect of gameplay is important to you, save your money unless it gets heavily discounted, you might still enjoy it for the plots and banter (which are of course still excellent). Otherwise, consider buying a DS and playing the original Nintendo versions it's way more enjoyable in my opinion.",1693477336,1693477499,False,2,0,0.460764378309249878,0,True,False,False

My only complaint is the strike system; if you present wrong evidence enough times, you'll ""lose"" and be forced all the way back to the main menu, where you have to then reload from the last save. If you're 90% of the way through the case and make a mistake? Tough luck kiddo, gotta replay EVERYTHING from the start of the trial.

 - The atmosphere struck a perfect balance between lighthearted humour, intense battles of deduction, and heartfelt moments. I think the soundtrack contributed a lot to this. Upon first hearing the soundtrack, it didn't sound like anything special, but after playing through the game, each theme became associated with the emotions of the moments when it played. 

 - The twists in this game are well-written. It is a mystery game and twists are expected, so many times I was able to piece things together ahead of time. However, it doesn't detract at all from the emotional impact when the truth is revealed. Even if you figure out the who and how of a case, the really juicy, emotional details of why are left until the end. In fact, I've found that being able to solve the whodunnit ahead of time increases my immersion and makes me feel smarter for having puzzled out the answer alongside the characters.

 - The characters are well written and memorable. Every character has their memorable quirks of character design and personality. I never feel that the writing of any character is too shallow, because the trial always reveals complexity in even the side characters. The motivation of every character is believable, and is consistent to their characterisation. Central characters like Phoenix and Edgeworth are given satisfying character development arcs.

 - The story is creative and well-structured. Although there are some tropes of the mystery genre that this game relies upon, overall the stories are refreshing and unexpected. The story has an episodic structure, but there are still overarching mysteries that are slowly revealed. The finale is satisfying and ties up all the loose ends cleanly.

Here is my singular negative about the game:

 - The game can be very particular about which pieces of evidence you have to present first and which dialogues you have to unlock. Even if you've figured out the contradiction already, you can't arrive at the conclusion until the game says that you can.

 Overall, I had a really positive experience with this game. I hope you play it and enjoy it!",1692575352,1692575352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I also have to mention that I played 4th, 5th, 6th and now near the end of the 2nd after 1st game. I'm not a quitter so I kinda stuck but seriously in a shortest way I could sum up is, the games are nonsensical and chore to play. I can't believe of its popularity against other mystery or detective games. 

Between trials you try to move around menu driven locations and to move the game forward you have to go specific places sometimes. So you get stuck sometimes because of it, not much of a sense in these specific places. To make it worse, most places have sub locations so you cant see them all in a bigger list. So you have to click back and forth to progress in game. I mean it is ridicilous, no person would enjoy these parts.

Trials are where the game is at but there are times you have to make such leaps of logic, you start to click things and hope for the best. Savescumming is a must as I see it. But I cant hold this problem much more than this, the game is about Wright's bluffs and fluffs for his dear life. It's very child friendly and also childlike, so no need say more. Most lines, animations, twists are nonsensical and it is what it is. Whole series is like that.

The main gripe of mine is metaphysical subjects in all the games in the series. [spoiler]All cases are about low probability events, closed room style weird machinations, good old luck or unluck. All events are somehow realistic. And you have to jump hoops to reveal them. All good and fine. Ah, also there is dead man spirits and people that channel them. Also these channelings change the physical appearance of said mediums. You can see peoples lies like some sort of locks and chains. In every game there were such things, I wont list them all. And most important part is all these metaphysical things exist in the game world and they are OK. No one bats an eye. Cases you say? Nah man, there aren't metaphysical thing to explain the murder. It's just not real, OK! Move along you fraud of an attorney. [/spoiler]

I'm very well aware that I sound very mad.  But I gotta say I can't recommend this game to anyone. There are very good mystery/detective/whodidit games and visual novels out there. This series are not one of them.",1668606137,1692167536,False,3,0,0.378645032644271851,0,True,False,False

The Pheonix Wright trilogy definitely stands up to scrutiny, unlike 100% of the witness testimonies within the game. These games are really good in depth visual novel mystery games, and the closest comparison I could make would be the Danganronpa games. But it is within that role that these games excel- the characters they create, the stories they tell, and even their limited (compared to non-visual novel games) gameplay make them very much worth playing.

I'll review the three games contained within this trilogy pack, but before I talk about what I like about them, I need to discuss their (in my opinion at least) only real flaw: the overly complex hoops that the player has to jump through when attempting to answer questions or point out contradictions in people's testimonies. Sometimes, in order to point out a contradiction, you need to present evidence that contradicts a statement, but the court record will contain multiple pieces of evidence that could be used to point out this contradiction, and you will be penalized if you choose the wrong one. Or, a witness in the courtroom might make two similar statements that you know contradict your evidence, but only one of them is the statement that you're supposed to object to, etc etc. This can sometimes result in a frustrating experience, especially during some of the more complex episodes in each game. However, thankfully the game has an incredibly forgiving save/load system, and as such, while this issue can sometimes be frustrating, it ultimately doesn't detract too much from the experience, and I still found the games worth playing.

Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney is the first entry in the trilogy and indeed in the entire series, and is without a doubt the best of the three overall. It establishes a very simple but reliable gameplay formula, tells entertaining and compelling stories, and fully establishes the world of Pheonix Wright, and as such is a very solid experience. At least, I can say that for the original four episodes in this game, which were all that the game came with when originally released for the Gameboy Advance in Japan. When the game was ported to the Nintendo DS and translated for English-speaking audiences, a fifth episode was added, and while it tells one of the best stories in the entire trilogy and adds fun new gameplay mechanics to the already established formula from the other four episodes, unfortunately the gameplay within the courtroom falls apart a little in this episode. It's here that the issue I mentioned earlier with the Pheonix Wright games really starts to appear, especially since this episode has one of the most complex plots of any in the trilogy. However, I still very much enjoyed this episode, especially for the new mechanics it made use of, and found the characters to be highly compelling, so i don't think it detracts from the experience too much.

Pheonix Wright: Justice For All is an interesting game, as it was the only one of the trilogy that I never actually played when I was younger. As such, I was excited to find that I had no idea what the stories would be. Unfortunately, this game turned out to be my least favorite of the three. I don't believe this was due to the lack of prior experience with the game or the nostalgia factor, but I also could be biased as well, so take my opinion on this one with a grain of salt. I'll start off with the positives about this one: It introduces a completely new mechanic that really adds to the investigation portion of the experience: Psychelocks, which are opportunities to expose lies from witnesses outside of the courtroom and gain information. This really helps make the player more invested in the investigation portion of the game, and adds to the overall gameplay experience as well. In addition, the game introduces a lot of great characters, themes and plotlines that are very important to the third game in the trilogy, which is my personal favorite.
Unfortunately, this game also contains some of the worst episodes/stories in the entire trilogy, which are bogged down by overly complex paths the player has to take, confusing justifications for which evidence to use or which statement to press, and (worst of all, in my opinion) recycled plot outlines. For example, the first episode in this game involves someone accused of murdering their lover, but is actually [spoiler]being framed by a conman[/spoiler]- which is basically the exact plot of the first episode in the first game. This might sound like an isolated incident, but most of the other episodes all essentially boil down to plots from the previous game. The second episode again involves [spoiler]Maya being framed for a murder[/spoiler] and the final episode recycles so many characters and is again about [spoiler]an actor from a kids samurai show supposedly killing another fellow actor from a kids samurai show[/spoiler]. 
It's unfortunate, too, because the specifics of these episodes are (in some of them, particularly the fourth episode) actually pretty interesting, but that's overshadowed by the recycled characters and plotlines, as well as the fact that this game suffers from the complex hoops issue more than any of the other two games; in particular, the third episode with the Big Top Circus being the worst offender. That episode is honestly my personal contender for worst in the series; the plot is semi interesting, but the characters introduced are mostly annoying, and both the steps required to progress the investigation and the actions required in the courtroom are vague and overly complicated at the same time, requiring you to do things in a specific order without offering much guidance for what order to do them. All of this to say, while this game is valuable to the series as a whole, has some of it's own merits, and isn't really a bad game, it's the entry in the trilogy that I have the most issues with and enjoyed the least.

The final entry in the trilogy, and my personal favorite, is Pheonix Wright: Trials and Tribulations. While as a game it has more of the complexity issue than the first game, it makes up for this with far more interesting plotlines (in my opinion) and maintains the new mechanics and fun characters from the previous game, while also introducing entirely new characters and plotlines. It also managed to completely remove the more annoying recurring characters from the previous games (such as a certain [spoiler]windbag who was a chore to talk to due to her completely unnecessary and long winded dialogue[/spoiler], and a completely [spoiler]inept photographer who somehow managed to make a return appearance in not one, but TWO episodes in the previous game[/spoiler]), which I found to be refreshing. While there are one or two very minor plot points that are recycled, thankfully these matter very little to the plot of each episode, and are overshadowed by the really in depth and interesting plots also found in those episodes. Overall, Trials and Tribulations manages to return to the interesting storytelling of the first game, and also perfects the complexity of narrative and new mechanics found in the second game while simultaneously avoiding almost all of that same games pitfalls. It also has my personal favorite episode in the entire series, found in episode 5, which I feel is honestly the overall best episode in the entire series, outside of maybe the fourth episode of the first game.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend the Pheonix Wright games to anyone who enjoys a good courtroom drama, mystery, or visual novel in general, and while the games are not perfect (in particular the second game, Pheonix Wright: Justice For All), I think these games are great experiences and honestly some of my favorite games I've ever played.",1692156932,1692158934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is awesome.

Obviously, you play as a defense lawyer, and it's not just one game, but a collection of the games in the Ace Attorney series that center around Phoenix Wright. You build your case by examining crime scenes, collecting evidence, and talking to people, which includes presenting evidence to them to see what they know about it. Despite all this investigating, you nearly always go into trial without a solid idea of how to prove your client is innocent. Every case is a constant struggle where you're struggling to stay afloat by finding cracks in the testimonies and evidence presented. Doing so gradually reveals the truth, exposing the real culprit of the crime in question and what actually went down. This makes for some really good twists that really caught me off guard in some cases. Even when you have a good idea of who the killer actually is (as in the first cases of games, which serve as a sort of tutorial), getting to the point of proving it by finding out what really happened is a great and entertaining mystery in itself. The game has a good sense of atmosphere (as much as a visual novel can have) and has exciting, actually good music that changes and intensifies as you get closer to the truth and witnesses get more and more nervous. The sense of justice you feel after clawing your way to victory and exposing liars and corruption is rewarding, especially with the excessive animations of characters breaking down when you corner them for good. This release also has achievements for pursuing additional conversations and other content not required to win the case as fast as possible, which is a nice addition to further incentivize seeking these things out.

The characters in the game are a big part of its appeal as well. They all have distinct personalities and designs, and their interactions add a lot to the investigation process. Many characters are recurring, and there are fun recurring bits as well, such as Edgeworth not being able to get his witnesses to state their names and professions, or Gumshoe getting his salary cut. The cases are chronologically ordered, and a general overarching narrative based on relationships between the characters develops. This doesn't always impact the facts of the cases themselves, but influences how characters interact with each other within new cases as you get further along. Most recurring characters demonstrate character development to some degree as well, as their opinions or situations change as the series progresses. This excludes the judge, who basically just agrees with the last decently logical line of thinking he heard and is a hilarious character representing everything a judge should not be. Thankfully, you (and sometimes the prosecution) are thorough and provide enough evidence that the judge doesn't really have to make a decision. 

The only real criticism I have is that the game is pretty linear, which results in you not being able to utilize things you noticed immediately. This isn't necessarily a bad thing since the story is entertaining and you can in fact fail and lose the case, but if you notice a contradiction in the evidence before the game prompts you to point it out, you are left waiting to do so or suffer a penalty for trying to present the contradiction when that's not what the game wants. From the case progression and what the characters are talking about before your choice, however, it is fairly obvious what the question at hand is and you can avoid selecting evidence at the wrong time easily. By no means does this mean that the game always tells you the right answer, it just provides sufficient context for you to base your objection on. That doesn't make it less frustrating to know something you can't use, though.

Overall, this is a very entertaining and enjoyable game. Save scumming is sometimes necessary in cases where you have no idea what Phoenix Wright is about to say to stay afloat, but in my opinion it doesn't affect the experience of the great stories the game tells. If you enjoy visual novels or investigative/mystery games, this is an easy recommendation, but the stories are so interesting and the experience is so fun I'd heavily recommend that anyone give it a try.",1691747203,1691747945,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I never really got around playing the game until recently. I watched gaming videos on it with my brother when I was younger, and actually, my first introduction to Phoenix Wright was actually Marvel vs Capcom 3, which made me wanna know more about the character and game.

This game is both a visual novel and a puzzle game. Play as the defense attorney, usually Phoenix Wright, as he investigates crime scenes and find clues to prove his client's innocence... if they are really innocent. Although... he's not a detective... why is he investigating crime scenes? Anyways, lawyer your way through 3 games and 14 cases, facing against characters, whether reprising or new to encounter. Face off against your old friend, Miles Edgeworth, in Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney. Get constantly whipped by Franziska Von Karma in Justice for all, and enjoy a laid back, hot cup of coffee to the face thrown by Godot in Trials and Tribulations. 

Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney makes you feel dumb and smart at the same time, such that you can deduce that a killer was able to fly through wires being raised, but, you are unable to remember a receipt has a front page.

I had no idea coming into this game that it had a full storyline.  My understanding of the series prior to playing it was that it was a bunch of unrelated short stories.  While the stories themselves have unique qualities and each one has its own charm, part of the fun of this series is that they all tell an overall story and the characters actually develop over time as the story progresses.  The gameplay itself is a fun challenge, though often the contradiction can be spotted but the way it wants the presentation of evidence is different from the way that you lay it down.  So I like the general idea of this game, but I just think that in moments, figuring out how the game wants you to proceed can be difficult.  In addition, I think certain characters could do with a wardrobe change, as this game could be enjoyable for a younger audience if not for what seems to be at least semi-mature wardrobe content.  As the only main difference in the games is in their plots, I'll rate each one below:

PW:AA - The introduction to the universe of Phoenix Wright.  This is the game that established the basic gameplay, developed the original cast, and did something very unique at the time that has now been replicated by several other games that are clearly paying homage to a classic.  Phoenix and Edgeworth make a perfect initial pair in court, and I just think this game deserves a lot of love. 8/10.

PW:JFA - This game introduced us to the successor prosecutor, and while I thought this new prosecutor gimmick was a stupid way to contrast her with Edgeworth, they actually developed her character to give her purpose throughout the entire storyline.  This game also introduced us to the magatama, which makes for a nice way to get the feeling of a trial before the trial has actually begun.  Pearly also appeared this game for the first time, and while I never saw a need for her character when she was first introduced, she's a character that has grown on me.  Finally, I'd like to add that the last game in this one was particularly well-written and overall a great mystery story.  It also tied in nicely to one of the classic episodes from the last game, so props to the writers for making this one a fitting sequel and something just as worthy of praise as the original. 8/10.

PW:T&T - In my opinion, one of the hardest things to do in a universe that has been well-established is to create an adequate final episode that ties all loose ends back up together again.  This game was pretty self-contained for the first few games but eventually they not only tied the specific game up to itself, but it also pretty much solved the remaining loose ends that we had been needing resolved from the past games, so there was a lot to love about this one.  Godot was the best prosecutor character in all three games, and anyone who has a different opinion on that is just straight-up incorrect.  Not sure if I liked what they did with his character, but I also thought that what they did in that episode was not totally out of character for the series.  The ending of the trilogy was impressive in terms of the number of loose ends that it tied together.  My only real complaint with the way the last story played out was in Maya's ""strength"" in handling it all for Pearly's sake.  After all she'd been through, I wish we'd seen a little more ""realness,"" but maybe that's too much to expect from a cartoon medium paralegal.  In any case, the storyline was fascinating and I liked where they went with it.  9/10.",1691393425,1691393425,True,46,1,0.773272275924682617,0,True,False,False

I do recommend coming into this getting ready to have some gay ships, since that's a very good way to derive additional enjoyment, and there are a lot of really funny and well-written fanfics that are based on the gay ships in this series.

I've become a huge fan of the Ace Attorney franchise through this triology, and I completely recommend it to anyone who enjoys visual novels and mystery/investigation games (There's a **lot** of reading to do, but if you like visual novels, that shouldn't be a problem)! 

The main plot and all the characters are excellent, and so are the episodes, the soundtrack, the trials... Not *all* cases are relevant to the main story, which makes some of them not as entertaining to play — however, at least for me, that didn't make any of them boring or anything.

Unfortunately this series suffers from bad writing and how strictly it wants you to follow its formulaic approach.

The investigations won't progress until you exhaustively check every item on every person or go to every location looking for the next event trigger so you don't miss anything for the court scenes. This ensures you never go into a case without all the info 'required' to make winning possible but makes the game very tedious.

The difficulty comes from selecting the right evidence in court but there's many points where suddenly the next choice is basically a game over if you don't select the right combination. This is made worse by the game wanting you to present evidence in a very specific order.

There were multiple times I wanted to point out clear contradictions but I was getting ahead of the story so it failed me for doing so. What's most frustrating is that stories are uncovered during the trials. Wright spends most of each episode bluffing and guessing his way through the court scenes, figuring things out only at the last moment which leaves you in the dark too and unable to do more than guess at where the writer is going. I think it's meant to make it more tense but it just feels hollow and makes the character seem inept.

Maybe if the stories were a bit less cliched and the gameplay more varied it would be more fun. Psyche-locks were an interesting addition but quickly became stale because they're court gameplay during investigations. Also what happened to 3D evidence? An interesting premise but does very little with it, they should have just made an anime instead.",1690710994,1690711203,False,3,0,0.490981787443161011,0,True,False,False

TLDR: Ace Attorney is a visual novel game, that means most of the game interaction doesn't actually happen in the game itself. It's really an elaborate puzzle game that you must piece together. Acting as both a detective and a defense attorney, you will go through 14 different cases and find the truth behind each of them. This is a thinking game, and the later trials in each entry of the trilogy will challenge your ability to both think logically and make creative, but accurate, connections.

Story: 
Without spoiling anything, I'm going to overview the story as best I can. Each entry in this trilogy is spaced out by a year. The timeline is fairly linear, but there are 2 cases you will go through that take place in the past. It's not continuity breaking at all, and actually makes that game my favorite of the three because it feels the most connected.

Typically, each case or ""episode"" will be a self-contained story. You will notice recurring characters, but that is generally all that repeats. You will go from a tutorial case in each game, which outlines the basic mechanics of how the game works, before getting in to the real content. These tutorial cases do, however, have story weight so they are very well utilized. 

When people discuss great stories told through video games, you'll often hear names like ""The Last of Us"" and ""The Witcher"" and ""Mass Effect"" among others. Those games all tell great stories, but they're a different kind of great story. In those games you play as the chosen one, a hero destined to save the world/universe from certain doom. In Ace Attorney, you're just a defense attorney that is fighting uphill to find the truth. I'd argue that Ace Attorney's story, particularly in Trials and Tribulations, is as compelling as those other great video game stories.

I'm going to list off my favorite cases by number, so the first case in the first game would be case #1 and the last case in game #3 would be case #14. Cases 4, 14, and 9 are outstanding. They are the climactic cases of each game, and are delightful to go through. Case #14 is probably the best case in the series as a whole because it really does wrap up the trilogy in an excellent way.

PS. Case #5 is a love it or hate it situation. I personally enjoy the court segments of that case quite a bit except for a certain vase section, but the investigation portions felt like they took forever.

Music:
Ace attorney games have phenomenal music, but it might not be for everyone. Remember, these games were developed originally for the GameBoy, and sound great when taken in that context. My personal favorite tune is the main prosecutor's music from the third game, Trials and Tribulations. The way that the music is used in gameplay as well is phenomenal as you'll know immediately if you're on the right track. When you present the correct piece of evidence, the music stops. It makes you feel like a genius in an incredibly subtle way.

Characters:
The characters in Ace Attorney are pun-filled and vibrant. There's hardly a character that isn't well developed or established in these games, and that's part of what makes them so beloved. You'll encounter some gems of text boxes along the journey through this game. The ""West Clownadelphia"" and ""A breach? Here? Baliff! Get my steed! We must retreat at once!"" are hilarious. There are some duds for characters, but overall this trilogy has the best cast of characters you'll find outside of a Persona or Final Fantasy game.

Graphics:
An older game for sure, but the HD face-lift the trilogy received does marvels for my enjoyment of the game. I play on a 4k 48"" monitor, and the game is gorgeous. I love the art-style, it feels like you're playing through a comic book. The animations are still a bit janky, but overall the game could easily pass for a ""retro indie game"" today.

Audience:
Ace attorney games are meant for everyone, but the common theme in all of these games is investigating murders. because of that, blood is regularly mentioned and how murders can/are committed is also mentioned. I'd give this an age rating of PG-13 if it was a TV show.

Gameplay:
As mentioned before, this is really a visual novel game. That means you're effectively reading a book and trying to guess how it ends to progress the story. This lends itself to much more of a mental game than anything else, and that type of gameplay can turn a lot of people away from this type of game. Don't let it turn you away.

PC Requirements:
This game can be installed and played on a smart-fridge.

Difficulty:
There are some massive difficulty spikes in this trilogy. The first case in each game is typically very easy, and its meant to get you mentally prepared for what is to come. The final case or cases in each game are the most difficult, and that certainly makes sense from a developer standpoint. If you recall how i numbered the cases before, Case #5 is easily the hardest case in this trilogy. It is long, it requires an extreme amount of mental gymnastics, and can absolutely make you hate the series. The reason for this is because Case #5 was originally developed for the first game's re-release on the Nintendo DS and they wanted to make full use of the DS's features. However, it feels out of place both in terms of the main characters involved and their relationships at that point, along with the otherworldly confidence you, Phoenix, have during the trial segments.

Games 2 and 3 do not have a case anywhere near as challenging as Game 1's 5th and final case. You will either love that challenge or resent it.

Game-Time:
Now it says I have 70 hours in the game, that's only true because i forgot i had it open twice overnight. Your experience with this trilogy should get you around 40-55 hours on average, but obviously how good you are at deduction can change that figure by quite a bit.

Price:
Get it on sale, this game can go on sale for as low as $10 or less, i'd definitely recommend grabbing it then.

Bugs: Never experienced a bug with this game, it is exceptionally well done.

Final Score:
9/10. 

Conclusion:
For what Ace Attorney sets out to do, its almost perfect. It is the best visual novel you will ever play unless you dig deep into ones that eventually became TV shows or anime (which this one also, coincidentally, did; there's even a stageplay and live action move for it). The only real complaints i have with this game are the investigation sections. They are often supremely vague and unclear as to how to progress, and you'll find yourself using everything on everyone until you finally get the right solution to move on.

If the investigation sections were cleaner, this game would be a 10/10. As it stands, 9/10. Highly recommended to all.",1689412637,1689412637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are two ways you could approach this game that I feel you could find enjoyable, either you can take it seriously and really immerse yourself in the episodes and trying to defend your client, or you could laugh at all of the weird oddities of the Ace Attorney universe. If you can find enjoyment in either of things, I think you'll find yourself quite enjoying this game. I will say that this game is not without it's flaws. The quality of each episode can vary and whilst I would say all of them are not bad, not all of them are masterpieces either.

To begin with, the game starts and it looks like it's going to be a cool game, just about judgments, without a big story behind it, BUT IN THE SECOND EPISODE, suddenly someone you created an affection for, because he was the one who taught you how things work, Mia, the boss DIES, and the investigation begins, the story gets difficult, you think that everything is going to go wrong at several times, even more so when you discover that Mr. White is extremely powerful, corrupt and manipulated everyone, when everything seems to be going well, you go after him, and he makes YOU TURN THE SUSPECT, you think it's all over but when you find contradictions in his testimony, when you find evidence that they exonerate you and blame him, YOU SCREAM OF HAPPINESS, you feel pleasure and pride in yourself when you succeed.
You also create affection for Alice, like a daughter, and you cry when Alice incorporates Aline in a spiritual way, this game is incredible.

Characters: 8/10
Some characters end up being a bit poorly presented, like the first Lawyer we are debating, but in general, most characters are good and endearing.

History: 10/10
There's nothing to explain, right?

Art: 10/10
The game design, the scenarios are very beautiful, the dialogues, everything has a very beautiful design.

""Animations"": 999/10
Let's say it doesn't really have animations, but I wanted to use it to talk about the actions of the characters in debate, like the point that Phoenix makes, the tap on the table that Phoenix and Edgeworth tap on the table, AND SIGNIFICANT, even more so when we're in a tense situation and we ask for protest, and we are anxious about a very important test, I almost have a heart attack at that time.

Game rating: 9999/10
WHAT A PERFECT GAME, YOU CAN PLAY IT WILL BE WORTH IT.

PT/BR: QUE JOGO PERFEITO, ainda estou no primeiro da trilogia, ainda tenho muito o que jogar, mas vou falar TUDO que amei e o que não gostei tanto.
Para começar, o jogo começa e parece que vai ser um jogo legal, só de julgamentos, sem uma grande história por trás, MAS NO SEGUNDO EPISÓDIO, de repente alguém por quem você criou um carinho, porque foi ele quem te ensinou como as coisas funcionam, Mia, o patrão MORRE, e começa a investigação, a história fica difícil, você pensa que vai dar tudo errado em vários momentos, ainda mais quando descobre que o Sr. White é extremamente poderoso, corrupto e manipulou todo mundo, quando tudo parece estar indo bem, você vai atrás dele, e ele faz VOCÊ ENTREGAR O SUSPEITO, você pensa que está tudo acabado mas quando encontra contradições no depoimento dele, quando encontra provas de que te exoneram e o culpam , VOCÊ GRITA DE FELICIDADE, sente prazer e orgulho de si mesmo quando consegue.
Você também cria carinho pela Alice, como uma filha, e chora quando a Alice incorpora a Aline de forma espiritual, esse jogo é incrível.

Personagens: 8/10
Alguns personagens acabam sendo um pouco mal apresentados, como o primeiro Advogado que estamos debatendo, mas no geral, a maioria dos personagens são bons e cativantes.

História: 10/10
Não há o que explicar, certo?

Arte: 10/10
O game design, os cenários são muito bonitos, os diálogos, tudo tem um design muito bonito.

""Animações"": 999/10
Digamos que realmente não tenha animações, mas eu queria usá-lo para falar sobre as ações dos personagens em debate, como o ponto que Phoenix faz, o toque na mesa que Phoenix e Edgeworth batem na mesa, E SIGNIFICATIVO , ainda mais quando estamos em uma situação tensa e pedimos protesto, e estamos ansiosos com uma prova muito importante, quase enfarto nessa hora.

Some characters will pull your heartstrings while others make you want to take a break from the game, but shouting ""Objection!"" in a kangaroo court has never been more entertaining. Despite its many gimmicks and oddballs, the game pulls off powerful moments with hardly any voice acting and basic graphics. 

Each game in the trilogy displays an improvement in story development and mechanics. This trilogy will simultaneously make you feel intelligent and... not as intelligent at times, but the journey is rewarding in itself. It is a great introduction to the series, and I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind reading quite a bit. 

There are some gameplay aspects that can be infuriating at times, but I think that they get improved upon dramatically in later entries of the series. Even with these slight criticisms, I would say that it is worth spending time and money on.",1688775751,1688775751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In this story, you play as Phoenix Wright, a rookie lawyer who can't win a case without having an underage anime girl by his side. You only have 3 days to prove that your client is innocent and lucky for you the real killer its always in the courtroom watching you struggle, It's up to you to find the evidence to prove his guilt. But this will not be easy since all the prosecutors you face will abuse you not only verbally but also physically, so get ready to be tazed, whipped and burned with coffee cups.
Do you have enough to succeed in this clown fiesta? Or will you let yourself be defeated by this corrupt society and its justice system that has no relation to the one we have in the real world?

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

However, I recommend to not play this entire collection in one go, or you will just end up feeling frustrated. This is one of those games that you better take your time for and not play it all in one go. the reason for this being that cases can get really longwinded and presenting contradictions can sometimes become really stupid.

+ Writing is pretty amusing. I've laughed out loud a few times despite this game obviously being aimed at much younger players.
+ Characters are goofy and likable.
+ Music is pretty good.

+/- Sometimes seems like you have to read the programmers' minds to know which specific piece of evidence you have to present from many options that seem valid. It doesn't always feel like your fault when you mess up. Each case seems to have one or two answers that seem very counterintuitive.
+/- Aside from the iconic shots of the lawyers in the courtroom, the graphics are worse than I expected. It looks like an early 2000s flash game. Even for a port of a GBA/DS game, it looks pretty rough.

------- The flashing. Good heavens, the flashing. The characters are fun, and the dialogue is entertaining, but I almost don't want to read it, because the game emphasizes things by playing an annoying sound effect and flashing the screen to white. When you're talking to excitable characters like Maya Fey, the screen flashes almost constantly. It's unbelievably aggravating, and there's no way to turn it off.

You'll get a lot of mileage out of this game, since it has all 3 games.

I rank them in this order of quality:
1.) Phoenix Wright: Ace Attourney (because it's hard to beat the one that started it all)
2.) Phoenix Wright: Trials & Tribulations (because the story and music are just too good)
3.) Phoenix Wright: Justice For All (because the music is bad across the board and Wendy Oldbag can get bent)

If you're interested in this one, consider checking out Apollo Justice when the next Ace Attorney Trilogy is released (which has some of the best and highest fidelity music in the series), as well as Miles Edgeworth Ace Investigations on the DS, and then download the rom for the second game which wasn't originally localized for American audience due to the high cost and low returns they would have gotten from doing so.

In short, I love Phoenix Wright. I grew up with it when I was about 14 and still play it to this day. Nothing can touch it. Danganronpa is a cheap PW imitation for explicit edgy weeaboos who need to see blood and pain to get their rocks off, but you can't beat the original.

Buy it and hopefully they'll bring the other ones to consoles. Capcom is on a ROLL with their games lately - Monster Hunter World, Megaman Legacy Collection 1&2, Megaman X Legacy Collection 1&2, Beat'em'up Bundle, Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 5, Ghost Trick, and now this?

I made a SUPER long video review about this game - things I liked, things I disliked, and a lot of discussion of how damn good the soundtrack is.

Capcom needs to bring in the rest of the series so everyone else can suffer- I mean, experience the same feelings about these surprisingly well-written and deep characters (unnecessary and otherwise).

- There's no time pressure
- It can be surprisingly tricky to find the discrepancies between witness statements and evidence, but
- You can make mistakes, the game will allow you to pick again if you link the wrong evidence for the case, or link it to the wrong part of the statement 
- Also, you can make a new save after each chapter, and a couple times during it, so you can easily go back to a certain point if you want to re-play it

If you like a somewhat point and click, heavily dialogue with almost a puzzle aspect then this trilogy is for you. I feel as though some dialogue has been changed in some situations, Don't quote me on that, but I feel like something is off from what I remember. The game play can get a little tedious when having to move from place to place and sometimes you feel like you've found the answer in a certain piece of evidence that actually proves your point but find out the hard way it's not supposed to be used until it's pressed in the cross examination. Other than that, I have nothing but love for the original trilogy and Ace Attorney Investigations featuring Edgeworth. The stories are well thought out and you find yourself invested in the characters, the motives, and of course what will happen next. They did some sprucing on the graphics but to be honest I prefer the pixelated images of the DS version. Gives it the nostalgia I feel seeing these characters again. It is worth the buy, but do try to catch it at an awesome sale or even bundled with the new trilogy. I can't express how happy I am to have this in my library. It was something I played for the hell of it when I was younger and now it's always a part of my happiest memories. I had never imagined highly anticipating the next game or even getting the rest of the trilogy. So all I can really say is that you will love it but you will be very sad when it ends. I've played the other games afterwards but they don't hold a candle to the original trilogy with Phoenix wright. I really enjoy Ace Attorney Investigations and I keep holding out that we will get a switch and/or PC release of 1 and the not localized 2.

Even though the plot ultimately falls flat especially compared to modern standards, it can still be fun to play. [b]Just don’t pay the full price for it [/b], the game is definitely not worth it. It’s a simple port with improved graphics and doesn’t offer anything additional that would justify the cash grabbing price.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+ Characters have unique designs and mannerisms.
+ Improved graphics over the original.
+ It’s a nostalgia trip for original trilogy players.
+ Soundtrack is pretty good.
+ You can squeeze a lot of play hours from it, even if you played the trilogy before.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
- In-game penalties vary in their severity, sometimes hurting you just a bit and sometimes giving you just one chance, regardless of your “health”. This encourages maniacal save scumming which isn’t much fun.
- Plot gets repetitive very quickly and you end up thinking whether half of world’s population has a tragically deceased sibling.
- Some characters are too cartoonish for their own good.
- The investigative parts can be a painful experience especially when having to deal with infuriating characters that keep reappearing in the game.
- There are sometimes plot points that are pretty obvious but will remain hidden in plain sight until the game arbitrarily demands you to expose them.
- You can’t really have fun playing the game blind. A guide is highly recommended if you want to maintain your sanity.

Very cheaply made with no voice-acting except for the words ""objection"" or “take that”, and it goes on for far too long. The latter probably being how they still get away with the high price, even on 50% discount.

As someone completely new to the series, I was hooked nearly immediately. You (usually) play as Phoenix Wright a defense lawyer, and gather evidence, interview witnesses, and use your gathered information to stumble your way through your client's defense. The game plays as a visual novel, involving lots of heavy reading and requires paying close attention to solve it's mysteries, so keep that in mind if that's not your cup of tea. All of the characters are oozing with charm, and the mysteries that unravel themselves kept me on the edge of my seat in every case.

I did have a few annoyances with the game, like sometimes the evidence needed didn't seem to match up with the dialogue it needed to be presented on, so don't feel bad about using a guide if you find yourself stuck on a puzzle for too long. The difficulty curve is a bit inconsistent, and the penalty system is overly harsh at the best of times, so be sure to save very often if you don't want to repeat hours of content. Despite these minor annoyances, I absolutely adore this trilogy. I found myself engaged for every minute of the 50 hour play time. If you're a fan of mystery/puzzle games, I would absolutely recommend it, especially if you catch it on sale for $10 like I did.",1686310550,1686311459,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The characters the foundation of this game; all of them are well written, and while sometimes they tend to be extravagant and exaggerated, they are human — meaning they express strong emotions and form meaningful bonds. The details matter, the silly dialogues tell wholesome stories. While some barely legal things happen in the courtroom, you should let that slide since it's hilarious (poor Phoenix). The cases are interesting and sometimes annoying, both in the challenging way and in the ""I wish this character wasn't so stereotypically infuriating"" — which isn't exactly a good thing, but it certainly makes more complex characters pop out.

The music is amazing, not much to say about that. The soundtracks are memorable and characteristic. The story flows nicely and develops through the trials, which are really interesting and fun to solve. In general, Ace Attorney's vibe is really peculiar and such a style with a strong personality is rare.

I highly recommend playing this game. Despite its flaws (overly stereotypical characters, the terrible movement system) it's a game that really deserves the hype. It's like a big inside joke between members of a family — in this case, AA's community. Hope you enjoy it!",1685577980,1685577980,True,53,0,0.809766769409179688,0,True,False,False

We all know Ace Attorney takes place in the United States, so you'd think they would mention 9/11 at least once. Especially when talking about DL-6, I mean, it takes place three months after 9/11. Why are Von Karma and Gregory Edgeworth busy fighting in a trial about cupcake wars when America just suffered the biggest act of terrorism ever? Aren't these characters the slightest bit patriotic? The original trilogy was also made around 2001-2004 so it's weird Takumi wasn't thinking about 9/11 enough to write dialogue about it.

I would mention The Inherited Turnabout but I always forget that's actually 2000, so 9/11 hadn't happened yet. In fact, there's even a deleted scene where one of the sculptures is a representation of New York and it has the Twin Towers, but they deleted it for aging too badly. Apparently AAI2-3 was in the works all the way back since 2001, which makes sense seeing everything that happens in the first game is a reference to this case.

This franchise, particularly the game ""Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney"" and its sequels, has captivated me with its unique blend of courtroom drama, intriguing storytelling, and memorable characters. In this article, I will share the reasons why I love the Ace Attorney series and why it has become one of my all-time favorites.

Engaging Storytelling:
At the core of the Ace Attorney games lies their enthralling storytelling. As a player, I am cast into the role of Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney, and tasked with defending the innocent in complex murder trials. The game masterfully weaves together intricate plotlines filled with suspense, unexpected twists, and emotional moments that keep me invested from start to finish. Each case presents a puzzle to solve, with cleverly hidden clues and testimonies to dissect. The gradual unraveling of the truth, accompanied by gripping courtroom battles, creates an intense and immersive experience.

Unique Gameplay Mechanics:
Unlike most mainstream video games, Ace Attorney primarily focuses on investigation and courtroom proceedings rather than action-packed sequences. The gameplay revolves around examining crime scenes, gathering evidence, cross-examining witnesses, and presenting decisive arguments in court. This combination of puzzle-solving and logical reasoning offers a refreshing change of pace, challenging my critical thinking skills and keeping me engaged throughout. The feeling of successfully exposing contradictions and presenting evidence to turn the tide in favor of justice is immensely satisfying.

Memorable Characters:
The Ace Attorney series boasts a diverse cast of colorful characters, each with their distinct personalities and quirks. From the determined and righteous Phoenix Wright to the enigmatic prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, the characters are brilliantly written and bring the game's world to life. The witty dialogue, humorous interactions, and memorable catchphrases create a delightful atmosphere, even in the midst of intense courtroom battles. The recurring characters and their evolving relationships provide a sense of continuity and make every new installment feel like a reunion with old friends.

Themes of Justice and Morality:
Underlying the thrilling gameplay and captivating narratives, the Ace Attorney series explores deeper themes of justice, morality, and the human condition. The games often delve into complex moral dilemmas, challenging players to question their own sense of right and wrong. They highlight the importance of seeking truth, the flaws in the legal system, and the consequences of corruption. The thought-provoking nature of the stories elevates the game beyond mere entertainment, prompting reflection on real-world issues.

The Ace Attorney series has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape, captivating players worldwide with its gripping narratives, unique gameplay mechanics, and memorable characters. As a fan of the franchise, I am drawn to its engrossing storytelling, challenging puzzles, and thought-provoking themes. It has ignited my passion for justice, honed my analytical skills, and provided countless hours of entertainment. If you seek a game that combines legal drama, intriguing mysteries, and a touch of humor, look no further than the Ace Attorney series. It has undoubtedly earned its place among the greatest video game franchises of all time.",1685375357,1685377214,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It is still a Visual Novel with a fair amount of trial and error choices, so expect the slower gameplay that comes with it. Quick skipping using one button helps to move repeated text along at a reasonable pace.

The English localization is mostly good, but there's a few typos and some cultural dissonance.

As someone who never even finished the first Ace Attorney on the DS, this was a great way for me to get into the series as a whole and experience the world and characters of this game.

The gameplay loop never feels too repetitive because of how great the story is and the characters in it. The soundtrack is also good

So glad i did, the overarching story throughout the trilogy is filled with amazing characters, moments, and twists. Some of the twists are kind of dumb, but most of them are great. I did end up getting confused sometimes and had to look up a guide, but made sure not to do that often, as it spoils the fun of figuring it out. 

All in all, these games are amazing and the soundtrack is iconic. Pretty simple music but it works wonderfully. (The only soundtrack i didn’t much care for was the second game’s ost, but even that one had one or two good ones.)

Although it has few minor issues, the overall experience is one highly recommended to anyone looking for a new game (or three). If you’ve never played the Ace Attorney games before, or if you’re looking for a new set of visual novel-style games to sink your teeth into, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is absolutely a must-buy on. With great humor, memorable stories and characters, a unique take on the legal system and – of course – a killer soundtrack, you really can’t go wrong. Just remember to only raise your objections when you actually have the evidence to support them, or you’ll learn the hard way that the Judge will only forgive so many spontaneous outbursts.

PROS:
✓ Great writing, with a memorable cast of characters
✓ Colorful, vibrant and refined visuals
✓ Stylish, fairly challenging gameplay
✓ Interesting compilation of stories within
✓ Upgraded interface
✓ Lengthy campaign
✓ Epic soundtrack

CONS:
- Requires leaps in logic

It's three really well-made games in one, great value for money, and an example of a remaster done pretty much perfectly.

My only negatives are small and inconsequential in view of the whole. I found some characters irritating (chiefly Franziska Von Karma), as well as the tendency to make the hero take a lot of mental (and physical, see Franziska) abuse during the course of the games. But that's easily balanced out by other characters I do like, for example Maya and Pearl Fey; my main man Will Powers; and the hilariously pathetic Moe the Clown. The general tone is over-the-top, the characters larger-than-life, and that can get a-bit-much, but on the whole it rides that line where I can bear the sillier elements, because the cases are always interesting.

In the second and third games of the trilogy, I feel that their respective final chapters got a bit convoluted and couldn't quite stick the landing, if you know what I mean. But it's a minor complaint, they're still enjoyable to experience.

Just buy it, you won't regret it. But maybe disable the screen shake effect as I did.

It was fun for the first two/three cases or so, but as it goes on I felt like it had some problems.
The pacing is an issue for me later in the game - the cases seem to drag out longer and longer, partially due to more gameplay but largely due to unnecessary dialogue and repetition. 
Story issues - the whole courtroom procedure is ridiculous, but that's part of the charm. What I had issue with is the other part of the story, the crimes. The last two in particular - the story was full of gaping plot holes and non-sequiturs and things that just didn't make sense. Combined with the sluggish pace, I just wanted to get them over with. 
So overall, it's a neat idea and was executed well for the first couple of cases, but that's where it runs out of steam.

Your enjoyment will depend entirely on wether you like the zany anime characters and absurd scenarios, which I do not. Unlike in, let's say, LA Noire, where you can miss clues or witnesses and botch interrogations, in Ace Attorney you'll always be forced to exhaust all options before events trigger and you move from field investigation to courtroom battles. Once you are in court, you can still choose the wrong piece of evidence, but you'll be given plenty of retries and cases don't veer from pre-established outcomes. Usually, after a lenghty ""bout"" against a witness that constantly alters his or her testimony to suit his or her needs (which would completely destroy its credibility in a reasonable environment, but not here), you'll reach a point where you show the conclusive evidence to sway the judge, and then a ridiculous, out of the blue event will trigger that will prolong the case. Afterwards, PW will be at a loss, but suddenly something will happen (like, a ghost will show up, or a surprise witness will forcefully take the stand), and then the judge will ask you: ""well Mr. Wright, please show us the piece of evidence that proves that what you are saying is true"", desperately trying not to be completely obvious as to what that is. This will repeat a few times per day at court, which will serve either to amuse you or roll your eyes.  Guess which one was my reaction.

The game treads lightly around morbid themes like murder, using non-stop levity, which is alright, don't get me wrong, but I felt like I was constantly going asleep as I played this since there were no stakes at all.

I will say that some cases had some questionable aspects to it, whether it was a contradicting oversight of a case that isn't mentioned or a case going into the realm of just being plain silly in how a murder was carried out, I still overall enjoyed my experience with the PW trilogy.
With this being sort of a 'remaster' though, the character and BG sprites are passable. It does kinda look like they just put it through an upscaling filter or something, not 100% sure though. Whether or not the original sprites are better is just subjective. It doesn't feel like they did much beyond that to be a remaster though, they really could have implemented a message history and other QoL things that VNs have nowadays. I did read they fixed up some errors from the original releases, though I don't know what these specifically were.

If you haven't played the trilogy before this is a definite buy, there's still the option of the original releases though if you really wanna. If you have played them, there's nothing really new here beyond fixing errors and updated art (you should still buy it and play it though so we can hopefully get more games and re-releases of the sequels).",1677021132,1677021132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Proud pricetag for a cheap remake (pixel graphics replaced by vector graphics that look like amateurish flash games from the early 2000s). User interface not adapted to modern hardware. The remake had sold over 800k times by end of 2020, most importantly for the switch, but no touchscreen support, not even mouse support. Yes, to click somewhere, you have to move the pointer with cursor keys and press enter. In a game using unity from 2019 that was remade for modern platforms.

The story of the game is nice and entertaining, the writing is good, although repeatedly following the same patterns and sometimes predictable.
Characters and legal system are completely silly, but its a game, with not much relation to reality. 

It is rather a visual novel than a game. The puzzles are usually not challenging and often there are strong hints what to do next (I should go there, I should talk to that person, I should present this). It only gets difficult if something lacks a bit of logic or if the game expects you to do exactly one thing, while another would logically be good, too.

The user interface is bad. Moving between places is unnecessarily complicated, so is switching between the modes for movement, investigations, talk and presenting.
In later episodes, additional mechanisms are added, which don't add an additional puzzle challenge but additional chores for the player.
Text is often repeated (at court or when talking/presenting to a person), its also not ideal that if you visit the same place on another day, what you already had explored becomes unexplored again and exploring repeats the same dialogs. This combined with a limited possibility to speed up or skip text, makes the game longer just through repetition. 
The mechanism to lose the game and having to start from last savegame is also a bad idea, because it again adds unneccessary repetition, but it does not hurt much as the game is so easy, you won't lose.

I had much higher expectations as the mechanics of pressing and objection with presenting a proof have good potential.
This is rather played for the story and characters, but the slow-as-molasses pace of the gameplay and tedious chores prevent just enjoying the flow of the story.
And in the end, while the stories are entertaining and touch some interesting questions they lack really interesting dilemmata and had to sacrifice some potential qualities of the story for the gameplay and twists.

It is visible that they tried to do it better but still the game transports stereotype gender roles. It helps a bit that they replaced one of the male villains by a female one, gave the protagonist a female boss in the beginning, and one womans naive play with her female attributes turns out to the disguise of a criminal - but still controlled by her male boss.  Most of the persons at court (judge, prosecutor, attorney) are male, and females appear most prominently as 16 year old girls that try to help the male protagonist and require his approval.
But the game should be judged considering the time and cultural context of its creation and its effort to break with gender stereotypes should be appreciated.

The concept that a good prosecutor wins cases regardless of the defendants guilt versus trying to uncover the truth even if it means ""not guilty""and having a defense attourney proving the innocence of their defendants as main character might not seem that special to a western audience but is extremely progressive regarding the japanese society and their horribly bad joke of a legal system with 99.9% of trials ending with the defendant being convicted as guilty.",1676148609,1676148609,False,1,0,0.477721303701400757,2,True,False,False

The cases are full of twists and turns to keep you engaged, and the trilogy tells a complete narrative with almost no loose ends remaining. One thing to note is that this game doesn't go for the 100% scientific approach that one might expect of a game that involves criminal investigation, but it's arguably more entertaining that way. Also, sometimes the answers the game requires from you aren't that obvious, but thankfully you can manually save at virtually any point in the game.

Some typical anime fan-service is present, the most egregious being a few minor characters, but nothing too bad. Localisation is noticeable since there is no way anyone will believe the setting is America, but it allows the game(s) to have a certain charm to them that's rarer to find in modern day localisations.

A few things worth noting:
a. The play order for the games are, in order:
    1. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney
    2. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All
    3. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations

b. That being said, Chapter 5 of the 1st game (Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney) was originally released after everything else in the trilogy. I didn't have any issues playing it before the 2nd and 3rd game, but it's noticeably different than everything else in the trilogy.

c. There are some points in the game where, if you save, might lock you into game overs or a bad ending. It's fairly obvious when that is, so just be careful and you'll be fine.

A word of warning; the investigative sections sometimes need a walk through to complete them. Sometimes you have to examine evidence after having a particular conversation and this is not always clear.

The games put players in the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney who must gather evidence, question witnesses, and present his case in court to prove his clients' innocence. The gameplay consists of two main parts: investigation and trial. During the investigation phase, players can move around different locations, talk to characters, and gather evidence. During the trial phase, players must present evidence and cross-examine witnesses to prove their client's innocence.

The game is known for its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and challenging puzzles. The dialogue and script is witty and well written. The game's art style is colorful and expressive and the character designs are memorable and unique. The game's soundtrack is also noteworthy, with catchy and memorable tracks that add to the game's overall charm.
The Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy includes three games: Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations. Each game features a series of cases that players must solve by gathering evidence, questioning witnesses, and presenting their case in court.

In the first game, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, players take on the role of a rookie defense attorney named Phoenix Wright as he takes on a series of cases. The game introduces players to the series' core gameplay mechanics and characters. The second game, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All, continues Phoenix's journey as a defense attorney and introduces new gameplay mechanics and characters. The third game, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations, concludes Phoenix's story and offers some of the series' most challenging cases yet.

One of the strengths of the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is its engaging and well-written storyline. Each case in the game is filled with twists and turns, and players will find themselves on the edge of their seat as they try to unravel the truth. The characters in the game are also well-developed and memorable, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations.

The gameplay in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is also noteworthy. The game's investigation phase is filled with challenging puzzles that require players to think critically and pay attention to detail. The trial phase is equally challenging, as players must present evidence and cross-examine witnesses to prove their client's innocence.

The game's art style is also noteworthy. The game's 2D sprites and colorful backgrounds are expressive and memorable. The character designs are unique and memorable, and the game's soundtrack is catchy and memorable.

Overall, the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is a must-play for fans of visual novels, adventure games, and courtroom dramas.

Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the third film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). Directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, it stars Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, alongside Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson. In the film, Morbius and his surrogate brother Milo (Smith) become living vampires after curing themselves of a rare blood disease.

There were several attempts to bring Morbius to the big screen since 1998, including joining the Blade franchise as an antagonist and having a solo film produced by Artisan Entertainment, neither of which ever came to fruition. After announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man related characters beginning with Venom (2018), Sony began developing a film based on Morbius. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, and Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work on the film began at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of production starting in London in February 2019. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019, with reshoots happening in Los Angeles the following February.

Morbius premiered at the Plaza Carso in Mexico City on March 10, 2022 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 1, 2022, after being delayed several times from an initial July 2020 date, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It received largely negative reviews from critics, with criticism towards its writing, visual effects, and post-credits scenes, though Smith's performance received some praise. The film was also a box-office bomb and grossed $167 million worldwide. Due to the poor critical and commercial reception, it became the subject of various internet memes.

At a hospital in Greece, 10-year-old Michael Morbius welcomes his surrogate brother Lucien, whom he unintentionally renames Milo; they bond over their shared blood illness and desire to be ""normal"". Their adoptive father and hospital director Nicholas arranges for Morbius to attend medical school in New York while he focuses on caring for Milo....",1673808523,1673808523,True,2,2,0.515738487243652344,0,True,False,False

You're a rookie lawyer in court, defending your clients, and more often than not more of a private investigator proofing their innocence by finding and piecing together new evidence, stuff you would think the police would do.

What really stuck out to me was the continuity (minus one case - if you play the Trilogy, you'll understand which one ;)) across the games. Unlike other games, there weren't any noticeable plot holes for me. One of the biggest criticisms of the game I have seen lie in its false depiction of actual court situations in both Japan (where the game was originally made) and its US localization (which I played); however, this is exactly *why* the Trilogy works for me - it takes place in a dystopic alternate universe where the court systems are so riddled with cases that lawyers have little time to prepare for cases, and cases cannot exceed an abnormally low number of days.

In the explore sections the player examines, talks, moves, and shows evidence. The player moves to a location, performs a single action, then runs to another area. Repeat. The exact actions must be performed in the correct order. It's easy to miss one obscure action. To avoid frustration I ask every question and present every piece of evidence to everyone I meet. This creates its own feeling of frustration. It's not a game if I have to play this way to proceed. It's checking items off a list. At trial the player needs to present the precise piece of evidence at the perfect time. Sometimes the answer is obvious, but it's also obscure and unguessable. This is a common problem with adventure games. Frustrated players look up answers to continue the story. Except that the story isn't great either.

The characters are the only redeeming feature of Phoenix Wright. The lead and recurring characters are charming, sarcastic, clueless, humorous, and determined to do right, whether it's Gumshoe, Edgeworth, Phoenix, or Maya/Mia.

Getting in between personal disputes. The sleepless nights. The potentially awful pay. It wasn't what I wanted to do, but I had no choice. 
However, my entire view changed once I saw the prosecutor. His name? Miles Edgeworth. He's a fancy looking man who wears red. He's cocky, sharp, and a bit of a jerk. But something about him.. I couldn't keep away, not even for a second. Ever since I first saw him, if I saw a case he was working on I would join instantly. He's a beautiful man, and I can't stand to be away from him. 
One day, as I was getting ready to confess to Edgeworth, I ran into a man in orange. He said his name was Damon Gant, and he claimed to be a part of the police force. I didn't mind, though I told him I would talk to him later. He didn't like that I said this, and before I knew it my vision was dark, and I was never able to open my eyes again. My body has not been found.

The trilogy offers varied (murder) cases that we, as lawyer Phoenix Wright, have to solve through investigations, cross-examinations and bluffs (lol) to get to the truth in the end. The game requires a bit of thinking and reading, so it's not for people who expect action-packed gameplay here. Each case has its own storyline, which mostly explains the backstories of various characters in more detail, to end up with a perfectly tied up overall package. Of course, the stories also contain plot twists, and it's not always immediately clear who is actually the culprit. All in all, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy tells a nice story, which I can recommend to everyone!

The puzzles are ridiculously fun, and mostly well-written, with well-paced bits of information and clues that help players theory-craft, and build their case. The logic jumps get kind of stupid in the later games, but its an old game, and there's some really nice walkthrus online for when ur stuck. Each chapter is a time-sink though, and it's awkward trying to pick-up a chp midway after setting it down, so you'd need to set aside a good few hours for each chp.

The cast is adorable, with a recurring main cast and the one-episode characters being played by easily digestible caricatures, each episode feels new, and stand-alone, as we're confronted by totally new, lively characters each time. The main cast, is stupidly funny and loveable, the dynamics between each character is fun and there's nobody in the game to dislike.

I am on the fence since I think there's a lot to like but sometimes think the games tone can be off putting for me (we're investigating murder here lets calm down on the banter a bit). The game has some poor narrative decisions and I think regardless of how much you like the game, it can be frustrating to try and figure out the right things to do to move the story along when doing investigations. Furthermore, some gameplay decisions are also a bit frustrating such as presenting the same piece of evidence twice in a row during some cases. That being said, I think that the main cast of Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth are all fairly likable with Edgeworth easily being my favorite character in the game.

The music and assets are also heavily recycled between scenes and episodes and get old quickly. Considering how tedious this game is, my guess is most fans of this series picked this up out of childhood nostalgia.

Finally, the port is also strangely done and manages to take up 60% cpu. This game is literally a slideshow lmao, if rendering needs to be done it should be done on the gpu. There's an unofficial fix for the new AA game but not this trilogy.

A couple of years later I finally got it and I'm sorry I didn't buy it earlier. The entire game is quite witty and meme-worthy. It's the first visual novel style game that I'm playing and I believe it is a great introduction to the genre, but also sets the bar quite high. If you don't mind the quite passive style of play and focusing on thinking about how the different pieces of evidence and testimony are tied together, I strongly recommend giving this game a chance!

What I especially liked:
Obviously, for a visual novel, the story is pretty important and for me, it was pretty good (even though not perfect). Let's say that by the time you're done with the game, you'd be content with it.
To strengthen the story, each character has their own distinct personality. They can often be described as silly, extreme or stereotypical, but this only contributes to the game's atmosphere. Many of the characters also have their own ""soundtrack"", which I found pretty cool!

What I didn't like so much:
The game is quite long. It's true that it's technically 3 games, with 14 cases in total, but it took me more than 60 hours to finish it and, honestly, by the end I was a bit tired of it.
There are some cases where it wasn't clear to me where I have to go or that I need to present some evidence to somebody in order to proceed. This can be frustrating at times.
Another small issue I had is that sometimes during trials I found a general contradiction, but it took me some trial and error to figure out the exact piece of evidence and exact line of testimony where it needs to be presented.

All of this taken into account, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. It's also quite often on sale, so it's easy to get it discounted.

I recommend playing each other at once each time. Because you must sometimes remember details that were exposed 30min or 1 hour ago.

If you care about the rich-story, you MUST absolutely play in order: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trial and Tribulations. (they are presented in this order too)

Wide variety of characters, some of them will meet 1, 2 or more times....

Now I won´t speak much spoiler but The End was EPIC and made me cry in a video game.

Last time I cried in a video game was 20 years ago when Sephiroth killed Aerith in old FFVII.

If you like comedy, buy it.

If you like drama, buy it.

If you like law this game is MANDATORY.

Have fun playing

For anyone unfamiliar with the franchise - this is a trilogy of games that each have 4-5 court cases within them, and you're usually playing as Phoenix Wright, the defense attorney trying to prove a client's innocence.  There are investigation segments and trial segments, and most of the gameplay involves choosing dialogue options and solving the mysteries primarily by finding contradictions in what people say.  The cases vary in how easy/hard, long/short, clever/convoluted they can be, but there are several real gems in the mix.  Each of the three games also has an understated arc related to one or more of the ""regular"" characters (generally one of the defense attorneys or prosecutors) that pulla a little bit from earlier cases into the later ones in the games.

And that's where the real joy of the game lies, because on another level this series is all about the major characters.  The regular and recurring ones - on both Phoenix's defense team and on the assorted prosecutors' side -  are wonderful, and you end up uncovering things about them as you work through the court cases.  What starts off looking like a goofy, over-the-top courtroom investigation ends up being a universe filled with people whose relationships to each other make you really care.  The one-off characters in the court cases can be idiotic, sometimes funny, sometimes interesting, and sometimes just annoying.  But the core characters throughout the trilogy (Phoenix, Edgeworth, Maya, Mia, Godot, etc.) are worth every minute spent learning their stories.",1669224042,1669653421,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you're not sure even with the sales of both the trilogy and great ace attorney Chronicles, I heavily suggest you experience the story via SaveData's YouTube channel (type in something like ""ace attorney played by a lawyer"" or something, and you get arguably the best way to experience the games besides actually playing them.) Also don't remember the swearing that resulted in those automatic hearts 😅. Wonder what did I actually said back then lol.




I am a recent fan of ace attorney, grew up on the phoenix wright: bullshit evolved series on machinima. I hope the other games eventually get pc ports(with mod support for extra diehard fans, I'm not much a visual novel guy, but this series is awesome)

So far only got through case 5 of the first game (may or may not edit this after I beat the whole thing, but I seen analysises and spoiled mostly on the twists of the two sequels, still looking forward to godot's coffee themed poetry, also beat apollo justice first just because I loved klavier in bullshit evolved, and relieved he wasn't a fan made character at the time xD)

For the first game, these three games were originally jap. Only gba games, the music is very short yet catchy and good. There really isn't any annoying sound clips or anything (maybe the megaphone of a certain case-5 specific officer can be irksome, but overall nothing was too annoying to me, and again, I hate visual novels in general, but I have been curious since sometime after middle school when I found out this was a actual series that wasn't just a very old machinima lol).

Phoenix wright judging by what I've seen of the first 4 games (since 5 onwards I heard they pretty much retcon or treat apollo justice like it barely exist sadly tho I thought it was a good branching off point, but I'm starting to seriously digress again lol least you're hopefully seeing my perspective as I write this), he's a very solid lead, considering this game was released in early 2001 September (I'm sure I don't need to elaborate further on why I'm noting that) , I'm surprised I never heard of him for a decade or so after that.

For phoenix, he's like a ideal anime protagonist (tho the anime... I'm not opening that can of worms tho it covers the orginal trilogy) , and the game really does a good job of demonstrating the limits of homo erotic tensions(thinking of our dear fan favorite, miles), all kidding aside on its own, the first game feel like a conclusive story, like if the game was a one and done thing, I would of been happy, tho I'm glad up to game 4, they did such a great job world building, and despite the issues of modern ace attorney, I hope and look forward to the series growing lol


(On side note the prosecutors in the next two games are kinky and poetic to the last drop ☕ respectively)

Edit: the first game came out Oct. 12th, 2001. I think a video review might have misled me a abit there, but still, I think my point stands lol just wanted to be a bit more factual for anyone who actually read the reviews vs looking up videos. I'm curious to how the reception was influenced critically and otherwise at the time. always open to a convo about the series if you're curious, tho I only more or less experinced the first 4 games, and the investigation spin-offs.

I discovered Ace Attorney game purely by chance, had never played before or watch any of its anime before but it left a lasting impression on me. I bought the game during sale and didn't have any high expectation for it. I'm a big fan of detective/mystery games and i figured why not give it a try as most of the review were positive and seems like It could be fun. I was immediately hooked on it and that's how I came to like the Ace Attorney series as a whole.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
The Ace Attorney Trilogy features 3 separate games combined into one. The gameplay aspect is pretty basic and it is what you would expect from a visual novel. Most of the gameplay relies heavily on point and click and occasionally other formats. The storyline is also linear with one exception if i recall correctly on JFA Case 4 where you have the option to get the Bad Ending. Every chapter or case as some may refer to it are split into 2 parts. One is the [b]Investigation[/b] and the other is [b]Trial[/b]. The investigation is self explanatory as you move around the map to gather evidence before heading on to trial. If you have played any Danganronpa game before, it is similar to that. If I'm not mistaken you will need all clues before you can proceed to the trial sessions so don't worry on missing out on anything. For achievement hunters you may refer to online guides on it as some of it require you to trigger specific dialogue from the cast for it. The trial part is where things start to get more fun. No it is not the same as Danganronpa, close but no quite. The trial session consist of Cross-Examination where you would need to find contradictory points on the statement provided by the witness. The game is also not too easy nor is it too hard, it requires you to think carefully before presenting an answer. Sometimes you are also require to examine the clues provided carefully as not all of the descriptions are provided. The game is also not too punishing on its players, If you made a mistake you can either stick with it or just reload from the nearest save point of your choosing. Speaking of save, the game doesn't have auto-save but it does prompt for you to save once a section of the game has been completed but you are able to save as frequent as you like. The game also have some running jokes which I enjoyed but some are just too annoying for me but overall It does balance well between taking itself seriously and making jokes.

[h3]Graphics & Soundtrack[/h3]
The soundtrack of the game for me personally are amazing. I'm especially fond of Turnabout Sister & Turnabout Sister Ballad. The OST for the Cross-Examination and Objection! are also really good. They remix it a bit throughout the series whilst retaining its original feel to it therefore I think it is really well done. The game doesn't featured voice character therefore nothing much can be said regarding there except a few ""Objection"" line from the Main Characters. The graphics for the game are nothing to shout about as it is just remastered from the original 2001 - 2004 games but it does allow for 1080p resolution which is a plus in my opinion. The game does have few animations, nothing too fancy but it does its job conveying the emotional state that the characters are in. 

[h3]Closing Arguments[/h3]
As with every great game, it does suffer from few problems here and there however with Ace Attorney Trilogy I do feel that the problems are really minor that It doesn't ruin the entire gameplay. Some of the issue such as the screen shake can often be solved by turning it off. The game's story is good but not great with some minor plot conveniences and change of rules but it is a good game nonetheless. I highly recommend you try the game for yourself and if you're stuck you may look for walkthrough online. Overall I enjoyed the game and wish I could forget the game and play it from blank slate again as it is one of my favourite Detective game.

The Ace Attorney games are a bit infamous for some ""moon logic"" sections, and it's true there are times where what is needed to progress is extremely unclear -- plus, in some cases, you can easily figure out solutions before the [i]characters[/i] do and are penalised if you try to follow that path too early. The game is very particular about the order of actions and When and How you talk to people or present evidence and such, and sometimes it doesn't do a great job of telling you what it wants from you at that precise moment.

While debatable whether it could be considered a visual novel it is what initially got me into visual novels through Danganronpa and then Summer Pockets.

The only difference between the original and this release was the inclusion of Rise from the Ashes which was added to the DS release. 

I first played through Ace Attorney some time in 2014 and subsequently went through all the games (including the FanTL of Investigations 2 but excluding Great Ace Attorney as of writing). The games even got me into the Professor Layton games through the crossover.

Each case begins with the wandering the crime scene to collect clues. This is very tedious, lots of retracing steps and going back and forth to discover a handful of clues. There's no skill or puzzle aspect to it really, just talk to one person go and talk to someone else, who sends you back to the first one. Tedious, and by far the worst thing about the game. I found myself clicking around for long periods of time and feeling like nothing relevant was happening.

The meat of the game is the courtroom scene (which makes it such a shame that you'll spend more that half the time doing the 'explore the crime scene' padding). 
This is much more compelling, question suspects and then use evidence to catch them in contradictions. It's a great idea but can be frustrating. Sometimes you've worked out whodunnit too soon and you have to go through the motions before you can confront someone with the killer piece of evidence. Sometimes the contradictions aren't quite in the places you expect and you can find yourself brute-forcing it, not because you haven't worked out what's going on, but because you can't work out the precise moment to object.

I'd be able to overlook these flaws if it was all courtroom. But I just gave up at the the end of one case because I couldn't face over an hour of fetch quests and dialogue before I got to play the actual game.",1666464961,1666464961,False,5,0,0.549469649791717529,0,True,False,False

Each of these games are fantastic, but it's how each culminate in their own climax that really defines them as legendary, and how the third takes every step of the journey and capitalizes on the lot that makes this trilogy a real masterpiece. I streamed this whole collection for my boyfriend- a lifelong Ace Attorney fan- and had an absolute blast every step of the way. The first two cases get you set off to a solid start in a journey that's as uplifting as it is devastating. Like the best legal dramas, many events, especially in the later games, are spun and kept in motion by larger than life characters, yet certain connecting threads keep them tied down to earth, their motives surprisingly base and human in satisfying confessions. 

By the end of this 70+ hour long story, I was really, really hoping it'd never end, and I always consider that the defining mark of a masterpiece.

The first three games roughly amount to a good 80 hours or more of gameplay, making this a great deal for Ace Attorney newbies. 

For returning players you get exactly what you expect, but with a fresh new look which has proven to be somewhat divisive within the fan base. I personally do not mind the new hand drawn character images, but I totally understand why someone would prefer the original sprites. I don't think too much is lost in the transition, but the charm the original games had is somewhat dampened by the new designs. The new graphical style isn’t bad or ugly, but there is an appeal to the original sprite work that could be argued is lost by the HD trilogy. It's up for you to decide which to play, but I love the convenience and pricing of this trilogy. It's perfect for most players.

As for the games themselves, they play as well as they did originally. For those unfamiliar with Phoenix Wright, all three games in the trilogy consist of unique cases, each of which last a few days in which you must collect evidence, speak to witnesses, present evidence in the courtroom and cross examine suspects. It's a fun gameplay loop that never gets old. Hearing Phoenix shout out OBJECTION! For the hundredth time when you finally nail a lying suspect is just a thrill. The music especially pumps you up during these moments.

And despite the games being pretty old, the cases still hold up remarkably well. There are some exceptions, like Turnabout Big Top which has some dodgy character writing surrounding a young love interest, but this is an exception. The majority of the cases are superb and this is down to the writing. It knows when to be funny, serious or even poignant. This trilogy is a very convenient package of three beloved games and is well worth it for anyone who enjoys a good adventure/visual novel.

If you don't know what you do in this game, you are Phoenix Wright, defense attorney at law. Your job is to prove your client's innocence before the court in a judicial system that is beyond weighted against the defendant. The system is based on japanese courts with a healthy dose of fiction and translator shenanigans thrown in for good measure, so if you know law then this won't exactly be a work-sim.
In court you hear testimony and cross-examine witnesses. It is mostly a logic puzzle to figure out inconsistencies in the witness' story and to get more information, while not making baseless conjectures or trying to prove something without proper evidence. You aren't using courtroom strategies or trying to plead to a (non-existent) jury for lighter sentencing. You are getting a full acquittal while providing the actual culprit or the electric chair (because it's always a murder case, somehow) for your client.
Outside of court you are snooping around crime scenes, finding evidence, talking to witnesses and others, [spoiler]and doing your best to not get killed by the prosecution, the murderer, a monkey, guilt or any other random individual, object or concept wanting to obstruct justice.[/spoiler] It is more or less an easy point-and-click game with some deduction going on.

That description might not sell it to you, but most of the cases have very intriguing twists and turns, and the two different styles of gameplay work together very well. While in court you make mental notes of who you want to hear from more and what to investigate further in the free-time, and while out sleuthing you are putting together theories to test in the courtroom.
It's not perfect. There are a fair few leaps of logic that make little sense, both for your case and just how they relate to anything. There are also quite a few coincidences and contrivances that make for bad cases (the vase in From the Ashes and the entirety of Big Top come to mind). But despite these things, I would say that these are fantastic games. Despite the previously mentioned issues, From the Ashes is my favorite case in the trilogy. A solid purchase at even non-discounted price.

A supposed witness was busy at 9pm. Therefore, this should negate the witness testimony to the murder, or at least, exact times mattered in Episode #1 so I assumed exact times mattered in Episode #2, but they didn't. So I couldn't figure out what evidence the game wanted me to present. It's hard to make a game like this work when there are multiple arguments to be made and the player has to attempt to get into the mind of the writers. Kind of annoyed right now. 

Plus, this is a bunch of just click here and save this piece of info, click there, okay, maybe it's evidence, but you won't know it until the game reveals it in the story. Case in point. Episode #2: You acquire a receipt as evidence. What does the receipt say??? Well, the game doesn't let you examine the receipt so you are at the mercy of the story which decides to finally use the receipt as plot armor to save your case by revealing what it says.

Characters are fun tho, and I'm going to keep playing but I can't recommend such a linear title. This truly is a visual novel, not a game. I was going to refund it, but Steam said I had played for 76 minutes at 10:40pm so I figured I'd finish out Episode #2. Anyways, at 10:58pm when I finished Episode #2, Steam said I had played for 2.1hrs, and thus, outside the return window! NOW THERE""S A CASE TO SOLVE>

So I am stuck here with an okay game, and I'm trying to beat all games I own so here i am playing for a couple 40 hours more.

::Update::

Oof, Episode #3 is getting very long in the tooth. Why does every witness have to revise their testimony 3 or 4 times? Like I don't feel like I am doing anything other than pressing ""Q"" to Press the witness. Also, most decisions given by the game lead to the same path/answer so that's ULTRA Lame. I even tried accepting that a possible murderer had no motive for killing someone, and the game said, ""NOOOOO!!!!, SHE GAWDDAMM DID IT. YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME BULLCRAP MOTIVE TO PROVE SHE DID IT.""  And thus, the game looped me into the witness's testimony again, even tho I didn't really care b/c I had proved my client's innocence and so I didn't care what this other person did. Not my case .

[b]overview:[/b]
the ace attorney trilogy has a lot of entertaining characters, fun cases, and engaging mysteries. the gameplay loop tends to be pretty consistent throughout: there has been a murder and then you alternate between collecting clues while investigating and putting those clues together during the trial segments. there is a lot of reading (i think the only spoken dialogue i remember is when someone yells ""OBJECTION!"" which, come on, is great), but i wouldn't classify these games strictly as visual novels since they do require a lot of player input and problem solving. 

[b]possible negatives:[/b]
- one thing i found irritating at times was how you move between areas when investigating. from your current location you have specific, limited locations you can travel to. as the cases develop and you will unlock more and more places to visit. trying to go to a certain area may mean passing through three or four other locations along the way just to get to the new spot. since there isn't any type of map to show you which areas are connected (if i am wrong, please let me know!), sometimes you are blindly clicking between areas to find the one you need, or even worse, you don't realize there is a new area to go to.
- i'm sure this will be a very controversial potential negative, but i felt this collection may be too long(!), particularly if you don't want to do so much reading or you find the gameplay loop to be anything less than enthralling. i started playing this mid 2019 and finished it late 2022. after finishing the first game in the trilogy, which added an extra case that the ds version did not have, i felt a bit burned out and needed a break. when i came back to the collection, by the time i got to the third game (trials & tribulations) i realized i was somewhat mentally checked out, not because the game quality was lacking, but because it was just so much content. it took me 67 hours to finish everything, which qualifies as a very long game for me. i'm sure some people will love that this collection is so long, and people who qualify game purchases by the ""$1=1 hour of gameplay"" will be ecstatic. again, i don't think there were any bad cases, but at a point i just wanted to be done with the ace attorney trilogy.
- lastly, i did have a graphical glitch at times where some of the text was dark grey instead of white, which made it hard to read against a dark background. this didn't happen very often, and it seemed pretty random.

[b]in conclusion:[/b]
basically everything else the game had to offer was a positive! i don't regret my time with the phoenix wright: ace attorney trilogy, and i do think i will check out other ace attorney games in due time.",1665188952,1665188952,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The stories and ethical dilemmas played out are complex and the way they connect is crazy. Then there's the aspect of it being satirical criticism of the Japanese court systems (which pretty much covers every time you'd want to cry, 'wait, isn't that unrealistic?!' yes. Yes it is, like a satire of judicial systems should be).

I know it is on gaming platforms, but approach this as a cross between a movie and a book with some puzzling to do, not a literal 'game'. You will enjoy it more for what it is that way. (This should be obvious given that it is a VN, but I think some people forget what a *novel* is.)

1. The game is too expensive and not worth it..
Objection!
It is a collection, which includes 3 games where you can spend at least 60 hours, also on sale you can grab it for the half price.

2.The game is linear, there are no choices in it..
Objection!
Edgy Edgy..
Who told you, that every game has to be non-linear? This game does not need it at all.

3.Gameplay is boring,every time you doing the same...
Hold it!
This is a visual novel, according to the data provideed by detective Gumshoe(Hey,Pal) most players enjoy visual novels because of the story,characters,music.

4.The game is too long!
Hold it!
Mr, this contradicts your previous testimony!
Previously you said that the game is too expensive and they ask a lot of money for it, but now you say that game is too long?

Ace Attorney takes something as mundane as court proceedings and turns it into an extremely fun, wacky and absurd drama.

Honestly, the game looks like it was made for pedophilles, which makes sense since weeaboo NEET's brains cease to develop after 15 years of age which explains their attraction to little 2d girls.

Finally being able to relive these games in Crisp HD, reminded me how brilliant they were, having just moments ago, beaten Trials and Tribulations, completing the entire trilogy, I cannot wait till we get the second Trilogy (+Investigations if Capcom are generous) on Steam.

Till then, I suggest either Emulating or Watching a play through of the rest of the series. If you have the money, I recommend purchasing the HD IOS copies of the series, instead of the OG DS games (IMO)

Don't know what series to watch? Well you're in luck my learned friend, some of the best ones to watch are:

Slyzer (No Commentary) 
Lucahjin (Commentary + Voices Characers)

Note: As of the date of this review being updated, 22/4/22, Luchajin has played up to Investigations 2

Slyzer has played the entire series, but doesn't provide commentary.",1649632851,1659824973,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It does kinda sag in the middle with JFA, but it picks right back up in its final arc. I will say that it can be frustratingly video gamey in when/how you're supposed to present evidence.

Ironically, what first brought me to the guide wasn't the trials, but the investigations. I got stuck with not knowing where to go or who to talk to and what to present to them at a couple points. And when I did use it in trials, in most cases, I had some idea of what point I wanted to make, I just wasn't sure on what statement or in which order to present things. And yes, when presenting evidence, the statement you present on matters: something that initially surprised me. Even if two statements are related or two halves of one sentence, don't expect them both to be valid present points! I'd recommend saving often if you don't want to use a guide.

With that fact admitted, I still have to say that I really enjoyed getting to play these classic games. It's not surprising at all that Phoenix Wright and company get their place in pop culture: they earned it. I really hope that some of the later games get a turn at being updated and ported to Steam, although it seems unlikely. Hey, Capcom, if you're reading this...well, probably not. But if you are, great job. It takes skill to make games that can still hold water years later, still be enjoyable to someone younger than the games.

The game looked like it had good humor and was fun to play, and I was absolutely right. I don't usually audibly laugh at games, but Ace Attorney is one of those few, and that's why I love it so much. Every character is perfectly designed to fit their personality, on top of that there designs are so recognizable and vibrant.

Ace Attorney games are visual novels, but I'd argue that they are puzzle games filled with amazing stories. You can't skip all the dialogue to get through faster, because the game will give you a question that you have to present a piece of evidence for. Multiple times you have to stop and think, ""how did that happen"" and come up with a reasonable explanation (mostly reasonable). The story across the three games, without going into to much detail, is perfect and mesh so well together. Characters go through arcs that perfectly go alongside the court cases. You get filled with so many questions that are all seamlessly answered by the end.

This is three great games in one great package, and they all fit so well as a trilogy. If you're interested in Ace Attorney, this is the game to get. It's a great first game for Ace Attorney and is well worth it.",1658296609,1658296609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I knew all the memes - OBJECTION - it took me more than a quarter decade to whip out the AA trilogy. Overall, they are great games that are fully deserving of its loyal fanbase. And to take it away straight away: [b]I highly recommend to buy the trilogy![/b] But this does not mean that it is a perfect game either...

[list]
[*][b] Story:[/b] Most stories from the first three games are standalone side stories, but some cases are actually linked to each other. Those cases that actually have an impact on the world are by far the best. Unluckily, the writing for each case varies in quality significantly.
[*][b] Gameplay:[/b] Click-puzzle-game. I would not even call it gameplay - it is a visual novel after all. I am curious how many books equal those three games, but one thing is for sure: Binging more than one case in one sitting is really tough. And even playing through one case in one sitting is not the easiest. But maybe it's just cause I do not have the fresh attention span of a teenager anymore.
[*][b] Visuals:[/b] Quite unique splasharts for each character. While the art is not of high quality, I got used to it pretty fast. Nothing to add here.
[*][b] Characters:[/b] Obnoxious. Look, there were some characters which I really liked: Ace, Mia, Edgeworth, Maya, Pearly...the main cast was likeable. Even Franziska with her one-dimensional gimmick grew on me. But holy...the one-off cast was god awful most of the time. Against his best efforts, Butz did not ruin 1-4 and 3-5. I know that it is rather cartoony, but the side cast is so one-dimensional and it is just annoying. There is no need to have a second comedy-act when you already have Gumshoe as well. It was too much. This in turn means that cases with actually decent and more complex (as much as it is possible) personalities are immediately waaay better (2-4, 3-5, 1-5, etc.). And that is the kicker that bothered me from time to time. It is really hard to read novels of text from characters that are just not likeable.
[*][b] Enjoyment:[/b] I am glad that I played the games! The fond memories of the good cases will remain. Weirdly enough, I am apperently in the small minority that thinks that the second game was really good and actually better than the third one which was solely saved by the last case - linked with references from 3-1 and 3-4. Big Top was not as bad as people say it is and 2-2 and 2-4 are both in my Top 5 easily. I just hope I can block out the god awful cases soon enough. I do recommend the trilogy but comparing it to Danganronpa the characters as well as the writing are far worse. AA often has really anticlimactic reveals after which you still have to play for an hour. Danganronpa hit the plot twist element way better. Or do you have any objections to that?

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney:
While not as innovative as its successors, this game is the perfect introduction into this bizarre world of anime lawyers, desk abuse and courtroom carelessness. In this game Phoenix Wright and his friends must face a dangerous threat: sarcasm! (If you're an actual lawyer, deliberately fail the bar exam before playing this). 

Courtroom sections are the highlight of the game, as investigation sections are just *trial* and error, as you present every piece of evidence to people in the hope that they have something even remotely interesting to say about it. Courtroom sections are, basically, an anime battle between a law school drop-out and a fancy dressing, rule-bending courtroom dictator who are in a race to convince the judge that the other's argument is baseless conjecture. 

Speaking of the judge, he's best described as a baboon who snuck into the courthouse, stole a gavel and decided the prosecutors were the coolest kids on the block. This game is great and is a perfect introduction to Phoenix Wright's struggles to be taken seriously.

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Justice For All:
This game continues the story of our kooky main cast in an excellent fashion. This time they have a new obstacle in their path: the full titles of their personage! The new additions to the cast are great and fit right in with J'Murica's run-down, ridiculous and inconsistent excuse for a legal system. (Now's probably a good time to mention, that, because of localisation choices, these games have a desire to be in America which doesn't quite fit with the original Japanese setting. Hence: J'Murica). 

There's a new gamplay mechanic that spices up investigation sections to make them just as interesting as courtroom section. (Although, courtroom sections are still more fun). This game is great, although, the first is maybe a smidge better. However, this is still an amazingly fun ride through Phoenix Wright's attempts to look like a competent lawyer

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations:
This game concludes the story of Phoenix Wright and his gang of idiotic companions as they face their most terrifying challenge yet, the spawn of the devil itself: coffee! The new gameplay mechanic introduced in the previous game has been perfected here and it's almost as good as the courtroom sections, now.

There isn't much to say about this game other than it expands on the formula from the previous 2 in ridiculously creative ways. This game is amazing and truly earns its reputation as the best in the series. Strap yourself in for a fantastic ride as Phoenix Wright tries, for the final time, to convince the world that he's worthy of his cereal-box acquired attorney's badge.",1630076240,1657792330,True,40,6,0.800885677337646484,0,True,False,False

Section 5A:

Yes.

Section 5B:

Just kidding, I do have actual reasoning behind this.

i) Edgeworth Isn’t Attracted to Women

It’s pretty obvious that whenever Edgeworth interacts with, is flirted with, or is approached by women attempting to flirt with him, his reactions to their flirting range from indignant to completely oblivious. Women who are noted in-universe to be particularly attractive have absolutely no effect on him: from April May, to Angel Starr, to Dahlia Hawthorne, any and every female character who relies on charm or capturing the attention of men find a brick wall in Edgeworth. About the only woman whose affections he notices is Oldbag, and that’s only because she’s… well, Oldbag. He’s somewhere between apprehensive and confused at learning he has female admirers, wondering if he “really inspires such frothing desire from the female masses” in Bridge to the Turnabout.

This is especially notable in his own games, particularly Turnabout Airlines, where we are given gems such as “Oh, now I get it. Maybe you’ve ‘got your eye’ on Ms Rhoda…” “Of course I’m keeping an eye on her. I can’t very well let her escape, can I?” “Never mind…”, “I can’t think of a single reason why I’d want to buy you anything,” (addressed to a woman who literally wears her flight attendant uniform open to seduce the pilot) and a particular comment about the female flight attendants’ room: “One would think that [women’s] perfume ‘smells great’, however, to me it simply smells… not that I have any interest in what lies behind this door.” The comment in English can be read as him just disliking the smell of perfume, but the way the Japanese version is phrased was interpreted by many fans as not just being disinterested in perfume, but women in general.

The only time Edgeworth has ever shown even remote interest in any woman is during his Takarazuka musical, which, as I have stressed earlier, is absolutely obligated to have the protagonist in a m/f romance. Hell, the romance itself is far less prominent than in other Takarazuka plays; the woman in question doesn’t even kiss him, simply giving him a rose which he keeps to the end of the play, and the traditional couple’s dance at the end of the play is given to a different pair of characters.

So, Edgeworth is definitely not interested in women. That leaves us with two broad possibilities: he is aroace (not to be confused with asexual, which refers to lack of sexual attraction and still connotes the possibility of romantic love; aroace is a term referring to those who experience neither romantic nor sexual attraction), or he is gay.

 

ii) Edgeworth Is Attracted to Men

Now this is the point of contention. Is Edgeworth gay or European disinterested in romance entirely? Surprisingly, there’s far more evidence for the first possibility than you’d think.

Returning to Turnabout Airlines, talking to the (male) passenger surrounded by bottles gives you this exchange: the passenger asks “How about it? How about a glass together?” and Edgeworth, without a second thought, assumes he is the one getting hit on- and responds with an uncharacteristically polite “Um, sorry, but I must decline.” There is literally no other flirtatious interaction which Edgeworth responds to with such awareness and civility. He doesn’t even notice Rhoda’s crush on him for the entire case! The passenger, on his part, replies “I wasn’t talking to you! I was asking the cute attendant!”. A case later, he also seems to react to Agent Lang taunting him and calling him a “pretty boy”, but makes little effort to discourage him from doing so.

Then, of course, there is the marriage conversation in SoJ’s DLC. People seem to believe this is a one-hit-kill of any and all Edgeworth ships. It is not. The line about wishing to remain unwed is almost exactly the same in the Japanese version, and in Japan, there is still no such thing as same-sex marriage. If the writers had been attempting to convey that he is simply uninterested in romance, why not just have him say that he has no intention of falling in love, ever? (It’s also important to note that we are never given a statement on whether same-sex marriage even exists in Japanifornia. As it stands, Ace Attorney’s semi-fictional hybrid country resembles Japan somewhat more than it resembles California; who’s to say same-sex marriage does exist there? Criminal law, at least, follows Japanese convention. We’ve never seen a canonical married gay couple in modern-day Japanifornia. It’s sad to say, but it’s a fair bet that as it stands, two men can’t get married in the Ace Attorney universe.)

Also- and I think I mentioned this earlier, but I’ll say it again- Edgeworth only ever objects to the prospect of “getting married”. Sure, he’s irritated by Phoenix trying to bring up the power of love as evidence in a court of law, but his refutations revolve around the idea of him getting married and “settling down” (i.e. starting a family with a woman), not the idea of falling in love. It is marriage, and heterosexual marriage in particular, which disinterests him.

Not to mention that from a more subjective standpoint of queer-coding, Edgeworth hits several boxes for stereotypes. While this is obviously ineffective at determining someone’s sexuality in real life, giving fictional characters certain traits can be viewed as a hint towards their sexuality- like a certain hairstyle on a lesbian or a piercing in a certain ear for a gay man. Bearing in mind that this is Suekane, an experienced BL artist, that we’re talking about- she knew what she was doing.

Edgeworth wears nothing but pink and frills, and clearly takes interest in the way he looks. He solves a murder in his manga series simply by judging a girl’s choice in shoes. In terms of Japanese culture, he slots right into the “bishonen” stereotype, what English-speakers would call a “pretty boy” (and, as Suekane had experience with yaoi- which bishonen frequently overlaps with- this was probably intentional). He’s noted in-universe to be particularly attractive, but he barely notices girls and has clearly never dated one. To me, his narrative of growing up in a strict household like von Karma’s also has a certain resonance with the narrative of the closet. All in all, he fits pretty solidly into the stereotype of a gay character. Again, none of this is proof he is gay; someone can check all these boxes and more and still be straight. But combined with all the evidence above… Edgeworth being coded specifically as a gay man is the most logical conclusion.

Okay, so Edgeworth’s gay. Is Phoenix bisexual? …Honestly, we have no hard evidence one way or the other. We’ve only ever really seen him be attracted to women, but those instances are relatively few and far between; he notices people like April and Angel, was definitely in love with Dahlia/Iris, and has crushes on a few girls in the casebooks. On the other hand, he doesn’t seem to be particularly heteronormative; he pretty clearly thought Lana and Mia had dated, is quite confident when he declares White and Grossberg must be lovers, and easily picks up on Max flirting with him in Big Top (although his reaction is, understandably, one of disgust.) Bisexual people can be anywhere on the Kinsey scale, and were Phoenix to be confirmed or hinted to be bisexual he would be no exception. And, of course, there’s the way he interacts with Edgeworth.

Ultimately, neither of these characters’ sexualities have been confirmed. It’s pretty likely that Edgeworth is gay; it is not impossible for Phoenix to be bisexual. Sexuality, therefore, is in no way a hurdle for Narumitsu.

 A highly entertaining game with a compelling cast and a hooking plot. The trilogy follows Phoenix Wright, a newbie defense attorney and our protagonist, as he grows into a great lawyer by unravelling mysteries, saving lives, wining trials and making friends.
 The games' mechanics are really simple, they resemble a mouse-only puzzle-like sort of game, where your greatest skill is your wits and not how many headshots you can get. Their simplicity allows for any type of player to enjoy them, yet they are not dull and thanks to all the thinking involved and the evolution of the gameplay, hardly feel repetitive.
 Nevertheless, the main factor of these games are its stories. Interesting cases, thought-provoking dilemmas, character development, fun investigations, dynamic trials, humorous dialogues. In terms of writing, this games have it all. The identity of this trilogy is clearly defined and if it is to your liking, you are sure to become a fan.
 Unluckily, Capcom has seem to have abandoned Spanish speaking communities, but for those who are able to access this content I pray you give it a chance. Although this may not be the kind of game that we are used to at present, it is an unforgettable champion in its unique genre. A game that could easily be forgotten because of its age and outdated playability; a masterpiece that is good enough to be kept alive by avid fans and thunderstruck newcomers that have fallen in love with this rare marvel.",1657165192,1657165886,True,1,0,0.504620790481567383,0,True,False,False

I played this trilogy originally on the Nintendo DS. Honestly, I prefer the DS version because I think the graphics look more authentic, but other than that and the achievements, the DS version and this version are identical. This is a great, cheaper alternative to play the series without trying to get a DS and grab the DS titles.

I purchased this game solely for the achievements and being able to have an Ace Attorney background, honestly. Judge all you like, I'm obsessed. So, I did wait for a sale because as someone who played the game before, I did not think it was worth full retail price. it IS worth full retail price if you've never played before.

What can I say about this game?

Story: legendary, keeps you on the edge of your seat, has twists and turns you don't see coming, keeps you invested (I laughed, cried and gasped throughout my original playthrough and it takes a lot for media to invoke emotion in me)

Characters: Colorful, intricate, interesting, unforgettable (even the secondary characters or characters that are barely shown/used)

Music: Iconic (I still listen to it casually on Spotify to this day)

Puzzles/Problem Solving: Well, about that...

My only criticism of this series as a whole is the puzzle solving. This game progresses very particularly. You may have figured out the case before the game really allows you to. Only certain evidence, statements, and examining will move you forward, even if you're ahead of the game logically. When I first played the series, I found myself saying ""Oh, c'mon!"" and ""Really??"" because I had figured out things faster than the game thought I would or didn't understand the logic the game was using and I was stuck until I pressed every statement, presented all evidence, and examined EVERYTHING.

For example (a spoiler free example): One character requests a script. I know exactly where to find it. I go there, but the game will not allow me to grab it and take it back until I show another character a memo asking for a script. Only THEN can I go back, grab the script, and take it back to the character who requested it.

And that's an example where it was actually easy to figure out the sequence of events. It's not always that easy.

But honestly, I managed to overlook that for just how original and fantastic this series is. It was still satisfying to finally figure out the mystery and move the story along.

Get this game. I think if you like murder mysteries and/or story heavy gameplay, you'll adore this cult classic.",1656963486,1656964740,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I played this game for the first time on the iOS Trilogy version and this is literally the best they could have possibly done outside of a complete rewrite to fix some of the continuity errors, logical leaps, and plot holes. There's no game on the planet I would recommend more if you are a fan of page-turning novels and stories than this one. The insight into the problems with the Japanese legal system creates some of the most unique, suspenseful moments a book or visual novel about lawyers going to court could ever produce. 

This isn't an accurate representation of an American court system, because of legal issues such as Conflict of Interest, evidence law and the rights of the accused spelled out in the Constitution. They would ruin any chance of a majority of the events in this story occurring the way they do in-game. The game is set in a bizarro Los Angeles mixed up with tons of Japanese culture (if you are playing the English version - I assume it's localized differently with other language settings), so it's important to keep in mind that the original trilogy of games were originally created and developed in Japan for the GBA back in the first half of the 2000s (2001 for AA, 2002 for JFA and 2004 for T&T). The games were not released outside of Japan until the DS remake of the first game that added the Rise from the Ashes to the case roster of that game. (Note: Rise from the Ashes was written after the completion of the first three games, so in order to truly appreciate it, I recommend newcomers to complete it after the final case in the original trilogy, as it contains little references here and there that you will only pick up on after playing the full trilogy first.) Thus, the game was meant to be a parody of the Japanese legal system, in which the game goes out of its way to highlight its many faults. As the series progressed, however, standards such as the Three-Day trial system and Prosecutors having the advantage became key to the identity of the series. In other words, even with the 3DS games' slightly less quality writing and story direction, it still maintains the identity and original message of the Trilogy. They still look to this game for its roots, even if they have tried to expand the AA universe in some interesting ways. 

That's what's so amazing about this Trilogy. It established a world, a legacy, for these characters to live and breathe in. The characters in this story are real. They have struggles and triumphs just like all of us. These games have changed the way I see the world and the people around me. I always try to maintain an open mind and think rationally through heated, emotional situations like the game teaches you to. I've learned to become more of a critical thinker, and less reliant on impressions and gut feelings. This game changes you, and you will never see the world the same once you click the next button on the final piece of dialogue. I'm so happy to get to relive this Trilogy again in with such beautiful, clean-looking visuals. They even fixed huge issues that plagued the iOS port, such as the speed of the text and animations, and especially noticeable was how they fixed some of the music differences back to their original states in the DS versions. I blitzed through this game because I had my tonsils removed and I was in the mood for a trip down memory lane. I do not regret one minute of this, and I even got 100% of the achievements, which I highly recommend because there are no other completion requirements if you are a completionist like me. There are even detailed guides for the games in the Guides section for the game if you are stuck and need help with story triggers, contradictions or achievements, which are the three most commonly reported ""stuck points"". I highly recommend trying to get into the game's mindset and figure things out on your own, as it will help with your critical thinking skills and ultimately help you become a better player, but there is no shame if you get super stuck. 

If you want to continue this series after you are done, I recommend playing the series chronologically. That means playing Ace Attorney Investigations 1 and 2 FIRST before Apollo Justice since they are between T&T and AJ. There are many ways to play the later DS games in the series (DS, 3DS, iOS), and both 3DS games (Dual Destinies, which is next after AJ, followed by Spirit of Justice) are available on iOS and 3DS (duh). The Professor Layton crossover is sadly 3DS exclusive, and Investigations 2 has had no official English release. Luckily, there are English Patches online you can apply to legally acquired copies of AAI2. Search up Ace Attorney Investigations 2 English Patch for AAI2. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a duology set a century before the events of the trilogy, and I highly recommend checking out the collection now that it is out on Steam and consoles.

Thank you Ace Attorney for consistently being one of the best game franchises, and I look forward to many more years of Objections and puzzling cases as the Handheld and Consoles merge and technology continues to grow. At least we know Phoenix will always carry around his trusty old-fashioned cellular phone, no matter how crazy mobile devices get.

It took two years actually. I loved the first instalment but was a bit weary of all the brain juice used in searching and reading that I took a break and played other action games. 

My only complaint is that, sometimes the trial dialogue is a bit hidden. 

Example: 
You have 5 statements and you press on every one of them. And you think you had unlocked all dialogue and wonder what you're missing. 

Turns out that you have to press on the 4th statement, and go back to the 2nd statement to press again.

I've finished the first three chapters and currently on the fourth and let me tell you, this game is so fucking worth paying for, even if it's not on sale and you have to buy it for 40$. 

The music is just so good. It has that nostalgic feel, it helps with setting the scenes and it evokes a lot of different emotions from you. But the big part is definitely the story. It keeps you hooked from the very first scene all the way to the very end of the case for each chapter. The detective like gameplay where you try to find clues while talking to people and going to places really keeps your attention. The characters are also just so iconic and unforgettable. Phoenix Wright, Miles Edgeworth, Mia and Maya Fey, the judge and so on. It's a joy to be around them and they each have their own little quirks and surprises.

""[u]Trials and Tribulations[/u]"" - that is the perfect way how to describe Ace Attorney in two words.

[h2][u]Opening Statement[/u][/h2]
[i]Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy[/i] (PW:AAT) is a rerelease of the first three games in the Phoenix Wright series that debut in the early 2000’s. Somehow, I managed to avoid the games in these past two decades and thus I have no nostalgia for the series. All I really knew of the series was “Objection!” and “lol lawyer game”. This is a review from the perspective of someone playing this classic for the first time. I stand before the judge and jury today to make the case for why it is a great game that still holds up today.

[h2][u]Evidence #1: Gameplay [/u][/h2]
PW:AAT is a visual novel with logic and deduction puzzles to navigate through the story. As a visual novel, the game has a lot of text and thus requires the player to do a lot of reading. However, the text is accompanied by various characters, their animations, and beautiful backdrops. It feels more at times like an interactive anime set in a whacky court-room drama and investigations held at the scenes of crime.

That said, this lawyer game does not stand up to scrutiny when cross-examined by actual lawyers. The player has to keep in mind that this is a fictional world, an odd mix of the USA and Japan, that follows its own set of rules for court procedure. In this world, the system is heavily slanted against the defense (a satirical commentary on Japan’s legal system, apparently). As the player is the defense, this is also for the sake of gameplay and challenge. There just wouldn’t be much game nor entertainment if the court was realistic.

Each game is divided into cases; a crime happens and you must defend the prime suspect. After such an opening scene, the case then plays out in alternating phases. During the investigation phase, the player travels from scene to scene to gather clues and talk to witnesses. Then there is the trial phase where the case proceeds to the court room. This is where the game isn’t very realistic but it makes for intriguing gameplay.  Each case starts with the prosecution making their case and they drive the court as they call witnesses and pull never-seen-before evidence out of their asses. It is your job to scrutinize witness testimony. Press them when they are being vague and provide evidence that contradicts their testimony and exposes lies. This is why I suggest the game is more of a logic and deduction puzzle game. Aside from the witness testimony, there are other times where the player is prompted to make choices or provide evidence to paint a scenario of what may have actually happened. 

[h2][u]Evidence #2: Characters[/u][/h2]
This wonderful whacky world has so many interesting characters and really bring the game, and especially the court, to life. At minimum, there is always Phoenix Wright (the player), an assistant, the accused, the judge, and the prosecutor. There are also usually the detective and multiple witnesses to interact with. They are all very much their own characters and have their own personality. 

However, with such variety, the characters are not all winners. Many characters are written with a defining gimmick. If that gimmick falls flat, it’s really hard to recover and the character may just be annoying and grating rather than endearing. For example, one character’s shtick seems to be bringing a whip to the court room and whipping the entire courtroom. It was funny at first, more so due to the others reactions at the absurdity. But the joke would not stop. The game really has a bad habit of beating a dead horse with their jokes sometimes. There is also an uncomfortable amount of other anime tropes like old men perving on women. It’s gross at times.
Objection! Despite those flaws, I still feel there is a net positive of great characters. While there are some characters that fall flat, the ones that remain strong are really good. There is not a single case I dislike even when there was a lot of screentime for a character that got on my nerves. This was largely due to a great story and amazing characters carrying it on their backs. Phoenix Wright himself is a worthy star who grows from an inexperienced rookie lawyer to an attorney on a quest to determine what justice and being a defense attorney really means to him. It’s sort of like an anime coming of age story with a lawyer as the hero.

[h2][u]Evidence #3: Story[/u][/h2]
The trilogy follows Phoenix Wright and his growth as a lawyer. I was pleasantly surprised by how much the games cases and story flowed together. This truly feels like a trilogy and not just three standalone games. Yet they could easily be played on their own as well. I recommend playing the games in order for the best flow.

The first case always acts as a tutorial and is both shorter and easier to solve. In the middle are cases designed to either foreshadow or hint future overall plot development for the game or even the whole trilogy – or to build up character development for the same reason. The final case of each game is truly remarkable. If ever the game feels tiring due to an obnoxious character, it’s worth pushing on to the final case. They are that good and still resonate with me even after finishing the games.

One minor gripe is the over-use of flashbacks. Even the game made fun of itself at one point when a character asked, “Do you remember when X” and the witness replied, “yes, it was five minutes ago.” This might be a fault of myself binging through the series but it was annoying at times to be constantly reminded of past cases or events that were still fresh on my mind.

Objection! That said, the use of flashbacks is still also nice as it really highlights how much the various events and cases throughout the series interweave with one another to make an overarching narrative for the whole trilogy. The third game is especially heavy on story with a fantastic finish that left me satisfied with the ending.

[h2][u]Kudos[/u][/h2]
- Can save pretty much anytime
- Great characters and developments
- Super fun mysteries to figure out

[h2][u]Case Summary[/u][/h2]
This is three games in one which is already great value for the price. If you’re a fan of visual novels at all, or if an interactive anime with murder mysteries sounds fun, then this is definitely a game for you. If you do not like reading and crave intense action experience, then this should be avoided. That said – this game does get tense when you get into the story. After playing this game you will feel like you’re ready for law school. You won’t be, because its not realistic at all. But it’s the heart that counts. And this game is full of it. Absolutely love it and I sincerely hope the sequels come to Steam next. After all, a lawyer only cries once it’s all over, and I’m not out of tears yet.",1655239897,1655240095,True,84,3,0.882921099662780762,1,True,False,False

The collection contains the first three original games from the Nintendo DS, each containing about four to five chapters. The games being ""Ace Attorney"", ""Justice for All"", and ""Trials and Tribulations"".  You work your way through court proceedings, attempting to discern fact from fib, uncover evidence from the scene of the crime, question witness testimonies, and most importantly, uncover the truth of what really happened. 

The only real complaint I have is that the solutions for some of the puzzles are truly headscratching. A majority of the time, you're not expected to remember any fine details, and anything you do need to know/remember is logged in the Court Record for your convinence. But even then, some of the solutions present in some of the trials felt a little far fetched for my logic. As a result, save scumming until I eventually just brute forced the right answer occured a few times. Thankfully this seemed to be an exception, as for the most part I've been able to make educated guesses to narrow down the possible options. And when you suddenly get a flash of realization, it's one of the biggest dopamine hits you can get.

The trilogy is well worth the full price (it goes on sale frequently too!) There's dozens of hours worth of game here, provided you rely on a bare minimum of guides/help from friends. 

If you play the first game and like it, I highly recommend playing the other two. I see people leaving reviews and they've only experienced the first game.

The first time I was interested in this game is because of Amber Heard & Johnny Depp's case, I was itching to play pretend as a lawyer. And I love to find faults in people.

Truth to be told, I was not a big fan of Visual Novel games since I tend to get bored easily. In my opinion, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy has a retro game charm and the fun mechanics that prevents the game to become stale, and actually, I don't mind to read at all for this game. It's fun to question people's judgement and try to find their faults. Although for some parts, the conversation and the game play can become a tad bit repetitive. 

But despite all of that, I really love how this game manage to balance out the fun things to do like investigations and collecting evidences between all the readings.",1654281795,1654281795,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

However, I would like to state that this trilogy is one of the greatest virtual storytelling experiences I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I will divide this review into four parts: the good, the neutral, the bad, and the important.

The good:

The stories themselves, especially the looming, overarching story of the Fey clan, are overall really solid. I genuinely like most of the characters, and while the settings are not super memorable, I find that even most of the only tolerable characters bring something to the table that increases my enjoyment of the games. However, all of this pales in comparison to the sheer emotional impact of this series. I've cried, I've laughed, I've cheered, I've raged, I've held my breath for fear of something terrible, I've done it all. If you like a game that genuinely makes you care about certain characters, and want to feel everything the protagonist does, then look no further than this game,

The game is divided into two types of gameplay: the investigation phases, and the trials. The trials are overwhelmingly where the heart and soul of the games lie. The gameplay loop of pressing the witnesses for more information and then presenting evidence to destroy their case is just too satisfying for its own good. I eventually found myself audibly shouting at the screen in triumph when I'd finally get a witness cornered.

I cannot talk about this trilogy without singing the praises of the soundtrack. Keep in mind that the first game released in 2001 for a handheld device. Despite this, the soundtrack of this trilogy manages to carry the exact amount of weight, positive and negative, that makes this trilogy really shine.

The neutral:

The investigation phases were not nearly as fun as the trials. Yes, important story beats happen, and I appreciate some things that happen during them, but I found more than anything that the story made up for the gameplay, which consists of searching locations for evidence, talking to characters, presenting evidence to the characters for more information, and, in the last two games, pressing characters for confessions. I think CAPCOM realized that the first game needed more during the investigation scenes, so they added something to make them more interesting. The main thing is, the story makes or breaks the investigation. Some investigations were somewhat tedious to get through simply because the cases were not as interesting, and other investigations held some of the biggest heart and soul of the story. Overall, they're a part of the game, and YMMV.

The bad:

So, the game sets up expectations for certain logic scenarios to behave certain ways, then it defies them in ways that don't make sense at all in the second game. Additionally, sometimes, you might have the right idea for a contradiction, but the game will not allow you to present this contradiction in the way that makes the most sense to you, or sometimes it might be presented too early to be accepted as part of the story.

Additionally, sometimes there are parts of certain stories where some logic just... doesn't flow. The story is strong enough that you might not notice it on your first playthrough, but still.

I must also say that the replay value is pretty low. Basically, once the story is given, you know how things will go. I guess if you go long enough that you forget the puzzles, then you'll be fine, but still.

The important:

Some parts of this game involve some situations that are a little... uncomfortable, if you think about them. This primarily comes into play thanks to the usage of something known as (minor spoilers ahead) [spoiler] the Kurain Channeling Technique, a spirit channeling technique where the medium channeling takes on both the spirit and the overall physical form of the deceased, while remaining themselves. At some point, this involves a young child taking on the appearance of a large-chested woman, in clothes that are child-sized, leaving the character in a rather revealing outfit. The game treats this character as the deceased person being channeled, but thanks to the explanation of this technique, there is no mistaking the fact that it is a child. Thankfully, no weird comments are made about either character when this happens, but it's still not something to feel super comfy about. [/spoiler] TL:DR; there exists a part where a kid looks uncomfortably like an adult, drawn in such a way that it seems a little sus.

The game does deal with murder cases, but it also does deal with mental health and suicide at times. The actual moments of death are not shown, only corpses in photographs or occasionally cutscenes. Be advised that some parts of this game are heavily tragic, and while most cases end on a positive note, the road to the end is not an easy one.

Verdict:

Though there are some flaws, and some aspects of the trilogy that make it certainly not for everyone, I maintain that anyone who can play these games really should, especially if they are wanting something rich in story and suspense. The characters, music, and delightfully mind-bending cases more than make up for the faults of the game. My suggestion? Play the first case in game one, and you will get a good feel for whether you will like the game or not.

Sometimes it can be a bit of a stretch to figure out which piece of evidence you need to use on what specific line of a testimony, or what specific dialogue option you need to chose to advance the day, but it makes you feel like a gigabrained genius when you put the pieces together and have everything click.

it is both very relaxing and intriguing and it makes you want to keep pushing through the story.

the game loop is composed of 2 parts - investigation/story which is like an interactive visual novel where you move between scenes talk to people and gather clues; and the courtroom, which have a higher intensity to it, where you need to poke at witnesses' testimonies and point out contradiction using evidence. it can actually be quite challenging at times, and very very satisfying once you figure out that sneaky contradiction.

The story is really interesting albeit very weird at times. But that's kinda the point, the series doesn't take itself too seriously after all. I highly recommend playing this series if you like visual novels and murder mysteries.

Edit: I've finished the game and I can safely say that I had a blast with it for the most part. The story had a bunch of plot twists and was overall really gripping. The only critique I have would be that I felt very lost at times, especially during investigations since the game only 'progresses' if you have already done a bunch of things beforehand (gather clues, ask people, show said clues to people). A walkthrough easily helped with this issue as I didn't feel like it took any of my enjoyment away with the game.

If you are looking for a visual novel to play and you like mystery and crime, don't hesitate to give this title a try!",1604350110,1653552957,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also if you, like me, have a compulsion to look at EVERYTHING, there's a lot of great easter egg-like bits. So much heart and emotion from what could have easily been simply a courtroom strategy game. Buy this game, you won't regret a single penny. Since I take my time, as I'm writing this I'm about a third of the way through the second game and am already at 34 hours of gameplay, so it's a lot of bang for your buck.

Maybe I didn't understand it or it's just not for me, but yet:
- Odd, dry plot and game mechanics (Danganronpa did it better)
- Boring characters who you don't feel nothing about
- Lazy introduction, you don't understand anything and you're given not enough necessary information, you basically guess what the game wants you to do and show the exact evidence at the exact time, even if there are also other obvious contradictions
- High price, low quality
- Mid graphics
- The worst visual novel I've ever read

This game doesn't take itself too seriously, at least from what I've played, but the storylines for the cases are still solid enough to keep you enticed and motivate the player to pay attention to the details. Very rarely do the cases outstay their welcome since tension constantly rises, new evidence and perspectives pop up throughout the episodes, and the charm and dialogue of each of the characters keeps it engaging. They pulled it off really well in T&T, with the final case wrapping up a lot of loose ends for the characters and gave the trilogy a pretty satisfying ending. The actual courtroom debate portion of the game is actually quite straightforward, at least from what I've played, and you're usually not required to remember anything that's not in the court record. It's a fun, logical, and not overly-complex system, which I like because it lets pinheads such as myself make mistakes and forget multiple things, while at the same time still requires you to make logical connections instead of pure guesswork. Sometimes this isn't the case though, and this is where I think the games start to show their weakness, and it's especially prevalent in JFA. There's multiple things to point out but only one thing is the right answer to progress through the linear story, which obviously sucks and forces you into either savescumming or using a walkthrough to see ""the right"" evidence. Also the games punish you WAAAAYYYY too hard for presenting wrong evidence, even in longer trials and the obviously tougher sections! I mean, 5 chances for the entire trial? You're just begging your players to cheat and savescum at that point! Most of the time it isn't like this, but when it is like this it just makes the game drag HARD, and if you eventually find the solution by yourself it rarely feels rewarding, you either feel stupid for not knowing or resentful at the game for the solution being ridiculous.

Overall very good, definitely worth the purchase. I think the first one is the best as its cases were the most consistently good and it had some of the most charming and memorable characters IMO. It also doesn't overload you with information and evidence (aside from episode 5 which sticks out like a sore thumb because of how long it is) which I think definitely works the best with the harsh penalty system. JFA and T&T were also good, but I felt some cases outstayed their welcome a bit, namely episode 3 in JFA and episode 2 in T&T, and they also started overloading the player with evidence. As a whole though, it's definitely a great trilogy of games and a worthwhile experience.",1651184758,1652522038,True,8,1,0.570397019386291504,0,True,False,False

Because of this, I didn't feel like I was really solving or going into the mind game of if my client was telling me the truth because I knew what happened. Granted this wasn't all cases and one case really had a twist about the usual formula but it did kill the vibe of solving things. 

The characters were delightful and charming, even though I still refuse to believe that a detective could give out so much evidence in a real world but you know, its a game.

I don't know why but I wasn't expecting a lot going in, I suppose I should have been since it's a game of such legendary stature. Anyway, my lack of expectation was misplaced. The first game at least, is fantastic. 

Is it at all accurate to actual court proceedings? Absolutely not. Are there a TON of plot contrivances and unnecessary drama? Yes, the whole basis of having to catch the actual killer to prove your clients innocence is so ridiculous, basically the whole premise is a contrivance and unnecessary drama.

That being said, it's beautiful. When this game really gets going I'm audibly shouting and freaking out in front my computer screen. It's very ""hype"", as one might say. When the pieces slide together, and the music kicks in, and you know exactly what piece of evidence to submit to prove everything!... Well, there just isn't anything like it. 

I'd criticize the game for it's lack of real ""gameplay""; there are very few points where you actually have choice in the plot, at least for the first game in the trilogy, but the interactive element is where all the excitement is derived from. 

Basically, the fact that you have to follow (at least to some extent) what's happening and submit the evidence yourself makes sure that you're in on the excitement. So if you get stumped somewhere, unlike a non-interactive medium where Phoenix might reveal the plot and you go ""ohh, that makes sense, I'm an idiot"" and leave unsatisfied, you have to solve the puzzle. When it does click in your brain, you can't submit that evidence fast enough. I'm practically salivating waiting for the prosecutor to shut their yap so I can deal the finishing blow with a... damaged vacuum cleaner or something.

The only thing I can say to it's detriment is that it takes a little time to get on the game's wavelength. I actually had to look up a guide in the second chapter for a few of the evidence submissions. It wasn't that I didn't understand the contradiction, I just wasn't sure how to submit evidence in a way that would tell the game what I was getting at. The evidence system can be a little bit contrived and even if you see a contradiction you can't always point it out until the preset moment that it's been written into the plot to be exposed. I haven't had to look anything up since though, as I understand now typically what the game expects from me and that sometimes it will require me to submit the same evidence multiple times even for something we JUST went over, which I was shying away from at first thinking it was ""too obvious"". Sometimes the game is just giving you additional prompts for the sake of giving you additional prompts when there really needn't be any. Trust your gut though and you'll figure out what the game wants from you, try not to overthink it like I did.

Anyway, other than that, it's been all good. Now that I better understand the way the developers tend to think and structure the trials, I've been able to breeze through pretty well, even when I don't fully grasp a line of inquiry, I can usually use context to figure out what I'm supposed to be presenting.

Sometimes it's a little frustrating because I know what point needs to be made with a certain piece of evidence but you have to pull up a related, but different, piece of evidence to get there, but that's more on my lack of patience than the game itself.

The first episodes (1-4) make it more tedious to use/collect evidence because unlike in episode 5 you kinda just pick up the evidence and are given a flat description rather than being able to look over it as a 3D object BUT that part is also a remake of the games from like.. 2001 so you can't really be too upset about it.

The minor complaints aside, I love the sprites and art, and the story telling in the game is A++. I love Phoenix and Edgeworth and all the characters, I literally can't get enough of them lol.

I remember originally picking up this series on the Nintendo DS mostly because I thought I should probably branch out and play other games that are not Pokemon, AND it had been rec'd by my friends and internet strangers (the good ol' days of the mid-2000's....)

I was skeptical at first: how fun can a game about LAWYERS (?!?!) be? But I quickly became obsessed. I've played and replayed these games, I've ranted and raved to friends until they gave in to also play these games. Capcom has probably gotten an inordinate amount of my money because I will buy this game for those who are skeptical about how fun a game about LAWYERS (??!?!) can be! I still come back to this series periodically, even 15 years after I first clicked that Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney card into my broken, floppy DS lite. 

It's fun, sometimes the logic can be dubious at best (and this is part of the reason why it really excels at replay-ability, like, how did I even get to that conclusion in the first place?!!?) It's hilarious, it's heartfelt, there's stepladders....

There are so many lovable and fun characters with interesting backstories, arcs, and symbolism (ahem ahem love me some good character foils). That being said, I wasn't expecting so many minor characters to reoccur in various cases, which was a pleasant surprise. I especially enjoyed watching the larger story at hand unravel as events from different cases throughout the trilogy came together to form a domino effect. It's like you're filling out a puzzle, yet as you step away from it, you realise there's a larger puzzle to complete, and this puzzle you were just working on was just a small piece of it. 

For the most part, the episodes are really interesting (except for turnabout big top, i want to scrub that from my memory), although i think for some players they may not enjoy the point and click aspect of investigating which can seem tedious. I don't really have any major gripes with the trilogy, the soundtrack is great, I really enjoy the game-play, the story lines, and the characters, so I definitely recommend it. :)

- It swung over like a pendulum?
- This photo of the killer is actually the victim?
- The prosecutor is the real killer?
- The prosecution wants to help you prolong the trial?
- The witness is projecting his clumsiness and sorrow onto the victim?
- The camera was set up with a timer hours ahead of time?
- The object thinks the time?
- This witness's alibi is committing another crime?
- This isn't the guy, but also is, but not really, out of his sheer desire to be the guy?
- Every witness is in cahoots with one another to protect her?
- The motive is similar to Ottoman Empire fratricide?
- The witness isn't crazy and the killer actually flew away?
- You don't know your occupation?
- You just ate the evidence?
- One case caused the biggest butterfly effect in history, making sure almost all of the above happened?

If you enjoy coming up with crackpot theories as to why things are the way they are, be prepared to have a bunker full of supplies because you won't be outside for a month minimum. If you're not in Alex Jones territory, only Seymour Skinner/Maya Fey territory, ditto.

If you would regardless enjoy a linear story with thrilling murder mysteries, a colorful cast worth bonding to and crying for (in both directions), and a soundtrack that perfectly sets the mood each scene, you've hit the jackpot. 

At the very least, buy this for your mother. May not be as realistic or British as what they have on PBS, but it beats anything on the app store... except for the other Ace Attorney games, of course!

This game will make you want to cry from the emotional intensity of some situations and then it will make you cry from laughing so hard seconds later. This game is so fun it's unreal. Often times games can feel like a chore or work but this game is a true pleasure from start to finish. In a bad mood? No worries, sounds like it's time for you to solve another case with Phoenix Wright to put a smile on your face.

This trilogy contains the first 3 games in one convenient package, and everything works pretty well. 

The game itself is an adventure game with the trappings of a courtroom drama, but really everything is pretty much on rails, and your choices don't matter a whole lot. Even when it comes to issues of murder and revenge, the game never takes itself too seriously. Good thing too, since the episodic plots are really stupid, and mostly just played for laughs. 

My only real issue that I've noticed in the first game so far is that this game stretches the idea of ""logic"" REALLY far sometimes, and some of the contradictions you are asked to find aren't contradictions at all. It is the age old problem of point and click games, where you have to sort of predict how something in your inventory, or an available dialogue option with be interpreted by the game, thus moving the plot forward. And when all else fails, just use every item and click on everything. 

All in all, these games don't really hold a candle to the classic lucasarts adventure games, nor to their handheld contemporaries like 999 or Hotel Dusk. However, the Ace Attorney games are still pretty entertaining, all told, and definitely beat the pants off of modern trial-themed games like Danganrompa.

Just keep thinking even if it takes you 20 minutes and you'll eventually figure it out. But really, the gameplay is only half of what makes this game so good - the story and characters are what just bring it to that next level. 

5/5, highly recommend. Well, besides turnabout bigtop.",1645168519,1645168519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is it better than the newer AA:C? Nope, not saying that.  I'm just saying you should buy PW:AAT first.  

Have you watched the trailers but you are still unsure?  Allow me to try to convince you.  You play as a brand new attorney, Phoenix Wright, who winds up with a small number of regulars plus a healthy dose of new and recycled characters who help you (or don't help you) solve a case through investigation and then discovery of facts during the trial.  The humor is very much of Japanese style, which is to say that it's pretty funny, and the translation company did quite a good job of porting the dialogue into English.

It should go with saying that you need to be able to suspend your belief in how the court system should work.  Your defense cases go to trial on the day after the crime is committed (yes, that right... the day after they are committed), the judge is easily influenced by everyone (the sadist prosecutors and the obviously conniving witnesses) except for you, and there is a spirit medium that physically conjures your boss from the grave from time to time.

Don't let that scare you, though.  This game is really good.  Each story line is clever, and if you are patient enough, you can interact certain places that are present in nearly every episode and enjoy clever little pieces of dialogue that change every day.  Did I mention the humor?  The story is cleverly written and even worth investing in a little bit emotionally.  Honestly, I cried a couple of times, and you wouldn't think that the animation style here points toward a story like that, but it can and does.

It's going to take you more time to play through this than you think it might, but the good news is that you can save practically anywhere... and that reminds, the old adage is in effect here: save well, save often.  You will keep yourself from having to start way back somewhere when you realize that you are out of chances to make good decisions and need to reload.

Also, keep a good walkthrough handy on your cellphone.  While perhaps you aren't the type to skip ahead, there is the occasional place where you know what's going on, but you can't seem to present the right piece of evidence in the right place.  Or perhaps you can't move the story forward because you forgot one little important thing that wasn't obvious to you at the time.

If I haven't scared you away yet, please let me convince you that it is worth your hard-earned dollars to play PW:AAT.  Use your deduction skills to piece the real events together.  Enjoy every humorous moment.  Revel in the little easter eggs that the devs placed in the game.  Take in the nuance of each well-written story.  And enjoy some of the best characters that gaming has to offer.",1644893778,1644893778,True,79,2,0.836675107479095459,0,True,False,False

For those who don't know, Ace Attorney is a visual novel series where you play as incredibly well-meaning yet bumbling DA Phoenix Wright who finds himself defending a menagerie of odd clients from false murder accusations and it's up to you to find the true culprit in order to save someone from an undeserved punishment. This takes the form of point-and-click investigation segments where you examine scenes for evidence and try to interrogate a huge number of unique, insanely diverse characters to get more information from them, as well as the famed courtroom segments where you have to use logical deductions to find contradictions in witness testimonies and then expose any lies with your stockpile of evidence. While this does not sound engaging to many, trust me when I say the 80+ hour playtime I had is from ONE playthrough of the three games minus some trial and error. The series' major strengths are its dynamic storytelling, excellent characters and presentation that still holds up despite these games originally being Game Boy Advance titles!

In terms of the ""trilogy"" aspect, this is a compilation of the first three games in the series with very minor changes. One complaint some have had is replacing the original games' sprite work with a more ink-and-paint style but I actually disagree. I think the new, polished look does a fantastic job maintaining the original likenesses and keeping the expressive animations while also looking cleaner and more refined. I will admit not putting an option to restore the original pixels was a minor mistake.

As for the games themselves? In each game, you play through a total of 14 cinematic stories that balance a running plot with the individual crimes that does a masterful job building the world, the characters and is all supplemented by the glossy presentation, magnificent music (all lifted directly from the original games) writing that somehow manages to balance amazing comedy, heart-wrenching suspense, genuine terror from the gruesome crimes (Even if the games are originally rated T, they do not shy away that these are MURDER cases) that amounts to such an immersive experience that will make you feel like you love the heroes, despise many of the villains, and wish to see more of this eccentric world full of objections and psyche-locks.

Ace Attorney, is one of the best AVG games I have played.

This game is so classical. GBA, NDS, 3DS, bring me back to 15 years ago. This time, the HD remastered gives me another chance to experience this game once again-although CAPCOM always likes to do porting.

I do not want to talk about the story, spoiler will ruin your game experience. The story of this game is no doubt impressive; the music also makes you feel very good.

Along with having an intriguing story, charming characters, and excellent music, AA is also among the few novels with extensive opportunity for gameplay engagement. You get to solve the mysteries yourself, and the trial system is particularly challenging compared to similar games like Danganronpa or Your Turn To Die. Even if you usually don't like to read a lot, I think that the point-and-click format of AA can really get new players into the genre, and they may have to practice or consult walkthroughs for difficult puzzles. 

In this collection, you get 3 games; all remade from the Nintendo handheld editions to have vastly improved art and animations. As complete products, they also come with the bonuses such as an extra episode in the first instalment. That said, each game is only about 10 hours or so, so it doesn't require a huge investment to see the entire original plot. Even if you choose to only play one or two, you'll receive great experiences as stand-alone titles, but each new edition stretches the limit of the genre and continues to innovate. I was amazed that even when I was doing ""Trials and Tribulations,"" the third game, I was still shocked by the twists and how you have to use evidence and reasoning. The clues, foreshadowing, and rationality involved for each mystery rivals the quality of traditional novels, but it also presents things one step at a time so you don't get lost or have to figure everything out immediately. 

The real appeal, however, is that Ace Attorney is just a really cool series, with lots of memorable events and characters. Pretty much anyone who plays visual novels will recall every name from this series, and its style is entirely its own. If that wasn't enough, it's also really funny, and does a ton without needing voice accompaniment. I usually didn't find myself ever bored during the investigation period because every person I met in-game was immediately likeable in being wacky and hard to predict. This translated really well to the trials as well with deep prosecutor relationships and hilarious sections involving witness testimony and argument. Few books I've ever read had characters done this well, and it's an unforgettable experience. You really don't want to miss out on Ace Attorney, even if you're hesitant about getting into VNs for the first time.",1642960605,1642960605,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is a visual novel / detective game. You alternate investigations with trials, and the story advances by asking people about the clues and spotting / confronting contradictions in the testimony. The trilogy provides good value for the money, with 14 cases over three games offering 90+ hours of reading/gameplay. 

Several minor / moderate criticisms give the ""but"" part of the rating. First, the characters (especially the judge) are obtuse enough that instead of a single contradiction [fictitious for this review] ""Look at the date on this photo -- it's the day BEFORE the crime so this doesn't show the suspect fleeing the scene at all"" we instead get a three way extended conversation about ""Look at this photo"" ""what about it?"" ""Look at the date!"" ""January 6, so what?"" ""But don't you remember the date of the crime?"" ""That was January 7th, don't you remember?"" ..............

Related to the above, there are some cases where I knew of the story the instant I was handed a clue (so continue the imaginary example above, suppose I immediately saw the photo date). But there is absolutely no game mechanic to express that fact until the appropriate point in the story. I have to wait for a witness to testify to something that I can present the photo as a contradiction. Even if other characters are directly referencing the bogus photo, I can't explain the clue I found until the appropriate place.

And something that bothered me more than perhaps it should -- this is the least accurate trial simulator on the planet. It's absolutely ridiculous that I prove a witness is lying about the their testimony 4 times in a row only to be told I must do it a fifth time or my client will be convicted. Several times when I'm sure the game was trying to for a ""back against the wall last ditch effort"" effect which instead came across as ""You've GOT to be joking"". 

And a final nitpick: If you binge all three games / 14 cases in a row like I did, then you start to see a bit too much of the formula. By the end of the game I wasn't even slightly surprised that --- yet again -- my clients fingerprints were on the murder weapom and a witness of impeccable integrity was prepared to swear they saw my client commit the crime. 

It seems like I've spent a lot of the review dwelling on the negatives. Truth be told there aren't very many games that attempt what this one does. If you can get past the ""No court on Earth is run this way"" aspects, and don't penalize it for including 14 episodes in one pack, the set does have interesting stories, and it was fun to play detective and scan the dozen+ clues again looking for the one thing that shows the witness could not possibly have seen what they just swore they did see.",1642549384,1642549536,True,1,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

The cross-examination I watched was ridiculous (no spoilers) but I couldn't help but see if it was possible for me to play this game. Lo and behold I found out it was available on Steam.

Here we are two weeks later. I was hooked right from the beginning: the characters, the contradictions, the OBJECTION!s, it kept me so involved. I never thought I was one for puzzle types or visual novel type games, but Ace Attorney proved me wrong. Each time I found new evidence, met a new person, I HAD to keep playing. These games do an incredible job of leading you on in the cases: you learn more, little by little, and you can start to piece it together. And then when you finally realize the truth, it's an incredible sensation. 

Simply put: I recommend this trilogy. If you've ever heard anything at all from anyone you know saying Ace Attorney is worth a play, believe them. Like I said, I thought this genre wouldn't be for me, but I must say, that idea was thoroughly turned around on its head. I'm hoping that Capcom remasters and releases more of the past games so that folks like me can enjoy them for the first time.

Originally released in 2001 for GBA, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is most definitely one, if not, the best game of visual novel genre. Story-wise, it's very enjoyable due to its mystery, comical, and fun nature. Not only from the reactions of the characters, the choices that can be picked is also hysterical, not mentioning some references used and Easter eggs inside of the game too. I highly recommend finishing the game completely since it will reveal many hilarious conversations. One thing that I would love to have in this game is the ability to use the microphone to press and object during the cross-examination, just like the DS version.

[b] Well done Capcom for releasing this HD version. It is one of the best game I ever played [i] (since I like deductive games with some thinking)[/i], and you probably too. [/b]",1642056609,1642056745,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only points that did make some parts a bit off-putting was at times providing evidence and where appropriate in the courtroom in some cases; because there were by logic times where you could have presented x evidence at x statement or even have either x or y evidence presented where appropriate, but threw me off big time when I cross checked with community walk-throughs when I got really stuck, there were two distinct times in Trials and Tribulations and I think once or twice in Justice for All that this happened to me. Also I did feel the merging of the Psyche-Locks and the Penalty bar from the second game onwards was a little odd as well.

It might also be like a one-off experience as well given the nature of the game, but it's still worth experiencing. I wonder if the games following this trilogy for Phoenix Wright will appear on PC...",1641538576,1641538576,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The concept is cool, the writing is awesome and the characters are fun. That being said, I'm a bit disappointed about how linear the game is. Cases can only be solved in one way, and it's not always possible to follow through on a logical line of questioning. Solutions are sometimes that you need to present evidence when there is no real reason for you to do so, while presented evidence that actually has bearing is sometimes dismissed by the judge because you presented it too early. When searching for evidence in investigations, I got stuck multiple times because I spoke to witnesses in the wrong order, which prevents other witnesses or events from appearing. 

Also, I pray to God that the justice system in de US doesn't actually work like this. Convicting a falsely accused defendant because the judge is annoyed with the defence attorney seems rather worrying.",1641461113,1641461113,False,1,0,0.471705496311187744,0,True,False,False

[h2]As a game (or a trilogy of games), it gets a 7/10[/h2]

It has so much heart, funny moments, and genuinely satisfying detective-style puzzle moments that it's really a delightful experience overall. There are some minor inconsistencies which detract from the overall story a little bit, sometimes the player will figure something out before the character can, and it's setting is a little muddled by taking place in both Japan and America at the same time. There's also the ever-present issue in a lot of anime-inspired media I like to call ""GOD DAMN IT JAPAN!"" of having adult characters try to get in relationships (and even sometimes marry) underage characters, including one example where a 20 year old is in a relationship with a 14 year old, and another where a 30 year old and a 25 year old both propose to a 16 year old. The biggest issue, however, is that there are a lot of moments where the player may well know what's wrong but be unsure of how to communicate the issue in a way the game accepts, sometimes it pays to have a guide open just to figure out individual moments if you get stuck. Still, none of the issues are enough to detract from the game's joys in my eyes and it's still a very compelling story.

[h2]As a port, it gets a 5/10[/h2]

Don't get me wrong, this is absolutely the best way to play the game on PC, the art is high res and you get the full experience the developers intended, however, in the credits there was one person listed as a translator and one person listed as a proofreader. The translator did really well in most instances, with only a few moments seeming weak or poorly translated (for example, suddenly having a character snap to the ""anger"" pose even though nothing prompted it, and then a weak attempt to justify it by having Phoenix think ""I don't even know what you're angry about""),  but the biggest critique is on the part of the proofreader. There are a lot of minor problems and two or three egregious grammatical typos that made no sense at all, which really shouldn't have even gotten past an automatic proofreader/spell checker. Furthermore there are a couple of major typos which make the hard to parse and interupt your flow (one notable example having the game say ""on one"" when they clearly meant ""no one"", it sounds just plausible enough that you have to re-read to make sure you're not misinterpreting what they're saying). There are also some signs that aren't translated at all and still show up in japanese, some sprites too, but I don't really fault them for that since it would be so difficult to make entirely new art just for those occasions. Still though, feels really sloppy to include mistakes that any professional spell-checking software could have pointed out to you, Capcom really dropping the ball on this one.



Overall I'm still going to give it a recommend since it's a pretty good time if you haven't played them before, just be warned it's 80% visual novel, 10% point-and-click, and 10% detective gameplay. Obviously if that isn't your style you might want to take a pass on this.",1640772977,1640772977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An outstanding trilogy. Every game in it are absolutely masterpieces. 

The first one introducing us to the world, ending with an amazing final case. The bonus case is a bit mixed, although its still a really good case.

 The second game introducing us to pearl, maya's cousin. This game is considered the worst of the trilogy, but i still love it. Yes, turnabout big top is the worst case in the trilogy but still has an amazing story, with the final case of the game being a tense emotional suspense filled case, one of the best in the series.

The third game, considered the best, expands upon the world greatly introducing us to dahlia, the main villain of the game and phoenix's ex. The finale to the third game is an amazing send off to the series, as it was originally supposed to be the last game.

Theres also third case syndrome for each of these, where the third cases are considered filler, although i would entirety disagree for turnabout samurai as the steel samurai is a reoccurring thing in the series and set up case 4 of the second game.

The music for this is outstanding too, as much as i would like to go over each and every song i probably shouldn't.

This trilogy is amazing, 9/10 buy it",1609565190,1640404428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not very fond of narrative heavy games with no action or complex gameplay. But this is the exception that proves the rule for me. The perfect example of how less is more. That you can have a great game with just a handful of static backgrounds and a few very funny character animations. All you need are compelling (and a bit over-the-top) characters and stories, and a matching soundtrack. The battles of wits, when that music suddenly changes, really feel like trading blows in a Dark Soul boss fight, they will make your blood rush. 

If you enjoy detective stories or are old enough to have watched Perry Mason, this is the game.

A lawyer simulation that will take you on an unforgettable journey. It's got everything, weeb as fuck stuff for everyone, cool story, waifus, sexual jokes and innuendos all over the place, strong alpha male power and deep homosexual Naruto/Sasuke rivalry. Funny, driving, interesting gameplay,incredible and iconic soundtracks. It even has a iceberg theory of lore. 

YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT.

But enough with the less serious stuff.

For real, the Ace Attorney Collection is a PC port of the 3 Gyakuten Saiban games released on GBA then Nintendo DS (and Wii ect). 3 Games, over 50 hours of gameplay depending on how you play. Definitely worth the 30 bucks. 
It's a point and click game with puzzle solving and witness cracking. It might give you a weird desire to venture into a courtroom and just trial the shit out of a witness, why ? Simply because Ace Attorney teaches you the very basic rule about trials and justice: EVERYBODY LIES.
Anyway, as you can see, there's no way to talk about this game seriously, but we should, because it's a 10/10.
This game also acts as a weird cure if you're depressed.

The way I found about it was from memes on Youtube (Objection.lol) and was intrigued by the presentation, to which I discovered to be an anime series to then finally learning it was a game way back in the 2000s. It was only available with Nintendo systems like the Nintendo DS, but at that time and even today, I absolutely hate the company and the way they are, so any property of Nintendo I avoid like the plague and as far as I'm concerned doesn't exist, which is a shame because I'm sure I'm missing out on some great IPs. 

But here it is, on steam ready and available and on sale, with at this time of review of an 'overwhelmingly positive' review. The game is different from anything I've played before. Conduct an investigation, then fight with words in court, present evidence which contradicts what someone said, press for more information which could help your case. Roughly 70 hours and a couple of months it took me to beat this series, and I'm glad I did. Ace Attorney is a really special series and deserves to be popular. 

Now, if you play the game and plan to be a lawyer after this, don't. The realism level and how things actually are is almost non-existent in both terms of the cases themselves and how a court of law functions. It's more on the level of fantasy which is fine, but don't expect to become an Ace Attorney yourself. Enjoy it for what it is and it's amazing. 

*A small warning. Below there are minor spoilers about the game, but nothing about the plot itself* 

I did find near the end the game getting stale, it's a very similar format and structure with almost all the cases. First conduct investigation, then your a defence attorney, saving to client in what seems like an impossible task to then just putting just enough of a doubt to conduct another investigation finding more clues and new witness to then being a defence attorney again to then again put enough doubt to sometimes force another investigation then go back to court but this time turn your a prosecutor (while still being a defence attorney) against the last witness which typically is the one that ended up doing the crime. There were differences here and there but the overall format is pretty much the same, and near the end I was pretty much done with it. I'm never one to ask for less content in a game, but I feel with Ace Attorney, they very easily could have skipped a few cases and it would have been fine and would have had no recourse for the main plot. 

It did drive me nuts at times because I knew what was happening or going on, but yet, the game is look for very specific piece of evidence at very specific times of the conversation even though what I present was fine and would have work. I can't fault it too much obviously it is a game and has its limitations, but the game is very, very linear. I feel they could have at least opened it up just a tad more in terms of options. There is only one way to play. After completing the game, I have little desire to play anymore. Seen it, been there, done that, but very glad I had!

It's by no means a perfect game, it has -many- plot holes and flaws, but it's still very good and a breath of fresh air different kind of game. I'll take this over any modern FPS any day.",1639233038,1639233038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a kind of adventure based around ""trial simulation"" (yes, justice trials, if you haven't noticed) and there are also investigation stages that are mostly point and click and dialogue.

After playing Spirit of Justice on the 3DS, which is a really good game, I could play them all day, but you have to wonder if you would, too. It's a well-known franchise but it might not be for you.

The writing, the characters, the music, the artwork, everything is made SO meticulously.

Small things like that just make this game a 10/10 from me.

Plus this game actually requires some critical thinking and deductive skills, and watching the prosecution and witnesses squirm when you unravel their ""airtight"" alibi or evidence is so satisfying.

The Ace Attorney games has survived the test of time for a reason; the mysterious characters, suspenseful trials and the Investigation that constantly has you change your guesses are what make this game a masterpiece. 

The abundance of characters armed with their own unique agendas and motives makes each case exhilarating to unravel, quality that is matched with the complex story lines that build on each other in a satisfying way (The third game in particular). The quirky characters and the interactions/dialogues shared between them is, for me, the highlight of the games that kept me engaged throughout. Apart from the obvious peaks of game-play found in the trials, finding out how certain characters feel about other characters or how they interpret certain scenarios made investigating not feel like such a chore. I won't go into any specifics but the mysteries and the explanations are top-notch to say the least; the game is not overly difficult- but every contradiction you find definitely gives you a great sense of accomplishment.

The Ace Attorney court is a place of amazing revelations, satisfying breakdowns, emotional conclusions and even some quality back and forth banter. I recommend this game to anyone with a functioning brain. :}",1636449922,1636449922,True,48,0,0.823466300964355469,0,True,False,False

I did not expect the overly-meme'd defense attorney simulator to actually change my emotion so much. I found myself pointing my finger at my monitor almost jumping in excitement from the raw hit of dopamine you get when you figure out a clue or notice a contradiction in the testimonies. It's so masterfully written and the developers did a great job hiding information from you while at the same time making it obvious your client wasn't the murderer, making it all the more interesting when you find a new clue and connect the dots before even Phoenix figures it out.

Overall I had an absolute blast playing this and I see why it's still a popular series to this day. My only complaint is that in some of the cases, especially Turnabout Sisters, there are times where you're actually not supposed to be able to find the contradiction and instead some sort of plot armor happens to continue the trial. It felt out of my control and were the only times I felt a semblance of frustration. Otherwise, really fucking good.

I start saying the DS version is obviously the better version for those games, yet the upgrade of some sprites doesn't satisfy me, but this is personal.

[i][b]For Linux & Steam Deck:[/b] Platinum experience. User verified with Proton 6.3-7[/i]
[hr][/hr]
The Phoenix Wright franchise isn’t just an outstanding game. Those that have never played a visual novel or a point and click game, this will prime you for what these genres of game have the potential to do, and has the capacity to change your opinion. 

The ultra-polished game play, switching between the visual novel court room battle and the point and click investigative is seamless and feels complete. But that’s not what draws you in, rather the richly engaging and thrilling story-telling as well as it’s memorable and impressive cast of characters are what ultimately makes this game adored by so many worldwide. 

But in my opinion, what makes this a 10 out of 10, is the entire Phoenix Wright compilation priced at a third of Capcom’s normal cost. This is unbeatable value for money for such a high quality game with 60 hours of total game time. 

Buy it. Must play recommendation.

    [td]2. Memorable and charismatic cast of characters[/td]
  [/tr]
  [tr]
    [td]3. Dramatic and action-oriented court room battle[/td]
  [/tr]
[/table]
The stories here are divided into cases and each case is an immaculate example of great detective stories rivaling anime and manga classics such as Detective Conan (Case Closed)de and Kosuke Kindaichi. The crime mystery is enthralling, always spurring your curiosity to keep searching and solving it. The best of these is definitely, the first 4 cases which in my opinion, also has the best cast of characters. There is an overarching main story that encompasses the entire trilogy, and the ending of that overarching story is appropriately epic even if it has some minor plot holes. 

And the cast of characters are all memorable, likeable and charismatic. Each character has their own arc and even the villains are impressive and imposing. Each cast are also designed uniquely and possess their own identity. Phoenix Wright is a relatable rookie defense attorney determined to prove his client innocence and his perseverance is infectious. The supporting casts, Miles Edgeworth, Mia & Maya Fey, Franziska Von Karma, are memorable as well with great character arcs that ties in to the overarching story line. 

Of course heroes are nothing without their villains and PWAA has a great cast of villains as well. I won’t name them here to avoid spoilers, but my favorite is the overarching villain of Trials & Tribulation. She is definitely among the most realistic depiction of a villain anywhere and her backstory while leans quite a bit towards day time soap opera, is cleverly written. 

The meat and potato of Phoenix Wright is definitely the court room battles. Catching the witness’ contradiction in their testimony by shouting “OBJECTION!” is downright addictive. When it comes down to it, the court room section is a puzzle game where you put together all the clues that you have during your investigation and try to catch any discrepancies in the witness’ testimony in an attempt to get to the truth and ultimately get a Not Guilty verdict for your client.

  [/tr]
  [tr]
    [td]3. Investigative point & click section is done very well[/td]
  [/tr]
[/table]

Each character and location is unique, distinct and easily identifiable. I can definitely recall each character, how they look like, what were their colors, their expression when they smile and when they grimace. This is also mostly true with most of the location design, from the Detention Center, Lake Gourd, Global Studios, the Court Room; each location have their own feel and look that will leave and impression on you. 

The music is very catchy, and they are all very appropriate to the scene whether if it’s during the actual crime, during an interview, during the reveal or during a lighthearted moment, it’s all very well composed and accentuate the scene even more. 

The investigative section of the game is essentially a point & click portion where you need to search the scene for clues and evidence. New mechanics where you are supplied with Luminol Spray to find blood splatter as well as Fingerprinting Dust to search for fingerprints as well as the Magatama, a spirit medium stone that can reveal if a person is holding secrets. The mechanics here are done very well without too much frustration.

    [td]1. Some cases gets really long.[/td]
  [/tr]
  [tr]
    [td]2. Some stories have pacing issues.[/td] 
  [/tr]
[/table]
Though not all cases, some of them have pacing issues and they can get very long. Specifically, Rise From the Ashes, take 7-8 hours to complete, as well as the trilogy’s finale Bridge To Turnabout which can take upwards of 10 hours. It’s very lengthy and very taxing, especially with all the information that you have to gather but the story makes it worth to push through. 

Especially in the investigative section, the game can suffer some pacing issues as you struggle to figure out which information you have to unlock/discover/acquire to trigger the next scene. This can be frustrating, especially when the game doesn’t signal to the player on exactly where to go or what to do. 
[hr][/hr]
[h3]What Makes This A Must Buy[/h3]

The entire compilation is priced at a third of what the usual Capcom game costs. With it’s high quality story-telling as well as 40-60 hours content, the value of this game is phenomenally good. Well worth the investment you put in. 

Even if you don’t like Point & Click game, or Visual Novel game, the value of this game with it’s relatively low price is enough to be the one game to give it the genres a fair chance. And most likely, you will come away with a positive experience and a new appreciation for the potential of Point & click and Visual Novel games.

It is probably going down as my favourite game that I've ever played so far, and if my steam profile isn't private when you're reading this, you'll see I've played too many games to the point that it's embarrassing. I've always been interested in law, and even though this game can make a mockery of some legal practices, it's still super fun to play. While the gameplay can get slow and annoying at times (specifically looking at you, Rise of the Ashes), such as investigations or just actual trials (which are the best part of the game), it's still worth it in the end. The writing and story telling in this game is top-notch. The narratives, plausibility, and twists in all of the cases are what kept dragging me in again and again. Every single case has such an intricate story line, it leaves you thinking about all the possible endings until you finally finish the case and uncover the truth. I can't say this enough, the writing in this game, while there are a few slip-ups, is fantastic. And since I said that it somewhat plays a visual novel, don't think it's easy! There were so many instances where I felt lost and felt I couldn't progress until I looked over everything in the court record multiple times. And even then there were I pretty much had to brute force it until i got the right answer, but once I did, I felt dumb (barring maybe 3 instances in the whole game). I can't recommend this game enough. Just remember to save before you do something risky (it will save you a lot of time)! This game has so much content in it, it's definitely worth your money if you're a person that compares cost of the game to how long it takes to finish.

If you enjoy detective visual novels with a puzzle-like mystery that needs to be solved you should have a blast with Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy. I enjoyed all of my time in the game and it will mostly likely make me a return buyer to future entries for the series released on PC. Literally my only qualm with the game (that is more of a preferential thing) is that it can sometimes be mentally taxing to solve a case so I found myself playing in 1-3 hours sessions and rarely solving the whole case in one sitting.

It's really well written, it gets you invested and the cases connect with each other brilliantly. The animations might seem to be lacking to someone who hasn't played it but each character's sprites are well thought and presented at all the right moments despite being limited. They give away a lot of their character and thoughts which keeps things interesting and even exciting at times when things get out of hand for criminals. Cue sounds, music and the few times we hear voice lines are also so well placed that the game feels complete as it is, it could have more but it absolutely doesn't need it. I enjoyed the whole trilogy immensely (yes there's some inconsistencies but they are easy to ignore and yes sometimes having to present the exact evidence the game needs to progress is frustrating but you can always save often and try again)",1634930076,1634930076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you go into it expecting a 100% realistic lawyer courtroom simulation, then you're going to be disappointed. But what it does offer is a very smart, funny and unique experience with great characters and fantastic writing. For a game that was entirely translated, it's absolutely hilarious at times and almost tear jerking in others, the jokes hit and although one or two characters can be annoying, each has an interesting personality and background that it's fun to learn more about and discover.

The game does a great job of really getting you involved in each case trying to piece it together and crack it wide open. Each case is varied and unique; I never once felt anything was copied or recycled. They take quite a while to solve too, the early couple of cases you can complete in an hour or two but later cases require several days of investigation and gathering evidence before you then go to trial (maybe 5-10 hours of gameplay?). It then feels so satisfying when you've got that douchebag on the stand and you catch them perfectly in a lie with some evidence you found earlier!

Absolutely recommend, it's a clever game that'll have you genuinely thinking with every case and it makes you feel like you're literal Einstein when you crack it.",1634922405,1634922521,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ace Attorney's all aspects contribute to a very amusing and neat little package. From the banger music, through the goofy dialogues all the way to the fantasticly built stories. 
The characters are lovely and flexible. They can feel like real people, but also larger than life at the same time, and the dialogues are also able to be funny, and extremely tense when it has to.
The game is really well paced, slowly opening up the more and more complicated murder cases. Solving the cases by myself is one of the greatest satisfactions I've felt in gaming, really making the player feel like a gigabrain.
Unfortunately I can't end the review here, the game also has some nuisances, originating from the latter pro. Though I love to get my mind blown by the twisty murder cases, and I don't mind a challange either, the game, it seems, cannot really handle it, and it kind of collapsing into itself, resulting in some really frustrating moments. 
A quick run down on the gameplay before I get into that: once you hear about the murder and you have your defendant, you collect clues. Then you go to the court, where you search for contradictions in the witnesses statements, summoned by the prosecution.  You press them to make them give more information. The more they talk, the more inconsistencies surface, which you can point out by presenting the evidences.
So here are the issues that exist thanks to the (sometimes) overly complicated murder cases, all of which I've encountered in Episode 5, and I fear I haven't seen the last of them:
-The contradiction can be pointed out in multiple statements of the witness, with multiple evidences, but the game only accepts one. So even though you have it all figured it out, you have shoot in the dark.
-There are multiple different contradictions in one testimony, but only one progresses the story, so if you point out the one that the game doesn't think is right, you still get penalty, even though it's obviously a contradiction.
-Instead of presenting the contradicting evidence, in which way you had to prove the witnesses wrong in the past 4 episodes, you have to press the statement, so that then the game can present the evidence automaticly instead of you, after a pointless conversation. When this happened, I first thought that I had to present a different evidence, since I had multiple evidences that could contradict the statement. After that didn't work out,  I spent a good 6-7 minutes reading the other statements over and over again, thinking I got it wrong, until I looked a guide up just to find out that I was originally right, the game just wanted to do it in an unorthodox way... 

The game is an amazing experience other than that, absolutely recommend it.",1633720875,1633720875,True,30,0,0.746702253818511963,0,True,False,False

""Well-ported classic Ace Attorney series. Classic!""

One may have had somewhat negative perception on some CAPCOM games for the qualities apparently incommensurate with the dazzling triumphs of its old days. This Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, however, will never be underrated by even the toughest and worst game critics (just, it can't be if they have ever played the final episode of the third series, Bridge to the Turnabout).
This trilogy was well ported to PC with the astonishing quality of old magnificent CAPCOM. I do have boxes of gaming consoles and really do love them, but It's way better just to play this renewed Phoenix Wright series on PC than old consoles.
One small thing I wish about this game is an option for English dub (I thought we would have one when it was ported to Steam). I know, most 2D visual novel games do not have such a thing. I guess some see it detrimental to the game quality. Just an on/off option for voice dub may be a good option to consider.

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, I love all the characters and all the plots in the game.
I can't wait to see 456 ported to Steam.

One of my favorite games of all time. Even made me buy the entire series on the Nintendo DS.
First of all, you get to shout ""Objection"" a lot and point your finger at witnesses.
But if that doesn't convince you, for unexplicable reason, here is a short summary.

Basically it's a visual novel with the feeling & art style of an anime, including both the strong emotions and the typical sillyness.
You play as Phoenix Wright, a newbie defense attorney, with Maya Fey, a spirit medium at your side. 

Every case first contains an investigative part, where you look for clues and gain information by searching the place, talking to people and uncovering their dark secrets with a little assistance by your spirit sidekick (can't tell any details without a spoiler). 

The second part is the actual court trial and this is where the real fun begins. Question witnesses, find holes in their testimonies and confront them, by pressing on statements and using the clues gained in the first part. 

Every case plays out differently and I didn't see all the twists coming. The overall story is pretty enjoyable and ties everything together nicely, with recurring characters and their individual quirks, which will grow on you.

The difficulty is quite moderate. Finding the right answer can be anything inbetween way too hard and sometimes on the nose easy. All in all it is a tough but rewarding experience, once you start seeing the whole picture in every case.

As far as achievements go, most of them are manageable, but I gotta admit that I needed a guide for the lunchbox achievement.

Music is pretty cool, by the way. Got me pumped every time and I keep on listening to it even after closing the game.

I recommend the trilogy, if you:
- don't mind reading a lot
- enjoy anime/manga and the typical style elements that come with it (sometimes goofy humor; deep emotions, physical reactions to the dialogue, etc.)
- like investigative games, where you can play detective
- always wanted to play a non realistic over the top attorney
- enjoy yelling ""Objection"". Seriously. I love it.
- came here for the ""You are not a clown..."" meme

The characters are relatively simple based around a quirk or two, but they're well-done and have excellent dynamics and banter/interactions. The art is solid, unique designs and excellent backgrounds. The music is amazing, I'll even add a few songs to my playlist (which I'm rarely inspired to do from video games). The plot is pretty good with plenty of mystery.

The gameplay itself is both easy and difficult. It's easy in the sense that it's usually not hard to figure out whodunnit and how the evidence relates together (aside from some details), but the game wants you to present the evidence in a specific way, so often times it's hard to figure out not what the answer is but how the game wants you to answer.

It might not mean much, considering the only games I play are Mario ones, Animal Crossing and a few others, but holy crap this is amazing. I was watching a stream one day when they switched to this game, (the Samurai trial) and I got hooked. I begged my mom to buy me this, and she did. And then I got even more hooked. Amidst all the games, this is most probably my favorite. It has humor, mystery, and is actually a game that plays with your head. You feel as if you're actually Phoenix (unless you search up a tutorial/walk-through), going through all these challenges. The only negative comment I have is that it's kind of difficult through the first two trials, because if you start with this game (which I did) then it'll be hard to get used to the controls and stuff. It doesn't tell you what to do, you just figure out yourself. Which just has a whole bunch of other pros and cons I won't get into. Other than that, I love this game so much, and the characters as well. I enjoy writing a lot, and making interesting characters is more difficult than you think. I was completely taken aback by how much I loved these characters, and how easy it was for me to love them. Props to the people who just made these in general. There are characters the game will make you hate and love, and I'm a picky person and usually isn't persuaded by the attempts. But this game somehow convinced me- it was like it took control of my emotions with mere text boxes and repeating game sprites to love them. I'm still shocked of how amazing this game is. It contains mild language (hell, crap, etc) and use of tobacco, but only in one trial, where a woman is smoking it. (At least, that's what I assume they mean. I haven't finished the game yet- don't quote me.) It doesn't show gore or graphic scenes, which I love, because I'm extremely sensitive to them. The murder scenes are just 5 - 7 frames of drawings usually, and there's barely animation/walking around or anything. This may sound disappointing to you, but frankly, I think it's better. Watching trailers and tips (without spoiling anything) would help before you purchase this game. All in all, 10/10.

The story is pretty interesting, there are some plot twists which they will surprise  you (besides some cases you will get already who is the murder before it starts the case), characters in general are fantastic (Gumshoe, poor man) and the great thing of this game is the satisfaction for found a contraction from a witnesses after you heard your ""objection"" (besides sometimes it becomes frustrating since the game couldn't get the evidence you present besides there could be a logic behind it).
Graphic is okay, they did a good job to make the draws in high definition (we talk of a game released for GBA/NDS), some musics are great and well made into the game and I enjoyed to play it in remote with my tablet sometimes lol.

Basically, you are (usually) defense attorney Phoenix Wright, and you have to navigate this world's crazy legal system in order to prove your clients innocent. You start by investigating the crime scene, then during court you point out when witnesses are lying or mistaken, by showing the relevant evidence.

My only complaint is that sometimes you'll know a piece of evidence contradicts the witnesses testimony, but it's not clear which piece of the testimony is the one you're supposed to object to. Sometimes I found that the piece of the testimony I thought was the most obvious one for a given piece of evidence was actually the wrong one, and in a few of the cases, I had multiple pieces of evidence that contradicted a testimony, but I wouldn't get to object to the part I wanted until later.

For that reason, I say there's no shame in using a walkthrough to check your work.

Alright, let's get into it.

1) Witnesses are stupid when they lie. So many times throughout the first game it's just witnesses who have contradictions because they were stupid enough not to craft their lies around things they can blatantly see (In Turnabout Sisters [spoiler] April May tapped into Mia's phone call with Maya and during the phone call she also heard that the clock wasn't working, and yet she lied saying the clock was working when even she would have known it wasn't working [/spoiler]). Or the logic is legitimately flawed (JFA first trial, [spoiler] man can't tell the difference between bananas and a baseball glove from the defense stand but he can tell that those glasses were his? [/spoiler]). I know that the first two trials are beginner trials and so they aren't meant to be the hardest but even throughout the other trials there are many times where a witness should not have messed up the way they did but they still did. I know this game is built around objecting to contradictions in the witness's testimony and so they have to make a testimony, but it's excruciating how stupid these characters have to be just so this works.

It's not all bad though, there are many times where you press all the statements and there isn't a contradiction, and so the testimony ends Wright has to really try and bluff his way out of it. There's a sense of ""Oh no, this is getting worse and worse for our case"" similar to the feeling you get from Great Pretender case 1 (if you ever watched it, I greatly recommend the first case, the other cases are fine but none match up to the first one).

2) Not only that but most of the time it's very obvious who the culprit is. Why is this? Because for some reason you have to prove someone else did it. This boils every case (At least in the first game) to a closed room mystery. Who out of all these witnesses and people we know could have done it? I know it's done to increase enjoyability, but after a while it's a really, really tiring trope. It would be much more interesting if, just for example I suppose, we got a client off and didn't find the killer, only for the killer to show up again and our client was accused again, causing a rift between Wright, the rest of the court, and deepen distrust between the client and Wright. Or maybe the killer shows up in another case as a victim, or a witness. Just anything other than ""Wow, [spoiler] Redd White/boat man/Gant [/spoiler] is definitely the killer.""

3) The investigations are grueling. Usually they are pretty explanatory with what you have to do but sometimes I go have to go through many areas over and over again because I don't know where to go to progress the story or because I missed presenting something to someone. It's not that big of a deal though, just annoying.

I can admire what this game did for its time when these types of games didn't exist, but there's a lot of flaws that make it cumbersome to play, especially since most of it is reading. I can't wait to play JFA and T&T and see if they improve on the original concept of the first game.",1627447657,1627447657,False,1,5,0.378282606601715088,0,True,False,False

So as you all know, Ace Attorney is a game about you being a defense attorney. You need to investigate, collect evidences, and all that before you compete in a trial against the prosecutor.

This game is very good from every aspects; gameplay, art styles, dialogue, and story. It's also more interesting that the game got twists which make the game more intriguing. Every choices you make will decide the verdict of the judge, it's either [b]Guilty![/b] or [b]Not Guilty[/b]. 

Overall, I really recommended it! There are also many achievements to complete, but I'm not a ""completionist"", so I didn't bother completing all the achievements.

This game plays as a visual novel with a mixture of the American and Japanese criminal justice system. Very non-realistic for those who are studying law lol. 

The core basics in the Phoenix Wright games are divided into 2 categories in gameplay: investigations and Court Trials. Investigations take place where the player must gather clues/evidence from NPCs that are witnesses/somehow involved in the case. These are needed to continue onto the Court Trials, since the games are a visual novel. Progression will only be continued until the player has gather all of the clues and it's a segmental system. Each entry has added more gameplay elements in the previous games, so investigation does improve.

Court Trials is where this series truly shines! Now that the player has gathered all of the evidence/clues, its time to present why the client we're defending isn't guilty! Pressing on statements, presenting evidence, and making decisions are the main  gameplay elements; however do note that it's a segmental system for progression. Not to mention the catchy VGM that plays when you catch someone BS ing!

Overall, I enjoyed my time with the Ace Attorney Trilogy collection. Great games that must be played in numerical order, amazing VGM, interesting writing, and of course great characters.

It's a parody on the American/Japanese law and court system, so a lot of things might seem absurd if you're looking at it as someone who knows how it actually works.

Even so, the AA trilogy is definitely worth playing.

The characters are all very fun and unique, the story is engaging and the satisfaction of being correct when solving a case is unparalleled. Despite the humor in this game being a tad outdated, it's actually really entertaining nonetheless. The gameplay can sometimes get a bit repetitive, but you start getting into it when you get closer to solving a case. My favorite chapter was probably the 5th case in the 1st game (PW:AA - Rise From The Ashes) because of Ema Skye and the new game mechanic that came with this character's appearance. Sadly though, it was the first and last time we got to experience it in this trilogy.

So, in summary, I think everyone should play this game. At least for the meme culture. I'd recommend buying the game on sale, though the price is alright if you've money to spare (or if you want to play it that bad).",1625141786,1625225363,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Lovable characters, engaging plot lines, smart puzzles. and wacky courtroom antics lend a unique identity to these games, one that I and many others love. There are a few amazing cases here that I’m not going to spoil, but you’re gonna know what I mean once you beat the game. Not every case is perfect, though.  Some cross-examination segments feel a bit obtuse. Investigations, while helpful in helping the player develop preconceptions of what happened before taking the battle to court, can overstay their welcome. These issues, however, do not affect every case and act as an exception to the rule. Overall, this collection provided a unique and fun experience that I can wholeheartedly recommend, and I can’t wait to see how The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will evolve the series in terms of gameplay and storytelling.

Had one issue where my save files were deleted for both the first and second game, but thankfully since I've played it again recently, they've stayed untouched. It would have been nice to fully recover my files, but since the endings aren't choice-based, I don't mind going through the game again. (I'd advise making sure your computer/steam is fully updated before you play just in case!) 

The entire premise of a courtroom setting where you have to confront the evidence given by the prosecution seems simple, but it captures your attention with great mystery and very entertaining storytelling. Some cases are better than others, If you do get stuck somewhere don't be afraid to use a guide as they can be a bit tricky, but the ending cases are just flat-out brilliant and worth the purchase for them alone.",1624737283,1624739482,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Just that alone makes it well worth the investment. I love the game, too. It's funny and lighthearted and isn't afraid to satire or parody even itself or take itself too seriously, but it also has deeply touching narratives and asks you to consider very deep concepts about the ethics of justice and what it means to advocate for a client that might be guilty or against a client that must be innocent.

""Spine tingling legal action! Mind numbing legalese! You will say 'wow'!""

And if you think the description looks interesting, then, oh boy, you are not ready for the game.  It's genuinely incredible, absolutely brilliant - divided into two modes - investigation and trial. You gather the clues and talk to witnesses to aid yourself in the trial. There are so many different characters, each one even funnier than the last one. The humour in the game is one of my favourite things about it, the jokes you hear and the characters' reaction will truly make you laugh.

Some cases are definitely easier and you will be able to guess what item to show the prosecution before the game gives you a chance but in some cases, you will truly need to think hard to figure out what crime has truly transpired. You have to keep in mind that your mistakes will end up giving you a ""Game Over"", so you have to focus!

I currently have 65 hours on record and I am pretty sure this number will continue growing and growing because I just cannot get enough. I have already played the first game and the Justice For All, the second game twice because I really love the cases. I have yet to play Trials&Tribulations but with how much I have been enjoying those two, I'm absolutely sure it will continue being so good.

I remember borrowing the 1st game on the nintendo ds years ago from a friend to try it out but it didn't stick at the time. Despite that, my friends raved about it for years to come afterwards until I finally decided to revisit the franchise with the trilogy years later. This cheesy and wacky set of games was so charming I was speechless. The characters are really fun and the cases and investigating really grabbed me in wanting to know what happened next. The only downside was a few cases in the trilogy where connecting some clues as evidence were really questionably reaching in terms of logic. Besides that, most cases made sense and had a good flow of story telling without feeling dragged out. It took me about 22-24 hours per game so you get a lot of play time  to finish all 3 games for the value of what you're paying.

Every cases in this game is like a bunch of tiny little puzzles that seems like they don't connect to each other, but when you finished the puzzle and the whole picture is shown, you would realize every piece of puzzles have their meanings in the picture. Although there are flaws in terms of logic in some cases, that is still enjoyable to playthrough.

The design and the development of characters is amazing. There are lots of characters are named with puns, like phoenix wright (Right, Wright?) himself. This makes the player remember those characters very well. Apart from their name, each characters in this game have wide range of 'phase' when encounter different situations. A prosecutor can proudly shake his head with his smug face and update the autopsy report from the court record, and next minute he punch his desk angrily and cut a detective's salary. This makes the emotions of each characters more visible and 'feels like more human'.

Finally, the music. I believe a game (In any genre) (Just my opinion) without a descent music would not be a great game. The music in this game is outstanding and suits the genre of the game. When you are in court cross-examining a witnesses and you find out a contradiction, the game reward you with a energetic and hopeful music with phoenix wright pointing towards the witnesses. When phoenix discovered that the witnesses on the stand is lying and potentially be the killer, the game starts playing a fast pace and thrilling music, encouraging the player to discover the whole truth. When you have won the 'Not guilty' verdict, the game plays a relaxing and happy music, telling you that you have won.

You should definitely play the games in order as each game has its own, self contained overarching story, but they build into the next game and get developed on further.

By the third game you have so many small questions looming in the background that they build on and resolve within that one game that you'd be doing a disservice to JUST play Trials & Tribulations, although, you can and the game will still make sense. Every game is careful to give you all the required information for things to make sense, so if you ONLY had to play one, I'd play T&T.

However, that's not what you're getting here. You're getting the whole trilogy. And my god is it good.

The first game is a bit of an odd one since the trials are shorter than in the games released after it, and the investigation phases are simpler as well. On top of that, the trials in the first game are all fairly easy - the evidence all easily connects and you probably won't have any problems with it. This makes sense since it's the first game, so they didn't have the format nailed yet - but it also makes it a perfect introduction to the series.

It's not hard and it's not very long, plus the story is compelling enough and keeps throwing enough questions at you to keep you wanting the answers. When you get to episode 5, things change a little bit though...

Episode 5 was originally added as part of the DS port, AFTER the entire trilogy had already been released on GBA in Japan. This means that it contains references to future games, and the gameplay structure is more like the later games. On top of this it doesn't hold your hand, and it has some unique features that are only used in episode 5 of the first game (inspecting evidence, forensics, etc). The story in episode 5 isn't really important either, since it somewhat conflicts with the story of the second game (Justice For All) and feels more like an afterthought than anything else.

Don't feel obligated to play episode 5 of the first game once you've finished episode 4 is what I'm trying to say, it's really not necessary to your understanding or enjoyment of the rest of the games.

The second game (Justice For All) introduces some new gameplay mechanics (the magatama and the health bar system), as well as extends and expands the trials to take place over two parts. Overall though, JFA just isn't very interesting to me - I don't find episode 1 or 3 very interesting, and I don't even find episode 2 that interesting, outside of its story implications.

No, the real star of Justice For All is episode 4. Holy shit, episode 4. It makes the rest of the game worth playing through, even if you're not as engaged with it as the first game. It's worth mentioning as well that JFA doesn't feature an overarching story like the first or second game, so there's no real looming mysteries to wonder about. Just standalone cases to solve, which I'm sure is fine for some people but is a bit boring to me.

Finally, Trials & Tribulations. The third game. In my opinion, the best game in the trilogy. It takes all the information you've learned over the first two games, throws in some new characters, some new information, and builds on it for five solid episodes. From beginning to end, Trials & Tribulations is just completely solid. Especially once you get to episode 5, the final case of the entire trilogy - all the final mysteries, all the little tiny questions that still are unresolved, finally get answered, and it feels like the grandest love letter to a franchise in a while.

Pretty much every important character makes a return at some point in T&T, and in some really cool and unique ways. T&T was my favourite game in the trilogy back when I first played it, and after replaying it, has reaffirmed that it always will be.

Just an absolutely incredible trio of games, and I highly recommend playing them if you're even slightly interested.

It's kind of a shame that Apollo Justice took a small shit on Phoenix's character, and they never brought him back in the same way after... but if you're looking for more Ace Attorney, it's still a solid game if you can mentally disconnect it from this trilogy. Same goes for Dual Destinies, and while I've never played Spirit of Justice, I imagine that game also took some weird liberties with the series but it's probably still fun.

If you want another Ace Attorney game that doesn't go against the original trilogy, I'd highly recommend Ace Attorney Investigations. It's quite a bit different from the original games, but just as fun and takes liberties without feeling strange due to its design. You'd either need to emulate it or buy a DS copy though, as I don't think its ever been ported. There's also Investigations 2 which requires a fan patch because it was only released in Japan, if you want to go even further.",1621755375,1621755375,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

So my review isnt based off of any nostalgic feelings, rather a completely new experience based entirely on the this version.

TLDR: I absolutely loved the game, it was a unique experience and I absolutely recommend it. However, there are some minor things that bugged me throughout the series.

You are a defense attorney, tasked with proving your clients innocence. Each case you have to investigate the crime scenes, question people, etc and do your best to piece together the truth and then prove it in court through presenting evidence and pressing witnesses on the stand. Most of the time you will go into court with only a vague idea that something is off about the current version of the story the court is wanting to pass judgement on and then the truth is slowly uncovered between you and the prosecutor throughout the trial.

Speaking of the prosecutor... that is perhaps one of the best things about the game. Over the course of the series you develop a relationship with him. B the time you get to the last couple of cases, while you're still on opposing sides, you are working together to get to the truth rather than get a petty win despite the actual truth.

The cases are all extremely complex and not even slightly obvious in the beginning. And they take some serious thought to figure out. The evidence almost always holds multiple clues that you can piece together. The most seemingly irrelevant of details, are enough to change everything about a trial. Awesome game for people that like mystery and piecing together clues to find the truth.

While the game was great there were some minor things that just bugged me about it here and there. The keyboard mapping for a lot of things was just not intuitive and just downright weird. Its like they just ""eeny meeny miny moed"" which keys to use on a lot of things. For instance, rotating objects you're inspecting was mapped to H,N,B,M, Q, & R... Then E would ""present"" the object in court which of course when you're using Q & R to rotate an object.. Its really easy to tap E instead of R. Which leads to possibly taking a hit(You have a little health meter during a trial, you have to be careful not to present the wrong stuff too much or you'll lose the trial.) And/or you have to sit through long winded dialogue just to get back to inspecting the item.

And that brings me to another note and honestly this was perhaps the thing that annoyed me more than anything else in this game... being forced to click through the same dialogue over and over and over and over again when you go back to double check something or you accidentally click on it or accidentally present it...etc. And often its not just a quick one & done dialogue.. no, its a whole dang conversation that you're forced to just spam click to get through it all as fast as possible. Would have been really nice if they gave some kind of hotkey or option to completely skip the dialogue or exit it. Or simply had the long winded dialogue only shown for the first time then a quick piece of dialogue to easily dismiss after that one. Given the investigative &  mystery solving nature of the game, you find yourself stumped often and rechecking areas & items many times over trying to figure out what you missed and you will spend a great deal of time just trying to skip dialogue. One of the worst is when you're trying to present an item to a character to see if they have anything to say about it. Often times they wont.. Would be nice if they just said ""Sorry, dont know anything about it."" But no... most of the time this initiates a whole conversation between multiple characters.. And when they're done and you try to present something else to see if they know anything about it.. you have to click through that exact same entire conversation again if they dont. Which was just annoying to say the least.


Another thing that was kind of tough, was trying to figure out how to present things in court. You may have pieced together everything right from the get go, but presenting it in a controlled game at the right time where you dont have an actual voice to speak whats on your mind is an ordeal. So you have to press a witness on their statements to open up new dialogue options and then present the right piece of evidence towards the right statements. I found myself looking up walkthroughs on many things to figure this out. As I took many ""hits"" trying to present things to the wrong statements even though it made perfect sense in my mind why I may have presented something there, the game cant see that.

The judge is not the brightest bulb and the game is not based in any type of realism. The judges opinion is swayed with the blowing of the wind. And the judge is ready to pass judgement based on whatever conclusion he has on his mind at that specific moment. At first I found this kind of silly. But thats the mechanics of the game and after a while you realize his incompetency as a judge, only adds to the charm of the game and the verdict is essentially just left up to you and the prosecutor. 

All in all the game was wonderful. And I absolutely recommend it despite the minor inconveniences.",1621561666,1621561666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I started my Ace Attorney journey with Dual Destinies and immediately fell in love with the entire series after finishing Spirit of Justice. I've even seen the anime adaptation of the first game. But, I never played the original trilogy. 

Until now.

I remember reading somewhere that in the first release, you couldn't go backward in testimony. I'm glad that that was fixed in the port, but I think that takes away from how the game used to run. Something really frustrating, though, was how frequently you needed to save in the case that you messed up too often. In the newer games, once you failed a trial, you could pick it back up from where you failed. None of that was present in this trilogy, making the trial system a bit unforgiving for things not completely obvious or accidental selections. I'll say though that it's gotten me into a habit of saving my things more often. 

Port and logistics aside, the first three games that jumpstart the series following the well-known attorney were a rollercoaster. The amount of drama, comedy, and suspense was just right. Personally, I'm not quite a 2D fan, but understanding wanting to preserve nostalgia, I worked through. After about two cases, the problem of playing in 2D was immediately thrown out the window, as it became a massive interest to follow along with the story. The OST was wonderful as always, and yeah some of the character audio sounded weird, but I can't expect them to rerecord all of the character voice lines just to sound better. 

Now for just personal opinions that don't really have any bearing on the review. Out of all three, I think my favorite in the trilogy had to be Trials and Tribulations. It really felt like all of the cases were interconnected and really led back up to one person throughout the game. Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice, along with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney do the same thing, which I love. All of the cases being interconnected by one overarching character or event just made the game feel more complete and unified. I can't really say that I hate the first game, because this is the first time that we are exposed to the characters of the series, so it should focus more on developing the characters to be seen throughout the series rather than a story. My least favorite in the trilogy, which I guess you can guess by now, was Justice for All. I just felt that there was no cohesion between the cases, and that there were just random scenarios put into place. The continuity was a nice touch, but it just didn't feel like there was anything built-upon from the first game. Also the introduction of presenting profiles as evidence in trials just made the game harder, which is a good thing, but at times became very confusing and tricky to figure out when to present them.",1621329393,1621329393,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-When you examine things, now they'll permanently tick things off that you've already examined so you don't end up wasting time examining the same thing over and over.  

-You can skip forward over text.  So if you've already beaten these games on the DS, you don't have to wait tediously for every text message to go by.  

One small criticism over the original, time played is tracked.  So if you are tired of a case and wanna AFK you can't just set it aside without having the game record you as having some ridiculous amount of hours played.  

If you haven't played this game before, you should.  It absolutely holds up to time.  Nothing really compares to this game.  There are games that tried to make something similar, but I'd easily say PW is the king of the genre.  

Graphics aren't a problem at all.  If you like anime graphics, then there shouldn't be an issue.  

There's actually some really great money value here.  Normally a new Ace Attorney game would cost $50.  So you are getting three of those for less than what a new release of the game costs.  

And don't worry, these oldest three games of the series, are IMO the best of the series.  Especially the first game, I mean OMG every case was amazing in the first game.  The newer games had to bend over backwards to create a mainline story however.  And the gameplay is pretty much the same with some slight exceptions.  

Like Dual Destinies used really bad 3D videos with terrible voice acting.  Apollo Justice had some less enjoyable protagonists with gimmicky abilities.  

I much prefer the first three games with NO voice acting and no gimmicks and a strong main storyline.  That's what you get here.",1620101448,1620531787,True,3,0,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False

The entire game consists of repeatedly pressing the Enter button to walk through lengthy scenes of dialogue. The murder mysteries are vaguely compelling, but there's not enough player interaction to push them over the line into fascinating. 

The games are hopelessly linear; there's no way to distinguish oneself by playing ""better"" or ""worse"". The bits that ARE interactive - finding contradictions between evidence and testimony - fall in one of two buckets: either the answer is painfully obvious and it's boring, or the answer is impossible to get and you have to walk through all the options in order like a robot. And if you get a certain number wrong, it's back to the last save point, and more tedium as you click through what you've already read. It's also pretty annoying that when there's a revelation, the writer takes about 60 seconds longer than necessary to catch up to what the reader has already recognized, explaining the punchline in laborious detail. 

It's SO. BORING. Why did I keep playing?! I guess I kept waiting for it to get good? It's basically a poorly-written mystery novel with one-dimensional characters (""science girl""? ""cowboy dude""... ""frenetic patrolman"") told in press-button-now-for-next-line format. So poorly written - basic, fundamental absurdities in the legal case. Who would conclude someone was ""murdered in two places at once"" if the body is at location A and there's no body at location B? Obviously they were murdered at location A. Christ.

I've played these games so many times on the DS, 3DS, Switch, and now Steam.  I can't help but to rebuy these games multiple times. I absolutely love the Ace Attorney series.  If you're a fan of good puns and zany humor, visual novels with ""detective"" elements even though you're a defense attorney, a good cast of characters with their own personalities, and a life that continues even into the next games, this game is a must!

This game is a steal for $30!  You get three games, which each game is approximately 18-30 hours, depending on your reading speed, ability to find clues, etc.  You could easily nearly put a hundred hours onto just one playthrough of the three games!

Please, Capcom, please please please port the other Ace Attorney games, like Apollo, the rest of the Ace Attorney games, and the Miles Edgeworth series!",1596904471,1619027196,True,26,0,0.705685675144195557,0,True,False,False

While these games aren't exactly riveting in the gameplay or graphics department, the story is the entire point of the game.

First off I'd like to start off with the gameplay and story. This game is a Visual Novel, so the gameplay experience isn't super riveting, most of the time you're reading through character dialogue. This being said, you play this game for the story, not the gameplay. As for story, this game delivers a good story. It includes the original trilogy, each game has it's own individual story but builds to the main overarching story that becomes apparent in the third game in the trilogy. The final case incorporates things that you learned about the plot from all across the trilogy and is a good finale.

For all of you who love to get 100% of the achievements, this game includes 30 and it is very easy to get all of them in one playthrough. About half of the achievements are just clearing sections of the game. There are a few achievements you can miss but they're easy enough to get without much hassle.

No game is perfect, I do have a few complaints about the game. The trials can be a bit frustrating and drawn out. A lot of times there will be multiple pieces of evidence that can contradict something but the game will only accept one or two as valid. Other times it can be confusing about what the game actually wants you to do/present in the trial which can be a real pain.

I would recommend to use a controller if you have one, it allows a more relaxed experience. I'd also recommend to prepare to pay attention to very small and seemingly insignificant facts and details about evidence/cases as more often than not they come into play during the trials.

Overall, a good game. Memorable characters and a memorable story!",1618454796,1618454796,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the absence of a middling review option, I'm giving this a bad review, just because it won't ding the overall hype train score and may show up more to potential buyers.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+Lengthy game (50-80 hours?) if you're playing blind. I had a lot of paused time.
+Humorous, and improved localization text as games progress.
+Colorful artwork.
+Simple, clear interface.

[h1]YMMV[/h1]
~Some Japanese culture that is out of place/unfamiliar in the West.
~Game can go full-anime (never go full anime) at times, which may be a little silly/over-the-top for non-weebs.
~Some annoying characters that keep coming back.
~Music tracks are catchy, but often short, which becomes annoying when stuck.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
-Game absolutely requires save scumming and occasionally looking up a guide, bringing immersion, momentum and fun to a grinding halt.
-The game often gives instant game overs for penalties, which doesn't mesh well with the next issue.
-Evidence selection is THE most frustrating part about this game:

1. There are often multiple valid pieces of evidence for a situation, but the game only wants ONE. Read its mind or be penalized.

2. You have to follow the game's path of exposing contradictions. If you try to expose another, bigger, more obvious contradiction, you'll be penalized. If you try to expose the expected contradiction via different (usually more simple) methods, you'll be penalized. Read its mind or be penalized.

3. Old evidence isn't removed from your inventory, and in larger cases may amount to dozens of items. However, the game's very inconsistent on when ancient evidence may be used a second time, adding to the frustration on when you get stuck (see #1 and 2). 

4. Game is very inconsisent on the level of cleverness/perception required of you. Spotting tiny inconsistencies is critical in some areas, and yet punished in others (see #2). The dev said he wanted the game to be simple enough for his mother to play. I'm fine with casual mother- or OCD sleuth-level difficulty. Just pick one and stick to it, or ramp it up. The ""difficulty"" is a roller coaster (see #2).

[u]Example:[/u]
Let's say your disabled miltary veteran client is accused of shooting someone with a rifle at a range of 200 yards. The court asks you to prove your client could not have shot the victim. Pertinent evidence belonging to your client is as follows: a pair of glasses with an incorrect prescription, medical documentation of their crippled right arm and shoulder and their glass right eye.

Which piece do you present?
A. The glasses that show your client would not have been able to see clearly.
B. The medical documentation that shows your client could no longer hold a rifle.
C. The glass eye that shows your client has no depth perception and little ability to use a sight/scope.

Your choice?
A? Wrong, penalty.
Ok, B? Wrong, penalty.
Fine! C! Wrong, penalty.

Save scum and find out the answer was:
D. You needed to present a photo of your client, which will bring up the fact that when being sworn-in earlier, your client raised his left hand, proving that he could not use his right arm, and thus, could not have held a gun properly.
WTF?

The prosecutor will then object, stating that your client could have held a gun in his left hand. Aaaand, now we're back to a 33% guess at picking A, B or C. Except you won't be able to present any of those until you go through two passes of the same cross-examination, pressing for additional information on EACH pass. The game won't accept its expected evidence until AFTER you do that. If you try beforehand, you'll be penalized.
---------------

This sort of situation happens at least once on every case...and sometimes even during evidence collection. I eventually learned to keep a guide handy, just to peek at a single line of what to do or say next to get past the hare-brained game logic.

Linear and boring because of it, scripted with nothing of actual value to the player, to make the player actually be smart. Instead It's the opposite ""Oh damn Phoenix is so funny and smart"". In short, a very polarizing experience when viewed through a particular angle, which is unfortunately my angle.

[h1] The Problems [/h1]

The main problem with this game, for me personally, is that there is no attachment to the people you're supposed to defend. These cases just get dropped on you, and while yes, their personalty is always ( in my case since I didn't finish the game ) eccentric and ""fun"". There is no tangible goal, there is no actual connection that makes me care if they get put in fucking jail or if I can save their life with my incredibly funny and witty dialogue.

The other problem I have is that the game is too fucking linear. First lets dissect the portion of gameplay which is used before the case begins in court. I like to call this the ""Follow the obvious"" part of the game. At first this was actually quite fast paced, and didn't hinder my experience that much with the series. But at episode 3 titled ""Turnabout Samurai"" this problem just become a tedious mess. For a bit over 1,5  maybe even 2  hours, I was stuck, because the game can bug >IF YOU DON'T GO THE WAY IT WAS SCRIPTED AND INSTEAD GO ANOTHER WAY<. I would literally not have been able to pass through this section if I didn't end up going on a forum for  a >STEP BY STEP< guide on how to progress. Apart from this, these sections are quite shallow, and get boring far too easy because they overstay their welcome and It's easy to get all the evidence, because the game throws that shit in your face, you can't fucking miss it.

Now for the other problem, which is the main case itself, or rather, when you actually get into the court room. Now I'm not gonna lie and say that these sections aren't exhilarating, well paced, and well written. But again the problem here isn't with that, the problem is that they are simply too fucking easy. You again follow a >linear story< that makes it obvious what you need to do to progress it. And at points it actually fails to do even that. Not in a good way tho, where you are supposed to actually use your brain, it's a confusing mess and you're basically left with a guessing game of >Is this what I'm ""SUPPOSED"" to pick?<. Imagine what kind of a failure as a game this is, if it can't even make you use your brain effectively to solve a court case.

This is also one of the things that made me so mad, and almost had me put the game down. If I'm not mistaken its the final portion of the case in episode 2, where you're supposed to cross examine some dude's statement. And I was sitting there, for 20 minutes, thinking what the fuck I'm supposed to do. I cross examined his EVERY, SINGLE, FUCKING, WORD only to not progress. Turns out right...stay with me now...you're supposed to not do anything, and just read through it 2 times. After that your dead mentor, comes back from the dead, in the body of her sister, and gives you some evidence with which you win the case? Hello? What? The? Fuck?

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

This game is only a recommendation for people that want a ""feels good game"", something that is entertaining on the surface level. Because at that, this game excels, the witty and fun dialogue, the fast paced court ""battles"" with Edgeworth make for some of the most exciting moments here. But if you were looking for something that will make you think about solving the case, something more grounded and complex, this simply isn't that. In that case, I say stray far away from this franchise and don't listen to everyone who sucks it's dick.",1617362943,1617396111,False,4,8,0.400772631168365479,1,True,False,False

To be honest, I wasn't expecting too much - I had played some similar games before and was looking for something where I get to use my own logic and think things through instead of just mindlessly clicking to pass the story. But it turned out to be much more than just that.

To begin with, it was exactly what I had expected - a solid visual novel with a compelling setting that really made you use your brain and seem like you are in control of the story, even when there is no real choice or multiple story paths. Having the choice of moving around, investigating and talking to characters somewhat freely gives the game a more active feel than many other visual novels. And, above all, it really gives you a sense of accomplishment when you're able to find a well hidden contradiction and crack the case.

Sure, the game has its quirks and annoyances. Occasionally I spent 20 minutes stuck in a cross-examination having not realized that you might, in fact, need to press some statements twice to get all the information. Or I figured out a key point or a contradiction during the investigation, and then frustratedly tried sixteen different combinations of witness statements and evidence to bring that contradiction out in court, before realizing there was something else I had to point out before I could do that. Or I could not progress the investigation by talking to a witness because I had not presented the victim's profile to Detective Gumshoe to get more details. I get that sometimes the story needs to progress in a certain order, but when you get no pointers as to what is missing for you to proceed, it can cause occasional spikes in blood pressure.

But what got me hooked was the story. Although it felt in the beginning that each case was a separate entity along Phoenix's path, the further the games progressed, the more everything began to link up. Especially the third game of the trilogy brought everything together in ways I could have never predicted, making sense of plot points I had not even thought were plot points to begin with. The characters are well-written and interesting, with personality quirks and witty remarks that make you laugh and feel for them (and, occasionally, groan and roll your eyes). In the end, I noticed I truly cared about these characters, who - let's face it - are nothing but pixels on my screen and words in the game files. If that's not the sign of a good story and excellent writing, I don't know what is. And when the truth came out at the end of the game, there may have been a few tears shed. But I guess that's okay - a lawyer only cries when it's all over, anyway.

Now I'm just really bummed that [spoiler]Phoenix and Iris never got (back?) together in any of the following games of the series[/spoiler].

At this point, if anyone is still thinking this game is not worth it, all I can say is...

Where there's a Wright, you can't be wrong. This gem of a series captures every suspense and comedy a visual novel has to offer as you step into the shoes of the beloved defense attorney, Phoenix Wright. While there are other instances for you take the roles of various characters in the series, you are mainly playing as Wright.

[h1] Gameplay and Mechanics [/h1]
The concept of the game is straightforward. To summarize the life of a lawyer quoted by me, a non-lawyer, it can be broken down into case investigations, witness cross-examinations, contradiction exposure within witness testimonies, and evidential arguments.

[h1] Design and Visual [/h1]
If you grew up playing Ace Attorney on Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS, the visuals just look more crisp now. The art style, together with the stereoscopic 3D, makes the Ace Attorney trilogy look even more like a graphic novel than before.

[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]
What can I say? It's classic stuff. Nothing I love more than a mix between orchestrated instruments and synthesizers to take me back to my childhood.

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]
Despite the game being a lawyer's parody and satire with its light-hearted absurdities, it does a fine work of balancing those with darker scenarios to build up a satisfying finale. You can't help but to adore Phoenix as his character develops throughout the conversations in-game. Also, Miles Edgeworth is possibly one whose character arc I found most compelling in the series.

Likeable characters, memorable court room battles and a very well localised script. This is a compelling 40+ hours of gaming which you can drop in and out of at your leisure thanks to generous save points.

My only gripe is some court cases feel very inflexible with the sequence the plot forces you to present evidence - sometimes it's obvious what you need to present, but it's not clear which line of testimony needs the rebuttal. 

The series would really benefit from a 'key phrases' journal to help you refresh on important spoken lines that are easily forgotten between play sessions.

This is very minor though, and most cases present a fair challenge if you just read your court record thoroughly and think what's been said through logically.

A unique gaming experience, and worth it for the memes it opens up to you.",1616240955,1616240955,True,17,3,0.6226654052734375,1,True,False,False

The sound design is truly incredible. A great soundtrack used impeccably to present a compelling narrative.
Characters in these games are amazingly well-structured and multi-faceted individuals with their own motives and personalities. The Japanese designers are not afraid of cliches, yet this has allowed their crime stories to be much more believable. 
The overall pacing and storytelling of each narrative is superb, largely because of the two factors explained above. This series WILL get you invested in the storylines and you will want to figure out exactly what's going on. The twists and turns are well disguised when appropriate.

The general worldbuilding follows the same quality standard, being very coherent, yet simplified to fit within the context of one court case at a time.
Graphically, these games are certainly a product of their time - however, their quality standards are simply perfect. There are no compromises in quality, no shortcuts taken - all character models and poses, all backgrounds and evidence - all the graphical models meet a consistent and stylistic theme that stays on-point for all three games. I have never seen this accomplished in other series to such a degree as it is here. Japanese developers clearly made this game and their craftsmanship is wonderful.

Now for the meat. In somewhat predictable fashion, there are major flaws. Some of the cases presented have obvious logical flaws, especially those numbered 3 or 4 in their respective games. 
Often, there are rounds of questioning where some evidence leads to an obvious verdict, yet that evidence cannot be presented yet as the writers simply chose to write the story in a different direction. Again, this is much more common in certain chapters (2 and 3) rather than in others, across the 3 games.
The actual ""lawyering"" of this game is very stylised to the fictitious world of the series, and you're not really going to learn anything about process or proper practice. Come into this game world expecting a corrupt, inconsistent, illiberal, nonchalant judge and court system in general or you WILL be disappointed.

So in summary, my praise lies in the relatively superficial elements of the games and my criticism is steeped in the gameplay and progression itself. Normally, this would condemn a title to a poor rating. However, in this case the aforementioned good points far outweigh the negatives, even if they lie in seemingly less important areas. It simply changes the nature of the games. Don't expect a puzzle game, or an exercise in logic. To clarify, you will need to think hard at points to solve the logic puzzles and complete the cases without a walkthrough, but these games shine far more brightly as interactive novels. You're paying to feel like a part of many different stories spanning half a dozen hours each, and a greater overarching narrative.

As for the gameplay, well, It plays pretty much like any visual novel you would expect.

Since VNs are heavy on the dialogue, the game makes the most of it by having the dialogues a core part of the game mechanics. Reading through witness accounts, police reports, etc. to find a inconsistency which you can use to break down small lies as well as bigger lies to find the truth. It's overall very rewarding to find the tiniest hole in someone's testimony and watch it all fall down. 

Unfortunately, the nature of a mystery game is that it can only be fully enjoyed. Once you know the twists and reveals, the game loses all of its surprises. You know who the criminal is, you know how he did it, why he did it, and subsequent playthroughs will become simple connect the dots game. 

One small thing I dislike about this game would be how exact you sometimes have to be in order to proceed even if you manage to pinpoint the contradiction. 
For example, evidence A and evidence B enter in contradiction. But you can't raise an objection beforehand until either of them is mentioned in someone's testimony. 
And it can be really arbitrary which one you should pick as well. If the witness mentions evidence A and you bring up evidence B to show the contradiction, the game does a brain fart and doesn't allow it despite having done so in prior levels.  Instead, you have to present evidence A, which then gives you the chance to also bring up evidence B.

Besides that one small annoyance that happens maybe twice in the whole game, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to people who enjoy Visual Novels and/or Detective Mysteries.

1. Witness testimonies will often include SEVERAL contradictions with the evidence, but the game will only consider ONE of them to be the correct ""answer."" To add insult to injury, once you present an actual contradiction that the game deems as ""wrong,"" you get penalized and basically lose health. Pretty much, you're forced to use save states to counter the game's way of handing you penalties for incredibly stupid reasons. 

Here are some fantastic examples:

A witness heard TWO gunshots. The murder weapon fired THREE bullets. Contradiction? ABSOLUTELY. Contradiction that the game wants you to find/deems as the only correct answer? NOPE.

A witness claims to have seen the defendant stabbing a victim with their right hand. No fingerprints were found on the murder weapon. No explanation is currently available. Yes, it's explained later, but only later, and is still a contradiction with the current testimony and evidence. Now, it wouldn't be so bad if the witness just said ""they were wearing gloves dumbass,"" but they didn't say that. Instead, the judge penalizes your ass and back to the menu to load a save state you go.

Basically, you can find something with the current testimony and evidence, but unless it's the ONE correct answer, the game offers no explanation and no progression, just a penalty and a trip to the save/load data menu.

If there is one thing I absolutely despise in any video game, it's losing for bullshit reasons. As proven by the two examples above, this game can and will have you lose for bullshit reasons if you don't counter the bullshit with save states. Please, do not come to me with ""sAvE sTaTeS aRe cHeAtInG"" because I'd like to see YOU somehow navigate around all the """"""""wrong"""""""" contradictions in this game, especially with shit like the first example, on your first try.

2. For this second thing, let me give you a sequence of events:
-The witness claims to have seen the defendant performing a sequence of actions
-The game even provides a slideshow of the witness and defendant on the map when the witness claims to have seen the defendant
-There is an OBVIOUS, and I mean OBVIOUS problem: the witness is claiming to have seen the defendant through a fucking wall. 
-I present the map to prove that the witness cannot have seen the defendant. Why? Because of the fucking wall blocking the line of sight!
-Penalty!
-I look up TWO different guides for the case. TWO. What do they both tell me? That I did it correctly! I was supposed to present the map as evidence! I did everything correctly! The witness couldn't have seen the defendant! The witness was lying and I uncovered it correctly the first time!
-What is my conclusion? The game somehow broke and blocked off all further progression, despite being a fucking point and click adventure!

How, how, how, how, how!? How can a FUCKING POINT AND CLICK ADVENTURE break like this? 

Not only is the gameplay questionable with all the """"""""incorrect"""""""" contradictions, but the game managed to fucking break and block off all further progression.

Story for the cases? Fantastic. The murder plots, uncovering of the murder plots, and how everything seems to make sense when the truth is revealed? Fantastic. The """"""""incorrect"""""""" contradictions? Gameplay ruining. The fact that a point and click adventure managed to break and block off all further progression? Astounding.

This game has it all. The beginning cases aren't as compelling as the later ones, but I still enjoyed every case and I couldn't have expected how amazing the finale turned out to be. The third game ties up every loose end in such a satisfying way. 
There is plenty of humor in the dialogue. I found myself laughing hard many times. The character interactions are fantastic. Despite the large number of silly moments, the serious ones still have massive impact. The plot twists are sometimes predictable, and sometimes not. Most of the writing is incredible and I fell in love with all the characters. Their motivations make sense and their backstories are colorful.
I was shocked at how well the cases were put together. The games should definitely be played in order, because plenty of characters and ideas are brought over from the preceding cases.
I know it isn't for everyone, but I love the soundtracks. I enjoy how they mixed up the music so it wasn't all the same. For example, some tracks come back from the first and second games in the third one, but there are also new themes and remixes of old ones. The soundtrack has an important role in gameplay for highlighting impactful scenes or sets of dialogue, or just adding emphasis to court cases (you'll see).
I teared up multiple times while playing, especially in the more important cases. I've seen multiple people say they wish they could forget playing the games just so they could experience them again, and I echo that sentiment.

Where these games shine are with their characters, music and sound effects merging with the incredible dialogue and utterly INSANE scenarios - elevating the relatively simple gameplay and premise beyond reasonable explanation. Just play this. I can't do it justice.

The investigations can drag on for so long and will have you randomly clicking things for 15 minutes trying to find the next clue. The trials are where the games really shine but even there the game can be pretty frustrating. Sometimes the game expects some pretty crazy deductions and in very specific ways, meaning you either have to spend a lot of time and thought into figuring it out on your own, or you have to throw away your dignity and google it.

[b]Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy[/b] is superb. Definitely one of the best experiences that gaming has to offer.
Let me preface the review by saying that this game is not suited for childs. Some people have the misconception that this game is childish, nothing farther from the truth. This game deals with murder, lies, betrayal, and sociopathy.

You are [b]Phoenix Wright[/b], a defense attorney whose job is to prove that your clients are innocent in the court of law; to do so, you will have to investigate the area of the crime, dialogue with diverse people, find witnesses, and show exactly why your client did not commit the crime they're being charged with.

There are two different phases in this game; the investigative section, and the court of law section. Each plays completely different, and the court of law marks the end of each chapter. And each chapter, is a different story, which makes for great 2 hours playthroughs.

It plays very much like a visual novel, with so many unique and likable characters that it absorbs you, in the same vein of watching a fantastic show. There are also great antagonists and villains, Edgeworth being one of the most famous in the gaming scene, who has remarkable animations and dialogues. Guaranteed to make your blood boil.

In my humble opinion, I recommend getting the game and playing it without knowing anything about it, and trying it out for 2 hours (this is the refund policy of Steam), if you remotely like or feel entertained in these 2 hours, it only [b]gets better[/b], so you'll make a safe bet. If you dislike how it is, then no worries, maybe try it later on. 

I recommend this game to everyone, honestly, you can dislike Visual Novels and still get a kick out of this saga. There's a reason why it's one of the most famous detective games. It'll stay in your memories forever.",1613515798,1613515911,True,46,0,0.805162012577056885,8,True,False,False

I completely understand why this is such a classic. At the end of the day it still has issues with the fact that it's a point and click game with a nice coat of paint, and as such has pitfalls where you simply get stuck until you click on the right thing or use the obscure item in the right place, and I definitely feel that element hasn't aged too well when compared to an adventure series like Danganronpa or Zero Escape. But what this brought to the table was its charm, world, and characters. It took until late into the first game and after the characters were really grounded for me to get hooked, but once I was this didn't let up. There's nothing quite like figuring out the case right when you're in the thick of it alongside the blunders of the rest of the cast. Not every case is amazing and some things can be quite predictable, but the cases with lasting impact absolutely shine.

To put it simply, I'm not someone who often puts 50 hours into a game but this was fun as hell, even with the jank of the gameplay . Classic cast of characters, great progression, great at just having you care and putting you on the spot. If you're like visual novels, travesties of the court system, or a good fun rollercoaster of a story, you gotta play it. It takes some time to get its footing and its gameplay can have frustrations, but those are small hiccups in the overall excellent experience.",1613287923,1613287923,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

the episodes in the first game felt strong, then there were some episodes in the second and third game that felt like ""filler episodes"" to me where i didn't get as much enjoyment from them (though i suspect this might be from binge-burnout). however it finishes off with a very strong final episode in the third game which i enjoyed a lot, i'd definitely recommend sticking through to the end if you get far enough into the games. just you might want to pace yourself well so that you don't get burned out too quickly.",1612215323,1612215490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From that moment I knew I'd be playing the whole series through, and when I finally ran out of games to consume, I felt a sad emptiness. Fortunately with  a year or two away from it, one may return and enjoy the experience once again, although with a bit less difficulty than the first time around.

The characters are the game's second big positive. Each is unique in design, often with a pun for a name that describes what kind of person they are, You'll either fall in love with them, and become engrossed in their backstories, always rooting for them to win, or hate them, and enjoy watching their meltdown in court as you peel apart their lies and lay the pressure on.

Pros:
+ Likeable characters: most characters are likeable, a big plus.
+ First game contains some really cool cases, third game all of them were quite interesting.
+ Lazy controls: only need your mouse.
+ Price: this is a difficult aspect for story games with no replayability, but this game is probably priced just right. Especially when on sale, this game is more than worth it.
+ The game grows better. The first cases won't be much special, but after those, cases will become
+ Game signals people well when to save and when something new is possible.
+ The game won't let you proceed unless you have everything. So no fear that you missed clues before going to a trial.

Minor negatives:
- You will play three not so difficult tutorial cases.
- Sometimes it's really obscure on how to advance. Fortunately, good guides exist.
- The stories don't always make sense. And people lie too much for little good reason. Game overs also don't always make sense. Like, you try to get someone a guilty verdict, but game over (because of mistakes) with a guilty verdict, which is exactly how you will end. The plot twists are great in this game, but the stories aren't of that level.
- The pool of culprits is usually so small, that there is little suspense about who did it. The game is much more about puzzling how it happened and how it ties to a person.

Major negatives:
- !!! Contains lots of white flashing !!! If you're sensitive to that, don't buy this! Especially the first game contained so much flashing I was getting annoyed by it.
- Second game was honestly lackluster compared to the other two.
- This game demanded all of my GPU, for some reason. If you're on an average computer, don't expect to run this game alongside something else.
- The game isn't always watertight. I won't forget the one time I pointed out this contradiction:
witness: ""They got stabbed in the chest""
me: ""Objection! The autopsy says they got stabbed in the back!""
judge: ""I see no contradiction. Here, get a penalty.""

It's when the music stops to leave you in suspense and then the pursuit music starts playing. That's around the moment where you go ""Ha! I got you now!"" That to me is what the best part of the game is.

As much as I love this trilogy, some of the characters in the final game just don't hold a light to the old ones. The prosecutors are the best example of this. In the third game, Godot isn't anywhere near as fun and interesting to fight against as both von Karmas. I freaking love how over the top both of them are but Godot just didn't cut it for me.

The characters, story and soundtrack is amazing and its satisfying to point out a contradiction in the witness' testimony.

My only complaint is that a few of the cases' methods and evidence needed to advance were confusing, so I had to use a guide to help me when I got stuck.

Like, YES, there are a few characters who are really annoying, but it seems like that's kinda the point... so it's okay. Besides, the cast is hardly the best thing about the series.
The twists are intense. You think 'oh, i see this twist coming from a mile away' but then you find out that the entire thing was completely different AND HERE'S WHY. Each crime makes sense from an overview point at the end and it pieces together nicely.
The absurdity of the cases strain belief, but that's a good thing. There's no way that a case would be solved by EXACTLY ONE piece of evidence that suddenly clears everything up, and in just about every real case, there's much unused evidence or evidence that's more significant, whereas in ace attorney, if a piece of evidence is used once, you can be fairly sure it won't be used again. And that's putting aside the fact that the cases made by both sides would NOT stand in any reasonable court.
BUT that's THE REASON that it works. Any logical case in the real world is generally solved with minimal evidence and 'the truth' is not the primary focus. You're not gonna find out exactly what happened, but Ace Attorney cases are different. They are SATISFYING. You KNOW WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT that THAT GUY was the guilty party and EXACTLY HOW THEY COMMITED THE CRIME.

I've changed my mind. I was expecting a good ~15-ish hours of playtime with my prior knowledge; but, I have played for WAY longer (35-ish hours). Ace Attorney took me a good 11 hours, and I've just now finished Justice For All. It took me a total of 24 hours to finish it! 17 hours today, the other 7 not long ago.
I'm very excited on how I will be able to handle Trials and Tribulations.

I'm super blown away! My expectations were already high, considering I've been a fan for a while, watching gameplay, parodies, playing fan-made games, but those expectations have been more than met!

BUT there is 2 problems with this game 1.triggering events 2.putting your words into evidence
Lets start with triggering events. sometimes you have to run around a area to trigger a event or dialogue. Now this would be fine if you where told where to go every time, but most of the time your not told, so you just end up running everywhere praying to trigger something

2nd problem: sometimes you know what to do but the evidence is scarce,So here's a example...
There's this one guy who gets injured by this girl, you have to show where he got hurt and why his cloths aren't cut up
You know where the wound is He knows where it is but the evidence doesn't show the thing he's hiding his wound behind.
You actually have to show his character profile which has no mention of the ""thing"" (im tryin to keep it spoiler friendly)

If you got 35 dollars to spare hell 35 dollars at all BUY THIS GAME, i promise if you actually use your brain you'll have fun.

Anyway i give this game a 8/10 some shitty court trials but other than that fun as hell...

all the animation, text etc all of them are improve, and the variety of character is pretty much hilarious on how they react and their personalities. beside from the gameplay Ace Attorney main point comes from story plot twist, variety of character that is why im enjoying this series.

The Objection and Pursuit soundtrack also really good to hear, man I can't get enough hearing this while uncovering the truth.

If I was voting based on the first [i]Phoenix Wright[/i] game in this trilogy, I'd give a ""Yes."" However, the 2nd game completely killed my interest in the middle of it. I took a break to see if I'd return to the 3rd one, but there's other things I'd rather do with my time.

That being said, the first game isn't flawless either.

If I had to summarize my biggest issue, it would be that the games become very tedious. I understand that law work would be tedious in real life; but these games obviously aren't going for ""realistic"" law work anyway. They're tedious in the way they design the investigations with weird loopholes, nonsense reasons that you can't use sensible evidence, the fact that you have to press people on one statement versus another that should have lead to the same thing, confusing ways to find certain evidence, and so on. The longer I played, the less intuitive things were.

Nevertheless, I overall enjoyed every case in the first game, plot-wise. Miles Edgeworth could be frustrating but he's a well-rounded character when the game shows his story. That said, old Manfred von Karma bothered me during his case in the first game. And little did I know, his relative Franziska would become one of my most-hated characters of all time during the second game.

As the games went on, I felt like there was way too much useless text and it only got worse in the second game, especially when the cases seemed to be of a larger scale. It's worse when you could essentially prove something did or didn't happen, but then the game would bring something up that ""invalidated"" it, even though logically it doesn't invalidate anything. Between Franziska's most annoying interruptions and whip-cracking (I absolutely [i]hated[/i] her for that) and doing stupid mechanics to completely overturn the cases, and my distaste for the the psychic case and the bigger mess of the circus case, I stopped playing.

And well, I just haven't gone back, nor do I feel like I'm missing much. I probably should have stopped when I completed the first game.",1609734430,1609780577,False,16,0,0.513415217399597168,2,True,False,False

And I think this is kind of the biggest compliment that I can give Ace Attorney. Ace Attorney is [i]lots[/i] of fun. And for a guy who doesn’t really get into visual novels, I am thoroughly enjoying this trilogy. A lack of impactful decision-making and consistency issues may leave some disappointed, but the [u]sheer amount[/u] of absurdity and hilarity in each installment is reason alone to buy this.[/b]

The Ace Attorney Trilogy is a [i]really interesting[/i] bundle to review because not only is it three games in one, it’s three games which are (mostly) anthologies, several episodes of disconnected works that are grouped together. On top of that, the first game includes a DLC chapter that was written and produced after all three of the games in this set had been produced. What this means is that: 1) The quality of any episode in a particular installment can vary greatly and 2) the trilogy itself can vary greatly depending on the quality of each game. But these two reasons are why I’m reviewing the trilogy right here and now. I am about halfway through game 3, and I can certifiably tell you Ace Attorney trilogy is without a doubt worth its [u]full price, even if you only play the first game,[/u] which I think is the best game I’ve played so far.

Ace Attorney, being a visual novel, is all about the characters. And while there are some characters I love, and some characters I hate, almost all of them I [u]enjoy[/u]. You know the saying, [i]“I love to hate”?[/i] That’s how I feel about [i]almost all[/i] of the characters in Ace Attorney. Save for a select few, I really enjoy every character in the series and I’m almost done with all three games. The characters are quite distinct, well animated, and super memorable with the way they talk. That is to say, each character’s writing is [i]expertly done[/i] and this is the greatest strength of the development team of Ace Attorney. You reach a point in the series where you can pretty reliably predict what many characters will say at any given time, and that provides a lot of enjoyment.

A weakness, however, is consistency between chapters and between games. This consistency issue is multi-fold, too. For example, near the end of game 1, Phoenix and Gumshoe sort of work together for a very special case, and despite connecting in this time, at the beginning of game 2, the dialogue heavily implies some kind of rivalry or animosity between them. It makes almost no sense given the results of game 1, but alas. These types of strange relationships and inconsistencies run amuck in Ace Attorney, and they damage the amount of fun you get out of the series as a whole. The games are separated into episodes, yes, but you can clearly see the developers try to link relationships and storylines between them, something they get better at doing the further along you get in the series (perhaps this was because they didn’t know they would get a 2nd installment on release of the original?), so it ruins enjoyment when there are inconsistencies in the way characters interact between episodes. Either Ace Attorney needs total disconnection between episodes and games [i](thus requiring all new characters for each episode (this would be a mistake))[/i] or it needs more threads linking chapters together [i](the right choice).[/i] In the end it stands somewhere in the middle, and takes a huge hit because of this.

In this same vein, there is a lack of frontloading which cuts into overall game impact. Many characters are introduced to be big names in the world of Ace Attorney, major characters that [i]Phoenix[/i] is aware of and has pre-established opinions on. Despite this, there’s little effort in the writing and world-building to lay the groundwork for how [i]we as the player[/i] should feel when we meet said characters. For example, the incredible prowess of Edgeworth and his ability as a prosecutor is supposed to be something we fear and are in awe of, but there’s little in the game to help establish this feeling, so the first showdown against him in the courtroom is less impactful than it should be. This is something (funnily enough) the [i]anime[/i] does a lot better, which undoubtedly is because it was produced years after the games, and a reflection that many were dissatisfied with the lack of frontloading. This is a reoccurring issue in Ace Attorney, particularly with rival prosecutors!

One major success of Ace Attorney though is the internal logic of the game. [u]This isn’t to say that the game makes a lot of sense in the real world or even slightly resembles what a courtroom is like in real life.[/u] Ace Attorney is a wildly stupid game in terms of its attempts to replicate anything close to a normal court setting and trials. But Ace Attorney [i]is[/i] consistent with its game logic. That is to say, once you start to understand how the game works, you can follow the flow pretty well. You learn [u]how Ace Attorney wants you to think[/u], but despite this, the writers still manage to pull the rug out from under your feet time and time again with total hilarity and absurdity. This is how Ace Attorney avoids being a frustrating experience. This position is supported by the fact that when I looked up hints on walkthrough sites I often said, [i]“Oh! I should’ve known that!”[/i] as opposed to, [i]”How the heck would I have guessed that?”[/i]

There is also a good sense of expansion and development between each installment. Game one is quite limited in terms of the game features. You talk to people, search for clues during investigation periods, and press witnesses and highlight contradictions in the courtroom. In game two, however, you have the [i]psyche-lock[/i] system which provides more of the interrogation part of the game that is so fun and provides a lot more frequent switch between the two typed of gameplay that help improve the sometimes slow and drawn-out parts of the games.

On that note though, this makes the DLC chapter in game 1 particularly weird. As it was developed years after the release of game 1 originally, it feels [i]extremely[/i] out of place with few recurring characters, several new systems for a singular chapter, and a totally different kind of internal logic to that which you had experienced up until that point. Again, Ace Attorney’s biggest failure is its consistency.

One way Ace Attorney [u]is[/u] superbly consistent however, is its soundtrack. [i]Holy moly,[/i] these soundtracks are [u]absolute bops.[/u] Game 1 has one of the most fitting soundtracks I’ve ever heard for any game ever, and the sound [i]effects[/i] are all top notch, too. I started off not loving the soundtrack to game 2, but then it really grew on me, and I find myself feeling the same way about game 3’s sounds, too. They’re really satisfying and contribute greatly to the enjoyment of every moment.

Here you have a trilogy that is not flawless [i]by any stretch of the imagination[/i]. There are weird consistency issues between character relationships, story threads, chapter quality, and so on. Despite these shortcomings, when Ace Attorney is at its best, which is more often than not, it’s a hell of a series and can be a really enthralling experience to even the folks like myself who are not typically fans of visual novels. Incredibly memorable characters, hilarious animations, and tons of wacky moments provide a fun and [i]lengthy[/i] experience. Game 1 alone is so good and [i]long[/i] that it makes buying this at full price a worthwhile investment. At that point, you can consider the two other games icing on the ridiculous cake that is Ace Attorney.

But, for what it's worth, it's still the great games we've all enjoyed and a very solid story and gameplay loop. However, replayability is extremely low. I play the original game every like year to 2 years, and I still remember the story beat for beat, and the evidence I need for the trial to the point that many cases I don't even have to wonder where to press or object, and go a full case without a single penalty. That's only true of the first game for me, but still, even so, it shows the replayability is low. Very low. Like any graphic novel really. If it's on sale, for 15$, Pick it up. It is so worth it.

The music fits the game perfectly, with just a few reoccurring themes for various story beats. The most iconic example being the ""objection"" theme playing after an expectant pause when you found the contradiction in a witness' testimony, which theme lulled you in while thinking hard about which piece of evidence would proof a statement wrong is in itself very memorable. It even has a faster paced allegro version to let you know when shit is about to get real.
The animation is as limited as it can get, but is so on point that it leaves nothing to be desired. It brings the characters to life with unique and expressive poses that perfectly portray the character. This acting and their design itself gives you a pretty good idea how their voices would sound. All emphasized by the screen shakes and sound effects the developers use to full potential.

This Trilogy offers a perfect set of villains, the perfect rival caracter and the most likeable protagonist I ever had the honour to play. Phoenix Wright is the guy you always root for, he is never frustrating as all what he does and says you support entirely. The cases differ in quality but are solid in general. Maybe you have to pull through the occasional weak one, but I assure you it is worth it, as the best trials are waiting at the end of each game.

I was deciding if I should buy this game or not during one of the Steam sales, since a few of my friends happened to really like the Ace Attorney series, and well....

I became obsessed with it. For starters, the characters are funny, memorable, and amazing, and the soundtrack instantly became one of my favorite game soundtracks. This game creates suspension that makes you more and more invested in wanting to discover the truth and (hopefully) solve everyone's problems. It also likes to make references, jokes, and the characters enjoy making fun of each other.

The games are all visual novels with minor adventure-game exploration segments and an emphasis on courtroom showdowns to reveal the culprit and cut through their lies. 

Get your lawyer’s badge ready as we push papers and wag fingers in this wacky crime visual novel. 



[h1]STORY[/h1]
Being a trilogy pack, the story follows the titular character as he begins as a rookie defense lawyer up until he becomes a seasoned veteran. Overall, the stories are all very fun and unique. In this universe, all crimes must have a verdict within 3 days. In court, both the defense and prosecution will argue their stances to the judge who will hand down the final verdict to the defendant. 

It is Phoenix’s job to get his client found not guilty. All the cases are homicides, so the game does lack variety in terms of case types. Nonetheless, each is filled with a very colorful cast of characters to entertain you on your journey. 

That being said, there certainly are a few cases and characters that are poorly written or annoying. Due to the game being linear, it is sometimes a slog to get through a particular trial or cross examination/interview as the game requires you to have a firm understanding of the events of each case in order to progress. 

When a case is well-written, it is a gripping drama. When it isn’t, it is a bit hard to want to continue. With 14 episodes to explore, there is quite a lot to see and do although I definitely dreaded having to revisit some. 

For the most part, each case is episodic, following a new cast of characters in each case. However, a common theme is that the penultimate case is usually related to the final case of the game and makes Phoenix question himself. Although Phoenix wants to become a great defense attorney, all his cases will shape him in one way or another in the end. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2326779424


[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
As a visual novel, the game is 90% reading with 9% being adventure game item hunting for case clues. The remaining 1% are simple mini-games scattered about. Each case begins with an opening cinematic to give a brief glimpse at its context. Afterwards, you interact with your case assistant and begin your case investigation for day 1. 

You are offered a choice of locales to visit, however some require a certain trigger to be met before unlocking. 

Once you are in a map, you can click the screen to have Phoenix investigate the space, usually to get a clue or receive a funny or quirky comment on it. Once you have gotten all important pieces of evidence and testimonies, you progress to court day 1.

In “Justice for All”, a new minigame is introduced called “psyche locks.” This is simply an out-of-court version of countering their lies with evidence in order to get an important clue or info. 

In court, you will have to guide the case to the truth by questioning witnesses, evaluating the legitimacy of evidence and contending with the prosecution’s harassment and subterfuges. 

First, the judge/ prosecutor gives a case overview and introduces the first witness. The witness gives their testimony to the court. Afterwards, you can “press” a witness for more info to amend a testimony to become more accurate, leading you closer to the truth. 

Once you find an inconsistency in their testimony, you open your evidence list and “present” the relevant evidence. This typically leads the witness to realize their mistake (whether intentional or not) and the case progresses. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2326786232
Sometimes the prosecutor or judge will ask you to elaborate on the evidence and you are presented with a simple multiple-choice question to see if your line of though is correct. In this trilogy, if you are incorrect in either your presented evidence or the contended testimony or choice, you will lose health/ “confidence” from your bar. 

You have 10 pips in total and penalties have varying amounts of damage. Wrong evidence usually costs 1 pip but there are dire moments where the wrong answer leads to an instant game over. 

On that note, the variable writing quality comes up again as evidence and logic hinges entirely on the quality of the case. There are some questions or testimonies that are rather obtuse about what is wrong and trial-and-error spamming of evidence is not uncommon. 

Similarly, some investigation scenes are annoying as the next progression step is unclear. This is usually resolved by showing someone every single thing in your inventory, but there are some scenes where you will have to pixel hunt for a separate interaction prompt in order to get a new clue.  

Cases typically run into the final 3rd day with Phoenix having to re-interview witnesses or look around for new clues. Otherwise, the gameplay loop is the same: find a contradictory testimony, present refuting evidence, answer the prosecution, and reach a non-guilty verdict. This isn’t a terribly exciting or innovative gameplay loop; however, it is the writing and characters that carry the series. 



[h1]VISUALS[/h1]
This trilogy eschews the pixel graphics of the original GBA and DS versions for smoother and more hi-res character portraits/ busts. Overall, everyone looks great although I do miss the nostalgic feel of everything being pixilated. The same can be said about the backgrounds/ locales which received a facelift. Everything definitely feels clearer and smoother now. 

The game also scales properly at 2k resolution which is very welcome.

The game retains all the interesting and wacky character designs from the originals. It is definitely a trip to see some of the more outlandish ones and have to interrogate them in a court of law.   
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2326777839 


[h1]AUDIO[/h1]
The trilogy retains the same music of the original as well with its GBA soundfont. It was definitely nostalgic to hear the “Objection” and “Pursuit” themes again in the first game. Sound effects are overall pretty good, each fitting the attached action well.   



[h1]PERFORMANCE[/h1]
Overall, I had no issue whatsoever with the game. As expected of a visual novel, the overall level of system, graphical and other options is quite sparse. However, none of this affected my ability to enjoy the game. 



[h1]AS A COLLECTION/ RE-RELEASE[/h1]
The games use a new font which is much clearer and cleaner than the handheld's. 16:9 resolution also works as intended.  

One option I wish was included was a chapter select menu. Sometimes I just wanted to replay a particular investigation day or trial day. However, you can only select the overall chapter once you clear it- you have to start over form the very beginning each time. 

Likewise, you only get 10 save slots total. While way more than the handheld versions, I couldn't make a save point for every chapter for easy access for a later time. 

However, I am overall very happy to have all 3 games in 1 convenient package and this is a great purchase for new and returning players. 



[h1]OVERALL[/h1]
Phoenix Wright was my first introduction to visual novels. Having replayed some of it, it definitely still stands up (barring the more annoying cases). This is a series about friendship, truth, determination and much more. He may have fallen to immeasurable depths of despair before, but he has risen anew like his namesake and fights to protect others. Gameplay is very simple, but engaging nonetheless. 

At the end of the day, the game is really about trying your hardest despite all of life’s complications. That, or you shouldn’t become an anime lawyer.

I have few gripes about the game. The characters and writing are fun and memorable, though perhaps leaning into the cheesy at times. My only notable gripe is the lack of diverse investigation technique. Only Case 5 of the first game introduces something new to the table. Aside from that, I always enjoyed how cathartically a case would resolve, revealing the whole truth. 
Personally, my favorite case in terms of trial and investigation is Case 5 of game 1. It has a great cast of characters, alongside my favorite villain to hate. The evidence used in that case was challenging and engaging. For me, Case 5 is the pinnacle of the Ace Attorney. It alone sold me on my purchase.",1608950057,1608950057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Main gameplay was fun for me. Talk to characters, collect evidence, and use your thinker to apply them.
I found some parts a bit weird in terms of its logic, but maybe I just have peanut brain. This rarely happened though and most  of the time it feels very satisfying to apply the evidence you collect to contradict the witness and prosecutor.

The highlight of this game is easily the character. Over the course of the three games you meet a wide variety of wacky fellows and each one is memorable and entertaining. The character design is top notch and filled with creativity. One small gripe I have is that some character appear a bit too often and they can wear on you a little bit. I very much preferred meeting new character over revisiting the old.

The stories in these games are very entertaining. Each one has a very simple formula of a seemingly clear cut case slowly unraveling to find a more unexpected truth. Despite this repeated formula, each time always plays out in fun and unexpected ways. Every story move in creative directions that keep you on your toes and I found the stories in all the games enjoyable and fun. In some cases the stories can provide a bit of emotion.

Music in this game is also great and makes the courtroom scenes feel hype.

Very great games. I would say each game is better than the last in the trilogy.

I'm not too big on point and click visual novels - I think they're boring and generic - but Ace Attorney, or at the very least these three games are filled with charming and lovable characters that most of the time are incredibly funny, but can also have their emotional moments. Even if there are a few awful cases in these three games that can, at times, make you not want to finish the game at all, the best moments, such as the final case of JFA and the second case in T&T, always find a way to subvert your expectations, and are all cleverly written. I'm really glad I bought this game without any prior knowledge or interest in the series, as I went in completely blind, and was incredibly surprised with what I received. My only real advice is that if you want to go for all the achievements in this game (which is really easy to do), you basically NEED to follow a guide otherwise you'll miss out on plenty of them, and have to restart cases from the very start.

It's likely that even outside of gaming circles, you've heard of Ace Attorney before. The games are absolute classics that have made their mark on the world and influenced pop culture to there and back again to the point where you can find references to them everywhere. Ace Attorney is iconic.

But is it really that good? Simply put, yes! Absolutely.

Playing as a young man named Phoenix Wright, you navigate your way through your career as a defense attorney, tearing apart the smallest contradictions in testimonies to prove your clients' innocence and find the real killer, investigating crime scenes and running into a colorful cast of recurring characters along the way.

The writing is very smart. The cases are all put together wonderfully, the pacing is perfect, the jokes are all hilarious (seriously, these are some of the funniest games I've ever played), and the characters and incredibly likable and human.

I think the characters are easily the best part of this series. We came to solve fun mysteries, and stayed for the characters and their relationships with one another. Of course we enjoy finding out who the real killer is and how they did it, but what we really want to know is if Phoenix and Edgeworth are going to rekindle their friendship or what's going to happen to the Fey clan next. What happens to these characters will move you and make you feel deeply to the point where you're on the edge of your seat praying for their safety.

I found myself liking pretty much every character except Godot, but aside from myself, fans seem to love every single character except the villains, who we're supposed to hate so that checks out. The characters all feel uniquely human and real, and they'll worm their way into your hearts so you'll never forget them and will be pleasantly surprised when they show up in later installments.

The gameplay is something special. It's rather simplistic, you have a few buttons you can press to make a few decisions but most of the time you're just reading text. Despite that though, it's still incredibly engaging and you'll be biting your nails trying to figure out the right choices. And once you do make the right choices? Man, does it feel [i]powerful.[/i] When the iconic ""objection"" rings out, Phoenix slams his hands down on the desk, and the music cuts out, you know things are going down, and you feel proud of yourself that you were able to figure it out.

And of course, while it's not the top feature, the cases are wonderful too. There's nothing like a good murder mystery, and when [i]you're[/i] the one who's responsibility it is to solve it, you can get really into it. They're all engaging and creative mysteries with a unique cast that will keep you on your toes trying to figure it out.

The Ace Attorney games are iconic cornerstones in gaming history filled with great mysteries, fun gameplay, and compelling characters (all of which you can pick up for an excellent price) that deserve all of the hype they get. If you're interested, or even if you aren't I [i]implore[i] you to pick up the trilogy.",1600133903,1605948755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite how relatively ""dated"" the original trilogy of Ace Attorney games are (and I shall forever be upset with myself that I never bothered to play the original games when I had the chance years ago) in comparison to their later counterparts, and indeed, other games of a similar design/approach, there's just something about the first three titles of the Ace Attorney series that makes them downright impossible to dislike - impossible to not enjoy. Perhaps it's the way the cases are structured; perhaps it's the very anime nature of the characters themselves; or, perhaps it's the otherwise crazed design of the setting itself, being an odd mis-mash of America and Japan. It's probably all of it, and more.

You're an attorney, and your goal is to help clients who have no hope. The gameplay comes in two different flavors: a point-and-click style investigation stage, complete with characters to talk to and environments to explore, and a dialogue-based trial stage, where you piece everything from the investigations together. 

There are some weird quirks about the logic and court proceedings of this game, but I feel like it's easy to get a handle on what they expect from you, for the most part. I do, however, think that some of the conclusions you're meant to come to are kind of a stretch, and I feel like this game is best played with a hints guide to help you along. (I've certainly needed it, be it that I'm drawing a complete blank or that I feel as though my solution won't work when, indeed, it will.) 

Anyways, if you could tell, I do think it's pretty difficult in a lot of places (sometimes to the point of being completely unfair...), though they also nail some things so far into your head... Like teaching you that pepper makes people sneeze by making not one, not two, but THREE people sneeze when presented with pepper... Along with an explanation about how pepper makes people sneeze. Thanks....

I also thought some plotpoints were ridiculous and cheesy at first (like the final case of the 2nd game, which I've currently just finished), but the resolutions have generally been really satisfying to make up for it, in my opinion. 

(Also, can we not make an 8-year-old channel the spirit of an adult who turns the body of whoever she's possessing into her own? It's a little wacky bro. And also can we not have a 16-yo be proposed to by one 21-year-old man and a puppet controlled by a 30-year-old man? :') )",1604869795,1604869795,True,2,0,0.526038587093353271,0,True,False,False

This is a trilogy of visual novel/point and click games about a defense attorney and his group of friends defending wacky clients where you NEED to think. Amazing story with highly likeable characters, great writing full of plot twists and satisfying moments. Great soundtrack that really adds to the investigation and courtroom atmosphere, the point and click gameplay consist mostly about finding and presenting evidence, reading funny dialogue and most of all thinking well on the correct answer. The game really uses minimal animation focused on poses that really emphasizes the personality of each character with plenty of shaking and sound effects that gives the game more ""umph"" to the situations and atmosphere. Love that!

Although, I got really impressed with the quality of the cases that the 3 games offers, I have some critisism. For example, there are various instances where you get stuck in the investigations parts, maybe because you forgot certain clue or didn't presented certain evidence to ""x"" character so there is some backtracking when it comes to his linear progress. Also can happen in court, that lets say, you know where is the contradiction but you haven't pressed enough to present another line of testimony or you get lost on what line should you present the evidence to continue and not lose health. Oh I haven't told you about the health bar, you can save and load whenever you want so the health bar wasn't a thing to be stressed about. Also in the last case of the first game, somehow the story of that case has some plot holes that you might find. Might be because that last case didn't exist in the original game, but they added that one on the release on the Nintendo DS so idk. BUT DO NOT LET THESE THINGS STOP YOU

I never played any visual novel games before mostly because the gameplay gets really minimalize in favor of the storytelling but, with Phoenix Wright Ace Attourney Trilogy, it really delivered a nice balance of storytelling and gameplay, im not used to use playthrough guides but i had to use it at a few certain times, to not get stuck or to be sure i was right and not screw up, again i dont really use guides...
 but i had a lot of fun, haven't found any bugs and I was really inmersed in the world. So of course i will keep playing the rest of the games. My mind got blown away.

All the characters feel alive and part of the world which makes the game feel like a great overarching epic rather than being slammed with different cases and random faces that wont matter which end of the gavel they finish on. The investigations and sense of urgency aren't as good as Danganronpa but I think that can be attributed to it's pursuit of realism. Danganronpa just has wild things that wouldn't make sense in a modern day world aiming for realistic representation. As trials go on, the majority of the evidence gets produced after the trial is near the halfway point, in which you have to go back and investigate the crime scenes again, which limits the player from being able to place suspicion. This creates an effect of just expecting to be spoon fed the real answer later on, which in my opinion makes a lot of parts of the trials feel pointless. When you are able to be in the action figuring out the real truth, it does deliver and does quite well.

I spent about half an hour attempting to come up with an excuse for why, but I just can’t think of any. I guess I just don't like reading... However, there's one series that I've always wanted to try and that's 'Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney'. After playing the first case at a friend's house, I bit the bullet and gave the trilogy a shot. Now that I've donned the blue suit and stepped into the courtroom, does this game deserve the heaps of praise it gets? Yeah, kinda. 

For those who don't know, in 'Ace Attorney' you play as Pheonix Wright, the Ace Attorney (and also detective I guess). Your clients have been accused of that most heinous of crimes: murder. It's up to you to defend these poor saps in court while also gathering enough clues to figure out who the true culprit is. I’ll start by saying that I really like this dynamic because even though you're an ""attorney"" you also get to play the role of the prosecutor when you find the [i]real[/i] bad-guy and attempt to indict them instead. You start each case on the backfoot and slowly shift from defense to offense. It keeps things fresh. 

I guess now’s a good time to mention that if you're looking for a realistic judicial/mock trial experience you ain't gonna find it here. 'Ace Attorney' is pretty over the top and silly, but honestly I wouldn't have it any other way. Each case has its own unique twists and mysteries to unravel. Things are rarely ever as they seem, and oftentimes, the most implausible explanation for something is what actually happened. It’s like all the criminals in this universe bought the Dick Dastardly book on villainy. 

The obvious draw of this game lies with its characters, and I’m not just talking about how they’re written. The character sprites in 'Ace Attorney' are amazing, full stop. I never got tired of watching Victor Kudo smack his bulbous nose or Oldbag shoot her toy ray gun. The animators did such a great job with each and every character. Excitement, anger, stress, defeat; these emotions are communicated beautifully through just a few simple frames of animation. The best animations happen when Phoenix proves who the real culprit is. Once they realize they’ve lost, the villains always have this amazing breakdown that acts as a massive emotional release at the end of each case. It’s brilliant. 

The individual cases are (generally) really engaging nuggets of storytelling, but what’s really impressive is how ‘Phoenix Wright’ weaves a narrative thread throughout the entire trilogy. This thread is largely constructed by the prosecutors that you square off with. Miles, Franziska, and Godot are superbly written and provide some of the best back and forths in the entire trilogy. This game is packed with genuinely emotional moments. Even when the story veers into the absurd the sentiment still felt convincing, kind of like a Broadway play. There were times when I really felt for both the defendants and the culprits. I even got a little watery during the third game’s final act. 

Most cases aren’t airtight, and this rule also applies to videogames. I do have a few issues with ‘Ace Attorney’ that I’ll briefly go through now. For starters, it seems like the same level of care that was given to the character animations was [i]not[/i] applied to the backgrounds. Other than the iconic courtroom scene, most of the other settings in the game are kinda bland looking. Though I guess this is alright, as it makes it easier to spot important pieces of evidence. The soundtrack is also pretty hit or miss. Sometimes the music is exquisite, like in the iconic track ‘Cornered’ or in ‘The Fragrance of Dark Coffee’. Other times the music is loud and grating, like in the first game’s ‘Moderato 2001’ or in ‘Happy People’ (god, I fucking [i]hate[/i] that song). 

Lastly, I think the player should have the option to load to the beginning of a given trial day. This is because I managed to soft-lock my game after saving in a bad spot. I couldn’t just restart the day’s trial, so I had to start the [i]entire[/i] case over again. This was particularly grating because it was the longest case in the trilogy… There is nothing I hate more than being forced to repeat a large chunk of a game that I’ve already done. This incident almost soured me on the whole experience. 

[i]almost[/i]

However, even I couldn’t deny that ‘Phoenix Wright’ had me in the palm of his hand. I was too invested to quit, so I slogged through that entire case all over again (which was worth it). Honestly, the whole trilogy is worth it; I just had to see it all through to the bitter end. If you’re in the market for a deductive visual novel with charming characters and a gripping story, you really can’t go wrong with ‘Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney’. I must say, it feels good to have fulfilled my reading quota for the decade. See you in ten years.

The graphics have been enhanced to feature the actual artwork and it supports various resolutions. This game is however stuck at 16:9 aspect ratio, due to the nature of this being a 2D drawn visual novel. Altough, I remember the DS versions having you pan across the entire screen to see the full drawing. Regardless, seeing the full artwork all at once makes the gameplay experience way more smooth.

Other than changing the resolution, you can also set 3 transparency levels for text boxes (None, low and high).
