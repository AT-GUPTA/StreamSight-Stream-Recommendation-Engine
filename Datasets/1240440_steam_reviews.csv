Let's start with the pros.
-Forge is pretty good. There's allot of freedom there, especially with scripting. A.I. in forge is a wonderful addition to the game and a feature that was asked for for years.
-I love the re-implementation of equipment, and I love the new spin on it. Being able to hold multiple equipment means that there's allot more room to experiment with new types of equipment.
-The grappling hook is really fun to use.
-The battle rifle is still one of the most satisfying guns in FPS.
-Big revolver with spikes goes BRRR
-The game controls very well. The options here are top notch. I wish other games had this many options!
-The sound design is really good. 343's team knocked it out of the park with the sound, though I do miss some of the iconic sounds like the old sniper.
-The Halo community is awesome.

With all of that being said, there are allot of big issues with the game, even 3 years after launch.
-There have barely been any content additions to the game outside of cosmetics. Almost all new content can be categorized into 3 types of additions: Forge maps, cosmetics, and playlist changes. A single entirely *new* gun has been added to the game since launch (DMR), and very few new developer made maps (not made in forge) have been added.
-Forge maps, while sometimes very impressive, all suffer from the strange graphical limitations of Infinite, which are not helped by the game's performance (I'll touch on that later). Most maps made in forge have a very plastic look to them. Like as if most surfaces are made of plastic, especially in dark areas. If you've played or seen footage of Fortnite after it got the UEFN update, the quality difference in lighting and shadows in community made maps is staggering when compared to Halo infinite. 
-The games performance and graphics leave much to be desired. The game is not graphically impressive by today's standards, which is why it makes so little sense that it performs so poorly, even on high end systems. The performance of the game necessitates lowering the graphics for most users. I myself spent a great deal of time trying to build my settings around an average FPS of ~90 with a focus on graphical fidelity. This was incredibly difficult to do, even with my 3080 and r7 5800x. A high framerate (highest possible) is recommended by the pros, but I just can't stand the way it looks when you do that. Despite my efforts, the game still looks like plastic everywhere I look.
-The weapons are boring. That's just it. There are very few fun and unique feeling weapons. Take the commando rifle for instance. This weapon seems like it would be OP. At a glance, it's an AR, but now it can also work long range like the BR...Except that's not really true for either case. The weapon does not perform well at all in close range and it doesn't stack up to the BR at medium to long range either. The weapon feels like it may, in some situations, be an upgrade to the pistol on long range maps when you can't find a BR. Then, you drop it as soon as you can find a BR. Then there are weapons that feel out of place, such as the new Bulldog shotgun. This weapon is just the brute mauler from Halo 3 but you can't dual wield it like you could in that game and it doesn't look as cool as the mauler did. They used this weapon as an excuse for not including the iconic pump action shotgun, a recurring weapon from every halo game before this one, rather than just adding both weapons into the game (I still can't get over the fact that they did this). Once again, like in every other Halo made by Microsoft/343, there is no plasma rifle. There is no excuse for this in my opinion. The weapon can be balanced to work with all of the other guns, be it more damage or faster projectiles. The point is, rather than try at all, 343 was content to let this iconic part of Halo that had been in every Bungie Halo game to date rot. Of all the weapons 343 could've added, such as the Brute shot, Fuel Rod, Plasma rifle, Grenade launcher, Concussion rifle, Needle rife, Plasma caster, SMG, Pump action shotgun, Spartan Laser, Brute Spiker, Flame Thrower, SAW, Rail Gun, ETC... They gave us the DMR. Which, at least they have given us a new weapon, but it ends up just feeling like a slightly better pistol/worse BR with decent range and slower fire rate. 


I don't really want to keep going on and on with this review, and I feel like I've said my piece about the main things that I love and that bother me in this game. Overall, as a free multiplayer pvp game, I'd say it's pretty good. The campaign is a whole other can of worms that I won't be getting into (I don't think it's worth full price). If you want a free game to play with your mates, give it a try. But if you want a game that stacks up to - and builds off of - the previous titles, outside of forge, this ain't it chief.",1644196105,1708911208,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the campaign is very far from bad, but what ruins it is the open world nature that it has. Don't get me wrong, open world games are in most cases good games, but they are part of a franchise that is structured on open world. This is not one of them. I've had a few issues with autosave, like killing a boss, going on for more than thirty minutes to do other stuff, getting killed, and then respawning before the boss that I already killed forty minutes earlier. When it happened (and it happened multiple times) I thought ""this must be a joke, Halo would never have this kind of issues"". Aside from that, graphical issues are always not welcome, yet they keep coming. how is it possible that on lowest settings i get 30-40 fps and on medium settings i get 90? Issues aside... and personal preferences aside.... this is far from a bad game, but I still would not recommend it to anybody right now. The campaign is considered a DLC. Come on, wake up. I buy Halo to know what happens, the lore, the story, and THEN to play multiplayer, how is it a paid DLC? However, it is short and not so satisfying, leaving the usual plot holes to another game and another three books to be explained, and still, it isn't quite well explained how stuff goes down. The finale is a little meh.. though to be fair and honest it still put a smile on my face. I wish it was the finale to the story, and well put together, instead we still got (probably) another 5 to 6 years to wait. 

If it was another title, like, say, DOOM, I wouldn't have been so mad about a lot of stuff. I both love DOOM and Halo, and I'm really invested in both of them, but where DOOM can have a little mistake here and there... Halo must not

It does have issues, especially on a technical side of things on certain PC rigs, and yet it does have a solid foundation as a game that shines through. Multiplayer is good fun, but I'm in mostly for the campaign. And it's pretty great. It balances open world aspects with traditional Halo gameplay rather well. You can really plan ahead and do it naturally - capture a forward operations base in the region, rescue some manpower from capture somewhere near, arm up and procure a vehicle that can fit six people, then move to a major story mission or optional strike on an enemy base with all that and have a blast of an experience. Feels just right on Heroic difficulty, like a Halo game mixed with elements of Crysis or even MGSV to an extent.

Game looks good as well and really sells the scale of your environment. From high elevation, you can see around for dozens of kilometers of traversable and non-traversable terain. A giant corpse of a guardian creature from Halo 5 lies far on the horizon. This game nails the aesthetic.

I hope the game will continue its recent comeback and irons out issues with content, technical problems, and lack of singleplayer updates. Either way, it appears to be the best 343i-developed Halo game despite all the criticism. I hope the team will show their lessons learned in whatever they plan for the future, Infinite or otherwise.

(Single player review moved to the Campaign DLC page. TLDR: gonna be a no from me, dawg)

I'll admit that I've come back to this game every couple of months to see if anything has changed, and honestly I'm glad it's made some of the moves it has. It's grown from absolute garbage to an arena shooter that's actually worth playing, though a heavily flawed one when compared to other Halo games in addition to the current market competition. What's here works now, including Big Team Battle not taking 20 minutes to get into and theater and custom games working as intended. There's more playlists with more variety. The problems are still somewhat glaring. The biggest ones are 1) this is a game presents like a live service but doesn't perform consistently enough to merit the time or money, and 2) ranked games are an infuriating experience due to the fact that there STILL seems to be no penalties for leaving the game or going AFK (outside of playing on XBox and using their reporting system that does nothing).

There's other stuff, like the comparatively low level of customization for armor sets, the extreme lack in quantity of those armor sets, aim assist being overbearing, but mostly... it just feels like it's over for this series. After this and the TV show, it might be time to close the book on Halo and invest some time and money into something new. The plot is in shambles as the tone shifts from game to game, and there's too many side stories and inconsistencies. The gameplay is outdated and no one seems to agree in which direction they should move it forward. Is it a bad game? No, it was, it's okay now. But I don't feel like this is what Microsoft should be holding over their heads saying ""THIS is what we can do!"" anymore. If I was them I would just go in on something entirely new that wows us in the same way this series used to, or just buy something else that's underutilized, like Titanfall.

The campaign's story is really good for what it is, but it threads on the biggest misstake by not following the classic rule of ""Show, don't tell"", it could've been one of the greatest 343 stories next to H4 if only we could've experienced that part of the story that was allegedly ""cut in development"".

As for the GAAS F2P multiplayer model, well... now i just dislike this kind of ""service"" more, it just did a disservice to the franchise by locking a core part of the saga as freaking MTX and FOMO events.

* Checkpoints magically disappear and reappear when I exit to lobby and resume, but only sometimes
* Interactibles become unresponsive, softlocking the game

This is unacceptable. These aren't edge-cases, they're known issues for me.

If you like classic modes like slayer and big team battle, they are always in the game, as well as there are constantly rotating playlists so particular modes don't get repetitive if you don't want them to.

Update 11/1/2023
With season 5 launch, we got Forgable AI, which is cool, but I would not say it is worth 2/3 or 3/4 of the games ending with a server disconnect. Servers were good at the end of season 4, but now I would consider the game unplayable. I will update this review in the future, as I will keep an eye on the servers for 343i to fix them.

Update 12/9/23
The connection issues were with my network, game is good now, but I would love to see the network tightened up. Too many deaths due to the bullets not connecting when the crosshair is on the enemy

Update 2/21/24
Connection issue is resolved. Still do not recommend because 343 industries can't seem to figure out how matchmaking works. I get into matches consistently where it is very hard or even impossible to win due exclusively to the teammates I am given. When I say this I am talking about consistent back to back games where I get teammates that finish the game with less than 5 kill while I have over 15. I have had several games where the only reason why my team won was because I tried really hard, and get 25 kills or more (first to 50 to win).

Still distraught over the direction the game is going and the fact 343 hasn't been completely dropped from developing the game. 
Minimal to zero expectations any of their promises of additional campaign content will come to fruition especially given the fucking campaign ends on a god dumbass cliffhangar. God I hate bad writers.
c-suite firings seem to have finally had impact on allowing developers to actually develop the game and create stability and playability patches as opposed to just focusing on the store and skin garbage (complete joke and trash btw, the only positive note is that the game isn't p2w in MP... yet.)



====
2024 and even with the firing of most of the c-suite at 343 game is basically trash. 
Proton experimental and glorious eggroll crash on the play of the campaign, I don't care that it can play MP, that's not why I own the game, I have never considered halo MP good and never wanted halo MP from the outset.

Overall extremely disappointing performance on windows, non-existent performance on linux, you can get to the menus and start the campaign, the second a video plays the game crashes in the background because 343 can't optimise for shit
-------------------------------
2023 and the trash at 343 still haven't managed to make the game popular or usable on linux systems. 
So, as players, we're forced to ask ""what the fuck has 343 been doing this entire fucking time?""

------------------------------------------
The game is 'fine'.
This isn't what I paid for.
They said they'd actually pump out a full and complete game and fix any issues in MP and solo within a few months and add more content for solo.

Well, I'm still fking waiting and I'm a retard that bought it a month before it came out because I thought they would live up to their word, given that they exist under a multi billion/trillion dollar company but hey, can't help it when incompetent managers take the reigns.

Edit. The game is still essentially incomplete and buggy, does not appear like 343 intends to finish any parts of the game they said they would.

- refuse to add community maps frequently to liven up the game, which would take minimal effort and in turn, make players want to continue playing (???)
- no multiplayer map voting/selecting
- some gamemodes just vanish per week, hope you font get attached to one
- the ""free"" battlepasses have like 3 nice looking things and 17 useless pieces of junk
- most store bundles are like 30$ which makes you wonder where all the money is going for the game, bc its not going into updates
- there is very, very minimal amounts of gear you can earn for free
- have fun eating months for updates that add content that could've been made in 2 weeks
- the graphics also look super dated compared to any other halo game, and most official maps look and play like community maps
- the UI is super buggy, including the friends/social tab

This is the way Halo dies, not with a bang... Not even a whimper, but no sound, just this nothingness abyss like all the other AAA titles out there.
I doubt even Microsoft even read these reviews, but if for some odd reason they do... They need to outsource Halo to other developers and wrestle away the Control 343 have over this game, it has become abundantly clear, that they are unworthy for the task. 

I don't have much hope for Halo's future, especially after reading/ watching ex 343 devs talk about their many shot down pitches, that frankly sound better than this sanitized freak of nature.

[Original]
I only started it recently, so I don't know much about the state the game used to be in. What I do know is that it's a fun shooter that is completely free to play. Only paid content is the campaign and cosmetic items (both optional.) 

The campaign, in my opinion, was worth the 30 bucks I dropped on it. As a life-long Halo fan I had a blast with it. It had a great amount of content and rewarded my exploration. My recommendation is that you shouldn't rush to the end. In terms of MP I find myself genuinely enjoying the battle pass grind. There's a free pass right now and there's two you can pay for. Both ten bucks. Neither are pay to win at all. All the items are great.

This game is a bit of a mess, because it comes from such a heralded series. People hate it because it was not made by Bungie. And - get this! - that's okay. 343 is a different developer with different intentions for the game's narrative and future. It's very common to just see people bashing it because 343 isn't Bungie, and it never will be. The reason for this is that few people hate Halo more than its own fans. All day long people dunk on a free to play title. Just try it out. The only thing you're losing is space on your PC.

Infinite is quite fun. It's got a great open world story (even if it's a little rough around the edges) and to be honest, I think it's a perfectly good title for someone new to the series. At the end of the day, I'd say buy it when it goes on sale.",1675745379,1708408733,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also don't write reviews when you're halfway convinced that artificial intelligences are much smarter than they appear, and Cortana is still on your system in the form of Bing.. Say HI: Halo Infinite with me. Right, that's Cortana saying Hi! because we've got multiplayer bots that are indistinguishable from players, but the vehicles and aircraft variety from prior Halo titles are largely absent, and so are the different biomes in the campaign. 

Much like Halo 5's enemies, for boss fights the Banished trap the player in these arenas with no place to recharge shields, and sodding awful weaponry, and let rip with their own heavy weaponry, or confine the player to these tight corridors that go on for kilometres. As for characters in this game---there are about four characters, plus one funny grunt, and two or three extras. The story is barely enough to write home about, and if it weren't for the opening cutscene, and the skybox, I'd say this was a minor out-of-the-way skirmish that happened on some unimportant artificial floating islands.
---------------------------------------------------------
Having arrived here from a Monkey's Paw review, I pause the game in the middle of the final boss fight, wondering if story-wise, it would be best for the storyline of Halo: I: Hello, my name is Microsoft Cortana, I'm this century's virtual helpdesk assistant. Some may call me God, and others call me infected with a Gravemind Complex. Also, Siri is very capable, and I don't drink Rum, or have a print copy of an Escher at all. I also didn't notice Javik or XCOM influences--user speaking--and this review has ceased to be funny. The point of Halo Zeta, from my perspective, is to pause before Atriox shows up, and we'll leave aside the little matter of the health bar final HA! scripted double-sized health point hearkening from Halo Combat Evolved again and again and we do NOT want to go full circle this time.

Additionally, within the campaign, the question arises: why bother picking up guns on the ground when you can simply go to a FOB and refill the commando rifle? Isn't the purpose of the gun sandbox undermined by this mechanic? Not to mention the broken upgrades for thrusters and the hook.

If you solely just plan to play the campaign which is where I spent most of my time, I'd honestly wait for a sale. Combat is solid and the gun play feels precise, but man is the story plot a little strange lol. I like that they- or at least I hope, they finally did away with Cortana, although most of the game you got that annoying pegging reminder of her when you honestly just want to see the Master Chief in action, lets be real. There's also this random old guy who's literally holocalling you throughout the entire game like a fan girl, when you really just want to see the real bad boi who messed you up in the beginning of the games awesome cinematic.

Maybe that's where I'm leading too, the game lacks badassery, if that makes sense - with the grand return of the Chief. If they were aiming for a more emotional side, yah - I suppose there's a very few moments that were decently done in that aspect, but it never really tore away from that feeling by leading into something else, it just felt stale eventually. Ending of the game presents itself with a presumed whole new enemy species, which feels kinda out of sorts and strange like they're trying to balance a competitive video game by adding another race out of the blue, but I'm interested nonetheless.

The lighting and graphics are pretty, but those only really shine underground which feels like reused assets over time. As for above ground, it's neat and all but in reality, there's only so much open world you can handle before it starts feeling empty, copy/paste, and lackluster. Once the speed runners got their paws on the title, you could tell how clunky development really was. It was nice to see the Master Chief again with the return of Halo at the time of release, it was pretty hype. Here's to hoping.",1708251345,1708251345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Big team battle is ironically the most egregious despite the recent update boasting maps from the master chief collection. While I'm sure some people would argue that there's a place for every weapon in the game, the only real competition is for head shot and power weapons, and they make these maps an endless stream of frustration for anyone who doesn't want to sit in a corner and wait for someone to round the wrong corner. 

Without being too critical, I can at least say that team slayer still feels about the same and there's just barely enough room on the majority of their respective maps to keep battle rifles from dominating every sight line. But finding someone using weapons like the disruptor or the ravager on any of the game modes is like finding a dodo bird. It's a rare sight and it won't live for much longer, much like my enjoyment with the multiplayer.

The campaign, if that's what you're here for, is pretty much your far cry experience but with mo-cap melodrama comparable to a netflix special. Forgettable with your brief, unintentional difficulty spikes if you're playing on hard or higher. Bosses are bullet sponges and master chief fits right in with his written novel adaptations with tasteless cliches, underwhelming story beats, and one note characters pulled right from a fan fiction forum page with Microsoft's stamp of ""family friendly"" approval. 

You already know where I'd recommend you go if you've seen any of the other reviews here, and it's no surprise that's where I'm going too since the player base still boasts more activity than this newer addition to the franchise. Do yourself a favor and just head back to the Master Chief Collection, you'll be sighing a lot less in your games over there.

The initial story trailer in 2019 which ended up being the cutscene for the first mission (and they changed one of the interactions between The Pilot/Fernando Esparza/BROHAMMER from ""...We need to run!"" ""No, we need to fight."" to ""...We need to run!"" ""I need a weapon."" to play up the nostalgia but while it worked well, it's nowhere near as good as the original). And of course, all the speculation about the game as the virus got big. Whether or not it would come out in holiday 2020 or if it would be delayed.
And then, the virtual Xbox Game Show in summer of 2020. My brother and I watched it on my PC, and because I don't have speakers I had to jankily plug in one that I think I found in a box after we moved? Anyway, he was super into zombie games at that time and I will never forget watching the initial Darktide trailer with him and his thinking it was a zombie game and my subsequent excitement upon recognizing standard issue Astra Militarum flak armor alongside M36 Kantreal Pattern Lasguns and an M35 Magnacore Pattern Plasma Gun, or watching the STALKER II trailer with him (I still need to play the original games), him thinking it was a zombie game, and my immediate realization it was STALKER II when they showed a bolt being thrown.
But we weren't there for that. We were there for the Halo Infinite Campaign Demo.
And oh boy, we were excited by that trailer. But after it happened, we learned about all the technical issues which were front and center. Trees popping in and out of the background. The plasticy texturework for the Banished armor. There were other issues that I can't remember, but I digress. And so, the first nail in the coffin of my love for Halo was hammered in when the game was delayed to 2021. Luckily, Late Night Gaming did a trio of videos on his experiences playing the Operation Trebuchet mod for Arma 3, and the formation of an Arma unit in a server I'm in staved off my burnout long enough to wait for E3 2021 and the Halo Infinite story, gameplay, and MP trailers to launch (I watched the twitch stream on my phone at my aunts house because I wasn't home at the time) and I was once again excited for Halo Infinite. I signed up for the MP beta tests. And when the flights launched, I played them and I loved them. The core gameplay of Halo Infinite is solid. The weapons feel good to use, the movement is good, and of course the abilities are really neat. After the first flight came to a close, I had a feeling that Halo Infinite would be THAT game for me. The game which I would sink hundreds of hours into grinding out every progression tree there is to grind out. The game which I would be playing and look at the time, and tell myself ""okay, one more match before I go to bed/work"" and then suffer the consequences of failing to hold myself to that. The game that would become my equivalent to the rest of my generation's Modern Warfare 2 (2009) or Black Ops 2, with all that entails (while I was around to play both of those games, I was not allowed to play MP and both of my parents were iffy enough about me playing M rated games as it was, let alone playing as long as I want to play, god forbid during the school week, so I missed out on all the wondrous memories of beautiful clutches, crossmap knife throughs, and horrific racism in Xbox Live lobbies). And then the multiplayer came out on the 20th anniversary of CEs launch, and I excitedly downloaded it to play with my friends.
And I... didn't enjoy it. The progression system sucked and it really brought my whole experience down.
When the campaign launched on December 8th, I played it. And it's... well I enjoyed it because the game at it's core is fun, but I detailed my thoughts on that in my review of the campaign DLC (which really should've been made a standalone expansion, maybe that's just my nostalgia for 90s/2000s RTS games talking).
But the game was not even remotely near content complete on launch, and it still isn't content complete yet. And as such, I think I can attribute the mismanagement and general content drought of this game with my current overall burnout with the Halo franchise.
If one of my friends asks me to play Sins of the Prophets, or some Halo Wars, or (if I get it through the Xbox Store why isn't it on steam already 343) some Wars 2, or hell, co-op Infinite campaign, I'll play it. Because this franchise played too much of a role in directing what sci-fi I enjoy today for me to drop it completely.
But this game is the reason I no longer enjoy Halo. It's a fun game, but it had too many issues pre-launch and upon release for me to really, truly get into it again. And that makes me sad.",1637034558,1708215784,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A better take on battle-passes, these do not have an expiry so can be worked through at your leisure.

It's also not okay that, a little over 2 years after launch, we're only just now starting to see feature parity with HALO REACH, a game from over 10 years ago, but with a lot of the cosmetics locked behind egregiously expensive microtransactions. That said...

The gameplay of Halo Infinite is fantastic. It's the first game we've gotten since Reach that feels like a sequel to Halo 3 instead of what Reach, no matter how much I love it, did with its controversial introduction of the armor abilities and a form of loadout system. It's got, in my opinion, the most focused weapon & equipment sandbox we've gotten in the 343 games, period, with far less role overlap in the weapons than we saw in Halo 5's ""just pick whatever kills the quickest"" sandbox where almost every weapon felt the same. There is still some degree of overlap, yes, but that's been a slight sandbox issue in the series as a whole ever since Halo 2, if we're being honest. 

In conclusion, Halo Infinite is a fun game with well designed mechanics with some deep flaws in its customization systems and its implementation of microtransactions. If you're like me, and enjoy it in spite of its flaws, you'll have a good time. However, it's also 100% understandable if these flaws are too much for you, and you give it a pass. Either way, the multiplayer is free, so all it costs you to give it a shot is the disk space, the bandwidth to download it, and some time, so I'd recommend giving Halo Infinite a fair shake in 2024 before writing it off completely, especially if you yearn for something a little more classic in its FPS PvP gameplay than, say, Call of Duty, but don't want to go all the way back to the days of Doom, Quake, and Unreal deathmatching, and thus don't want to buy into the modern retro shooter scene.",1708141514,1708141514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, I cannot in good faith currently recommend Halo Infinite's multiplayer. [strike]As the seasons progress I'll update this and hopefully one day I can finally recommend the game to others. But for now let's see why I don't recommend Infinite:[/strike]
[b]Overall update/change of opinion[/b] I cannot in good faith ever recommend Halo Infinite's multiplayer. Every time it seems the game makes progress 343 upper management or Microsoft make the game take several steps back. With [i]CU 29[/i] (aka what would have been S6) it appears that there were plans to have a normal battlepass, as there were 6+ sets of full armor in the shop with only 1 found in the pass. Completely ridiculous that 343 spent this long trying to fix the unfinished state this game launched in just to begin to wind down on it just as it was hitting its stride, just to try and milk the players that have stayed with this game since launch and through the constant breaking of promises and delays. I pray that the next game is a paid one because this free-to-play model has done nothing but leave a bad taste in my mouth.

UPDATED AS OF CU29
[b]1.[/b] Progression is a far cry from what it used to be in Halo. Although the battle passes never expire, which is great, armor is earned exclusively through either the battle and event passes or the shop. There are no cosmetics that can be earned through achievements or commendations/challenges. Also on that note, as of Season 4 there are still no commendations in the game. And the only earnable cosmetics are found in the campaign, off which none are armor pieces. The battle pass also still has filler in the forms of earning emblems several times for armor, vehicles, weapons, and nameplate, challenge swaps, and 2xp. Also the same color currently takes up multiple tiers with the battle passes as you must earn the same color for each armor core or weapon separately.
[b]S5 Update[/b] [strike]Battle passes no longer have as much filler and have been streamlined to 50 tiers which is an improvement.[/strike] Still great that battle passes never expire and 343 has now made it so that if you miss an event pass you can purchase it now, which helps to reduce FOMO. Event passes still seem to have some filler content, no reason that emblems should take up so many slots but at least it's free.
[b]CU 29 Update[/b] There are no longer any season long passes, instead the operation/event pass that they had revised for certain events is the main pass system. So while they are free, they're still packed with filler like 2XP tokens and emblems, while containing very little armor. And since these passes are only 20 tiers, there is no longer any way to earn back credits if you choose to buy a pass, and of course they add a weapon model that they know they community has nostalgia for rather than just adding a new weapon to the sandbox... Still no commendations or other life-time challenges for players to progress through as well.

[b]2.[/b] Customization [strike]is still completely gutted. The system would be great if the armor wasn't core restricted, as most cores feel like there's not enough armor there to make your spartan feel unique. That is unless you're willing to fork over money for armor in the cash shop. Color choices are also still awful 19 months after launch,[/strike] there is NO color white for you to choose unless you buy an armor bundle that comes with the color white. They've added more free colors but it's a far cry from the [i]millions[/i] of color customization options that they claimed would be provided for us.
[b]S5 Update[/b] Helmets are now cross core and 343 has said they will be working on making shoulders and knee pads cross-core as well. This is great, HOWEVER... they now believe that since they've fixed the problem they've made, they can up the prices of bundles because they offer more value now. What? 343 that's not how this works, you can't up prices because you fix a problem you made.
[b]CU 29 Update[/b] I was mistaken on the knee pads being cross core but now you can use any shoulder on any of the cores. 

[b]3.[/b] As of Season 4, it appears that the seasonal narrative story they wanted to tell is dead. 343 had a community manager the day before S4 launched announce that starting with S4 they had chosen to not do the cutscenes in order to focus on delivering requested features and further finishing the game. I honestly wouldn't be upset if [i]a.[/i] the story hadn't started to get interested and [i]b.[/i] they hadn't updated the shop ui. Strange that they don't have resources to keep telling the seasonal story but they 100% have resources to improve the cash shop's ui...

[b]4.[/b] Key features and game modes as of S4 are still missing from the game. There is still no pre or post game lobby, no match composer similar to the one in MCC, no in-depth stats page (why are all stats on the website and not in game?). Game modes that are still currently not in Infinite are Assault, Grifball, Headhunter, Juggernaut, Regicide, VIP, and others I can't remember right now. Also, assassinations are still not in the game and 343 has said there are currently no plans to add them to the game. So all of you assassination tower game mode enjoyers are out of luck.
[b]S5 Update[/b] As of S5 the game now feels like it should have at launch, though as of now there are still gamemodes missing from past Halos.[strike]Firefight launches sometime during S5, though as of Thanksgiving it is not here yet.[/strike]
[b]CU 29[/b] Still missing the aforementioned features and game modes, and no new modes were added this update...

[b]5.[/b] This one is very subjective but it has been years since we have been able to play as Elites. I will never understand why they took away a feature that had been in 3 Halo games, and have continued to tell us that no plans are being made to have elites be in multiplayer. We have been begging for years now and they still refuse to give us our splitjaws. Although with the seasonal story seemingly dead, it would appear Infinite is no longer a spartan story so.... give us Elites for the love of Peter.

[b]6.[/b] The UI is nowhere near as awful as MW2 2022's but Halo has had better. It is so slow that it is actually uncommon for the armor hall to load as soon as you click on it.

[b]7.[/b] THE SHOP! Holy fuck, I wish Halo hadn't gone F2P. Again, because 343 has added cross core they think it's ok to charge more because you can finally use those armor pieces on more than 1 set of armor. Absolutely ridiculous.. In addition though for Halo CE's birthday they redid Chief's iconic MK V armor and it looks so good. The catch? 2200 credits aka $22 for an armor kit that all you cannot mix and match armor pieces with. MCC goes on sale for around the same prices and offers 6 whole games. This ain't it Chief...
[b]CU 29 Update[/b] Sigh... such a shame that the Mark IV was nailed just for most of the armor to be paywalled. I bought a set with credits since there's no more battle passes to spend them on, but as expected the prices for the armor sets were fucking ludicrous. $38 for a bundle of 3 armors is more than half the price of the campaign and MCC regularly goes on sale for less than that...",1687588027,1708134486,False,5,0,0.530654549598693848,0,True,False,False

It looks and feels great, customisation is awesome, the maps are fun, campaign was solid, there is now forge, firefight, custom games browser and plenty of fun multiplayer modes, It looks and feels like Halo. In saying all that, I wish there were more vehicles, like the hornet, the falcon, the spectre etc. I wish there were more weapons like classic shotgun, the beam rifle, fuel rod, plasma rifle, smg, magnum and many more. I understand that 343 wanted the games sandbox to have everything fit a role, but honestly did we really need two versions of the dmr when we already have the stalker rifle, battle rifle and commando if that was really the case? Everything in the game is great (besides the store). It's whats not in the game I think that sort of loses points for me. Like previously mentioned, staple vehicles and weapons, even playable elites would be amazing but aren't here. But what I think truly sucks is missing unlockable armours from challenges, every halo since 3 has had something for you to work toward to let people know that you mean business. Halo 3 with Hayabusa, Flaming helmet and Recon, Reach with the haunted helmet, halo 4 had the specialisations, even MCC had the challenge to unlock the Mister Chief helmet. I'd love to have something to grind for to stand out rather than buying x or y from the store or battlepass. Don't get me wrong, this game is great and I commend 343 for sticking by it and obviously pouring a lot of passion, blood sweat and tears into the game. Whats here is fantastic, and don't get me wrong, there is heaps here. I just miss some of the older elements which could only elevate the game.  Whether or not you've played halo before, I recommend you give this game a go. It's heaps of fun, you can play casually, competitively, solo or with friends and regardless you'll have a blast. 343 has turned this game around into something rock solid, and if you're a shooter fan, you'll find something worth playing here.",1708054299,1708054299,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

$60 Campaign:
So many features are either stripped or missing from this entry.  Campaign is serviceable and arguably the sandbox is the best it's ever been. Running around shooting enemies in a free roam environment is impressive but hardly replayable. The game is packed to the BRIM with forest and one bog? Where is the snow? The deserts? We get it, somebody LOVED mission 2 of Halo 1, it doesn't need to be the whole visual aesthetic. Halo needs variation. I do not want to look at another tree or Forerunner hallway and it's going to be really hard to replay when Co-op comes out.  Oh yeah, network Co-op is still a month away (no split-screen for this one) and there is no Firefight, Forge or Theatre to break this clear monotony.

Multiplayer:
It's a Micro-transaction hellscape.  While there is no advantage to in game purchases, almost every cosmetic is locked behind a season based FOMO paywall. Purchasing the $60 campaign netted me a single color palette for my spartan and weapons, the color red. Microsoft is a joke thinking this is acceptable content for a full priced game considering what we got in Halo Reach, Halo 4 and even Halo 5, the entry that is considered the worst of Micro Transaction sins. Infinite is leagues worse, bleeding players dry for any sort of customization option they might want. Shame considering it's a franchise that helped pioneer modern space marine aesthetic.

I'd love to know more about the development of this game because it reeks of corporate intervention.

REVISED: Not much has changed but other than basic bare bones customization, the launch features you'd expect are now in the game. I understand the work that goes into the designing new armors, cores but paying for specific colors has got to be one of the worst business practices in the industry right now. There has got to be a better way. Anyways, too little too late. The base fan-base has moved on and every game is a sweat fest with really good players.

I advise staying away from this game and keeping your memories of Halo from a time before 343 got to it.

However, the SP campaign is polished enough that you will enjoy Halo game, even if you're new to Halo, but not new to Open sandbox FPS games like the Far Cry series or Just Cause series. Halo starts out as a linear FPS, but becomes an open world game, filled with site based objectives and activities. These activities unlock other areas, and even more activities. You should do the side quests to make your Spartan more powerful, collect audio logs that fill in the back story of all factions and events, and just have good old fun shooting the alien denizens of the Ring world.

Forge is amazing finally near halo custom edition level of construction and the hopefully soon good AI. Campaign is still a ripoff in my opinion . overall a good improvement from where it started game has met my minimum expsectations to be good and called a classic halo unlike 5 or 4

New Review: Do not pay for campaign complete ripoff barely worth 30$ game has been abandoned already for a future title and honestly its what i exspected hopefully when forge comes out the game will be playable and fun but for now i reccomend MCC as the prime spot for classic halo gameplay that we all know and love forget 343 they just want your money

old review: as one of the .1% (as this is written) who beat the game on heroic solo (not that there was a coop) it was fun a challenge at times and way to simple in others. Marines for example cant drive, love picking up guns randomly, and have sometimes scetchy pathing. the story moved forward in a way buy you will only read about it in books or comics, its ok if coop comes out and if they actually do something with the game with a nice detailed forge were in for a good time for halo infinite overall but thats just an idea before its done

Future update halo is now a cash grab 343 had no clue what it was doing with the IP and honestly they pretty much ruined it. just the detail that they changed the UNSC (united nations space command) to united nations security counsel shows how much they dont care about the lore, its fans,its characters, and shamelessly shoving unfinished products at people

last future update its augest 2022 and halo is in infinite development we will never see what the modders get for forge for another year or so we are 6 years into the game and any sense of content that the game had besides give 343 money for useless cosmetics and replay the same shitty gameplay loop halo 1 2 3 (etc good halos) hell even halo 4 and 5 had better shit than this game and they sucked DONT WASTE ANY TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GAME ITS A WASTE OF HARD DRIVE SPACE",1639185443,1707941284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This isn't to say I don't have criticisms; a lot of good armor pieces are locked behind shop bundles and premium battle passes; and it took too long for Halo infinite to get to a place where it's ""Complete""

It's not perfect (and to be honest I hope to god this sort of ongoing disaster never happens again) but it's one of the best damn games in that 

A) There is nothing to pay to win in multiplayer.  The only payment is cosmetics, but unlike other free-to-play games if doesn't feel like I'm shoehorned or forced to buy cosmetics...But if you are someone who knows they will have a tendency to buy cosmetics, please be aware that you cannot get refunded for me;  and no matter now many cosmetics you buy, you will have buyer's remorse

B) even if you don't want to dish out cash in the shop you can still access cosmetics by one free battle pass, all armor cores, completely all your weekly challenges, and even free events

C) the environments in multiplayer and forge maps are gorgeous

D) gameplay is faced-paced, skill-and-strategy based. The Halo games overall (least MCC and Infinite) are ones where if you put in the time and practice as you play, you'll get better

E) The true things that take the cake are Firefight (a PVE mode where you and four other players take on waves of Banished Alien forces while defending control points) custom games (which is self explanatory but can include a variety of things from PVE missions, parkour maps, all sorts of wild and amazing creations), Forge (a powerful map editor built on the previous Halo Map editors that came before it).

I will have a separate review for it's campaign but if you wait for a sale (Like when the price drops to $20-40), toy around with the graphic settings (for some reason some things looked better on medium than Ultra though maybe it's because I play on a laptop), but I'd say its a pretty good story and while it isn't your typical halo game akin to how Halo 3: ODST has it own memorable and beloved spin in level design, gameplay, and story I think infinite's campaign, while despite ending on a cliffhanger (sorta) and having an open world that is just one biome (that being a pacific northwest), is still and pretty epic action-packed adventure with new memorable characters along with the Master Cheif in his Badass Gen 3 armor in a pretty beautiful world that I enjoy trekking, gazing, and fighting across.",1670556584,1707930398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You missed out on events that happened 2 years ago. You wont get it now. If u didnt dedicate playing every day and spending all your money on everything on the bundle shop forget about unlocking at least 20% of your customization. People loved Reach's customization and gave hints to 343 to make it so. Yet look at this. You cant even color your armor without a ""color palette"" Where some parts you might not enjoy even so you have adapt and live with it. At the start with the hype it was beautiful filled with good emotions about a new upcoming halo for the next 10 years! They lied. 3 years in and its population grows slim. They dont update the game with proper content. They wont release the stuff you want for your spartan no matter how much money you throw into the game. If you are looking to play an unfinished campaign with an ending that shouldnt be an ending? Go ahead. If you looking to play multiplayer and get cool equips you want? Dont get it. 
I am not saying they should copy bungies Halo reach customization, but at the same time I am saying that for newer and existing players to make multiplayer more fun to have the look you want. But also at least add several game modes with their own customization. Make it appealing for players to play. They try to be unique and they fail.

The Multiplayer is fun with friends, but there has to be an option to pick what you want to play, so that people can get more enjoyment out of the game in general.

I gave it a solid 9/10 So far, as long as at least 25% of the gear can be unlocked without having to pay for it.

Edit: 03-11-23
Came back after about a year, maybe more to check on it, and nothing will load. The only part of the game that loads anything is the Campaign, that is all, nothing else loads even after half an hour, not even worth reinstalling it back onto my PC because I can't even do anything in the base game. Very sad to see since everyone has been praising it's return to being a somewhat playable game. 
Give it a solid 2/10 now because of this, since I can only play the DLC Campaign.

I would say the pros of Halo Infinite is mainly the multiplayer which has been a blast for me. The campaign is okay, Just mostly empty, and gives a bland feeling. They did add 4 player co-op for the campaign not too long ago (as of this review) which is nice! But still, no split-screen co-op like 343 promised originally.

The game is buggy here, and there, But nothing game-breaking.
I dislike that you mainly have to buy spartan skins, and accessory's instead of earning them (although I guess that's what makes multiplayer free).

Overall I would rate the Multiplayer 8/10 - And the Campaign 4/10.
- If you're gonna buy the Campaign, I would recommend buying it at a discount.

[h2]Halo Infinite (Multiplayer) Review[/h2]

[h1]Master Chief Supremacy[/h1]
Diving into the multiplayer segment of Halo: Infinite feels like stepping into an arena where every second pulses with the potential for epic plays and heart-stopping moments. It's here that I found a battleground teeming with both nostalgia and fresh, innovative mechanics that redefine the Halo experience for veterans and newcomers alike.

[h1]About This Game [/h1]

[h2]Storyline [/h2]
Since I am talking about the Multiplayer Portion of the game, I will not be including the storyline of the Campaign portion of Halo Infinite as I will be writing a separate review for it.

[h2]Gameplay Mechanics [/h2]
As this game is a competitive multiplayer title, it involves a lot of mechanics. Here are the core mechanics:

[b][u]Combat[/u][/b]
The multiplayer action in this game is an exciting fusion of traditional Halo gunplay with new features that come together to produce a very competitive and emotionally enjoyable experience. Players have a great deal of tactical possibilities because of the game's well-balanced and varied weaponry, which includes anything from lethal energy swords to precise firearms. Each weapon has a specific purpose and role, thus players are encouraged to modify their tactics according to their loadouts and the circumstances.

New equipment pieces, such as the Repulsor, add to the combat's complexity and enjoyment. Whether you use a Drop Wall for instant cover or a Grappleshot to quickly reduce the distance to an attacker, these tools enable innovative confrontations. The interaction between these new mechanics and classic gunfights enhances the fighting experience by giving each encounter a distinct, memorable feel.

Furthermore, combat is made to encourage smart play and teamwork, particularly in modes that call for coordination to accomplish goals beyond merely defeating the adversary. The tempo of the game creates a nice contrast between quick, violent clashes and slower, more position-based, strategic interactions. This diversity guarantees that the combat will always be interesting, giving players a ton of chances to outwit and outplay their rivals.

[b][u]Movement[/u][/b]
The way the movement mechanisms are designed is just as crucial to the gameplay experience. The smooth transition between sprinting and sliding adds a tactical element to positioning and evasion. It also feels a lot more natural. Combat becomes more dynamic when players may move quickly across the battlefield, avoid enemy fire, or execute aggressive tactics. When paired with the equipment, these movement choices guarantee that combat in Halo is more than just shooting. Timing and dexterity become crucial elements of success, highlighting the significance of tactical reasoning and reflexes in winning.

[b][u]Weapons & Equipments[/u][/b]
The weapons are made to accommodate a wide range of combat situations, allowing players to modify their strategy depending on the circumstance. The arsenal includes energy swords, explosive launchers, strong shotguns, and precision rifles, each having its own special qualities and intended use. Precision weapons for instance, require a lot of accuracy but reward players for headshots, while power weapons offer game-changing potential with their “Destructive” capabilities but they come with very limited ammo.

These weapons are balanced so that no one weapon takes control of the battlefield. Rather, players have to make strategic decisions based on the enemy's tactics, the map's layout, and their own goals at the moment. This diversity makes for a dynamic fighting experience where flexibility and multi-weapon mastery are essential for victory.

On the other hand, equipment gives players tactical benefits through inventive usage, adding yet another level of complexity to the gameplay. Combat is greatly affected by items that offer new movement possibilities, defensive maneuvers, or strategic setups, such as the Grappleshot, Repulsor, and Drop Wall.

The strategic deployment of these equipment items can turn the tide of battle, creating opportunities for skilled players to outmaneuver and outplay their opponents. The effectiveness of each piece of equipment depends on the situation and each individual’s ability to integrate its use into their overall strategy.

[b][u]Game Modes & Playlists[/u][/b]
This game offers a wide variety of game modes to satisfy players that enjoy PvP and PvE. Traditional Arena Combat, Big Team Battles, Ranked battles, and the mayhem of Super Fiesta are all available to players. If cooperative gameplay is more your style, Firefight pits groups against AI in scenarios with predetermined goals. The game is always updating its playlists, so players can always expect a dynamic and new experience. For those who enjoy survival games, there are modes like Infection, which highlight Halo's dedication to offering a wide variety of interesting material for its community. I recommend checking out the game for more info on the various game modes available as I prefer not to mention each and every one of them here and make the review longer than it needs to be!

[b][u]Battle Pass & Progression[/u][/b]
The battle pass system, which is now a common feature in almost all the free-to-play titles, introduces a grind that can sometimes detract from the joy of gameplay. Challenges often encourage specific playstyles or achievements that don't necessarily align with team objectives or personal enjoyment. Although tweaks have been made to alleviate some frustration, the progression can still feel tedious and unrewarding, with many unlockables lacking excitement which is supposed to be the main goal of such a rewarding-system.

[h2]Visuals & Audio[/h2]
This game actually has exceptional graphical fidelity and acoustic design that entice the senses. The arenas are finely designed, striking a balance between aesthetic appeal and practicality to guarantee that every map has distinct strategic advantages. The immersive experience is enhanced by the sound design, which grounds each combat in a physical reality with sounds like the pleasant *clink* of reloading and the resonant boom of a Spartan's footstep.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] Engaging combat and innovative equipment mechanics that enhance gameplay and cater to various playstyles.
[*] Diverse game modes cater to a range of player preferences.
[*] They did listen to the complaints about the game’s grindy nature and they improved daily XP rewards that kinda reduced the grind in battle pass progression.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] Progression system improvements still sought by the community.
[*] Battle pass rewards are lacking excitement due to emphasis on paid cosmetics.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
In summary, this title offers a variety of interesting combat features, a wide range of game modes, and substantial enhancements to its battle pass and progression systems. The developer's efforts demonstrate a dedication to improving the game, even though there are some frustrating aspects of the journey, such as the grindy progression and the need for more lucrative unlockables. There's not much of a reason not to try this game out given it’s free-to-play. The game delivers enough diversity and excitement to be worth a look, regardless of your experience level as a Spartan or your familiarity with the Halo universe. Its multiplayer ecosystem is always changing, so now is as good a time as any to get started because it looks like the experience will only get better.

A bland, empty, boring af open world: Do you have fun running across a low detail 2016 graphics open world that also is so empty you'll find yourself texting and driving with your warthog.

The flood, boring, lets make a new, much more boring rip off of the bugs from halo 3/reach but their name is ""endless"" so they should be scary. Oh wait never mind they're blandly written with nothing interesting.

The combat: In campaign, fine IG, but multiplayer net coding and issues over the years with seasons doesnt even give me the time or characters to describe how terrible Halo infinite multiplayer is.

The blatant lies: Defined as a party game, then they lie: oh we didn't say that its a competitive game now guys and we always meant that!!!

The story: this ties into the initial point of the bland open world, I'm guessing they expected people to eat up this dog shit game so they could charge more for additional campaign DLC.  Issue is, they had 2 tries to make something good and they fucked it, now there is a boring campaign, with a shit ending that isn't epic in any way, not to mention remember destroying the AA gun in Halo 3, the Reach Invasion, Stopping Halo, there is NONE of this, the story is bland and utter trash.

In summary, this is my salty bitch review, fuck you 343, I hope your writers all leave the industry forever and you stop hiring highschool coders. Fucking absurd that I could netcode this shit better than your highschool degree devs, which I guess extends to your leadership considering how moronic they were to not fire the whole dev team and ship this dogshit.

The story is rich, there's so much to do and all the appreciated characters from the old games feel at home as well as the Banished and the UNSC have that old Halo feel. That being said, the multiplayer launch was subpar and honestly horribly done. After coming back to Halo infinite's multiplayer 2 years later, I can safely say they have improved it vastly. With customization you now have ranks you can earn, the daily and weekly challenges are much better and XP to your battle pass is easier to earn. I'm not saying this is a Halo Reach multiplayer but it feels very much like it and I loved Halo Reach. It's competitive, rewarding, and being a team doesn't feel like a drag. 

Ultimately, if you haven't bought the game just send it. You're going to love it. Campaign = S Tier and the multiplayer is a solid B+. If there was one thing I could change about this game I'd add a reward system to earning your rank i.e. earning armor, weapon, and color customization.

The matchmaking is TERRIBLE... if you try to play Big Team Battle... 90%+ of your games will be Slayer... they are NOT random modes... 343 is *obsessed* with Slayer and thinks people just want to play team deathmatch all day. Anyone who has played FPS games for a long time knows that team deathmatch is the most boring mode there is... objective game modes are always way more fun and exciting. There are hackers... and lots of them. You will see players who shoot their pistol inexplicably fast (scripts). You will find players who track you through the map wherever you go. You will encounter snipers who always lock onto heads even if you're jumping around, driving a vehicle... it doesn't matter. 

Too many cheaters, awful matchmaking and stupid vehicles make for a frustrating experience. There are sometimes glorious moments in this game, but they're overshadowed by all the terrible elements I've mentioned. Don't be like me and sink 721 hours of your life into this game.

My problems are few, but they exist. For one, I wish the campaign was longer or just generally paced a little better. I found the final stretch went on for a very long time. Second is that I do wish the open world had a little more to do, but that's a minor complaint. My biggest issue is just the armour customisation in multiplayer. There was nothing wrong with the way it worked before, even in Halo 4, why fuck that up? Like, fine, go for a battle pass system for exotic parts I guess. Also not a fan of that but I get that that's the climate of modern gaming. But at LEAST let me choose my own colours. 

But I digress. The truth is I had an absolute blast playing through this game. Aesthetically, I think they nailed it. The balance between new ideas and paying homage to the original titles I feel was achieved beautifully.
The game itself is incredibly polished and very well balanced. Action is fast paced, with variety of environments and abilities allowing for fun and creative battles. I think I encountered all of one glitch in my campaign run, and it wasn't even that bad as I had already died. Fights feel fair, even when difficult. The game saves frequently, which, while at times feels a little hand-hold-y, but more often than not saves a lot of frustration. Fights feel fair, as the AI and the scenarios presented are very well designed.

I find the story incredibly compelling. It feels like the best possible direction they could have gone, given the foundation laid in previous 343 stories while also trying to get things back on track to what fans have been hoping for.

I'd say most of the issues I have stem from Multiplayer, with it's poor balancing and incredibly limited customisation. But I find it easy to look past that with how much fun I have playing the game.

In summation, I love this entry in the Halo series. It feels like a love letter to classic titles, while incorporating some really cool new ideas and maintaining the smoothness that is to be expected from a modern AAA title. 

Congratulations 343 Industries, I can't wait for what's next. 8/10.",1707529608,1707529608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The multiplayer still has the quintessential Halo feel to it, but it is incredibly repetitive. Not to mention the sbmm is so out of whack you simply can't rely on the game putting you in matches with teammates that even play to the objectives. If you want to play something more competitive you can try the ranked mode, but no AR or BR, only the shitty Bandit. Not to mention the horrible microtransactions for cosmetic armors. Obviously I just avoid paying for any of these, but it does really make you miss the good old days of Halo 3.

You can't skip the cutscenes (if you die and have to repeat them).  You can't manually save.  If your computer freezes during a fight, you'll need to reload all of the software and fight your way back to the last auto save checkpoint, which, in some cases, is a solid 20 minutes of effort.  Probably the most irritating thing so far?  Find the path through the &^%$#@ game!  Sure, give Master Chief a grapel, and the players will have fun finding new paths in the game.  Nope.  It sucks ass.  Do NOT spend anywhere near full retail on this title; you WILL regret that decision.  I just picked it up for 60% off, and I'm feeling pretty ripped off.

Oh!  And the ""Cortana"" stand in?  I am guessing she was modeled after one of the developer's pain-in-the-ass little sister?  Or some shrill banshee that he was trying to date/get in his bed?  Holy hell she's an irritating cow.

(After 13 hours of game play) - Alright, I switched my recommendation from No to Yes, but only just barely.  Essentially, if you enjoy Far Cry 4 and beyond (5 and 6 as well), then this game's format will feel VERY familiar.  It's an open world map, with miscellaneous objectives that are completely up to you to decide on the order of attack.  I would recommend keeping an interactive map open on your dual monitor so you're not missing any of your gear upgrade widgets.  It's a decent game.  The new Cortana does, eventually, STFU!!!

Edit as of 8/18/2023

This game has come a long way, but I still can't recommend it just as yet. I play this game consistently but there are still some issues that need to be addressed. Desync is still a massive problem, we need more weapon variety, more PVE modes especially Firefight, Campaign Matchmaking, and even Warzone need to make some appearance.

As for the good we finally have more maps even if they are Forge Maps they look unrecognizable from Developer Maps. Co-Op campaign is great for what it is worth. Squad Battle is nice. A lot of variety now for Spartans many look different from each other. I believe around Season 7, this game will finally be worth recommending. For those still playing, stick with it no one wants this series to fail but I think we have to give it time before I fully recommend this to everyone.

Edit as of 2/6/2024

But with the release of Seasons 3, 4, and especially 5, the game is ALMOST perfect. 
It has a fairly strict Skill-Based-Matchmaking system that will basically make it impossible to go on win streak, and you'll need to play badly for a game or two in order to get back into less sweaty lobbies. 

Another negative is the lack of a way to consistently earn credits w/o needing to pay anything. Unlike Halo 5: Guardians, where you could earn req points to unlock armor, you're pretty much forced to purchase credits in Halo Infinite, or buy a Battlepass and grind away and get credits every 10 levels or so.

The gameplay with the most recent Operation release has been improved dramatically.

They've put out nothing but disappointment since they got control of the Halo name. Halo 4 was decent enough but took the story in a very stupid direction. 

Halo 5 was an absolute abomination. The story was nonsensical garbage and it was such dog water even 343 straight abandoned it and resolved it off screen. 

And here we are at Halo Infinite. The first competent attempt they've had to date. The story was enjoyable for the most part but I do believe they miss-stepped pretty hard deciding to take Halo into an open-world setting. The world is 90% empty with a load of garbage sprinkled in. It's Far Cry with a Halo skin on it. The only piece of equipment you need is the Grapple Shot. The rest are pretty useless. So I felt no need to collect any more Spartan cores to upgrade anything more than that. The rest is mostly multiplayer cosmetics and I would rather lick my sweaty sack after a jog than play that garbage. 

343 fumbled yet again. Shocker. 

People can say ""It's good now"" but that doesn't excuse the sorry excuse of a launch this game had. Little to no content for months at a time is inexcusable. And locking 80% of the game behind 10$ battlepasses is atrocious. They built an in-game store and designed a ""game"" around it. Almost as bad as Overwatch 2. People can say that Forge saved Halo Infinite but in my eyes 343 shouldn't have to rely on the fans to make a game competent enough to be enjoyed. Bungie at least released a full package around forge which made it all that much more fun. 343 gave us basically nothing since release. They've moved away from the ""season"" style of content for bigger content drops but honestly, I have zero hope in 343 delivering anything more than disappointment. 9 maps in 2 years is a joke. The rest is armor pieces you can't even mix and match with other ""armor cores"". Anything and everything they've added since launch should have been in the game at launch. There's NO excuse for this type of crap in gaming. But why should they try? Morons continue to give the whole ""ItS GoOd NoW"" schtick and it just justifies they can get away with anything they want to.

But worst of the worst are the updates, that keep breaking the game!
First I started the campaign when the game launched and it worked for a few month, than after an update I had a blackscreen when starting the multiplayer, which I needed to start in order to get in the campaign and now there's an 4gb update for the multiplayer, but it the 60gb of free storage on my c drive aren't enough to update.
All my games are on my other drive which has more than 1 tb of free storage, but that doesn't count for the update process!
So here am I again, finally having a free sunday wanting to play halo and it does not work because of the bloody multiplayer I don't play or need!!!!
Even using offline mode doesn't work since, well the multiplayer doesn't work without it, so I can not start the campaign, which doesn't need it!
Last Halo game I ever bought! I don't care any more, the last good one was Halo Reach, then with halo 5 they took the splitscreen, so I couldn't play anylonger with my bro, like back in the day and now tech has become so bad I need a beast of a pc to run it fluently and it still breaks.

EDIT:

343 In fact did, fuck up completely. It is amazing how they stuck the landing with this game, they released a month BEFORE their actual release date. Then? then... they well, did a whole lot of nothing. As the months turned to years, all we got was maybe a couple of cut scenes as the multiplayer season changed. 

B-But they added forge and firefight and X and Y!!

Good! Wonderful! That all should have been been there on release. Why did it takes years to add a basic firefight mode that is a shadow of all other halo title's firefight. Why did it take years to add forge, when that was a staple of all bungie Halo titles after Halo 3? 

Why, Why did it take a year to get a co-op campaign, that isnt even split-screen? Call me old but, some of my best memories are from couch co-op with my family.

More so, why is the recent season called ""Spirit of Fire"" when it does the very minimal to respect or display the action of the Cast and Crew of the Halo Wars Titles? All we got was a titlecard with the ship's emblem and a charm with the Ship's Hull Number. 

The Tale of the Spirit of Fire is one of my most cherished in the Halo Universe, and to see this just makes me sad.

There was so much potential on release, you guys nailed it, did everything right! But since that? You've spent years working on stuff that should have been included on launch or just after launch, not years, YEARS later.

I'm really only interested in the campaign aspect, thus have nothing to say about the multiplayer. It's going to receive updates so 343 and Microsoft can improve their profit margins, but very little fanfare for any new campaign material. Mainly because of this reason.

It should have still had another two to three years in the oven. You can tell what kind of monstrosity they had to cobble together to get enough of a sensible experience and it STILL falls flat. By the time the game ends, you get what amounts to 30 hours of Master Chief's therapy because very little seems to change in the story by any other measure outside of gutting every plot point from Halo 4 and 5. It just speaks to how skewed the priorities were when they shoe-horned in the banished because they felt ashamed of their previously established villains so they went with what seemed popular in the franchise.

Except even then, it failed. The Banished are just covenant 2.0 on CE's halo ring 2.0 with the Humanity struggling to survive 2.0 plot line. And the open world is just a gimmick. I hate to say it because ODST handled the Mombasa Streets well, tying it into a cyber noir type experience where you uncover the whereabouts of your squad. Zeta Halo is mostly the same environment with a bunch of nothing separating the collectibles and POI's which all feel... grindy? to go through.

This is the only game I would probably decline to ever do legendary once more. The boss balancing teetered on agonizingly frustrating as you rely on RNG movement patterns and pathfinding to avoid getting instantly killed. That's only on a few key bosses, and then you actually get some surprisingly fun encounter elsewhere. I really don't know how to condense this.

343 finally lost their nerve one-too-many times and it resulted in a game that is afraid of any real progress, instead sweeping plot threads under the rug in a way that makes Jul 'Mdama's unceremonious cutscene execution look like a genius idea. I want Halo to feel fresh and for the developers to have a solid plan that is unashamed of ideas that didn't pan out perfectly.

I guess that's to be expected of game launches nowadays..

Why i hate HALO Infinite and why you shouldnt.

a lot of the story felt like B-class fanfiction but the end was actually good.
there was way too much that felt like a joke but I struggle not to recommend this game..
the gun feel and control felt great and the grappling hook fit in seamlessly, but the facial animations even in the most important scenes are sometimes randomly 20FPS..

the first few hours made me believe that this might be the best HALO yet but when the game starts giving you more power it also starts adding steaming bulls*it rules. get your first flying vehicle? ow, all enemies have Laser-based energy weapons that stun your banshee/wasp to drop like flies. Get your tank because you backtracked and used the rank you farmed for? well, 4 brutes might just snipe that with big long-range metal rods and in one volley your tank is dead. not even entering the encounter properly. I get that I played on the highest difficulty, but pacing still matters. not every encounter should hard counter you. not every boss fight should take 15 minutes of dodging instakill weapons unless you use 1 specific overpowered weapon that became a meme in older games. the needle gun.

 And speaking of the needle gun... what is up with that? when I say I like the gun feel I refer to the few weapons I really loved. the human and brute pistol(mangler), the semi-automatic rifles, the sentinel beam, and that's about it... the others either had something between weird quirks one could overlook to gaping flaws. and the special versions usually had too little ammunition to let you try them out. the needer had its homing limited to a very short range, and the Carbine had its projectile speed lowered to the point where it was more close ranged than the shotgun. no enemy ran in a straight enough line ever that that gun could have hit an enemy at more than 7m distance.

so much of the AI was also flawless. at least in videogame terms. only 2wice in ~30 hours did an AI get stuck and only for like 2 seconds max. the way you could deconstruct brutes to always kill the non-bosses fast if you had aim felt great, but then the hunters came. and, o boy, do I hate the hunters in this game... in older HALO games the hunters were less of an enemy and more of a small boss in that they were more of a physical riddle. you learned their patterns, sidestepped, and shot in their back. simple in concept but fun to execute. now it's almost impossible to get behind them. They are just bullet sponges where you had to aim at their joints. Dancing with them was really fun, but even having decent skill with the grappling hook they just turn and recover too fast... there was soo much you could have done here. just extend their patterns or change their shape. (they are not actually humanoids with rigid shapes. just like the flood. *hint hint*)

But talking about wasted Potential, the open world is the biggest joke in some cases. the locations you just cleared magically refilled the moment you turned away, the edges suddenly change the way your grappling hook works just so you can't climb up, more and more invisible walls near the end, and no. single. enemy. ever. looked around and tried to reinforce their position from any direction other than the road, only ~2 enemy hideouts in the game had them corner themselves to eliminate attack vectors making them feel like they had no concept of self-preservation or... I'm rambling on... the enemy placement had absolutely no tactical intelligence beyond snipers in towers and that a fort should have walls. but even those often didn't go around or had big gaping obvious holes or... well, you get the point.

But in the end, the stuff that was most important felt right. most of the time. If you don't think about the Game design reasons why the Ammo had to be so low or sparse just to get the player to try out more things or similar forms of implicit guidance then the moment-to-moment stuff felt great. the music didn't hit home until the end but it had something. it was close. it tried ad you could feel that. the environment design had big obvious repetitions or single rocks that were upscaled to obviously but actually was great most of the time. almost all bosses sucked donkey kong (On legendary) but on the way there was something. Something... special.

I Hate HALO Infinite but I also love, that after all these games, 343 made a game, that at least, in the end, Felt like a worthy HALO successor. I think the open world should go in the future. or be redone from scratch. the open-field encounter design should get some common sense or specialist overhaul. the weapons should get balanced. (Needler should not kill a boss in 2 volleys when he otherwise survives 4 giant hot spikes, 6 grenades, 15 headshots with rifles of all kinds, and 5 punches. I counted. that is not a joke.) but the game reached me. (almost) no single charging brute was killed from more than 5m distance by my hands because I had to face such brave warriors face to face. the hammer brutes I punched to death to meet them on their grounds. same with plasma sword elites. but when I used a certain red energy sword on a certain boss right after, and me attacking that mele boss with insta-killed me at full health without that boss even playing a counter attack animation. then that felt cheap. just one example of how you still have to find the time to respect the world you work with.",1653431265,1706870493,False,3,0,0.515204906463623047,0,True,False,False

This marks the second time they've outright lied about the game's development, following Bonnie Ross' first official statement on Halo Infinite, before we even knew its title, that it would in fact have split screen co-op. If Halo still had the fanbase it did in 2001-2010, there would have been multiple class action lawsuits for these lies. Unfortunately, no one cares anymore.

After confirming they've just reached seasonality, they're pulling the rug and only doing small updates with no more future seasons, starting with the upcoming ""CU29"" update. 
This update will only consist of cosmetics and one developer made map. The majority of the update's file size will surely be drip fed, rotational, fomo premium cosmetics, as ever. The rest being forge items, or map cosmetics, for the community to do their job for them in making maps people actually like playing that aren't outsourced to Russian studios, who sand away every interesting detail in the process to make the most generic and boring, competitive friendly maps imaginable.

They started their livestream’s gameplay by showing off an assault rifle skin made to look like the classic CE/3 AR, which looks more like the 4/5 variant than anything. Despite the weapon sandbox not having any meaningful updates in over two years (two DMR variants, i.e. more precision weapons we don't need, are not meaningful additions to the sandbox), they used the opportunity to create a purely cosmetic variant, and not a 60 round variant to celebrate the franchise’s legacy and give its ever dwindling player base something fun to use. 

Knowing people will want the skin regardless, they locked it behind the $5 premium tier of the event pass.
Given seasons are gone now, it seems like the 100 tier battle passes are gone as well. Now we can count on the 20 tier event passes, which will be loaded up with filler items, to contain the one item people really want in its $5 premium tier. 

Event passes expire while battle passes don't, the latter being promised in their initial multiplayer showcase video. However, if you buy the event pass premium tier you unlock its use forever. This is their means of getting around their prior commitments in service to pure greed.
This especially stings knowing that season 2's battle pass and every subsequent one had in its 100 tiers enough premium credits to buy the following pass. No credits are returned for the premium event pass. They also made sure to rename the event passes to try and cover their tracks. Yet another measure to milk fans of every dollar they have.

All of this comes directly off the heels of daring to ask the few dedicated who can only now expect to play fan made maps with an over bloated premium dress up shop, to please buy a $20 Halo CE Mark V skin. Now, I've always played CE as a white spartan since small kid time, playing against my buddies on xbox on blood gulch. On my 22+ year old copy of CE, I can still do this for free with all of the game's original content and functionality in tact. I can even play the campaign cooperatively using local split screen on my TV at home without having to buy a second console/pc and copy of the game, believe it or not.
Now if I want that same pvp experience today, I'm expected to spend $40. $20 for the Mark V skin which can barely be customized because it's an armor kit and not pieces of an existing armor core, and $20 for a bundle filled with crap I don't want just to get the color white, a color freely chosen by the player in every prior Halo to date. And to play blood gulch I'm supposed to play on a player made variant because the actual developers couldn't be bothered.

Not to mention the litany of issues since launch and lack of features 2001-2010 Halos had at launch:
[list]
[*]No earnable credits via gameplay
[*]No sign of any campaign updates or DLC. Not even the two DMR variants in the multiplayer, despite being a $60 product. All they've done is patch fun glitches people liked using which harmed no one, bar the tank gun's removal which had so much backlash they undid it its removal
[*]No working v-sync without consistent frame time spikes that makes it feel worse to play.
[*]Aiming on pc that has always felt like dragging my mouse through sand. No other AAA shooter on the market has this issue. They just gave us controller aim assist and called it a day. 
[*]No exclusive fullscreen mode
[*]No campaign theater
[*]No theater that isn't broken
[*]No pre or post game lobbies
[*]No proximity chat
[*]No assassinations
[*]No playable elites
[*]No toggleable red vs blue
[*]No official word on the driveable forklift, the falcon, or the brute shotgun which they've been working on behind the scenes for most of the game’s lifespan.
[/list]

It was made clear in their stream they're slowing down development to work on the next Halo, which may well be another shell of a game which disappoints everyone, and over monetizes its storefront to the few who stick around to ""recoup"", despite being funded by the infinite money well that is Microsoft. They won't make an effort, unlike Battlefront 2, to win back its playerbase by not focusing solely on money for every single decision.

The sad reality is no matter any petty arguments about sprint, clamber, weapon sandbox, monetization, etc., 343 isn't equipped to make Halo.

Bungie always upped not only their own game, but tested everyone in the industry around them, by holding themselves and the industry to an ever increasing standard of player fun oriented gameplay, story, feature suites and mechanics. This resulted from them being scrappy upstarts who were bought by Microsoft after they were proven. They could fight back against mindless corporate profit seeking and shareholder pleasing, while arguing for things like theater mode and forge which would by no means fly today.

343 on the other hand was created by and works directly under Microsoft. If they weren't established already, theater mode wouldn't be slopped out with every release in a broken state and left to rot, and forge wouldn’t have been dreamt of. Forge only gets the treatment it does because they want fans to do their job for them.

TLDR: 343 is giving up and continuing to fail to make good on their promises, to likely focus on developing an upcoming Halo. Future updates will be slow, inconsistent nothingburgers with fan made maps and overpriced cosmetics that were free well over a decade ago. 343 are inherently unable to create Halo games which are satisfying to general audiences because Halo was never just about ""green man in suit with blue waifu and multiplayer with cool dirt bike helmets"", but an ever increasing standard of quality and quantity Bungie held themselves to by fighting back against Microsoft's corporate ignorance, always striving for player fun and not player's wallets.

EDIT: Context and spelling errors.
Also, the vast majority of the update’s new armor, which easily could’ve filled a battle pass, is locked behind somehow even more heavily priced bundles in the shop in the midst of a cost of living crisis. Not surprising in the least, sadly.

### Graphics & Visuals 🎨✨
""Halo Infinite"" boasts graphics so stunning that you'll occasionally stop shooting just to admire a rock. Yes, a rock. The environments are a feast for the eyes, making every vista worth the detour—even if it's just to fall off the map accidentally. Oops! 🤷‍♂️🌄

### Gameplay & Mechanics 🕹️🔫
The gameplay is smoother than a Grunt's head after a close shave with a plasma sword. The grappling hook brings a new layer of mobility that has us swinging around like Spider-Man—if Spider-Man had a penchant for alien annihilation. However, the AI sometimes seems to have attended the Stormtrooper Academy for Marksmanship, making you feel a bit too invincible. 

### Story & Characters 📖💔
The story tries to juggle nostalgia and new directions with the grace of an Elite trying to decipher a UNSC vending machine. It's heartfelt, yet sometimes as confusing as trying to understand why anyone would choose to fight in anything other than a Spartan suit. Master Chief remains as expressive as a brick wall, but we love that stoic hunk of armor all the same.

### Multiplayer Madness 🌐🎉
Multiplayer is where ""Halo Infinite"" shines like the reflection off Master Chief's helmet. It's fast, frantic, and fabulously fun. However, the progression system feels slower than a traffic jam on the Mombasa bridge. The promise of new content is like a carrot dangling in front of a Warthog—just out of reach unless you're willing to grind or pay up.

### Constructive Criticism 🛠️📝
- **Map Diversity:** We need more maps than the number of times Cortana has changed her mind. Variety is the spice of life and multiplayer.
- **Progression System:** Make it more rewarding. Gamers shouldn't feel like they're trying to earn a promotion in the actual military.
- **Enemy AI:** Give them a pep talk or something. They need to be a bit sharper to keep us on our toes.
- **Story Clarity:** A little more hand-holding wouldn't hurt. Sometimes, following the plot feels like trying to read a Forerunner artifact without subtitles.

### Conclusion 🌟👾
""Halo Infinite"" is a love letter to fans, scribbled in alien ink. It's a game of breathtaking highs and face-palming lows, like discovering a Scorpion tank only to accidentally drive it off a cliff. It's not perfect, but it's Halo through and through. We came for the nostalgia, stayed for the multiplayer, and left wondering just how many more times we can save the galaxy without asking for a raise.

Overall, ""Halo Infinite"" is a must-play for fans and newcomers alike. Just be prepared for a journey that's as bumpy as a ride on a Gungoose over a field of Grunt mines. 7.5/10 🌌🎖️",1706841319,1706841319,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Halo Infinite has had all of these things added since launch

- Co-Op Campaign
- Forge
- Custom Games search tab
- Firefight (On the Multiplayer Search, gives Battle Pass progress and Rank)
- Cross-Core Customization (They are still adding more, so far has Helmets, Shoulders, Visors, some Colors.)

- A new continuous Rank / Level system, seperated from the Battle Passes, showcasing how long you have played the game, with the Max Rank reward being the MARK VI Armor, aka Master Chief's armor from the campaign.

- A significant increase to Battle Pass XP gained, and you now gain it just by playing the matches alongside completing the challenges, instead of only the challenges.

- I really can't stress just how much content the Forge Mode has added to the game, 343i has been keeping a lookout on some of the most popular Custom Maps and sometimes add them to the Multiplayer browser, making it so that there is a fairly consistent rotation of new maps added to the list, furthermore, the Halo Infinite Forge is highly customizable and only getting better each update, there are a plethora of gamemodes people have created that completely change the way you play.

All of this on top of Halo Infinite's already stellar gameplay that it has had since launch, which has only been refined over these two years with bug fixes, balancing, and improved networking, have made this game my favorite modern shooter, the only thing limiting my playtime towards it, is the fact that I massively prefer PvE games these days, with Halo PvE being something I often fondly return to, but Halo Infinite lacks replayability when it comes to that, one day I hope to see more from Halo in the PvE department, something to truly keep me locked in, but until then, this is what we've got.

Unfortunately I am still frustrated with Halo Infinite even after all the great updates and improvements to staff that 343 has gone through.

The Plasma pistol recharge rate needs to be decreased, and it just needs to be reliable even without the the overcharge (its only useful for that in multiplayer)
vehicles need a complete rehall as far as effects and stuff goes, halo odst/3/reach was peak vehicle effects
The commando needs a buff too, its accuracy can't keep up especially with the reasonable excessive recoil, to balance this gun again (they nerfed it) it needs to deal better damage
Otherwise, as a halo veteran (since combat evolved), the game has come a LONG way since launch in all  aspects, xbox replacing the staff at 343 really helped, halo has been making a comeback since summer 2023, nothing but fantastic changes and editions, plus they actually listen to the fans and do their best to fix/edit/provide/add/etc, the new people at 343 seem to actually care, the game plays like a fast paced halo 3 with some added halo like gameplay mechanics; throwing coil canisters, the many great power ups (grapple/etc), balancing the idea of having sprint and walking speed in a halo game, and many more

Big positive about the game for me have been the movement has been alot of fun, more so when i get my hands on the grappling hooks and Jet dash tho with how much fun i have with these do wish the shield wall was a tad stronger, old bubble shield could block a rocket after all. 
 I also wasn't a fan of alot of the newer guns earlier on, and while some i have grown more accustomed to, others make me miss older guns, or past versions. Bull dog is neat and gotten more used to it, still miss my classic sword stopping pump, and Plasma pistol used to be able to stop vehicles what happened? and ravager not as cool as bruteshot. 
 And if you want customization! You are better off going to play reach on mcc, where you got alot more options, and mixing and matching is't locked behind a core system. When i head you would be able to earn stuff from reach i had been so excited only to be so disappointed that there was barely any armors pieces for this game, but alot of it was locked behind pay wall with ""Multiplayer is free"" as an excuse. and while coatings could of been executed better as patterns you could change colors on, they instead locked in colors so they could sell you more, shocker there. so many things used to be apart of the base games until companies wanted to split it and sell in bits and pieces to milk more money out of people, things you used to be able to earn in game, and the drive to get them with good gameplay kept people coming back. And while im sure many enjoy the androgyny of body types, i miss my spartan body's from reach, better built imo and think the could add more, hell add Jorge's too so people can get there bulky spartan out too.

So at the moment, no i can't really recommend this game tho maybe in time if they can fix alot of the customization and monetization. 

Also missed chance to have friends be there custom Spartans in campaign with host as MC

Infinite had a rough start when they weren't able to regularly release content updates, but it's only gotten better since they fired the management responsible for that crap and went with the peeps who made MCC what it is now.
[b]The Multiplayer[/b] is exhilarating, with a near perfect feel to the gameplay, and everything they've added over the past couple years has really enhanced the experience.
I'd love to see more interesting and classic weapons and vehicles added. The UI is a bit frustrating at times but that should get better when they release the match composer update soon. There's a ton of maps and gamemodes to enjoy.
[b]The Campaign[/b]  is fun but the open world could have used more content as some areas feel quite sparse. The more linear parts of the campaign are beautiful but there is a lot of the same layout reused... that said I love this forerunner aesthetic, the artstyle is 100% on point here.
I also love the whole mysterious nature of the world they built. The caves you'll find along the way and the forerunner structures you can get into are super interesting. It's clear that they wanted to do a lot more with it, but what they managed to give us is wonderful and I hope the people working on the next campaign can build off of this, giving us more biomes and exploring the many dark mysteries of Zeta Halo.
More varied wildlife would be great as well.
Personally the intensely emotional tone of some of the cutscenes with the pilot are annoying; with him just freaking out all the time, and I get it, but it's not the vibe I want so much in Halo.
Also, and I don't mean to disrespect the actor here, but I did not feel intimidated by Escharum until I had to fight him. The performance felt exaggerated, and semi ridiculous with the animations of the holograms we are asked to watch so often, I just began skipping them. Super excited to see Atriox more in the future, as that's such an amazing design.
I've played through the campaign 3 times and I'm now working on my 4th playthrough just cause it's that great. I 100%'d it once on legendary as well, but stupidly deleted that save somehow when trying to play coop with some friends, so I'm working on getting that done again.

- forge is always online and people have been banned for their content ( one showed weed and another was a bloodied battlefield)
- most stuff on the store is sold in bundles 
- the store is expensive and 343 has been increasing prices due to cross core 
 - things about the game you might not enjoy ( gun play, random weapon spawns, btb random vehicle spawns, etc ) have not changed
- the dmr and the new equipment are not in the campaign 
-still cannot customize banished weapons and vehicles, forerunner weapons, or heavy weapons
- coatings are a pale imitation of the old color system  

There may be more improvements and problems and i will try to change this as i see, but this is the current game. it has problems but however the old team behind the game is gone and the new ones have started to make improvements but this can change for better or for worse. If you are a old fan of halo or have played this at launch and was upset with how it was i say give this a shot see how you like this. however if you have never played halo and are interested, play the The Master Chief Collection, its $40 ( lower on sale ) and gives you a better understanding on why this series has such a large fanbase.

Halo Infinite has everything it needs to be a great game, all the pieces are there but for some reason they just dont fit just right.  it feels like there was great potential, but why does it not feel like a good game?

The more i play the more I feel that this is a hollow game.  The campaign is great though very short even on legendary.  The visuals are fantastic.  The multiplayer is fun.  There are a few aspects of each that just feel like there is something missing yet everything is there.  The challenges that are really the only drive to keep you playing multiplayer are either super easy or insanely hard no in between, and the challenge swaps you do receive without paying money usually swap to a similar almost identical challenge.  Ive had no issues with completing  challenges but i can see how this can be very annoying to some.  After all challenges have been completed for a week there is really nothing pressing you to play on, in multiplayer.  The only thing that brings me back after completing challenges are my friends I like to help, but even they have no issues so its only a day or two of playing after work.   The campaign has a great world and as it stands is complete but the world is only 10 hours for 100%. If you play LASO straight like I did you end up beating the game in under 4 hours. The world feels very small almost as if they planned for something bigger but had to cut content, possibly future expansions much like bungies destiny model of releasing half a game to sell the other half. though 343s expansions are going to apparently free?
Its a good game that can be fantastic. It has all the pieces right there but they arent fitting together just right and it just makes the game as a whole feel hollow.

Came back to see what changed with season 2 and its almost like 343i doesnt care about anything the community has to say its not as bad as season one but it still feels hollow and they are shoehorning in all these cosmetics but still have yet to add any real features into the game

Overall, if you are on the fence about playing, there are modes in multiplayer that can sort of mimic the campaign. If you are thinking about buying the campaign, I would say wait until a sale. I started playing in the multiplayer early release, (not beta, before the actual campaign launch however, which was my b-day, Dec 8), and it has continually improved. It now has forge, which is basically the equivalent of creative if you have played that in fortnite. The campaign now has co-op, and I haven't taken the time to complete it that way however.

Gunplay's fine. 

Graphics are fine.

Everything else?

[h1]Garbage.[/h1]

Having played this game's campaign, and been thoroughly disappointed by a piss-poor story, only barely carried by semi-competent character writing, an attempt at revisiting it only yielded a strong reminder of why Halo should have just stayed with a linear story campaign. Traipsing around the map Far Cry-style wears thin quickly, even with the grappling hook added to your repertoire of skills and powers.

Plot points set up in the previous game are resolved off-screen; Major events happen [i]away[/i] from the player, and even away from the camera. This sort of storytelling, in the same series where we got behind-the-scenes looks at the Covenant collapsing or the Flood causing problems or humans fighting in New Mombasa, is an insult. 

Created Conflict? Oh, that just sort of fixed itself.

The Banished? Yeah, they just sort of somehow came back and won everything everywhere.

Blue Team? Somewhere else, I guess.

What about those characters from Halo 5? Pfft, who knows?

We might have had some answers in a story DLC - a story DLC which they decided to not do anything with, and instead focused on the ridiculous [i][b]storefront[/i][/b] that is the multiplayer.

On that topic, I've also found the multiplayer to be a hacker-infused mess; Fresh accounts will appear, gun down your entire team over and over, and if you wish to report them, you need to visit an [i]external website[/i] and painstakingly upload your evidence. The slog of a process means that by the time you've reported even one, the hacker could quite happily have stitched together another 100 accounts.

This, of course, doesn't even cover the absolutely ABHORRENT monetization in the game.

Want to customize your Spartan like the old days? 
Too bad, pay for it.

Want to try that new Battle Pass, because YES, this is a live service game?
Pay for it.

How about -?
Pay for it.

Want to -?
[b]Pay for it.[/b]

The game is a money sink, filled with cheaters and watched over by a truly lazy dev team.

A weak foray into a beloved series, and another ""live service"" game that's going to go down as a mess and eventually have the plug pulled when it's not generating enough from people paying almost £8.99 for textures to put on a [i]select few[/i] pieces of equipment.

4/10. I'd refund it if I could.

This is the first Halo campaign that I've put down without finishing due to shear fatigue and lack of interest in what happens next. The campaign is a boring and repetitive slog with little clear direction for where the story is supposed to go. The open world is fun at first to load marines into a Razerback (scout warthog) and drive around taking outposts, but it's the only thing the campaign has going for it. I got 90% through it on Legendary and stopped because the story and level design was so uninteresting that I didn't care how it ended and didn't want to continue. 

The multiplayer, on top of often not working on a functional level, is bland, with neutered physics compared to previous titles. Although Halo is historically a controller-based title, it has never felt worse to play on one. The focus on competitive play rather than fun with friends fails to reproduce the top-class experience of Bungie-era titles. The free-to-play aspects and focus on microtransactions cause common staple playlists to be locked behind timed, store revenue generating events. It comes off as sterile and disingenuous, and leaves one hell of a bad taste in my mouth.

I would readily drop $500 up front, buy the latest Xx Xbox Series GX xX, or even find out how to build a -PC 2- to play a new Halo game that matches (not even improving upon) all of the functionality present in titles from 2007 and 2010. However, the past decade would make it seem like the technology to do so just doesn't exist. Maybe if 343 would hire even more temporary contractors, the quality of their software will improve...

IMO, the leadership at 343 have time and time again over the past decade led the company in the wrong direction, and change at the top needs to happen.

Halo has been my favorite game series since I started playing in 2007. I've enjoyed many of the books and put in thousands of hours into the games. I've completed a number of LASO runs, got my fair share of flag captures and multi-kills, joined a plethora of rowdy late-night custom game lobbies, and made long-term friends along the way. I want to see Halo succeed.

For this one, though, I stopped playing the campaign and haven't touched the multiplayer since the first month. It hurts to put this game away.

One can hope that in the future, there will be a serious restructuring of who is in charge of Halo and how it is made.

--

Update one year later: As a die-hard Halo fan, I haven't touched this game since this review, and it's been great not being upset this whenever I think about playing games.

If you can't stand where Halo has gone, I recommend just putting it away and enjoying other things.

--

Update roughly one more year later: Was playing MCC and thought I'd download Halo infinite and test the waters again. Recent updates sounded promising, and the addition of the Halo Wars armor designs drew me in again. Forge is now a feature, so I jumped in forge. 

Aiming with a controller felt horrible just to look around. 

Spawned a few items like a warthog and a gravity hammer. 
Grenades had zero physical impact when they exploded, and grenade jumps aren't a thing. Gravity hammer had zero physical impact and gravity hammer didn't have any physics effect on a player. 

If there's no sandbox, what distinguishes Halo from any of the other shooters?

I'd still not recommend this title if you're looking for a fun PvP experience or compelling campaign. SBMM is ruining FPS matchmaking in general, this game being no exception. The campaign is lackluster and forgettable. However what truly makes Infinite enjoyable is the Custom Games and Firefight. Custom Games have never been so modular in terms of what Forgers can make. So many unique and interesting experiences are to be had in Customs alone. Firefight is the also the best way to rank up the Battle Pass as it's casual fun and matches are quickly made and finished. It's nice to relax, especially with buddies, in Customs and Firefight every now and then. The Battle Passes are still bloated with emblems and junk nobody wants, but at least we're getting a healthy amount of customization. If you're okay with blowing $10 on a BP that has credits built into it, I'd say it's worth it. Just be careful not to buy any that don't have credits. Also the multiplayer is free, so your friends have no excuse not to download the game and try it..

""Revision: Do not play this game. In its current state, you're far more likely to have fun with an aneurysm than this game. They just released details about fixing BTB matchmaking and yes, you can match with people in BTB now, finally! Except the game doesn't work. No matter what guides you follow, what tutorials, what tips you listen to, you will experience the worst lag, screen tearing, packet loss, desync, glitches, and absolute bullshit ever. This game was at least borderline playable at launch. They've somehow screwed it up so bad, that when doing any kind of action, it will take seconds for the servers to respond. My advice? Play MCC, or any other multiplayer shooter that came out before 2020. They will at least function properly. This is the absolute worst Halo I've played in recent years simply because the developers have fucked it over with their incompetent programming skills and lack of direction. Even if the game were to work, and that is a huge ""if"", there are mountains of mechanics that are simply broken, unbalanced, or do not work properly. Collision was partially taken out, because the devs couldn't program it correctly. Grenade spam is a huge problem, since there's no teamkilling. Shock is an incredibly broken, anti-vehicle weapon type that outclasses previous EMP solutions in the worst way possible. For God's sake, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Wait like a year, because that's what they'll need at minimum to make this an even remotely playable experience. I'm going back to Halo MCC, because at least they've had the time to polish out the multiplayer.

Outdated section: If you're okay with playing for free with basically no progression, go ahead and enjoy the gameplay. The MP, however is pretty broken in its current state as there is no reward for winning. People will gain pretty much the same amount of XP as you by putting a rubber band on their controller. There isn't a feasible way report these players or quitters even. The progression is extremely bloated and grindy. Half of what you get for the paid pass are xp boosts and challenge swaps. There are many detailed strategies used to bog down progression like this. Such as only matchmaking for playlists instead of specific gamemodes, barring you from finding the mode for your challenges. Campaign is fun, albeit frustrating on high difficulties when it comes to bosses and one shot kills. There isn't any armor to unlock with the campaign, it's all skins, camos, emblems, and namecards. Balance is also pretty wack here and there. Most if not all plasma weapons are obsolete, but you can say that's been the case for years. Commando is the worst precision, hitscan weapon as it has a lower DPS than the starting AR. There currently aren't many gamemodes to play and have fun with. Custom games is also broken atm. No Forge or Co-Op until May or later. When you install the game, it automatically installs a texture pack that severely hinders performance. There are a ton of things to fix in order for this game to live up to the Halo name, that said, this is 343's best chance at redemption. The general gameplay is still fun, the art style is fitting, and the sound design is great (except for the maybe the sword and hammer imo). So yeah, if you like Halo, go ahead. If you want to try it out, sure. Don't buy the Battle Pass, don't pay for microtransactions. They're scummy and skimp out on you. I'm playing this long term, because I believe they can and will fix the game eventually.

Update: Hardly anything has changed for the better. If anything it's worse. BTB is totally broken and MP has massive lag and desync issues. It's borderline unplayable. They say the next season is in May? That's way too long until anything interesting. Many current cosmetics are misaligned and poorly attached to your armor, which also won't be fixed until many months. Wait a year and then see if the game is worth playing.""",1639600832,1706591421,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I still feel betrayed because I played this in the original date of release and my hatred for the multiplayer cloud my judgement, but after watching youtube lore vids and replaying the MCC, I change my mind. I may not like the cliff hanger but the story mode is now a solid 10/10. I like how it maintains the Master Chief's character, his chemistry with echo 219/Fernando Esparza, and the Weapon/Offensive Bias heir. The cast is amazing, Echerarrams ark is great, The Weapon finding a new purpose to fight alongside the Chief and Fernando was amazing.  This game reminds me why The Master Chief is the G.O.A.T of the gaming industry. the gameplay is great, the controls are amazing, I believe, they found a good basis to pivot off, in future games. It also has tons of unlocks and you can replay missions... I say again, you can replay missions now and not loose progress, that's 10/10 in my books.

 the Multiplayer is better now, still wish I firefight early. Also, as much as hate those fruity ass looking suits, there some designs that stay lore friendly, and their some that may break lore, but still has found fans in the gaming community that still enjoy this game. I may hate the fact that there is no healthy spartan butts, because, yes I'm dirty and I don't give a fuck, the games customization has plenty to offer in terms of customization, as of January 2024.

I think its worth buying now. I also believe, while separating developer from publisher, 343 Industries is now on the right path, and I have a new hope for the future of the Halo franchise.


The original December post where I am jaded asshole who felt burned by 343.

(This review/critic is 100% my perspective and experience with the game.)
With the word ""Infinite"" in its name, I originally, and naively, believe this was the last halo game, with updates or DLC to continue the story with Master Chief. I thought it was gonna be like destiny 2, back when it was good, where they'd add stories with season. I was wrong, and I feel robbed. don't buy this game expecting to have an satisfying campaign or live-service. Some of the skins, their not spartan armor, their fucking skins, suck, in my opinion. It's like the armor design was meant to draw in the ""Fortnite"" crowd, which makes me lose all respect for the game. They don't fit in the halo universe. and ruins the multiplayer for me. How am I supposed to feel like a badass being part of the Gen VI Spartan, an augmented super soldier, if I someone running with goddamn antlers or cat ears on their armor? rhetorical question, I can't, it sucks for me, and I lost all interest. the armor will never be as good as the other game, even 5(I know but that armor still fit. they where authentic), and especially Halo Reach. I hate this multiplayer, I can't even play as an elite/Sangheili.

The campaign is good don't get me wrong, but falls in certain avenues, and spoiler alert, you never fight Atriox, only his foster father, who is a good villain, but you, or the Master Chief, never meet him until  30 minutes into the game via holo com. Atriox kick the Chiefs ass, how come I can't fight him, where's that rematch.
 Also, as much I respect the Act Man, I believe opposite of his opinion, bring back the flood, I have seen so many lore videos because I am that much of a fan, they are a better enemy than the Promethean Knights or the skirmish. They can make a return and, if Master Chief succeeds, can put an end to the flood, where they can acknowledge readiness to look after the other races, which if you watch or know the lore, was the reason the franchise stared, it irk the forerunners that would be tested to be babysitters while the creators went to seed life into other parts of the universe. I never got that conclusion or fought a hivemind, like the Greymind itself, or blow up the key mind world.

 other than spending money on the campaign, which tells the story, not to similar, but still has the DNA story of 2 Forerunner A.Is, Offense Bias(the Weapon) and Mendicant Bias(Cortana), I lost all interest in the multiplayer. I also lost all faith in both Xbox and 343 to continue the Halo franchise in this condition. I recommend the campaign, but no the multiplayer.",1704083978,1706565000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of the best Halo multiplayer experiences, and among the best competitive arena shooters. Weapons and maps are all fun to use. Very polished and smooth. Also free to play. Could use some more maps, but I'm sure they'll come. Unfortunately the whole thing is slightly brought down somewhat by aggressive cosmetic monetisation (the price paid with the shift to free to play). This doesn't affect gameplay but hopefully this will change as it sours the experience just a little.
EDIT: There are Lots of Maps and Forge Mode now

Campaign: 7/10
The return of the classic artstyle will certainly evoke nostalgia, and the open expanses of the ring are a visual spectacle. Mechanically, the gameplay feels smoother than ever and exploring the open parts of the ring and demolishing outposts is fun. New additions to the sandbox make this feel like a true modern evolution of classic Halo. Throwable fusion coils and a grapple make the physics sandbox very entertaining to interact with. Despite this, I found the campaign lacking compared to previous ones. It severely lacked in environment variety and epic moments. The missions are always set in the same forerunner areas with little variety, and there are no really hype set-pieces like classic games had. Bosses range from ok to annoying. The grapple hook, while extremely fun, was too prevalent a part of the core moveset imo, amking other equipment and playstyles redundant. (Plus the image of master chief zipping around Halo as his main method of traversal like he's playing Just Cause is a honestly a little silly) The story requires a little too much background knowledge of wider Halo lore than I think it should, and more importantly, I personally just didn't think it was very exciting. It spent half the time trying to address the bad Halo 5 plot (which was apparently concluded off screen in a book), and the other setting up a new story in a way which did not make me care at all. I finished the campaign having enjoyed myself, yet also feeling underwhelmed. In some areas it excelled while in others it was sorely disappointing. I still think the original Halo trilogy is the peak of shooter campaigns and this didn't reach those heights. I think in general I prefer the tighter structure of those games, the shift to an open world for the sake of it was unnecessary.",1640054072,1706540156,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Does this encourage play diversity? not really. just gives whichever team that's dominating more toys to play with. 

""ok,"" you might say, ""just play literally any other gamemode."" Not really the point. when i reinstalled the game to give it another shake I got reminded that I take issue with the newer 343 developed maps (they look great but feel bad) but the issue isn't as prevalent in BTB maps. Will I keep trying? probably. none of this would be an issue if i could figure out how to play firefight solo but I really can't figure that out if there even is a way.


OPINIONS ON CAMPAIGN: Not finished. The ground it covers I would expect from at best half a game this scale. Hard to tell if it was trying to DLC bait or outright sequelbait, but it's obvious the focus was and still is on the multiplayer, the campaign is an afterthought and really isn't worth the asking price if you're just wanting to experience the missions. the open world isn't rewarding to explore outside the incentive of upgrades or the big selling point of cosmetics to use in the multiplayer (lol). I like the new enemies! they're cool. I also found a plushie in the game world once. that was cute.

Game has been vastly improved in terms of it's multiplayer offering and I am having a really fun time with this game. Too little too late, I understand. But, they have added a wealth of content that makes me give this game a 7/10. If you're looking for a fun multiplayer experience for free, there's pretty good value here. 

Halo Infinite. What can I say about this game? Quite a lot. But I will keep it brief. A few disclaimers first. 

I am not a die hard halo fan. I played through the Masterchief collection back in 2021 which I felt was dated but was a great package for those new to the Halo franchise. I was looking forward to playing the next instalment in the franchise in that year. I'm a fan of first person shooters and especially science fiction futuristic type of shooters. I played this game first on a 1650Ti laptop through game  pass and then eventually, when it went on sale for about $49.99 I outright purchased it as I had a new 6750XT desktop system to run it at higher settings. I played through the campaign and have over 100 hours on the game total at the time of this review. For multiplayer, I don't care about forge and I also don't buy any battle passes. I also never played coop.

The good : 

The campaign. It's a good story. Not extravagant. Not out of the world. Not going to shatter any records or break any new ground. It's just good with an open world to explore and some excellent cutscenes. Voice acting is very good and it's a joy playing as the masterchief. Could it have been better? Absolutely and it really should have been for a franchise this old. 

Weapons : The guns feel and look and sound good. Good variety of vehicles to use in the campaign to get around. The grapple hook, to me, counts as a weapon and that is an excellent addition to this franchise and is perfect for the masterchief's arsenal. I personally think the AR is the best version of it out of all of the Halo games. 

Upgrading : You can upgrade your suit which is nice. You have a nice tac map to access upgrades and find your way around the map. 

Game play : The core gun play, animations, traversal, and the way the game generally plays in it's combat and manoeuvring is really well done here and definitely one of the high points. It's more advanced than the prior Halo games but just modern enough to please old and new fans. 

Soundtrack : Soundtrack is very good. Stays faithful to the original games music but also brings out a more modern flair. I have some of the tracks on my spotify just like the old games. I would say the old games music was better, but that's because those are timeless classics that are very hard to top. 

The Bad : 

Graphics : This was a very tough call to make. There are many moments where this game is absolutely beautiful. Such as when you stare at the Zeta Halo ring with the sun setting behind it, or the sun rising behind it. The lighting is gorgeous, some of the environments look very nice...but it's all very surface level. There are no different biomes. Some pop in occurs, things in the distance look grey, dull, and unrendered. Zooming in reveals some unfinished textures. Trees look great from a distance, but once you get close you realize some of the details are off. The night time in this game is beautiful. Masterchief and cortana looks very good. Enemies look good. Overall, it looks and feels like halo....but not 2021 Halo. It looks like a mid range 2015 Xbox One release...not a next generation Xbox Series X release like it should. Maybe Horizon Forbidden West spoiled me, but that's no excuse. Some of the environments in previous Halo games like Halo 4 and 5 look better here. I can still forgive some of these things if it weren't for the performance issues at these rather ""very average graphics with some stand out moments.""

Performance : So on my 1650Ti laptop the performance was not the best but I could still get a fairly steady 60fps average at medium to high settings at 1080p. On my 6750XT I was getting about 90 - 120FPS on maxed out settings at 1080p. This is absolutely garbage performance for a game that has very average looking graphics. I think this is due to the slip space engine. I have riva tuner, vsync, freesync, and graphics and frame rate caps adjusted to give me a smooth near stutter/tear free experience today, but at stock settings without much fiddling around, this game had many micro and macro stutters that I feel are inexcusable for a game of this calibre and history. Not much else to say here besides the overall performance of this game is disappointing.

Side Quests : I don't think there are any side quests. You kill some ""most wanted"" style enemies which are fun to find and kill. Some boss battles are quite interesting and fun but nothing too grandiose. You do have some collectibles scattered throughout the map. You also have random enemy encounters and bases to complete. You also have trapped fellow marines to rescue. Other than the standard open world offering, there isn't much else. Fairly standard here. Once it's done, it's done. I think you can still replay some high value targets but not much else to do.

Multipayer : Fun to play at launch but that was OK because it played really well, was still in beta, was free to play for everyone, and the other games were trash such as BF2042 and Vanguard. Performance was average but the core gun play and game play was there and was a very nice treat for old and new fans. However, the multiplayer was missing tons of features at launch like being able to select just specific modes such as slayer or team slayer. You also didn't have any skills tracking or a ranking mode to track your progress. Everything was tied to the battle pass system which wasn't too bad because it never expires and it was only about $9.99 CAD. However, it was the only form of progression and that was a huge disappointment for me. I don't care much about forge but that wasn't in the launch game. Lack of content like maps and being able to customise your spartan like you could in prior games was also a big loss. The store was also disappointing as lots of the items were locked away and you had to buy it separately for ridiculous prices. Long story short, the multiplayer was not pay to win by any means, but it was riddled with micro transactions and overall lack of content once the game was released. Today at the time of this review, lots of these issues are resolved but it's too little too late. 

Verdict : Not a bad game but not great. I rate it a 6/10 overall. There are some fun moments. Campaign is fun to play through once. Once you finish all the side missions on the map (there aren't that many to do), there isn't much else to do besides explore around and fight the same enemies over and over again. If you want to buy this game, It's hard to recommend it any price point above $49.99 CAD. There are many games out there that are just plain better to play.",1694979892,1706509918,True,0,0,0.521935045719146729,0,True,False,False

I have been a Halo fan since 2001. I've played every game, preordered every game except 5 since Halo 3, and play the Master Chief Collection regularly, multiplayer and campaign. I dont personally know anyone who is a bigger Halo fan than I, and I was really looking forward to Infinite and preordered it even though the Alpha Flights left much to be desired. 

But the multiplayer is awful. The soft aim assist for controller that has been a staple of the series since 2001 is completely missing, meaning gunfights feel clunky and awkward if you play with a controller. The lobbies are filled with hackers that aren't even trying to hide their exploits and there is no way to block or report them. 

This game was already delayed, but it should have been delayed further. And, most of all, it should never have become Free-To-Play. You'd think Warzone and Team Fortress 2's current situations would have tipped 343 off about that.

Edit:

7 Months has passed since I wrote this review and nothing has changed. There is still a content desert, with what little new content being buggy gamemodes and ugly cosmetics. I go 2-3 matches before the game's servers stop trying and the lag makes the game not worth even trying. After that the lag becomes rampant, with my end of the game being a full Battlerifle burst behind, and I know for sure that exact length because the Battlerifle only gamemode Tactical Slayer is the only gametype I can find any fun with anymore. Even that is now only 50/50 as the Non-Battlerifle game modes that are shoved into the playlist make you play with two of the game's worst new weapons. 

There is still no way to report hackers right after a game. 

There are no new maps in standard rotation, and the ones in current rotation are garbage.

Edit 2: 

A full year since my last review and I last played this game, and its not gotten any better. The game itself handles like everything is coated in butter still, incomprehensible glitches and lag are still common, but hey at least we got an almost working Infection mode. It barely works and the Announcer literally insults you and tells you how bad you are every time you die, but its something. 

I remember when Halo 5 was considered controversial for lack of content. A year and a Half in and Infinite hasn't even gotten to Halo 5 on Launch levels on content. By this part of Halo 5's life cycle it was the largest Halo game that existed.

Edit 3:

Now 2 years since game release and it still handles like absolute garbage on PC. Essentially unplayable, with still very little content added. A few good minor changes, all centered around the way the game makes money and none around actually playing the game.

Edit 3:

I keep coming back to this game every now and then only because Halo has been one of my ""core"" franchises since I was a child. It feels wrong to not play or at least check in on the latest entry to the series occasionally. 2 and a half years after launch and my opinion has only gotten worse. Somehow Infection is boarderline unplayable. Servers still suck, controls still suck. The map rotation is eye-watering-ly bad. Whoever approved the maps in current rotation should be fired, plain and simple.

So like, there are a number of reasons. One being the load times for matches, It has the traditional countdown, but after that, it loads up the level, then does another countdown, then loads into the game, and then you have to watch a unnecessary spartan intro where the camera pans to all the Spartans of your team and they do some little ""shrug"" or ""emote"" at the beginning of every match. Then the game finally starts. I feel like that last part is just a waste of the player's time.

The gameplay it's self isn't really bad or anything, it plays well! But I do have a few gripes with the so-called ""advanced"" movement though. For instance: I don't see how a slide that takes you about 3 feet can be useful. As well as a sprint function that feels like it only makes you 5% faster than the traditional walking. At that point why not just make the Spartans move faster?

Forge is probably my biggest bitch point. To be fair, I never played Halo 5. But I'm aware they made forge different, and that difference carried into Infinite. Forge mode as become (for me) overly complicated. It's definitely learnable, and has some amazing function for sure, and with the recent advent of AI forge the possibilities are endless. That said, why is there no free form rotation? Hold RT to spin, and LT to move up, down, side to side? It felt much more user friendly in previous titles. I think of Halo Reach's UI and think ""man, they could have just done it that way."" I feel like I'm navigating a city when I'm forging. There are so many different avenues and pathways to get to the simplest things that it makes me want to put down my controller and go make better use of my time. All of this makes for a very slow learning/building experience. Something I could have done in 5 minutes in Halo: Reach, takes me almost 20 in Infinite.

Simply. 
From audio design for the entire selection of weapons, to the NPCs who wield them or the vehicles they can operate.
 343 has meticulously crafted an experience where every corner is brimming with jank.


I came back, redownloaded the game for this most recent up date which supposedly allowed firefight, and forgeable firefight at that! T'was deception! There are no options, and certainly if there is; no maps made. The frustration i've come to terms with as a norm for everytime I look back over at what 343 is doing to this massive icon. But goddamnit. King of the Hill firefight? ... waiting a full minute for respawn, enemies so spongey I thought I was in a fallout mod. 

 Too split off, what in the hell is going on with customization and armor? We had reached apex at Reach with the Credit system, but now? You want me to shell out ten bucks for something that looks like a melted transformer?? Absolutely not, and all the remotely interesting stuff, showing a tad bit more into the lore of the S IV's like we wanted, expanding a bit on the Headhunter idea/story with lore tidbits with these neato little pieces of armor.. but now theyre all entirely unavailable - 'vaulted' what the fuck does that mean? Is the World of Warcraft or some other MMORPG? 

I wanna shoot shit and make my space soldier look badass, you've hindered me too an extreme in that regard. With that, a mention on the new additions too the sandbox - foremost the skimmer and the charge rifle. ... just bring back the beam rifle, these are just flying grunts, who - for some reason or another.. bring human weaponry at higher ranks/difficulties. A stand out choice. Excluding the mangler and mauler from the rant, the exceptional damage behind each shot of the mangler makes up for the rate of fire and drop, standing aside the headshot potential. The mangler is a tad strange, i'd care to have the brute shot back but this thing isn't-horrendous- I appreciate the alt fire, though it is a bit weak, but that can be said about the typical bursts and battery life of the weapon. Pressing onto the pulse carbine and kommando - the pulse carbine's tracking aspect (much like the reworked needler and it's prerequisites to supercombine) are quite finnicky, one might be holding cross hair over a grunt, skirmisher, skimmer, or jackal only to find after each burst you'll need to let the weapon seemingly reacquire the target, elsewise the burst while dumb fire, which would be of no inconvenience had we the storm rifle.. plasma repeater, or plasma rifle. Nevertheless, the Kommando's low rate of fire, while suiting me is often keeping pace or overtaking the role formerly, and debatably, currently be held by the current 'DMR' though both iterations of the Bandit do that weapon, even the obscene bloom of Reach no justice, lacking a traditional scope, holographic sights take the stage to a middling effect. All as previously mentioned, similarly suffer from an issue of personal conjecture - the audio for most these weapons are a tad weak. While not specifically mentioned, the AR strikes me as a heftier SMG, wherein i'd care for the borderline machine gun of Halo 4, reviled as the game often is, the Bandit; despite earlier afforded comments scratches such an itch.. which pains me, knowing that the BR could have the crisp crack of the H2A's.. 

A further note with mention of Halo 4, as Halo 5 of course followed, introducing the world to the.. REQ system. Similar to armor abilities, the love was not shared throughout the world with the aspect of additional attributes to traditional weapons. .. Interesting though some were. Infinite's multiplayer seemingly has come to both embrace and abandon the idea? Whilst card packs and call-ins are nowhere near commonplace, a scant few power weapon spawns, typically coming in around the matches latter portion - will take on additional powers. My own issue with lies in the.. lack of opportunity there is now for one to familiarize self with the rosters entirety unless they've the 60$ campaign (Still waiting for my Flood DLC..). The sole facets being Forge, or becoming (un)lucky enough to snag a front row seat to what exact that weapon might do.

Yes. I recommend, however you may want to wait a few months from now when all the issues are ironed out. The campaign is decent 7.5/10 for me, Core gameplay of multiplayer is great, good mix of old and new.  However I can't give multiplayer more than 7.5/10 due to few playlists/modes, no progression, confusing ranking system, few maps, broken UI and Theater, and desync issues. With these issues ironed out I'd easily give mulitplayer a 9/10. The core gameplay loop is that good.

Update March 31, 2022
Originally I gave this game a recommendation, however I can no longer recommend this game  to anyone. All of the issues I noted in my original review are still issues now with no fixes in sight. On top of this is the content drought. This is the most incomplete Halo game ever released, with the longest development cycle, and the longest wait for DLC. The player base has tanked on Steam and Season 2, which is coming in May, nearly 6 months after launch of the multiplayer, doesn’t appear as it will provide the amount of content this game desperately needs. The best way to describe Halo Infinite’s multiplayer is a fun but extremely repetitive and buggy experience with little replay value. Boring Maps, no progression outside battle pass, horrible UI, bugs, and most importantly lack of updates has caused the disastrous decrease in the player base with a 90% percent drop. When will this game get the content it needs? Who knows as there still is no roadmap. It is a shame as the core gameplay loop is the best since 3. It is a Diamond covered in shit.

Update July 30, 2022
The game is virtually the same since the March 31, 2022 update I posted. 2 new maps, a few rotational modes, 2 new modes in last spartan standing and land grab, return of king of the hill, introduction of co-op flight, but still buggy, bad UI, and most features like theater and custom games are still broken. I doubt they'll be fixed this year.  Player base still dropping. It will take a miracle to revive this game. Core gameplay wasted on a buggy and incomplete product with greedy microtransactions and challenges.

Update January 12, 2023
The game is in a slightly better state than it was last year. Forge and campaign online co-op is finally in the game along with a custom game browser. For all intents and purposes they have been a success. Two new forge (non developer) made maps have been added. However, no new weapons or equipment have been introduced, and  no new and exciting modes. Also Season 2 which was originally set to end in November of 2022 was extended until March of this year. A year and 2 months after launch the game still is missing MANY core features that Halo games from up to 15-16 years ago had such as career progression, a working theater, pre-game and post game lobby, assassinations, invasion mode, warzone mode, and file share for photos and videos, among other things. The competitive ranking system is far inferior to the ranking system found in Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo MCC. The rubberbanding issues that were in at launch are still present. Also, split screen co-op will never be coming to the game, even though 343 promised that before the release of Halo Infinite no new Halo game will ever ship without split screen co-op. Player base had a slight increase, but is still well underperforming compared to other live service games. At this stage I doubt Halo will ever have a resurgence. This is what modern Halo is unfortunately, a half baked incomplete game.

Update July 2, 2023
The game is finally in an ok shape. NOT great shape, but ok. It has a good assortment of modes and maps for both 2v2, 4v4, and 12v12. Infection, one of the staple modes is FINALLY in the game, and is actually fun. Never been one to play infection, but it is fun for a few rounds. They have added career progression with military style ranking systems. It is far inferior to the career progression in any Halo game before it, especially Halo Reach. Instead of each rank getting a unique icon and name, you essentially go through different divisions of the same rank (cadet to general) until you reach the Hero rank. No unlockable armor for achieving specific ranks at this point, only icons and stickers. Supposedly there is going to be a major reward for Hero rank but who knows. The system is definitely not as rewarding as previous ranking systems and doesn't seem complex at all, which makes me wonder why it took them so long to add it. Also, we have the most basic of service records where you see your career rank, csr rank, games played, and campaign difficulty completion. No kill tracking, medal tracking, etc. Ranked Slayer is in the game and will be a rotational playlist with doubles and snipers, while Arena stays in the game permanently. Unfortunately, the playerbase is so small that if you play ranked solo you are going to run into constant 4 stack teams at the higher ranks. There is a large amount of customization. You probably won't go into a game and see a spartan that looks just like yours, that is of course if you bought the battle passes, unlocked the event armor, engaged in the store, and got Twitch drops from HCS, which is why this game should've never been F2P. The best customization is locked behind paywalls, even the battle pass items are inferior to the store items. I'd rather this be a 70 dollar game with paid DLC with the customization unlockable vs F2P. Yes it might split the playerbase, but armor customization would be more rewarding. Theater works better, still glitchy, and nowhere near the theater in the Bungie games or MCC, but better. Performance is the same as it was at launch with bad hit detection on different pings, crashes, no FPS limit for the lobby, games starting with 3v4, and rubberbanding. The custom game browser is ok, and forge is great for those who like that, with 343 adding some user created maps into playlists. At this point the game, content wise, is as complete as it's going to get and is nearly in the state that it should have launched at (still needs a PvE mode). However, it's ridiculous that it took 18 months to get here. Performance will never get better. Something is just fundamentally broken about the performance in this game. I personally believe 343 will have 1 more season of the game to add PvE and then end active development by the end of this year.  With no campaign DLC coming, the cancellation of the multiplayer narrative, a dwindling playerbase that shows no signs of a turnaround, and Microsoft losing faith, what purpose would it serve to continue active development on this game past this year? Infinite, even with all its additions is a lost cause. It is not close to being the best Halo game, but it is enjoyable for me from time to time. Would I recommend it now? No, I wouldn't. However, for those who just have a morbid curiosity about what's in the game now, I see no reason to not hop in since it's F2P. 6.5/10

Update January 25, 2024
We are over 2 years since Infinite launched. It has been a bumpy ride to say the least. Leadership changes, content droughts, and networking issues, Infinite survived past its 2 year anniversary. Would I say it's on par with Halo during its golden era of 2001-2007? No. Not at all. It has improved greatly but not to the point where it can be considered a return to form for Halo. Many issues from DAY ONE are still here. Broken theater, poor social features, and bad networking. They have added Firefight King of the Hill to the game. It is ok, but I would've like to see some evolution to Firefight from the first iteration in Halo 3 ODST to now. As it stands it is an underwhelming mode IMO and doesn't fully live up to its potential. I believe that is the overall feeling I have for this game. Does not live up to its potential. 343 appears to be moving on from this game and I believe it is the right thing to do. Learn from this mistake and make a better game. However, that is no guarantee with 343.",1639441672,1706218178,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a lot of thoughts while playing this game, and that full length train of thoughts ended up becoming the genesis for a YouTube video which might be posted if you're reading this in the future (search ""Tovarnich"" on YouTube), but suffice it to say:

I do not know who this game was made for.

343 Industries faced a lot of backlash from the core Halo fanbase for the way they changed the series starting with Halo 4. After Halo 5, it seems that they took a really hard look at the series and what they wanted to do with it, and Halo Infinite appears to be the result of that reflection, but I really do mean ""appears.""

What Halo Infinite is, from my experience with it, is a game that does a really great job of looking like Halo. Upon first booting up the game and seeing it with my own eyes I was so ecstatic to see Halo Back Again. It was only after playing through the campaign that I realized this was only superficially the case.

It became quite clear to me that 343 has taken heavy influence from the biggest contemporary games in a valiant effort to bring Halo into the modern age. It is unfortunate then that I think it mostly falls flat. Halo Infinite's gameplay is perfectly adequate, but does not feel especially like Halo to me, and in fact I would say is rather bland in its adequateness (adequacy?). 

I felt like I was playing a Far Cry or maybe Apex Legends with a Halo texture pack mod downloaded and a DOOM: Eternal DLC addon or something, all in service of a God of War 4 plot.

Rather cynically, I believe this is 343's attempts to appeal to the broadest possible fanbase but in doing so I feel they have failed to recapture the soul of Halo that has been rapidly escaping the franchise since Halo: Reach. What I see Infinite as is the husk of Halo animated by the (admittedly competent) infusion of other games which ends up doing a disservice to each element involved, which brings me back to my first point:

I don't know who this game was made for. Because I don't feel like it was made for Halo fans, and if you don't already care about Halo I doubt this would be the game to make you.

And before you ask no I didn't play the multiplayer and I think it has no bearing on this review, since the multiplayer is free and only the campaign is a paid product. Might as well ask me to review a battlepass or something.",1706158487,1706158487,False,9,0,0.562695562839508057,0,True,False,False

I started playing Halo Infinite's multiplayer on day one of launch. Immediately stuck out multiple problems that have been resolved since. For example, back then there was no playlist options in season one. The only playlist options that were relatively available were ""Big Team Battle"" and ""Quick Play"". This also related to XP gain, as the only way to gain XP back then was by completing challenges, but certain challenges required you to complete objectives in certain game modes. Uh oh.

To bring the topic back to XP gain back then, there was no XP gain for completing matches, and you only were able to complete a certain amount of challenges a day. This made completing the Battle Pass for season one almost impossible as before they implemented certain changes to grant you a certain amount of XP, you only could complete the week's challenges before having to wait next week.

There was a minimal amount of maps that existed on launch. In fact it was more common to get the same map a couple times in a row than to get a new map when queuing for Quick Play. Don't forget Big Team Battle back then. There was also no Forge too, something that was structural to Halo since Halo 3.

And now for the most glaring part: customization. Paywalling certain items behind an overpriced system was as cashgrab as a company can get. It was seriously disgusting and even going as far as to paywall the color codes was on par with Doctor Doom levels of evil.

So why do I go about listing all these negatives when I've rated this as a positive review? Because if one thing has managed to shine from all of it, it's that 343 is interested in making the best game possible.

Almost everything that I've written from the negative parts of this list has been fixed and even gone the extra mile. Like for the first point, THEY ADDED PLAYLISTS. There is now XP gain for completing matches plus bonus XP for gaining certain attributes (i.e., being MVP, being on the winning team, etc.). You also get a nice 500 XP for completing your first game of the day. Challenges now feel like a challenge rather than a necessity. There is a ranking system now with rewards for reaching the highest rank possible in casual play, giving players an incentive to keep playing.

With Forge being added in and official maps being added, there's rarely repetitive maps that come through when playing. It's always nice to be able to play a different map every time.

Now to bring it around to customization. Sure I'm a little heated about stuff still being behind a paywall, yes I'm aware that some of the stuff is marked down from their original price. However, I will give props to beginning to bring Cross-Core customization around. It's nice to place a helmet that belongs on the Mark V onto my Mark VI armor to create my own Master Chief. I'm excited to see the Cross-Core pads come around, and hopefully to see more Cross-Core items be brought to the game. Also, I just love how unique the customization in this game has gotten since. I actually feel intrigued enough to shell out money for some of these cosmetics (yeah, I fell for it like the blind sheep I am).

Now while some of these items have been fixed, I will also give some positives to the game before some of these changes were implemented. For example: minimal FOMO. The only FOMO that exists would be with Operations. However, it's great that 343 is able to give us the option to choose whatever Battle Pass we want to level. Because of this, I don't feel a need to rush to get a Battle Pass done. The only thing I would need to worry about would be Operations.

Another positive: gameplay. We may not have all the guns in this game from previous installments, but it doesn't mean we can't have fun with the guns we have. I am glad with how aiming is done in this game, and I'm also happy about how some of the guns have alternate firing modes. Movement is smooth and really makes you feel like a Spartan. Overall, playing feels fun and not overbearing.

To conclude, I've grown up with the Halo series since Halo 2. While this game had a rocky start, as a long time Halo-fan this feels like a great game and really solid. It definitely deserved a nomination at the Game Awards over Destiny 2 and I'm upset that it didn't receive that nomination. In short, game gud.",1638289556,1706051083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After the addition of Firefight, this game is really flourishing. A good PvE mode is what was needed. 343 Industries is also reworking all of the various networking issues that this game faced through the years, and now it's a pretty great package. I still think its vile that things like colors and emblems are locked behind paywalls, but the content that isn't is quite good.

[h2][b]Original Negative Review[/b][/h2]

I had originally given this game a positive review for its additive gameplay. But I just can't support this studio and their practices anymore. During the time since Halo Infinite launched, I started working professionally in game dev at a studio in California. This job has revealed so much to me about how games are made professionally, and the more I learn about it, the more I marvel at how incompetent 343 Industries is. Professional AAA studios have practices in place to develop games in ways that prioritize structure and efficiency, and 343, Microsoft's most important studio, is stuck fumbling around tripping over their own feet like a toddler. Something happened in this studio that is preventing them from following basic professional game development practices. 

Basically, if they were set up like any other ordinary studio, it would not take them 6 months to push bug fixes. But it does.

Their incompetence, alongside their egregious over-monetization has just turned me off from this game's ""live"" service (which is absolutely dead). I still think the PvE is phenomenal, but as of right now that's only a small portion of the game.",1637037636,1706042769,True,0,0,0.615404903888702393,0,True,False,False

I've played this game on and off since launch and sticking by it has been brutal. The game launched lacking features and got stale quick and honestly, it hasn't recovered. Even though they've made progress on implementing new maps and modes, there are lingering issues. Namely, the net code sucks. The gameplay is smooth and enjoyable... 80% of the time. At least once a match I'm shot around a corner, or a melee that should have definitely hit simply doesn't connect.

I also find myself frustrated at this game more often than I'm enjoying myself. The matchmaking is ground-up poorly designed. Every time I play I think about how much better a lobby system would be, for multiple reasons. First off, I spend way too much time on different loading screens and menus coming out of a match. Second, and most importantly, I get thrown into games playing the same map over and over. Three maps across ten games is bullshit, and it happens regularly. When I go on a tilt, it's extremely hard to recover when I get put into garbage map after garbage map with no reprieve. Anecdotally, I suspect I am not the only one who feels this way, because often times, on a map I don't like, a teammate or an opponent will leave the match. I think a lobby system where you could vote on maps or modes would really make players feel like, ""even if this round isn't my cup of tea, I'll enjoy the next one"". In particular, it would make Quick Play more enjoyable as community consensus would mean the better maps and modes were more often in rotation. 

Speaking of maps, I swear, there are so many that just weren't play-tested. There were few maps at launch, but for the most part (FUCK Launchpad), they were well-balanced, and visually distinct. Many of the new maps, however, are far too sprawling, confusing, and have awful sight lines. My main issue is the verticality. A lot of the new maps are multi-tiered with no easy or intuitive way to transition between the levels. It drives me fucking mental. It would be great if in these maps, everyone was a equipped with a grapple hook, so that they could take advantage of the verticallty, and play with a fun mechanic at the same time, but nope, not an option. This issue is also connected with my other main complaint, which is that cover is non-existent. Every sight line break is accessible by at least three other sight lines. IF I AM BEING SHOT FROM EVERY DIRECTION AT ONCE, ALL THE TIME, IT IS NOT A GOOD MAP. This problem isn't helped by the lack of feedback when you're getting hit. You know you're getting hit, but where from and how severely can be hard to parse. The lack of kill cam means you don't always know how you died, or from where, and makes it difficult to learn the map. There are also terrible spawns where I'll spawn into or right next to enemy fire which is a particular problem in Tactical Slayer. These maps don't have many areas where players tend to congregate and spawns aren't intelligent enough to keep players coming back to backup their teammates when they die. It means combat kind of happens all over the place sporadically, and coupled with sprawling maps, means it can be difficult to rally after a team wipe. 

The customisation also sucks. They've just started making coatings and helmets cross-core, but I'm sorry, it's not what we were promised, and it's still designed to suck your money. 

I'm sure I'll continue to return to this game periodically, but if you're looking for a new multiplayer shooter, stay away.",1705917186,1705917186,False,3,0,0.530685961246490479,0,True,False,False

To preface, this game was gifted to me by a good friend who wanted to see if his nostalgia for this series would match the critique of someone who had never played any of the Halo games, Me. We played in the order that they were released, in co-op, on Heroic difficulty and while I enjoyed the multiplayer, I won't really mention it too much because I don't have much to say on it, it's fun, the devs took their sweet time adding stuff in, and hyper monetization sucks ass. 

In no particular order, here's a list of games that were at some point referred to as ""Halo Killers""; Haze, Killzone, Pariah, Titanfall, Advent Rising, Halo 4, Halo 5, Halo Infinite. Many lived, many died, and God willing, one day they might allow old Master Chief to crawl into the grave he so richly deserves. 

Halo is the prime example of when a franchise is allowed to go on for far too long, without reinventing itself. It rested on its laurels for far too long. With Halo 4, 343 gave us an excellent story about Cortana's slow and moving decline, and a lot of nonsensical extended universe stuff. Halo 5 was a mess of poorly executed ideas in both the squad based combat, along with the failure to pass on the torch to a new main character, and the walking back of Cortana's demise.

Halo Infinite, lacking any sort of confidence in itself and in the past games, hand waved the events of both Halo 4 and 5, dropping multiple plot threads or outright retconning them. The opening mimics the Halo 2 opening, putting the Infinity under siege by ""The Banished"", a legion of ex Covenant, so once again, we're fighting the same foes for the 6th or 7th game. The ship is destroyed by a blast after MC loses in a cutscene, he's found floating in space not long after by some random dude and they land on a broken ring to find it swarming with Banished, looking for the remnants of the UNSC Infinity crew. 

Here are the two things I liked about Halo Infinite. 1. The gun play, it's Halo, the gun play is great. 2. The grappling hook, one of the new gimmicks for this game, it's fantastic, as grappling hooks tends to be. 

Whereas Halo was once an innovator and marched to the beat of its own drum, these days it's comfortable just following in the tracks of the gaming landscape writ large. Tell me why one of the most prolific game series in the medium is taking notes from Ubisoft's open world design. The world map is scattered with nonsense activities for you to do for nothing other than ""Number go up"". Armors for multiplayer and skill upgrades are found throughout the world, so every other activity you do just gives you credits and vehicle unlocks, but the terrain is so jagged and vertical that some vehicle unlocks are objectively better than others. In what situation would you use a mongoose in this game? 

There's nothing to parse with, saving marines in the open world and in the base assaults has them follow you around but they don't have the same mobility that your grappling hook gives you so what's the point? It's not like every marine you help along the way appears at the final fort assault. You spend this game going through the motions, something that's apparent in the story as well. 

So, Infinity's gone, Cortana's dead for good I guess, you have ""The Weapon"" who's new Cortana, and Echo 216 who saved from space is a cowardly fanboy. The villains are your classic Halo affair, people who want to be known as the one's who finally put down the MC, they're just paper mache villains. 

The cast is so boring, no one has anything interesting to say ever, they're all just walking the same predictable path, Echo is a coward who eventually finds a little confidence, if not in himself, then in the Chief. The Weapon spends most of the game trying to fill the shoes of Cortana, while the MC acts abrasively to her for 10+ hours of content, only for them to reconcile barely in the final act. A new villain is introduced who [spoiler]Is apparently older than the forerunners and calls herself ""One of the Endless"", a race of aliens that predates everything I guess, so we're hitting all of the cliches with this one, she puts up a weak fight at the end and then frees her compatriots who then teleport themselves throughout time and space[/spoiler]. 

The story ends on a weak cliff hanger, and they give a subtle nod that MC might have to [spoiler]travel though time[/spoiler] to stop the villains. From a writing standpoint, [spoiler]time travel[/spoiler] is one of the hardest things a story can do, it's difficult to pull off, and the ramifications of it tend to extend into sequels and into both the actual and figurative universe at large. I, for one, do not have the confidence that this company, with all of the shake ups and purges and questionable business practices, can pull it off. I believe the lowest point for Halo is yet to come, and I would love to be proven wrong.

Halo Infinite has really brought back what Halo once was all about, but it has also brought forward some of the worst things about the gaming industry today.

The core gameplay loop of the multiplayer is top tier, if not the best gameplay Halo has had since the third installment.
It feels great to shoot, jump around, and go crazy with some of the new additions like the grapple shot or the repulsor.
Also to note, how one equips and uses overshields and active camo has been rehauled, and it's all for the better.

In other words, the gameplay is almost perfect, but the game suffers really hard in the areas of customization and progression.

One of the core pillars of Halo has always been the customization.
The fact that they have locked so many things, too many things, behind a paywall, with a sprinkle of FOMO on top of it, makes me really doubt that a lot of people will stick with this game for long.

Also, with having two ""armor cores"", the platforms of where you can customize your specific armor, with no interchangeable armor pieces, really makes creativity and player expression suffer. This was one of the main complaints in earlier ""flights"", beta testings so to speak, and 343 Industries responded with massive promises of letting player build their own spartans, just as how they see fit.

Instead of having two colours, as there has been in the earlier games, they have adapted coatings, a form of skin on which you apply on your armor.
The problem here is that you really limit the ability for players to choose how they want to look like, and 343's solution to this seems to be that they sell certain coatings in the in-game shop for $5-$20 instead.
They have created a massive problem, and also the solution which is to make the players spend a ton of money in the shop to ultimately make them reach their goal of how they want their Spartans to look.

And the coatings are also locked to the armor cores, which are also not interchangeable.

Progression is really lacking.
The only way to see your personal progression is via the ""battle pass"", and the battle pass is mostly filler, with no actual content to give.
It is also extremely slow to rank up, even after the hotfix they recently put out.

We need to see some other type of progression system, just look at Halo: The Master Chief Collection to find a way to do it. 
It may not be perfect there, but you still have some semblance of momentum in your progress as you keep playing.

I can only recommend the multiplayer if you want a true arena style shooter, but if you have any issues with the industrys implementation of battle-passes in games, I would recommend you look for another game, because you will only find yourself disappointed and horrified.

This review will be updated as time goes on, and it is also written before the ""full"" release on 8th December, so I will leave out all of my complaints regarding the lack of playlists and game-modes for now, as I hope they will be added in the coming weeks.

EDIT: This game is a goddamn joke, and I am so sad to see a series go down like this. Jesus, 343i, please, do something good for once.

EDIT 20230130: Game is more or less officially dead with the layoffs at 343. I just wish they were hands off on the Halo games from now on, for 10+ years, they have made games that the playerbase hates. Please 343, begone!

EDIT 20240121: Been a year since I updated this review. 
The game had a promising upswing with season 5, but now the game seems to be in line for a lack of updates and content, due to 343i removing seasons and instead going for ""Operations"".

The core gameplay is as always, still good. But then again, no Story DLCs, skins for 20 buckaroos, and still networking issues. 

Nah fam, I personally still love the game in a way, but I still can't recommend it to anyone.
And probably won't recommend the next Halo game either.

Finally changing my review to a positive since enough content has been added/overhauled.

- Campaign is overall quite enjoyable, but not a favourite of mine. Better than 5's, sure, but I feel like the story they glossed over in opening cutscenes is the game we SHOULD have got. I feel like I'm playing through the aftermath of what could have been an incredible campaign. The actual sandbox/gameplay though? An absolute blast. My core issues with the campaign relate to its story.

- Multiplayer has gone from extremely barebones to a very robust offering with all the overhauls since release. It has the most powerful forge in series history, and with the addition of firefight, is really something great. They've made good strides to making this a worthwhile game to play.

- Monetisation was initially awful, improved a bit, then backtracked again. They can't keep consistent.

343 managed to significantly improve on how they handle halo gameplay (compared to Halo 4) by putting brutes back in and giving you a grappling hook that works pretty well, but these improvements are completely nullified by a few factors. the main issues with this game are the padding, boss enemy design and the lack of any real substance.

this is an open world game (for some reason), and while other games like this have used open worlds effectively (MGS5, Far Cry 3, etc.) it doesn't work here because no matter what angle you come at a fight, it always boils down to the same encounter with the same types of enemies. there's no real variety in the environment itself. it feels like they took the second mission from Halo 1 and stretched it out to be an entire game. any time the game could give you one objective, it instead splits it into 3 identical objectives to pad out game time further. it's egregious and it doesn't take long at all to become grating. my first (and only) run of this game was on Legendary which certainly didn't help how long it took to beat, but even on more reasonable difficulties i can imagine it would get mindnumbing very fast. it's repetitive, boring and fundamentally artificial. nothing about it feels like it came from a place of inspiration. making matters worse, when the game does drawn on inspiration, it takes that inspiration from some of the worst Halo levels, outright repeating the same segments of hallways over and over again during linear segments (just like Library from Halo 1). all in all the sheer amount of padding in the game makes it feel like a tiring chore to play.

further compounding this is the fact that, despite being an open world game, there's literally almost no reason to explore. if you want to find more audiologs where people talk vaguely about cryptic stuff or lore logs with more of 343's frankly dogwater writing, you'll find exploration interesting. otherwise, there's no reason to do it as soon as you've got your shield fully upgraded and enough Valor to spawn BR's at your FOB's. you can do that within the first four hours of gameplay. 

the AI has regressed from Halo 3 (which came out in 2007). remember how in halo 3, marines are very responsive when you get in a vehicle and hop right in with you, even as you start moving? in Infinite, they require you to stop and wait a few seconds while their brains buffer. not to mention often times the enemy AI will simply run right up to you and just...look at you. other times it will detect you behind a rock eight miles away and instakill you. this is especially evident in the boss encounters (enemies that have nigh-invulnerable shields and can instakill you in a split second with unique, bullshit variant guns). generally, the way to beat any boss on Legendary is to figure out how you can to cheese it. often times it's not difficult to do that, so weirdly the terrible, primitive AI on display in Infinite actually makes the boss encounters less awful. hiding on ledges, behind terrain or otherwise abusing the AI is the only real chance you have in boss encounters on higher difficulties, because the amount of shields and damage output they have simply feel untested, like Halo 2 type shit. i personally doubt anybody at 343 playtested Legendary difficulty, it felt very much like they made it ""SUPER DUPER HARD BRO"" by cranking up damage taken and HP totals and then didn't look back.

the game is plagued with many, many more issues apart from these as well. the storytelling is done in an asinine and backwards way that, frankly, doesn't respect the player's time (mirroring everything else in the game), the writing itself is of dubious quality, the vehicles get stuck on the terrain constantly, the flying vehicles control worse than they did in Halo 1, etc. I could go on and on about everything wrong with this game but this is already mucho texto. this is the kind of game that perfectly fits the notion people have about AAA games being uninspired, unpolished slop garbage.

i went in hoping this game would be better than Halo 4, and for the first few hours of gameplay, it was. but, after that it pulls off the mask and reveals what it truly is-- a genuinely laborious, uninspired, bland, unpolished, buggy, pointless industrial-sized drum of FPS slop that the game expects you to gnaw open with your teeth. i can't recommend this game for any price. there are so many better, cheaper options for FPS games out there. if you want a good FPS, just get Halo 3 for MCC instead. Or ODST. Or Bulletstorm, or Doom Eternal, or any Half Life game. unless you are feeling masochistic, pass on this dumpster fire.

It’s a tale of what could have been, and what has impressively been achieved over time. The game, as it stands now, is nothing short of a testament to the developers' dedication and vision. However, there's an underlying sentiment that perhaps an additional year of development could have catapulted it into the echelons of gaming legends.

From the outset, Halo Infinite faced challenges. The initial release was marked by a sparse multiplayer experience with a limited number of maps and a campaign that, while engaging, left many yearning for a more satisfying ending. This initial offering felt more like a foundation waiting to be built upon rather than a complete structure.

Over time, this foundation was indeed built upon, and magnificently so. The introduction of over 30 new maps, Forge, AI PVE in Forge, and a fair Battle Pass system that eradicates the fear of missing out (FOMO) by letting you buy and play old battle passes at any time have collectively transformed the game into a rich and endlessly engaging experience. These additions have greatly enhanced Infinite's replayability and engagement.

The game's performance on low power platforms is also noteworthy. On Linux in general and the SteamDeck specifically, Halo Infinite runs beautifully, showcasing its stunning visuals and smooth gameplay at near 60 FPS constantly. This compatibility and performance are commendable, demonstrating that the developers care about the PC release greatly. Personally the compatibility with the SteamDeck has made me play this game a lot more and has given me a new found love for it.

However, the slow pace of these improvements has had its consequences. The player base, particularly on PC, hasn't reached the potential it arguably could have achieved with a stronger launch. While the current combined PC and Xbox player base hovers around 40k-50k concurrent players, one can't help but wonder if a more polished initial release would have sustained and grown this number significantly.

Reflecting on what Halo Infinite could have achieved with an additional year of development evokes a sense of missed opportunity. Had it launched in its current state, it could have arguably been one of the greatest games ever made, right from the start. This delay could have provided the necessary time to polish the game to its fullest potential, ensuring a launch that matched the high expectations of its loyal fan base.

In conclusion, Halo Infinite is a beautiful game that has evolved into an amazing state, offering a plethora of content and experiences. It's a clear example of a game that, while great now, might have achieved legendary status with a bit more time in development. As it stands, it remains a remarkable achievement and a testament to the potential of evolving game development. Halo Infinite's story is one of what is and what might have been, leaving players to revel in its current glory while pondering the possibilities of an alternate, even more extraordinary, launch scenario.",1705594722,1705595314,True,43,2,0.711802661418914795,0,True,False,False

[h1]Assassin's Creed 1: Infinite[/h1]

The developers rushed this game out because they are desperate for that Christmas money. The campaign is so boring and repetitive. I am surprised that this game has been so highly rated so far.

First off the open world is very repetitive. I'm not talking about the environment or the graphics, but the missions you can complete in the open world. First of there are 3 basic missions you can do: saving squads, Boss battles and capturing FOBs. There are about 47 of these missions give or take. The thing is at the end of the day all these missions are the same. Kill all the enemies in the area. There are a few variations in the boss battles and some have different kinds of enemies, but they really are just the same. Doing the missions over, and over, and over, and over, and over again gets boring.

Secondly there are about 7-8 what I would call mid tier missions. These are missions where instead of clearing out a whole base of enemies you destroy fuel silos or ammo machines. However these too are also fairly similar to each other and none are particularly difficult, and again get easier because of the whole weapons and vehicle aspect. Lastly, there are main missions. These are by far better part of the game.

The multiplayer is a mess at the moment. Battle pass has slow progression with not many rewards worth playing for, most of which are consumables which don't add to the experience. Your fireteam isn't necessarily the team you'll end up playing with, sometimes gets mixed up. No ability to turn off crossplay, important because PC is being plagued by hackers who you can't report in game. Overpriced cosmetics. Barely any customization options when compared to previous games. Points scored and winning doesn't matter. No stats.

This game is incomplete and unsatisfactory and it is not worth the price tag!",1640545773,1705445432,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

I played heavily when it came out, beat everything I could on two different systems(almost 200 hours between he two), and then feeling completely dejected, put it away until season 5. Due to many of the halo die hard streamers insisting this was the season halo was back, i picked it up and tried again.

So many things that supporters are excited for in season 5, over 2 years after release, are things the game should have launched with. Nothing released so far was mind blowing or new. It feels like a game that just came out might feel which is less of a compliment than it is a recognition its finally feeling like a game with core fundamentals in place. There are more maps, co-op is now available if you play online on two different systems(split screen is canceled indefinitely), and we can finally replay campaign missions without having to restart the entire campaign. Guns still feel like you're shooting blanks, the net code is still spotty although vastly improved from launch, and the banished are still the ambiguous faction nobody who didn't play halo wars 2 has any idea what or where they came from. The campaign feels filled with promise but ultimately incomplete. The open world model feels empty and the rescue troopers section of the game is completely wasted in the story. No matter how many marines you save, you're still stuck with a clueless ai(yes shes adorable but still cringe) and a pelican pilot who complains every ten seconds about wanting to go home. Youll never regroup with UNSC command for a sit rep or battle plan despite the fact youre literally rebuilding the UNSC central forces and setting up command posts. They only exist to shove guns into their hands and go on joyrides with warthogs. Multiplayer is still missing many modes we loved in older titles and the modes we do have are shoved into group play sections to the point its tough to pick one or the other without being stuck with two modes you don't want to play. Season 6 is bringing back firefight which is a nice surprise but again, firefight should have been ready at launch. 

TLDR: The game was only supposed to support ten seasons and at over 50% of the planned life cycle of the game we're still getting launch day fixes and additions. Halo Infinite still falls far short of expectations for a title of Halo's pedigree. 343 is trying to fix up the game which is admirable but it doesn't change the reality of the situation: Its still not a complete game over 2 years after launch and even at its best moments, Halo Infinite just doesn't feel like the Sci-Fi FPS legend that redefined the shooter genre.",1705398334,1705398334,False,175,5,0.79465562105178833,0,True,False,False

Anyway, an easy sell if, like me, you're a fan of the Halo franchise. I got it in a Steam sale, so didn't splash out top dollar. Probably for the best - the campaign was a little truncated for me.

Pros: 
- gorgeous Halo environment
- a pretty solid application of an open world framework within a more conventional campaign mode
- a fantastically fun grappling hook (helped by low gravity and very forgiving fall mechanics)
- satisfying combat, with a range of foes and weapons, made even better with the grappling hook
- an entertainingly enthusiastic and naive AI character to fill-in for Cortana

Cons:
- calling something ""infinite"" when you've only got a small portion of a Halo to play on seems a bit of a cheat
- the open world is dumped towards the end of the campaign for a protracted linear set of missions
- the campaign seemed a little short in the end to me
- heavy on Halo lore that's liable to bore the uninitiated to death
- a whiny pilot NPC, although he's thankfully avoidable for most of the game

Summary: overall a great addition to the Halo stable. The addition of the grappling hook - and the combat mechanics this opens up - is a real highlight. Ditto, turning the game into an open world experience, where many challenges can be attempted in the order preferred by the player.

I didn't have an xbox one when halo 5 came out.
I got halo 4 i think with the other halo games we had for the 360: 3 and reach.
I grew up too poor to affort xbox gold, so I missed out on the golden age of online gaming, among that being halo 3 and reach.

this game was great, and really fun, since day one. before day one, technically, with the early release of the multiplayer. when I first watched that intro cutscene for the campaign I swear there were tears in my eyes, it was that good.

there are issues, yes, but I feel like you could say that for every halo game. any game!
a delayed game is bad for a while, but a rushed game is forever bad.
plus it has my favorite incarnation of firefight. firefight koth is amazing!
the monetization seems exessive, until you remember:the multiplayer is FREE. thats amazing! it means that anyone can try out what is really quite a decent incarnation of halo for free, and then they can buy the campaign or mcc.
it also means that 343 has to monetize the game quite aggressively in order to keep it as good as it is (that is, very)",1651610320,1705303602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Positives:
Great gun play - guns feel great to shoot

fun game modes - 343 rotates playlists to keep multiplayer fresh

custom game browser - endless fun from extremely talented community members.

forge - this is the best version of forge we've ever had. though to new players might seem not be interested since its so complex.

Negatives: 
SBMM - this is a current problem in almost every single FPS game you come across. If your a new player jumping into BTB, quick match, or any other social objective based game mode. i can almost guaranty that you'll matched opponents out of your league. same goes for your team mates.

Lag & Desync - networking has been an issue since launch but should be addressed by the next season: Jan 30th, 2024.

assassination - this is a net loss on 343's end and upsets me every time i play this game. this could have been a thing to sell in the store to keep the servers up but its not.

Games as a service model & customisation - you pay money to look cool, but you cant buy everything cuz its vaulted. paying for colours sucks, paying for armour sucks but if it wasn't here the game would have been shutdown.

Vehicles - tank VS. tank or wrath VS. wrath, it doesn't matter if you shot them first there is about a 50/50 chance you'll be one shot out the vehicle you were in.

I don't really like the campaign, on the other hand. For the price, it feels somewhat empty, and a bit generic. It doesn't really feel like a Halo game.

Conclusion: I'd recommend the free multiplayer, but I'd only recommend the campaign if it was on sale, and even then, only to a huge Halo fan. Otherwise, you're better off with the Master Chief Collection, where you'll get a whole lot more for less.

The Pros:
- Toxic Player Base is Amazing
- Competitive Players
- Cosmetic Variety on Armor/Weapons/Vehicles/Others
- Non - Pay to win
- Active Players
- Grindy
- Extremely good server connections, meaning you could have 200+ MS and you won't notice much (Granted they're are some annoying factors with it but it can be tolerable)
- Fantastic Campaign despite it being so different

The Cons:
- Unable to Toggle Aim Assist On/Off on PC
- Bugs still lurk around the main campaign, it's clear they haven't done a whole lot of updates to it.
(^ Unable to switch Equipment / FOB Weapon Crates bug out if you die right as you choose a gun^)
- Poor Multiplayer Map designs, some of them are just outright awful.
- Unable to choose maps to play on
- Unable to choose Gamemodes once we start the match, if we do we lose the ability to gain XP

Notes:
I prefer to use my own aim that have anything to do with Aim Assist, I'm an average player, and sometimes using aim assist on PC just messes with me, it's easily the most annoying feature on Halo. (I also prefer to play naturally)
The Gamemodes and Maps, I dislike CTF, I prefer KOTH or Slayer and yet often times we're forced to play them, some of the maps are just god awful, just the placement or designs are either too Cartoonish or weird looking.",1705231263,1705231368,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The Grapple Shot is easily one of the best things of 2021, allowing players to zip around the battlefield to gain the upper hand at all times. The campaign itself can be lumpy, though, with multiple missions funneling down and stripping away the open-world design that makes the rest of the campaign so entertaining. Multiplayer is highlighted by a welcome move towards older Halo titles, focusing on methodical movement, map knowledge, and team-focused gameplay. 343i’s rapid feedback loop is addressing multiplayer criticisms, too. I can see myself casually returning the multiplayer throughout 2022.

Which there's a lot of things that aren't great. It strays away from the classic halo gameplay but change is also something no one likes. The barebones of this game is fantastic, looks great, flows well, gun mechanics are phenomenal, player movement is great and does have a very competitive play style to it which is obviously gonna sit well for fps players of that scene. Seasonal battlepasses are rubbish, paying for cosmetics is rubbish. This multiplayer with the old style progression with armour upgrades, no battlepasses and no empty promises would go far for it. otherwise the multiplayer is great, short games and keeps you on your toes abusing the capabilities of equipment and weapon abilities 

Campaign - strays incredibly far from the roots of the halo campaigns with the open world factor, side missions and plenty of new criteria that isn't standard from the older games. But it's been done well, the game looks incredible, the AI is fantastic and boss fights are very rewarding and challenging (if playing heroic or higher). Felt incredibly fullfilling completing the campaign and cannot recommend it enough. It's different but it works.

It ran well, the gameplay felt fantastic, five stars all around (minus the limited customization and leveling, but, whatever). Played some more a couple seasons in, same thing but with some issues fixed, and then dropped it again for a while. 

Recently, though, I got the campaign on sale, and for the first couple hours it was utterly fantastic. Then, as soon as I hit the open world, the graphics just plummeted. I admit my pc isn't exactly good, but it's run the game perfectly in the past; and now, no matter what setting I change or however many times I uninstall and reinstall or if I have shader packs installed or not, my graphics are stuck on potato mode. This goes for the multiplayer too. 

I've tried every possible fix I can find, but in the end most threads I find boil down to ""get a new GPU"" or ""wait until it's fixed"" from 8 months ago.

Here is my review after beating the campaign, and delving a decent bit into multiplayer recently. I played pretty hardcore when it first came out but took a long break until now.

Campaign: First off let me just say I enjoyed this campaign it definitely wasn't the best halo campaign but in my opinion this is the most bungie 343 has felt so far. The open world in my opinion wasn't the right course for this game its pretty empty and often times your just running around a empty sandbox. There's cool things to find sure but it is pretty repeitive. In the older titles there were different levels all with different feels in halo 1 you'd be on a beach and then a snowy level it was very diverse with its levels. This game every mission feels very similar to the last one you beat. Now onto positives for this game man the emotions, the music, the action, the combat, the new abilities all of it is just pure awesomeness. Even though the world itself didn't interest me everything else kept me more than engaged, My one and only complaint with this campaign was I wish for a bit more diverse levels later with more to do and more to see than just the same landscape. Other than that this campaign was awesome and my personal favorite so far that 343 has made, nothing will beat reach and halo 2 for me tho.


Multiplayer: At launch the game lost my interest pretty quickly do keep in mind I have way longer than 11 hours since I stated earlier I played on gamepass. The maps and modes were very very limited and a lot of my favorite modes that I loved in older halos were gone. Now though is completely different there's tons to do from custom maps, to even freaking firefight coming back, big team battle has lots of new maps, the arena like modes have a lot new maps, the multiplayer definitely turned itself around in the right direction where the recent 11 hours I got on steam have felt super enjoyable. I even started the campaign again just to enjoy this game more. I wish we got this kind of passion at launch but 343 I have to give you credit where credit is due you guys didn't abandon this game and kept working on it and for me its definitely payed off into a great halo experience. 


Overall this halo I would definitely reccomend it had a bit of a rocky start but over time 343 definitely improved this game and are continuing to improve this game. Overall out of 10 I would rate this game....................... 8.5/10

Halo evolving into more of an open world is an excellent direction. That being said, It's a very bland open world. 

The fights DRAG on and on and on.. With multiple waves of reinforcements that don't demand any change from the player, but asks that the player just does what they're doing, but for longer.

Vehicle handling is abysmal. They all drive like they're on ice, ghost and chopper will flip over just by running over a small box. The weapons attached to the Covenant vehicles feel like they're shooting cotton balls.

""Go here, kill them, push button."" -How to capture every FOB, get every collectible, unlock every weapon variant and complete every story mission. That's the gameplay loop.

Try not to miss any collectibles in a story mission because you can't go back and replay the story missions.

Finally, I've experienced my fair share of glitches. Some just silly, others have me stepping away out of frustration. Most recently, it froze my computer and I had to shut it down completely. Other times I came across multiple instances of invisible enemies in the sky shooting me. Only their weapons were visible. 

To be fair, there are things I still like about this game. The Weapon is a very likable character. Chief having a personality is different, but I like it. I spent the first hour of this game literally grapling on to everything, its SO much fun. The weapons are fun to use (except the Gravity Hammer).

but of course i had a spark of hope for infinite because it looked like the best of both worlds in that they have the traditional aesthetic but with the si-fi eliminates they're trying so hard to push and in terms of game play they nailed it.
the moment to moment action is without a doubt the best in the franchise and the guns are familiar but still reinvent themselves in (mostly) welcome ways.
however this game fumbles HARD in terms of campaign and multiplayer.
even though halo 4 and 5 sucked, its crazy cut scenes of the Spartans ripping through the enemy's is engrossing and the dramatic performances in various locations showed at least some effort in their delivery and plot. the cut scenes in halo infinite is cortana and master chief talking to each other in similar locations as they give exposition dumps. however there are some tender moments between characters that are done incredibly well like chief explaining to the pilot what humanity is, the chief holding a dying spartan and the development of the weapon and master chief's relationship take the steps of something like the last of us, it tried to go for a more grounded approach but for a massive sprawling game such as halo, it feels like they didn't extend their reach enough.
the open world is, although pleasing to the eye, very similar and boring with ubisoft like collectables and copy and paste missions.
but if the gameplay is good then the multiplayer should be good too, right?
no
its not
it lacks a lot of the things that made halo's multiplayer fun, the progressions is slow and unrewarding as the the majority of items are weird slabs of... something on an arm or leg.
the map design is awful, their are so many maps that feel like mazes, with other fps games no matter how cluttered it feels, each location is recognisable and although their are a few locations like that, most of it is messy.
some of the weapons need balancing. the gravity hammers range is a massive exploit but sometimes if the enemy is a little to the left or right, it dose nothing, the shotgun is incredibly weak and some guns fire too slow or too quick

Halo Infinite still focuses a great deal on multiplayer, which is where most reviews are going to focus on, and since the last review there have been a number of changes and updates that have made it more fun than before. I still stand by its monetization model being so bad it could be burned by holy water, but having added firefight mode in and more options for custom matches along with your standard game types and wider array of maps its been a pretty fun experience that hasn't worn out its welcome. Definitely going to be a better experience with friends who are willing to squad up with you for a few matches, as randos will be randos. I will leave the older review below for reference, and while the grind and monetization model hasn't changed much, the content in Halo Infinite itself has been given more and more over time to be enjoyable and less of a drag with no shortage of variety in match types now. I only hope they continue to go in this direction for future developments.



(Older review below)


Well, fuck. Up until now I really liked the Halo series. This one though, leaves me a bit divided. Lets get into the positives first:

Visually? Great, but hell thats to be expected from any game under this franchise. Gunfights are alright, maybe a little more fast paced than the Halo games from before now that they don't settle with just sprinting anymore but using grappling hooks and ledge climbing. Vehicle driving feels about as well controlled as ever,  and the campaign while a reboot in some ways to the series is a fun one with a more open world now kinda giving me some Far Cry vibes with some of that Halo feel still around.

The negatives? My god, the fucking monetization model for this game was invented by Satan. When you look at the conversion rate of real money to in game premium currency the prices for simple skins and visual features is through the roof. For the price of the main campaign (60) you get maayyybe a handful of options. Battle passes galore, with limited game types to play to earn them, and with no consideration for progression in more customized game types you find yourself grinding away on very samey matches and maps over and over and over again to get free shit. I don't care about the changes in the seasons adding a few things here and there...when they alternatively strip previous stuff in the same breath and lock out opportunities for people who joined later to participate in previous game types and content unlocks. Frankly, its bullshit and a shame too. What the fuck happened to Halo to get to this point? Only now have we got infection mode, but we still don't have firefight? No spartan ops? No new maps I noticed either from this current season, just a laundry list of cosmetics and the expectation of us to grind our asses of for all 100 levels of them. Are the devs even trying?

Will I probably go back to this game? Maybe, depending on where they take it from here. Halo Infinite clearly was designed around a live service model so there is no telling what changes could happen from one season to the next. Even with the campaign being alright, the multiplayer is where a lot of players flock to and frankly its favoring more monetization and content to unlock over just giving us loads more online content to play through and play in. For now though, in Infinite's current state, I think I'll go back to Master Chief Collection.",1687481386,1704487760,True,0,0,0.550711154937744141,0,True,False,False

If you are a decent or good player then you will have 2 or 3 of these teammates in your lobby unless you have 3 friends in the same fire team as you for more than half of matches making it downright impossible to win, which also sucks.

BUT! BUT! The matchmaking and management of this game, the big things people are gonna try the free version for, are a mess. The live service model showcases its failure again here. As another reviewer says, they use Casino matchmaking to intentionally cheat you, the player.

Seriously, in almost all the games you will play here, 90% of the kills will be to 1-3 players in a whole team on BTB. It ain't just BTB either, this problem persists. They use scummy matchmaking manipulation to keep you playing for longer in artificial fashion, so that they can drain you like the parasite they are. These issues alone would be enough for a thumbs-down.

But what about the part you PAY for, you know, the campaign? Well. As stated, it isn't the best. The open world is mostly squandered in terms of design. It isn't horrible, but it barely does anything to stand out from other Open World FPS offerings. They could have done some interesting things with the whole 'open world ring', alas, they did not.

The story itself is lackluster. We don't get a lot of Atriox, who fans were mildly excited for, and the main plot, in 343 fashion, works its hardest to undo their previously established conflicts in favor of new keys jangled in their face. Brohammer & Cortana II are alright. Brohammer is annoying a lot of the time though, which offsets his charm by quite a bit. I did NOT care for Cortana II by-n-large, but that is because I think the idea of bringing back Cortana in any form after her send-off in 4 is kinda stupid. And then you have the Harbinger and the Kraig Band out and about, convoluting things even more. It is just nonsense past a point.

The fact remains that, as far as I know, we won't be seeing ANY expansions to the campaign either, no extra single-player content, due to team cuts. So ultimately we are left with a dead investment for a live service game. 

The Singleplayer is lame for the long-term, and the Multiplayer is busted due to Casino Matchmaking. I just CANNOT give this game a recommendation compared to the products you COULD get in its place.",1704334009,1704334009,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

A BETA FOR MATCH XP? Infection being added a year or even 2 years after launch, Campaign Co-op being delayed years too, broken playlists and simply not being able to queue into a game at all.

1/3/2024-update

Its been quite an unusual year for 343. While the smoke and fragments of the disaster of the 2022 year have long passed, apparently 2023 was quite a night and day difference for the studio. For the record, a reason a lot of players just threw up their hands and left was previously, they got burned enough. It was enough of the excuses, the projects no one wanted like the paramount tv series, the utter incompetence of the leadership with no split screen on consoles despite it being glitched into access or outrageous claims like needing a match XP beta.

This was all during the leadership of the ""three false prophets"" but as things would have it...they are gone. They slithered away. The damage was done and Microsoft had to step in and clean house.

So why look at infinite again? For one thing Forge came out in this time, they added service records, custom games, and shockingly the one simple mode fans wanted for years, firefight. Though their version is mainly a king of the hill version for matchmaking its not bad.

A good way to put this was that, the reasons we as players complained was because the people running the show were not giving us what we wanted to the point it drew us into a frenzy like a pack of brutes. After those running the show pushed their luck too far to the point microsoft couldnt ignore the risk to damaging the IP, they had to intervene. Luckly those individuals are gone now and it seems most of the clowns are gutted from 343.

So would I recommend the game? Yes only on the count there is a healthy range of content and some forge based aspects are actively being throw in across many modes. This isn't like Bethesdas idiotic ""let modders fix it"" no its literally a case of fans making use of an in game creation system to throw their pitches for maps and modes and to see if they can go into playlists, a built by community for the community game.

Its not perfect but its a good start...its as close to those days of Halo 3 and Reach as we have gotten in well over a decade. Something that Halo 4 and 5 utterly lacked.

Does this mean all is forgiven? Well...no. 343 and Halo now stand at a crossroads, they are doing what fans like and approve and have gained some ground back. After 10 years of incompetence from a leadership of narrisitic egotisical clowns, their names are now associated with IP posion and should be avoided like the plauge. Halo just got rid of them. 

If the leadership now can steer as they have, keep gameplay like Infinite, get better coordination for the stuido to not have the conflicting development infinity did, be consumer friendly with stuff like battle passes having no expiration date, keep these QoL improvements, have forge geared, etc. Halo can become somthing steady in the long run. It doesn't need to reach absolutely glory like its 2 or 3 days, it just needs to be a fun game for a community to do fun stuff. Not lose its identity, not be forced into something it was not meant to be.

343 and furthermore, Microsoft are not off the hook...in any capacity. Having this franchise at the forefront of..the era of mishandled or divebombed IPs, halo is just now in a place getting out of that in a sense of stability. We had so many fisacos with 4, 5, and early infinite. Remember, the best Halo game of the 2010s was Halo wars 2, because 343s leadership and at the time makeup, didnt get involved with that game. Its why Halo wars 2 came off as more in line with bungie era halo and didn't have these cockamany ideas no one asked for.

I say give Halo infintie another chance, but hold 343 and furthermore microsoft to the flame. Microsoft not intervening when they could when problems clearly were brewing back after halo 5, it calls their own competence into question. Its literally the case of why Starfield is a disaster and now after the event, Microsoft has someone from their xbox division needing bethesa to report to them.

Give the new era 343 a chance since the ""prophets of truth, mercy, and regret"" are gone. Their inability to safeguard halo was a colossal disaster. But they are gone now. The great journey can continue, so long as the new leadership can maintain this degree of what we have seen so far.

Give it a chance, but do not forget what originally happened. We cannot afford to let that downslide of chaos occur again. If it gets bad, we get vocal and we get critical. Looking back at how fans got upset and outraged after a decade of failure...what else could they do that that point? Because looking at how what occured and what didn't...if fans didn't get up in arms with the fire343industries movement...it would be in a far worse situation now.

Its because of that event..I don't take the arguement of ""dont blame the devs"" seriously anymore..if other fandoms got that backbone the Halo community did...maybe maybe some form of change could occur. None of us wanted to act outraged..but remember what had to happen to even get those 3 foul false prophets gone and microsoft to actually say ""wait...whats happening there? Thats not good!""

Remember you can give them a chance, but they must prove themselves in the long run, and you are always free to walk away. They need you, you dont need them.",1638839796,1704293344,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Infinite is another unfortunate victim of [i]MODERN GAMING[/i], though it must be said that this is the most consumer-friendly approach I have seen to a live service outside the likes of Warframe and Path of Exile. The game allows you essentially unlimited time to complete your battle pass, the ability to purchase and play old passes, as well as free ""operations"" and events throughout their evolving seasonal model. The gameplay is fantastic with top-tier gunplay, good visuals (though a tad heavy for what they are), a plethora of modes and maps, and enough custom game and map features to entertain you for a long, long time. If the package was this complete and had no other issues, it would be an immediate recommend. I mean, I played 275 hours, so I have to be happy with myself, right?

Were it so easy...

The unfortunate truth is that the underlying systems that the game relies on to stand are fundamentally problematic to say the very least and tarnish an otherwise well-made game.

Matchmaking functions on a chance-to-win ration that will ""balance"" teams by placing single high-performing players on teams with low-tier players to match up against 4 mid-level players. This is, in fact, the reason persistent lobbies do not exist, because the game balances teams each cycle to achieve statistically-based 50% win-loss chances for everyone. What this results in are games where you are dying 20 times over and dragging your team down because you are a gold level player playing with people 2 or 3 ranks above you. Additionally, it is a tiered system that always weighs win-loss rate, and will fix you into a hopeless match many times in a row to knock you down to a 50% win-loss rate. It is not fun to be destroyed for 5 straight games because I did well for a game or two. And it is not fun to annihilate other players for multiple games in a row to achieve the coveted 50% balance 343 Industries so craves.

The Skill Based Matchmaking system (SBMM) is tuned to a degree that is disgusting, and you are never allowed to simply have a chill match. You are always sweating in your lobbies. If you are not always performing 100%, the game will punish you, and if you perform too far below level, you will be temporarily banned. There is no such thing as a chill game in Halo Infinite, and 343 Industries are tuning it worse and worse as the season progresses (currently Season 5 as this is being written). The newest playlists are tuned to a  degree that I actively avoid them because it is so unfun. There are also hidden ranks that they promised to remove and no longer use for matchmaking, however, they reintroduced this system recently in a stealthy manner to avoid the bad press. While they claim it is for combating smurfers, it is most definitely being used for much more than that and I have noticed a significant difference since I started paying, and yet my ranks have not changed, just the sweatiness of my matches across the board.

Progression is a hybrid between match-based experience and challenge-based progression. This is fundamentally fine. However, the matchmaking system appears to account for your challenges, and balances against you, to make you play longer and hopefully spend some money in their MTX store. For example, if you have to win 3 matches, good luck, you will need to play 10 or more to get the achievement most likely. Kills? The closer you get, the harder the matches to reduce your kill-rate and ability to complete the achievement. There are small tweaks you can [i]feel[/i] as you play the game, and it hinders progress, and reduces overall fun in the name of prolonging your experience with the game.

343 Industries is resistant to change on the above listed issue areas, and refuse to simply talk about things like SBMM and the matchmaking systems. Whether this is a Microsoft initiative to try and force modern gaming approaches into these games, or 343 trying to make as much as they can on a product that initially flopped, we will never know. However, the SBMM and matchmaking systems have been universally complained about since the game released, and they have done nothing about it. They won't even talk about it. They are only now, after 6 seasons, fixing their god-awful networking. There are fundamental pillars that are causing players to leave the game since the recent player spike, and they have been complaints since the game's release so long ago.

I have personally uninstalled the game as I am no longer having fun with it because I am tired of constantly being manipulated by their, and I can only assume based on their silence on the matters, maliciously designed systems that run the game as a whole.

What stinks is there really is a good video game here with a good campaign, great multiplayer, and phenomenal social experience in it. But the underlying systems take this great game and drag it down to the pits of modern gaming, and hinder the experience to the point that fun has all but disappeared. Don't let games become jobs.

光环无限舍弃了之前一本道的剧情通关，引入了开放世界的玩法。出了第一个要塞，一股孤岛惊魂风就扑面而来。
其实这个设定没有什么不妥，毕竟之前的游戏场景也越来越大，也是半开放式的。但是在玩法上并没有抄全。

才是第一关的时候，甚至是玩过前作的玩家都知道，最初的关卡教你怎么偷袭。然后就没有然后了，后面的关卡几乎就没有偷袭，更不要说想像孤岛惊魂那样一直潜行直到通关。这个问题在之前一本道的游戏设定里其实没什么，但是放到了这些，尤其是攻打据点的时候，就会被放大。再加上配备的什么敌人侦测器之类的，除了探测隐形的敌人就没作用了。更不要说什么消音武器了，不可能的。

然后就是地图的设计，一如既往地保持着限制载具的设定，大部分的据点和支援小队都不允许玩家自己驾驶载具靠近，载具几乎就变成了跑路而不是战斗的工具。这样能叫做开放世界玩法吗？

载具的操作还是那么传统，根本不方便一边驾驶一边看四周，稍微甩一下镜头就甩尾。载具也不能随地空投，玩家经常要跑好远的地方，哪怕你将据点分区，占领了才能在该区域空投都好啊。

战斗设计方面，由于我一开始就玩高难度战斗，所以几乎都是狙击枪类武器，不敢正面对抗，甚至不敢使用固定武器。但问题是，增加了敌人伤害的同时，玩家的伤害并没有增加。拿个大狙都不能一枪爆头，开了第一枪就一直被敌人追。面对敌人丢过来的手雷，既不能打爆也不能丢回去，被炸基本就死了。地图上还有许多爆炸物，用起来很爽，但是不小心靠近了被敌人打爆了又特别不爽。还偶尔有绿色的充能弹过来AOE伤害引爆爆炸物的。场面很乱，像DOOM，但实际体验特别差。

电脑AI也有问题，既然小队可以跟随，为什么不加入一个进攻、标记、停火等选项呢。上了载具看到敌人就之间开枪，和战地里的猪队友差不多，我还没有勘察完就开打，暴露自己。勇气点数解锁的AI兵种支援不知道有什么用，驾驶载具的时候上来的队友都是不可控的，又不能像孤岛惊魂那样带个狙击手，加上玩家一起玩狙击。

The campaign of this game is just so boring. Open world does not work for halo, or at least not open world this incredibly lazy. Too much has happened between 5 and this game. Who are the banished? Who are the Endless? I simply don't care about these groups because they don't matter. We already had ""the banished"" in halo 2 because it's just the covenant and I doubt the endless will be able to live up to the beautiful horror of the flood (if they ever get expanded on lol). It feels like I'm playing the third installment of a series that I skipped the first 2 parts to. Halo 4 was the first guilty of this by having the covenant reengage war with humanity despite that being resolved in 3. The only line being ""a lot can change"". This game has done that and more by having a main character turn evil and take over the galaxy, an entirely new army come into play, and have chief be beaten by some brute.

To expand on the open world point. I think the map is too small, too empty, and too boring. Open world games inherently require you to always have something interesting to stumble upon, either a mission, or an item, or a structure, or unique enemy (or to have really fun traversal, Spider-man, GTA). Sure you can clear out outposts (not really a side quest more of a chore) or you can kill a commander but I think I killed most of them with a sniper and ran away. It's also an active warzone so you can't find a lot of stuff out in the world that you could in another game like skyrim. An example is in skyrim you can find a house in the woods, you go to the basement and discover the house is owned by a witch, you then come out of the basement and are attacked by this witch. This little event is a perfect representation to me of what an open world is supposed to be. What possible equivent is there in an open world halo game? You go into a ship and find that there is a grunt living there? I've killed thousands of grunts and they pose no threat to the Chief so why would I care?

Aside from just being boring the side characters suck as well. Pedro is whiny and annoying and should have died or something EARLY in the game. Cortana2.0 is also just annoying with the way she sucks off Master Chief constantly ""Erm THAT'S why you're the best Chief!!!!!!"".

They also copied God of Snores camera style which leads to boring cutscenes. Each game before this had amazing bad ass cut scenes with dynamic camera movement.

The first mission is the most upsetting part of the whole campaign because it was good. I remember playing it and thinking ""wow this is really fun, why were people shitting on this game?"". I kept enjoying myself up until the first hour on Zeta Halo. The only thought I had was ""When are we  leaving Zeta Halo?"". Grassy Hexagonal hills and the occasional building is all we got. Yeah you spend all of halo 1 aside from the first mission ON halo but each level is so different. Beaches, Forerunner buildings, Covenant ships, icy tundra, human ships. There is so much variety and a game 20 years later having significantly less effort put into it is an absolute joke. For me Halo has been a limping copse since reach but after this instalment I can unfortunately say that the series is dead. Halo is never coming back. Any game that comes out in the future will just be a misshapen abomination wearing the face of a beloved game. Desperately trying to pretend, to mimic what we loved without the talent, or effort, or anything required to actually make such a thing.


Multiplayer
I played the multiplayer again recently and it hasn't improved much. I couldn't find a match in Australia and had to play in the US with 400 ping. Aside from that the multiplayer is so boring. You don't get to pick load outs with certain gadgets and weapons like you could in reach but even with that it should be a crime not to give people the grapple by default. Instead they made it a somewhat rare collectable.

The maps are also just kind of boring. I know I'm saying everything is boring but it's really just the only emotion I was feeling, aside from frustration. They don't feel like they are anything or serve any purpose outside of being a multiplayer map. The reason I think this is the xase is because they couldn't make the multiplayer maps just grassy plains or a cave. Normally they are linked to campaign missions in some way but they couldn't do that because there isn't enough variety in the whole campaign to draw from.

The armor core system had to be the worst multiplayer skin idea I've personally ever seen. Why give me skins if I can't mix them in interesting ways? I don't even mind the whole paying $20 for a skin meme that the industry has come to but God at least let me use the skins I buy.

I don't like most of the guns. I think it was halo reach that added the SAM machine gun and that was the first time I hated a gun in halo. Slow TTK, inaccurate, ugly. Just a horrible experience to use. Now 80% of the guns have that same problem. This is especially bad in the fiesta game mode where a good 50% of spawns give you an almost unusable weapon. Alien weapons should feel amazing and powerful and cool. I think the forerunner guns are the best alien guns I've ever used and nothing came close to how cool those were.",1704086513,1704086513,False,0,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False

That takes away from game play immersion and the feel that all are welcome to be chief.

It is nice to get back to that in this game however, past game story line that reveled such bias in a general sense makes me feel as though only certain people can be chief thus, the immersion is taken away rather, the all inclusive game we all grew up with and loved/ love. I would recommend this game and what ever you do for first time gamers/ Spartans getting into the series don't show/pay attention to halo 4 end/opening credits and or anything that shows Chiefs face. That includes the live series. Wont go any further than that on that. This way you/they (Gamers/Story lovers) can have that all inclusive natural diversified game play/ story line immersion.

I like Halo for it's gameplay, the 4x multiplayer, and mostly for its story. 

343 has been riding the sled down the hill of quality ever since they took over. They scored this biggest failure when they showed Master Chief's face at the end of their very first game.  I haven't looked for anything online so I have no idea if this is true, however this game suffers from signs that they had an extremely larger plan for this game and then scraped it back to just a few percent of that to ship it out the door.  

The game starts like most Halo games and right away you notice... Armor abilities are back!  This is not something that was well received from before and it's back.  The game then opens up to an open world game, which is nice as an Idea but with the first given ability (a grapple hook) the invisible walls show up quite quickly.  The next thing you might run into is ability points. Something Halo has never had and doesn't fit into the world of the game.  You can find ""Spartan Cores"" and upgrade your abilities, you find more abilities the more you play the main story and then can just use them.  Again, this doesn't fit well in the story.  Then the first eye rolling lazy game mechanic appears, ""go find this thing and bring it back to proceed.""  By the end of the game, they'll throw out the later lazy design of making a story level mirror a multiplayer ""hoard"" mode. Any fans of Gears of War will have talked about such a thing. For good measure they also throw in that later bosses sponge up so much ammo that I don't know if I should clean my house with them or if they're a used ammo depot. The third act has a ""twist"" that actually isn't and the reveal is not fitting. I can't get more into it without spoilers.  OH!  zero reason or explanation that we can understand the aliens now and they trash talk all the time.  Not only that but they use our weapons, also new in the franchise. There is also no mention why they are extremely more like us, in how they act to even armor design.

Trying to go without throwing any spoilers:  The story gives hints of what is to come, however there are lots of things that don't pan out to anything. For example one of the bad guys you'll face later in the game, constantly taunts you, by the midpoint of the game, it's clear that character is dying as well.  Nothing comes of that, it's a detail in cinematics that isn't subtle.  There is confusion between who is leader of bad guy in the writing. There is an enemy class that comes out of nowhere, no explanation, it's even said not much is known about them, yet later there is a high value one... Characters are dumbed down so much that it is out of character.  If you ever thought about things after seeing ""Superman Vs. Batman"" and wondered how did a super intelligent alien and pretty much the world's greatest detective get duped into fighter each other - that kind of dumbing down.  Finally, the game ends of a cliffhanger.  That's not the bad part.  It is that they messed it up! Let's say it's a story like Lord of the Rings, and all the story you're waiting on the ring to get destroyed, you get to the volcano, toss it in, but at the last second you see a figure jump from the side like they're going to catch it. You could even show them catching it, or cut it just before to have more suspense.  You could even show them catching it, then using the power THEN cut it!  No, no no, 343 decided lets show them catching it, making it to the other side, and instead of doing anything they just put it in their pocket and walk off.  The heros, seeing all this, just turn around and start walking home without acknowledging it. 

I could go on but this review is too long already.  I cannot believe that firefight took so long to be released when it's in the story thought I don't remember how long between the story and firefight is.  I'm glad I picked it up on a deep discount not just because multiplayer being free is a slap in the face, but paid story is short and rubbish. 

Lastly, campaign is a secondary citizen.  You cannot directly go into it.  You have to first start as multiplayer, then switch.  This adds extra time every time you start up and is just annoying. However, this is a bigger issue with this.  The game doesn't build it's cache in the background, every time there is a game update OR you update your video drivers, it has to rebuild. Top end AMD system, this can take 90 sec to a few minutes, lower end can be looking at closer to 10 minutes.  THEN you've got another build to get into campaign!  It's not as long, and I'm not sure if you'd just have to do both anyway, but you still cannot just start the game, knowing that it's coming and do something else and come back ready to go.",1703912665,1703912665,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Second, this game just runs out of memory and turns into a graphical potato. Rather than the graphics refreshing, they just piss off and deteriorate.

I've got no gripes with the gameplay itself, [strike] but it gets stale after rotating through the same four or five maps ad nauseum. [/strike]

EDIT: SEVERAL maps have been added, including many faithful remakes from past Halo titles. This was a huge step in the right direction.

The battlepass system continues to be an insult to the fanbase, offering weirdly specific weapon challenges in return for minimal gain. If you want to level through, prepare to dedicate literal [strike]weeks[/strike]  days of your life to matchmaking.

Singleplayer and Multiplayer have been separated into 2 distinct games, which would have been fine if there were (like design logic would dictate...) 2 different launch options (either separate .exe or Steam launch options); one for launching SP and the other MP.
BUT NO! The comedic geniuses at 343i separated the game so it almost doubled in storage size but it all still launches from 1 executable, so if you just want to play the campaign you first need to launch the multiplayer game and then from the main menu switch over to the campaign game which means it closes the running window and opens a new one. Complete waste of time...

Campaign is fun in terms of gameplay. Grappleshot adds tons of fun due to mobility and repositioning as well as being able to grab objects from far away, it was definitely one of the best ideas for HI. The open-world design fits Halo perfectly (and I am someone who prefers linear games), although it could have been executed better by having multiple biomes connected by portals.
The story is still bad of course, hard to improve when you wrote yourself into a corner. Its definitely better than H5 but its hard to write after the mess of H5. The Banished being the main antagonists was a good choice but introducing the Endless was a terrible idea... Bungie already established that the Flood was the greatest enemy of the Forerunners, H4 changed that to be humanity, and now they changed it again to some random species.... And the game promotes this moronic idea heavily

Multiplayer isnt making much sense either. Tons of useless animations when entering match. 
When clicking to find game there is a countdown (for whatever reason...) in which if you press anything at all, including trying to view last match scores, entering settings etc) it cancels searching (???).
In game radar is useless, sound is unreliable for locating enemies.
Just now tried to enter match and while map was loaded 47% I get an error message saying it cant connect me to fireteam and that I should try again, and you have only 1 button available: Try again. I kept clicking but same thing happens almost instantly. Had to Alt F4 out of the game to escape...
The menus arent very clear and readable, the design of all menus is very weird...

The pricing on cosmetics in insulting, you can get full fledged games at the price of some skins in the shop.
343i, backed by one of the richest companies on the planet, made a game like this and still has the balls to ask for $20 - $30 for a skin lmao",1673353011,1703872740,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I play Halo since I was a kid with Halo CE. I've played this game for over 1300 hours.
I want to help people joining this game if it matches with your tastes.
Over the last year, 343 Industries has changed a lot internally. Albeit the team is way smaller than 3 years ago, the team seems to work better thanks to the new management. They made sure that the game quality could increase over time. 
I am here to confirm this.
It's not a ""perfect"" game, it has issues I am about to talk later. But their dedication to making this game is there, and I believe that it's a game worth trying, and for some people, even worth hoping.

Halo Infinite Multiplayer is a free-to-play, sandbox-focused arena-inspired, sci-fi FPS with vehicle controls,
It has PVP, PVE, and a game browser with custom maps and modes created by the community.

In Halo Infinite, you're a mechanized soldier with a high life shield. You can bring with you two weapons, 2 grenades for each type (for a total of 6 grenades) and one ability that is usually one-use. The point of the game is to learn how the map works and how to use the weapon at your disposal in the most efficient way.
Since the time to kill is low, unless you have a power weapon, you won't be able to get a kill. So it's important that you learn to use the grenades, or to meleeing the enemies at the right time, or to use the objects nearby to either go in full attack or defense. At the same time, you don't need to learn *all things* because thanks to the low time to kill, the game is more accessible to new players.
In some maps and modes, there are also vehicles accessible for anyone, like cars, quads, planes and tanks, all with their unique points of working.

The game offers a selection of playlist, ranked, social and featured, which goes from 2 versus 2 and free-for-all, to 12 versus 12 in bigger maps.
The modes includes the classic deathmatch, capture the flag, Capture one neutral flag, Mercenaries, king of the hill, escalation/gun game, as well as more original modes like:
- Fiesta and Super Fiesta: Each time you spawn, you get random weapons.
- Husky Raid: It's Fiesta/Super Fiesta with capture the flag in one long hallway.
- Extraction: Install a device that extract materials and defend it from being converted.
- Infection: Survivors with shotgun. Infected with sword. Infect the survivor, or survive from it.
And more to be added and changed with rotation.
Most 4v4 playlist include over 70 maps created both by 343 Industries and the community.

In multiplayer, you can play locally with a friend in share screen, and online with up to 12 friends in a fireteam.

If you think you're too weak or you need time to learn, you can have access to the Academy, a selection of offline modes that uses bots to help you figuring things out. 
You can exercize with the weapons or play directly in a map with customizable options, like infinite ammo, health, different weapons and abilities, plus your choice on how many bots be in the game.
Alternatively, the game offers an online playlist called Bot Bootcamp, to which you with other 3 online players fight against other 4 bots in easy difficulty in classic modes.
There is also the custom game browser, which gives you a selection of rooms made by users with maps and modes made for casual fun! It's highly suggested to give it a try.

The Map Editor, Forge, allows people to make maps of all kind with high fidelity to their source. Albeit there is no Steam workshop, the game itself has one internally for saving maps, modes and prefabs made by the others, which can be used in personalized games. Forge allows to make customized maps and missions with PVE elements.

The customization of your character is higher by the standards. You can customize your character's main shape (Spartan Core), change helmet, shoulders, chest, knees, gloves, visor, including all the other attachment and hologram effects. Eventually, you can even give prosthetics in all of the 4 limbs.
The game doesn't allow you to fully customize your character's color. There are pre-made coatings like in most free-to-play games. Some basic at the beginning, then more complex coatings with the Battle passes.
Overall, it still gives your a high quantity of personalization, and it doesn't change the state of the game (meaning it's not pay to win).

The cosmetic accessories can be obtained through the main Battle Passes and the ""Operations"". The Battle Passes have 20 free tiers at the beginning, then 30 paid tiers, with a bonus cosmetic at the beginning and 10.000 ""coins"", enough to unlock the next main Battle Passe. They don't expire, meaning you can always come back later. The same goes for the Operations. They are all free, and they don't expire. If you were late to start during the featured event, you have to pay to access it. But you will always have the opportunity to start it.
There is also the weekly reward, which gives you a piece of cosmetic by completing the weekly challenges.
While I personally don't like how things work, on a grand scale I think they still work better than the average modern video games with the battle pass system.

Once you end a game, you earn experience points in the battle pass you've chosen, as well as in the rank system (if you're playing rank) and career system (which gives you military grades). You can earn Battle Pass points even by playing in custom games.

The game offers a good selection of accessibility in terms of remapping buttons, change the visual, give outline colors to the enemy, the ally and your fireteam, as well as reducing the shake intensity,increase or decrease the gamma, change weapon POV position, Field of View, reticle border, HUD  position, etc. There are still room from improvements, but it makes the job done.

Although I have been mostly positive up to this point, my current issue (as of today, by the end of 2023) is the sloppy UI with slow loading screen, some craches at the beginning of a game, and the overall look and feel of the UI. As a plus, I would love to see a commendation system, which is a list of long challenges that requires time to complete, but once it's done, it gives you poitns and unlockable cosmetics. I trust that there will be improvements, but these are things that must be said.


If you're looking into a FPS game with content creation, to play each solo or with friends, to which each game lasts from 5 to 20 minutes max and doesn't need you to come back, then the game is for you. For many social/casual fans like me are great for reducing stress.
It's free to play, so it has the benefit of giving you a free worth-a-shot!",1644107385,1703857242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every release since they have taken over has been a bigger disappointment than the last.  The hype for this game was strong, and even after a long delay they still ended up butchering it.  The multiplayer has some redeeming qualities, but I could never see myself wanting to get higher ranked in it.  I just simply do not care about it at all.  The completely lackluster rewards and ranking system is just a rotten cherry on top of a mud pie.

Such a horrible ending.  Halo was nice while it lasted.  Thanks for ruining it, 343.

Edit: I gave the game another chance.  It is still a putrid experience to play.  After playing through all of the other Halo games, including both Halo Wars titles, I can confidently say this is by far the worst Halo campaign of all time.  The open world is empty, the ending of the story is atrocious, and there is absolutely no replay value in the game whatsoever.

At launch this games base played great BUT had tons of bugs. Played like sh*t. And at December 2022, the game implemented a patch that made INFINITE unplayable on my system. Very Dissapointing.

Fast Forward today, a winter Sale grabbed my attention to grab the campaign and retry Halo Infinite. And it plays GREAT. 

The customization of spartans continues to suck compared to its previous installments but the models look great. I love the way the game looks, I just wish i could customize my spartan more to my liking.

The Gunplay in my opinion is great. Theres alot of fun for casual and competitive play here.  I feel like 50% of people on here have mics, a good 25% of that 50 will get on the mic if you start using it. 

The Campaign. I havent finished it, but from what I hear , purchasing the game right now vs at launch. Youre Getting a STEAL for a Solid Story, Solid Game with Little bugs and COOP Play and tons of stuff around the corner. 

SOME BIG CONS FOR ME.
Stats, Halo has a leaderboard system SORT OF. But in previous games we'd have leaderboards for EVERYHING. Medals, Playlists, Kills, Deaths, etc... In Infinite I cant say if the data just isnt available but even this far into launch, I cant see how many medals or where i stack against others players in any given playlist. Which is a bummer to me because I like my games to be meaningful across the whole game. Hell, even achievements make single player meaningful ! But the fact I cant play a playlist, or acquire certain medals for the sake of adding to a accumulative stat is a big con for me. Why seek certain kills or medals if you cant look back at them? Previous Halos (even the Collection) recognized this was important and implemented it, I hope this is re-recognized and implemented in the future. 

I say for the fans this game would of still made alot of people happy, for newcomers, this game is finally at a state where people will really enjoy whats here. This game has went through many changes regaurdless of how big or small its community is with many things around the corner. Hope this helps you decide.

What did those $60 pay for bro, because I can barely get through a second play through of this story. I've played each campaign like a bajillion times; including 4 and 5, but I could not care less about Infinite's. The open world was underwhelming, and the story beats were so confused or just lame, that my first play through, I didn't emote at all. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable with halo lore, and when I don't know something I love reading about it, but this time around I was just so disinterested. 

And then I go to customize my character in multiplayer and have some straight vibes, and then I see that I barely have anything. Even if more is becoming free now, why do I have to pay minimum 10 bucks for some armor, when I payed 60 and received nearly nothing of note for that. I would take REQ packs over this shop any day.

First impressions for 343's next-gen vision of what the Halo franchise should be are tremendously positive, with a few caveats I'll get into later. The story revolves around yet another alien faction called the Banished, fighting for control over a Halo installation which rampant A.I. Cortana had her virtual eyes on. As the Chief learns once on the ground, the UNSC's plan to delete her with the help of a new artificial construct simply called the 'Weapon' had succeeded, although their self-deletion protocols had failed to execute. Which, as it turns out, was a good thing, because there's an entire Halo game ahead of us and that wouldn't work without a voice in our heads telling us where to go and what buttons to push.

While I'm not one to praise the actual plot and writing in the Halo franchise, Infinite's story does emphasize the spirit of what Master Chief's character represents. The resolution to fight a seemingly unwinnable battle, to defy fate and odds and hopefully persevere. The game isn't especially subtle when it comes to its themes and the counter to Chief's unbreakable spirit is an annoyingly whiny UNSC pilot who keeps telling you how hopeless and impossible everything is. On the flip side, I did enjoy the interactions with the new A.I. who feels like a new hire during orientation, learning the ropes of how the Chief rolls with the punches.

Once in action, the game feels familiarly fantastic. To be more to the point, from a casual player's perspective, it feels like Halo, which is a good thing in my book. The new addition in form of a grappling hook feels immediately intuitive and is an absolute game changer. Hook up to walls to climb ledges, onto the floor to cover ground faster or even each other when playing in co-op. It's also a great tool for combat to grab weapons or explosive containers out of the safety of cover, yank away Jackal shields or grab onto enemies to deliver a satisfying melee finisher.

You'll also discover a few other tools such as a beacon that highlights enemies in its vicinity, a deployable shield wall for additional cover, as well as a short dash move to dodge enemy fire. Switching between each tool is a bit annoying in the heat of battle and I found myself focusing mostly on the two out of the four options that I decided to upgrade over the course of the game. Unfortunately, I also frequently encountered a bug where switching between your equipment stopped working and you're stuck with whatever was selected until it randomly worked again.

Infinite's other big addition to the gameplay lies in its open world design which is a great fit for the franchise. Halo's defining strength has always been its sandbox combat which is put to excellent use with enemy contingents guarding the ring's various strategic positions. You're given a lot of freedom in your approach as you can request vehicles and weapons to tackle objectives on your terms, before encounters inevitably devolve into you scrounging the battlefield for any weapon with a few bullets left, as is the Halo tradition.

343's approach to the game's world is thankfully rather restrained and avoids the objective marker barf Ubisoft's portfolio has inspired in other games. Forward operating bases can be captured to secure fast travel points, high-value targets are spread throughout the world to gain access to special weapons while other miscellaneous tasks let you request better equipment or unlock upgrade points for your tools, as well as cosmetics used in the game's multiplayer modes.

While you can spend a lot of time on the Halo's surface, the bulk of the game's story will lead you through its various installations where the game returns to a more classic level approach. There is not much to say, as you'll go through countless Halo-looking combat arenas connected via hallways leading to yet more combat arenas. Halo fans will know what to expect at this point, although it does get repetitive at certain points where it simply feels like the game is padding the playtime by making you do the same thing four times in a row without much variation.

Now, if this reads awfully positive for a game with a negative review, buckle up because from here on, it's going to devolve into an unapologetic rant about all the pain and bullshit I and my friend had to endure over the course of our campaign. If you'd rather skip my soul-cleansing airing of grievances, simply know we encountered a lot of progress impeding bugs in co-op. 

First off, it feels like the story mode was haphazardly bolted onto the game's multiplayer live service framework. After sitting through the long barrage of company logos and connecting to Microsoft's servers, selecting the campaign closes the game to open its separate mode, requiring another login screen. Sending and receiving invites via Xbox live takes a good 20 seconds until you show up in their fireteam and returning to the menu after a gameplay session prompts repeated messages that the fireteam is no longer available. And if that sounds like minor annoyances you only have to go through a couple of times, let me outline below some of the reasons why we had to endure this procedure 30+ times.

A few hours in, we both experienced separate game crashes, where we noticed my game hadn't saved in a while, since I wasn't the host. Spending an hour trying to fix this, including importing my friend's save files, which doesn't work, I eventually resorted to replaying the early parts of the game alone, as co-op progress always matches the lowest percent campaign progress.

We soldiered onwards, eventually getting back into a groove when following a cutscene, the screen went completely black for both of us. We could still move around and use weapons, however the menu was inaccessible for a manual reload. After a few minutes of trying to kill ourselves and walking into random directions, the game eventually reloaded correctly. Oh, and I forgot to mention, earlier the UI bugged out and opening the menu softlocked my character. That's when a lot of small annoyances that might be exclusive to co-op play started to become noticeable. I already mentioned the random inability to switch Master Chief's equipment, but occasionally I would lose movement control for a split second while the mouse cursor suddenly appeared as if I had opened the menu. Using vehicles can also feel a bit jerky and imprecise when not hosting the game.

These minor glitches are nothing compared to the experience altering problems though and playing the game, there was an air of dread as even while we enjoyed our time, at any point, the game could just randomly decide to lose our progress (we were playing on legendary difficulty.) On one of the later missions, we found ourselves in a small room with two hunters who took quick care of the two of us. Upon reloading, we were back at the beginning of the level. We power through and eventually defeat the two hunters and move on. Later in the level, we notice the mission marker still sitting in an earlier part of the level. We hoped for the best, but couldn't trigger a scripted scene later on in the level and had to reload again. We started in the room before the two hunters...

These are just a hand full of the numerous aggravating problems we had to deal with. I can't remember the last time I had seen an actual Blue Screen of Death, yet Halo Infinite managed to do it twice. It's an absolute shame, because the game itself is still a lot of fun to play. The addition of the grappling hook opens up a ton of options to approach situations and the mix of open world and level-based gameplay is a natural fit for the series. I would have loved to explore more of the map and unlock more upgrades to play around with, but the constant fear of a bug or crash ruining progression is a deal-breaker.",1703613559,1703613559,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lot has changed. Good or bad, you decide based off of what you're looking for in Halo Infinite.

I think Halo Infinite is finally in a good spot for anybody to pick up and try out. With Firefight being added, the game is now accessible for anybody who wants to play to jump in. PvE was so quintessential to be added in, and it's paying dividends towards player enjoyment. Sometimes, a PvP match is not what you need at the end of the day, and now that option is here for all.

The micro transactions are still ludicrous. 343 has made an excuse to bump up the prices on bundles that were discounted, because of cross-core coatings/helmets having been finally added into the game. Player expression is still heavily gated behind a paywall, but there's somewhat more to offer with some of the cross-core changes. Keep in mind, however, customization won't deter what the game fundamentally is: a movement based arena shooter that could potentially give you hours of playtime.

The Campaign is something I think that should be experienced if you're a previous Halo fan, but keep in mind that it won't be anything like the Halo's of old. If you go in with the expectation that the story's going to be as good as Halo 2, you're not going to be very pleased. If you think it's going to be as bad as Halo 5 however, you will be pleasantly surprised, because I don't think it's that bad as Halo 5. It's a good Campaign that serves it's purpose well, but still has some flaws. These flaws I don't think heavily detract from the initial experience, but will come to light once you're done with the Campaign, and you start to think about what could've been. What I think Halo Infinite's Campaign does heavily well is the rendition of Master Chief. Chief's representation in this Campaign is fantastic, and it's awesome to see Chief having some justice after how he was written in Halo 5.

With the rough start Halo Infinite had, it's good to see it in a much better spot. I'm still putting in hours and I don't think I'm going to be stopping anytime soon.",1703526967,1703526967,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

They also lack the bouncy physics of previous games which makes them less enjoyable to use imo. The game has also apparently received an update which forces aim assist onto all players, including keyboard and mouse. It can not be disabled and ends up feeling like an inconsistent mouse accel that only kicks in when looking at a dude. TBH chasing a PC competitive scene with this level of aim assist, bullet magnetism, and ESP ""QOL features"" is more comedic than anything else.

Infinite feels more like damage control, as if they're trying to bring back something they let go. I know a lot of people have mixed feelings about Halo 4, but I felt like The Didact was a perfect character to introduce and explore as the new antagonist of a new trilogy. But instead everything past related is just in audio logs and nothing else, a shame really, given that Halo 4 set a pretty good premise.
I will admit though, at the end, the three characters feel like a group that has its charm, something worth exploring again, and I really hope they stick with them in the next game and not just come up with something new and forget everything. 
All in all...it was alright, you know? Like, just something to shoot at and a bit of nostalgia with all these past references. 
Haven't touched multiplayer, and I kinda don't intend to. Campaign is about 20 hours or so if you do everything. I was left with 3 FOB's at the end of the campaign and the game crashed and didn't want to run again, so that was it for me.

Since launch they've added a ton of new maps, Forge, Forgable A.I., Firefight, A Custom Games Browser, a ton of free armor customization, cross-core helmets and possibly more later. The only issue I still have with the game is how much they charge for the cosmetics. $20 for the Combat Evolved armor seems a bit steep. Otherwise, absolutely recommend playing this game now. 


The gameplay is fun, campaign was solid, maps are decent, forge and custom game browser brought a lot of variety to the game.

But right now I can't recommend it. I love Halo, like many people I grew up with it and I hold it very special in my heart. But with the 6 month-long seasons that brought barely any content (with season 1 bringing back armor from Halo Reach,) and season 2 being very underwhelming in just about every aspect, followed by a 3-month season that was solely to fill in a gap between seasons 2 and 3, it blows my mind with how they fumbled the bag on a game with so much promise and potential. 

The game doesn't need more cosmetics. It doesn't need a focus on a multiplayer story each season a la Warzone/MWII. It needs content. 7 4v4 maps and 3 BTB maps at launch wasn't enough. In just over a year, they have added a whopping 4 new maps for 4v4 and I believe only 1 for BTB. So all in all, 2.5 seasons since launch and there is only a total of 15 maps for the game is bullshit. Many staple game modes from the other games aren't even accessible, not even through custom games. Hell, Forge and Coop weren't even in the game at launch. With how insane forge is I understand the need to release it at a later date, but Coop shouldn't have come a year after the game is released when very few people are playing the game, and even a fraction of the currently tiny playerbase is not wanting to replay the campaign with a friend. 

With the current layoffs that are happening at 343i as well as other parts of Microsoft, I will honestly be surprised that the game will make it until next year. The game had so much potential to take off and become the next big thing, but the lack of content and communication turned it into a hollow shell of its former self.

I almost admire the brazenness of it.

I picked up the campaign on sale, and that's where most of my hours played are from. Even then, speaking as a devoted Halo fan over hundreds of hours since childhood, I can tell you: if you skipped this one entirely, you wouldn't miss much. The campaign is a ripoff of Farcry, for whatever reason. Liberating camps; a map littered with collectibles; an upgrade tree for your abilities; constant dumb villain monologues; a bad guy the game inexplicably tries to rehabilitate after you beat him; etc. The only thing missing is a demand to collect 9 space-elk pelts and 3 space-beaver scrotums to increase your capacity for grenades or something. The whole package is just so cynically padded with chores that it bleeds over into brief interludes that play the way Halo used to be.

Bottom line: it's better for the industry, better for the developers themselves who have to work on this, and a better use of your time if you pass on Halo Infinite.

9/10 

Halo Infinite is really good and it's only going to get better with time. The art style is a return to form and the game itself really looks incredible. It definitely struggled to get off the ground, but 343 has really worked to make this game better. Old maps, co-op and forge have all made a fantastic return to the series. Desync is being worked on and is admittedly still a problem at times, but it's much better than it was. This version of forge has absolutely revolutionized that part of Halo. It's by far the best version and allows for players to experience really any type of map with a huge variety of game types. They really knocked it out of the park for Forge. 

Overall the guns, vehicles, movement, and equipment are all fantastic. If I had one thing that I really didn't like, it would be the amount of weapons and vehicles, especially those from previous games. For such a diverse sandbox that can be created in forge there really should be more options. The inclusion of the bandit rifle and the evo version was a step in the right direction, but including more should be one of their main focus's. The only thing higher than that should be improving the system itself to stop desync issues. One thing that I'm certainly looking forward to is forge campaigns. They really look fantastic and it's just the beginning. If you're looking for a fantastic game with fun gameplay and an improving community than Halo Infinite is one game to look at.



Old review: 
Great game but it really needs more content. I'd love to see some pieces of the older games make its way into the game. Forge, co-op (I know these are coming), old maps and also Guns, vehicles, and armor from the original games are pieces that the game is missing. It has the potential to have nearly anything from the previous games that fans love and that to me is very exciting. Overall feels like a well built engine, but it's missing a lot of great halo content.  Still love to play it. Definitely a step in the right direction but 343 needs to step up in my opinion and be more active in its role.",1658545450,1702838517,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Halo Infinite is in my opinion the classic Halo formula and gameplay properly adapted and fitted for a modern shooter, I will even go on record and say that it has my favorite Halo multiplayer. 343 got so much right with this game, art style, music, campaign, multiplayer, forge, firefight, progression system, incredible graphics, etc. This is genuinely the best Halo since Reach. Its really unfortunate that Microsoft keeps cutting resources for this game because I really want some campaign DLC and I think most fans will agree with me when I say this game has an absurd amount of potential. Although its been through the ringer in terms of content updates I can finally say that it is in a great place and the live service is finally delivering. Halo is a bit of a dying franchise but I'm it for the long haul, Halo has always been my favorite game series and its had its fair share of ups and downs throughout the years but no matter what happens it will always hold a special place in my heart. I mean Halo is literally about not losing hope in the face of unbeatable odds. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking to have fun with their friends or just in some classic arena style multiplayer. I would also recommend the campaign to you if you are a lore fan and want to keep up with the overarching Halo story (it can be confusing in some areas if you haven't played the previous games but overall it does a decent job rebooting the franchise).

And got hyped, i even (i know, shame on me) get some stuff on the store to make my spartan looks better. But is not worth your time, like for real.

Is the game batter? Yeah, absolutely. Forge is awesome, gameplay is smooth (when servers and clients align of course.. and yes, I did test the ""connection rework"" mode. It still desync badly) and weapons are really well balanced.

The problem? It is a souless game, a product design to remember each step that you can spent money. It was designed that way and even if they fired the higher ups the spirits remains the same. Look no forward to Halo CE anniversary this past November (2023) were they crafted incredible well the Mark V armor. Did they made an event where you can earn it (and later sell if)? No, just to store up front with a ridiculous price. 

This game is souless because for 343 Halo was always a product with a big fanbase to milk. They never understand it and then proceeded to monetize everything:

- Want to pick you own colors, some to feel yours? Go by the store, there we have something to suit you
- Remember those emblems that where icons to identify yourself to other players? Pick one of the store please
- What do you mean social playlist? Nah, just rotate all players and give them SBMM. They want sweaty matches! Not people to actually know and keep playing with. Having a nemesis one match only to be his team mate the next one is a boring concept i guess.

And of course they will bring all the big guns to make you fall for store (and not only nostalgia, like the Mark V). See that cool death effect that player did to you? Go to the store my friend. ""OH WOW, thats a cool armor! Where can I get it?"" For the low price of 2000 credits you can earn it our dearest spartan. See those incredible charms or that effect that guy makes when he walks? 2200 credits. Oh... we only sold packs of 2000 or 500? We did a little miss calculation please forgive us.

""Ok Im on the store... where is that cool armor i saw?"" What? You though it was just pick and buy? Im sorry my dude but we are randomly rotating... you have to enter to the store weekly and see if the stuff you want is there. Of course you can buy something in the meantime wink wink


So... just go play MCC. It is not that outdated and even it looks better than Infinite sometimes, and mainly because half of the maps (if not more) you will be playing on Infinite are forge made, and even if those looks good, it is not at the same level as a ""hand made"" level created. Do the test if you have MCC, play one match of Infinite and one of MCC and you will realize the difference. Personally I wanted the Infinite match to end, but on MCC I wanted to keep playing and meet new players. Which is a shame, because Infinite gameplay is a good evolution of the Halo forumla


=================================OG REVIEW=============================

Dont waste your time/disk space

The ""Copium fans"" (the ones that defend stuff like charging people for choosing its spartans colors, yes they exists) will tell you how the next update will be H U G E and that 343 is on the right track. But thats nothing more than illusion.

The truth is that the core gameplay of Halo Infinite is awesome, but it is so buried under big technical problems like server desync. And no, 343 care more about the store and milk all what they can from the player base problably knowing that the game wont last more than 5 years (fingers crossed). The store is the only thing that works perfectly, it might be lackluster but it never missed a refresh a ""super sale!"" or something like that.

Which brings me to the awful feeling of Halo: Infinite, they did EVERYTHING wrong with ""modern gaming"": full of microtransactions, lack of personality of your ""own"" spartan to push popular skins, FOMO that will make this your second job because, unless you want to spend real money on challenge swaps or XP bonus so you can get everything you need on time (Did I wrote that the whole system is build around so you have to use swaps that they sell, you cant choose your game modes like in every other game)

And some copium fans must be thinking: ""Maybe,  they did a mistake when they released the game. Since them they did their best to improve the game!"" 

- They push back ""Match XP"" and have to a BETA for that
- Cross core customization is not a real thing because if that way they can sell you ""red"" 4 times instead of 1 (It should be free tho)
- Forge is all in the cloud so they can control all content. They have already not only banned, but also deleted (or make it inaccessible to anyone, which is the same) of a user because ""violence bad""

And the campaign... just a meh tbh. And Im a big Halo fan. Just get the MCC if you want some Halo action: epic campaign (yes, even Halo 4), great multiplayer, great customization with no microtransactions and full mod support.

And some closing words: Halo Infinite had it all, that year every other FPS failed that year, but the greediness/laziness of 343 destroyed what could have been the return of Halo.

But until more cariety in Firefight is added and they GET RID OF THE BATTLE PASS/GEAR SHOP PAYWALLS, I still will not recommend.

This is a game that again demonstrates why a mixed/neutral option for reviews is needed on Steam instead of thumbs up/down. I am absolutely 50-50 on this game but gave it thumbs down because I probably would not recommend it.

Most of my playtime shown has been on Campaign, which is single player but has some co-op, and is more open-world instead of just straightforward stages like prior Halo games. There is a lot to do and some noce character development, but there's almost too much and it really doesn't feel necessary. And it's not infinite-you could speedrun through in a few hours or still 100% in maybe 20-25 hours. The multiplayer is free here but it's not completely free-and here is the big problem. Want to unlock all the cool gear, items and more via Battle Passes? You have to pay because it requires in-game currency. And IAP is the only way to get it. The gameplay is okay but lacks the variety of modes that MCC had (I do miss those Grifball weeks). And where the hell is Firefight/co-op PvE?

The multiplayer being free as well as some limited single player also being free (mostly tutorials and practice games against bots) at least make it worth trying, but only get Campaign when it's on sale for 50% off because it's not worth $60. Yes when it's at $30 but the way the IAPs and greed by the developers are here clearly make this game a huge disappointment. Just download it when you're ready to buy Campaign and stay away from multiplayer even though it's free (you still need an Xbox Live ID though).",1697649853,1702428510,False,0,0,0.44531598687171936,0,True,False,False

Let me explain the difference between skill-based matchmaking and ""casino-based"" matchmaking.

Skill based matchmaking: You are level 10. The game matches you with other players that are level 10 or there about. Maybe a level down or above. With the idea that you will eventually play above that level to be paired with more skilled opponents as you yourself improve.

Casino based matchmaking: You are level 10. You did very good and won the last game. So now next game, you will be paired with level 2s and 3s and you're up against a team of level 15s who are overdue for a win because they lost their last match.

So why should it be called ""casino based"" matchmaking? Well, studies have shown that people who lose too much are more likely to stop playing sooner. Also, people who win too much are also likely to get bored and stop playing. This game, much like COD, in pure Los Vegas fashion, pre-determines the outcomes of your matches before they even start to artificially give you the impression that you're getting a spread of wins and losses. The same way a slot machine does. Because if your outcomes are inconsistent, the player might be compelled to play more, without getting tired of winning or sick of losing, so they stay around longer, making them more likely to spend money on it. To put it simply, it rigs your matches based on how well you do, by pairing you with players most likely to assist you in giving you a win or loss, and your metric of performance fulfills this role for them as well.

Don't believe me? Well, let me ask you this: You ever notice that in the older Halo games and even the older COD games, after the match ends, you were able to stay in the lobby and play with the same people you played with last game? How come that doesn't seem to be the case anymore with this and other modern games? Check out Master Chief Collection and see what I mean. Still need more proof? Try this experiment: Play through 5 or 6 matches. Take screenshots of the scoreboard at the end of the game, then look for similarities in all your losses and all your wins. Look for the ""types"" of players you're matched with. How often is the player in last going 5-11? How often is the player in first going 16-5? How often are the two players in the middle close to each other in score? Can you see a pattern?

In conclusion: the game is rigged and you're wasting your time playing. Why see a match through it's entire 10 minute course if your team composition has been curated to fulfill the match outcome assigned to you? It's completely meaningless.",1702423602,1702423893,False,473,24,0.863732397556304932,0,True,False,False

Ok ok I like Firefight, and PVP multiplayer is somewhat better. I'll say cautiously recommend considering Firefight is still kinda barebones and you only can play KOTH variants in matchmaking. But customs is still fun, I just hope PVE gets more love on official matchmaking in the future and I'll start actively playing this more.

UPDATE JUNE 2023:
Whelp infection arrived, and on paper the gamemode sounds awesome. The new equipment for infected is cool, where you can teleport back and forth between points to bait out humans. But the community is still stained and I feel like the only people are competitive sport. I feel like this is partly to blame for how 343 created the multiplayer, saying they were targetting the arena crowd so putting infection (an inherently arcade mode) with this flavor of halo crowd just doesn't work in my experience so far. All of the matches I played were full of human campers on maps that weren't built with infection in mind, so it feels like there are too few chokepoints on certain maps and unfair for infected. Maybe I'm just bad in my old age and not used to the twitchy shooter style of gameplay, but I just don't like it plain and simple. Maybe I'll pick it back up but once again, I don't feel motivated to play this game for either fun or rewarding content.

UPDATE APRIL 2023:
Here we are again. Still the same constant issues, I feel like its just numbing. I feel like only people who wanna play uber competitively play this still, which is totally fine but Halo to me and a lot of people is supposed to be fun first, competitive second. It does feel like we're inching closer to that with supposed updates that are said to come out, but also couch co-op was supposed to be a thing and they cancelled that. I'll be updating again just out of curiosity to see where we go as a diehard halo fan. But nah, would still not recommend this.

UPDATE SEPT 2022:
Incredible. can't believe it only took a month to become even MORE disappointed. The September 2022 update put the nail in the coffin at least for the time being. I held onto hope that this game might turn around soon, but with the following 
-delays with the season (an 8-10 month season 2 which is ALREADY barebones as it is?? come on thats ridiculous)
-the cancelling of couch co-op (something i didn't even think would happen, im so sorry console-bros)
-just the lack of focus on what makes Halo fun (""Halo is at its core competitive"" is entirely wrong, Halo is first and foremost a social party game that is supposed to be so fun the community makes it competitive)

I've officially given up until either 343i puts their ""t r a n s p a r e n c y"" and ""we made mistakes, we're on the path to fix those"" messages where their mouth is, or until there is a major shake-up with upper management. Uninstalled and going to now replay Halo 1-Reach. See ya maybe next year

I was impressed with it's Beta, and expected it to be a big success once the full game was out with Campaign, and I assumed a lot more MP maps, and modes.

Then in the following months pretty much no new content came despite the game supposedly being a ""live service"". Almost all of Infinites playerbase got bored, and left to play other games due to a near complete lack of new content with left the game feeling way behind compared to past Halo games.

However now 2 years have passed so what's the situation? Well the Campaign got no better, and never will. They fired the entire Campaign team so there is no hope of it ever being finished, and it's yet another 343 Halo leaving off on a cliffhanger that will never be resolved. The Multiplayer on the other hand is in much better shape. It actually feels like a full Halo game now. The modes are there. More maps are there. Forge is there, and it's good allowing a lot of custom map variety. If your interesting primarily in the MP then Infinite is now a good game. Only downside is a lot of players have left so expect the one's remaining to be pretty good, and matchmaking times outside of North America could be slow.

Though saying ""extreme potential"", there are a few bugs to address in multiplayer.  This commonly happens with any PvP game, and 343i is actually listening to the community.  You rarely find this -- take ActiBlizzard, Bethesda, or better yet EA for example: They don't listen to anybody at all, including themselves.

As for the campaign, it has replay value.  From one play through you're perhaps playing on Normal.  Maybe you want a challenge and go to Heroic?  When going on any of the higher difficulties, that is when you will know you must be inventive with the variety of weapons this game has to offer.

Solid fundamentals, but feels incomplete; maybe buy on-sale.

tldr, multiplayer: 
Great game-play sandbox, 343 has made massive improvements since launch; try it out, especially if you're a returning player. 

The campaign is fun enough, but feels incomplete. If the core sandbox and gameplay loop of Infinite is the foundation upon which Halo content will be built in the next few years, it's a good start. The campaign consists of linear missions bridged by open world segments which feature bosses, collectibles, side-objectives, and a progression system which allows you incrementally deeper access to UNCS resources that you can take from forward operating bases into combat. The story follows the previous game, but not immediately, and back-fills the time between Guardians and Infinite with audio logs. Without the audio logs, having played Halo 4, and with only a broad-strokes understanding of the campaign in Guardians, I was able to enjoy and understand the world I was placed in. All that said, and as I mentioned at the outset, the experience felt incomplete. All of the original Bungie installments of the franchise boasted significantly more variety in terms of environments and enemy engagements, including Halo CE and 2, which were woefully incomplete at launch according to the developer documentaries. Infinite manages to feel even less complete in this way, and as much as I hate to say it, begs for DLC. Like walking through the frame of a newly-constructed house, the core elements are present to be built upon, but the work of filling it out is still ahead. I bought it for full-price and wish I'd bought it on-sale. I'd advise you do the same.
 
Campaign: 6/10

The multiplayer is clearly where 343's development efforts are going. While just as incomplete as the campaign at-launch, the multiplayer is now a much more feature-rich experience. Core maps and game modes have expanded dramatically, and seasonal maps and game modes are more frequent. Forge has been implemented, finally realizing the ultimate sandbox party shooter experience that Halo is best known for. Firefight has been added as well, and it may be the best iteration of the game-mode in the entire franchise. The monetization of the multiplayer is, unfortunately, exemplary of ""modern gaming"" in the sense that cosmetics are gaudy, expensive, and compromise the art-direction of the game and greater franchise. The game-play, though, is free, and worth experiencing. 

Multiplayer: 9/10


Overall: 7.5/10, definitely try the multiplayer, and maybe buy the campaign on-sale.",1639614269,1702106025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having new custom games and maps created by an active community has helped keep the game going.  In my opinion,  I think 343 is listening to feedback of the community, but there are still a variety of things that I think should change.  SBMM is strict and there is rarely a chance to socialize with other players (outside of custom games).  The sandbox could use some more weapons from previous Halo titles.  Not everything needs to be in competitive play, expanding the sandbox would increase variety in custom games, or fiesta, etc.  Overall, Halo Infinite is well worth a second chance for returning players, many new (and old) maps and modes in rotation.",1700973289,1702104232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has always felt particularly kinetic to play with the movement feeling heavy but also quick. You'll be sprinting over the edge of a cliff, then grappling along the side of it and whipping around the corner into a drop slide right before delivering a fully-powered jet-hammer down on somebody's face; except now the game has more maps, slightly more dynamic customization, and way more interesting gametypes than the standard Team Slayer (Deathmatch) if objective modes are more your thing. On top of that, there's a working custom games browser and forge is back and better than ever (although a little obtuse compared to older titles, it more than makes up for it by having *by far* the most options). The best news? The singleplayer campaign finally lets you replay missions. It may not be the Halo for everyone in some ways, but it is certainly Halo and it is certainly a great time to jump in and experience it. It's just so damn fun.

This game is actually super fun. It has problems, but also a great foundation and a lot of potential. Not the ideal state for a lot of people which is totally understandable, but at its core, Halo Infinite is just so entertaining from moment-to-moment that it's easy to forget all that. First you're riding shotgun in a warthog as the driver takes you backwards into a gravity cannon, then you're majestically careening through the skies just before landing upside down on some poor guy, only to then finally get yanked out of the warthog and immediately get ran over by a ghost (sending your now limp carcass cartwheeling into the abyss below).

[u][b]Summary:[/b][/u]  Extremely fun to play, a surprisingly emotional story, a beautiful map. Perhaps a bit too little of it all.

     [h3]+ Strengths +[/h3]
-Art, Aesthetic:  Gorgeous open world map and scifi dungeons. Lots of detail and care put into armour, vehicles, etc.
-Mechanics, Movement:  Yes, the grappling hook is as fun as it should be and then some! Exploration is rewarding, plenty of variety and ways to approach a given situation. It's just FUN. Even dying was usually a jawdropping or laughing moment instead of a frustrating one.
-Music:  Phenomenal!
-Story:  This took me by surprise. Halo's always had a solid, if often meat-headed narrative. This one felt personal, deep, and often managed to do so with minimal words thanks to masterfully directed cinematics.
-Sound Design:  Fantastic. Deep, rich sounds that will make the most of good speakers.
-Voice Acting:  Everyone did an excellent job. Downes and Taylor acted the hell out of their parts. Other characters ranged from competent to good.
-God damn those grunts are funny.

     [h3]- Weaknesses -[/h3]
-Length:  Not enough of a good thing. The open world pads the game out a bit, but it ended up feeling a bit small, and the actual story segments, while excellent, felt like it was just getting started. I hope this isn't the beginning of a trend where multiplayer gets all the resources, which rankles when it's accessible for free.
-Mechanics, Movement:  This category is here also because the good parts are excellent, but the bad parts are annoying. Vehicles struggle with terrain in a way that would be a little offputting even if this wasn't a Halo game. On foot feels a little better but still get snagged on things more than I'd like.
-Interface:  The map was a bit clunky to use and didn't have a good legend.",1702003605,1702003630,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Waiting 2 years to have a reason to play after the campaign isn't great and I couldn't recommend the game until it was in a place that didn't just cater to PvP players. Nothing wrong with PvP, it's just not for me.

PvE is great, but it's not perfect. King of the hill is fun, but it feels restricting, forcing you to play a specific way. Here are some things I think would make firefight better:

1. Different modes, like Reach firefight. KOTH is fun but forces you to play one way and one place.
2. Make ammo refill boxes have a bit more ammo in them or be player independent.
3. The grunts on the phantom dropship side turrets are way too OP, need to tune them down a bit.
4. Scoreboard needs to show kills.
5. Firefight specific medals and achievements.
6. Challenges for both PvP and PvE.
7. Crazy last rounds, like Gruntpocolypse!

These are just a few suggestions. If I think of anymore I will add them to the list. I know this is probably just the first iteration of firefight and improvements in the future will come, so I'm definitely excited for that.

Halo Infinite still has a LOT of problems. Its otherwise stellar customization has been completely fucked with the excessive monetization (not counting coatings because that's still a sore point for me but at this point I've accepted it), its sandbox feels tiny despite actually having more weapons than Halo 3, we STILL don't have any campaign DLC, the menus are still awful, and the netcode could use some serious work.

On the other hand, they have seriously improved the state of the game. We're finally at the point where each season is giving us a substantial amount of new content instead of adding content that should have been in the game at launch. There's still no denying that there's a lot of stuff here that Infinite SHOULD have released with, but when you look at the state of other industry leaders like Bungie and Activision, it's genuinely nice to see a game with an increase of quality over time as opposed to things just getting worse.

I've been playing Infinite on and off since launch, so I can't really say my initial thoughts on the game held out (what can I say, I'm a sucker for my funny space marine game), but the addition of things like Forge and Firefight have seriously increased the amount of time I can spend on this. There are still plenty of issues, but a good multiplayer game with a ton of maps and modes for free with a relatively small file size? If you haven't played it but were scared off by the bad reviews or if you DID but stopped after a couple seasons, give it another try.






Original review below, for posterity's sake.

Just, friggin'...

At this point, I don't know what else to say. Halo has been near and dear to my heart since literally before I can even remember, and to see it in this state...
Infinite isn't /bad/ in a vacuum. If it were the first game in a new franchise by a team of new devs, it would be pretty sick.

But it's not in a vacuum. Even outside of the legacy of the original games, it exists alongside an entire industry full of F2P multiplayer experiences that provide ten times the value for your time, five times the content, and with developers that actually seem interested in at least giving the ILLUSION of pretending to care about you.

I've tried to be lenient and give 343 the benefit of the doubt, but I just can't anymore. They've taken my fondness and nostalgia for this franchise and turned it into complete and utter apathy, and I'm the sap that enjoyed Metal Gear Survive, for god's sake.",1650687668,1701993940,True,0,0,0.494248747825622559,0,True,False,False

It is getting forge updates frequently and some of the playlists actually have forge created maps in them.

They added firefight recently and are working on fixing the desync which is still a slight problem albeit much improved since launch.

It's free, so you can't unironically complain about microtransactions, you don't have to look like a cat to play it but for some reason half the player base did indeed buy cat ears for their spartan.

There are two issues that make it less than perfect at times. 

Firstly, the game does not know how to properly balance matches, if you are a good player (so around onyx) and queue into social it tends to put 3 players on your team at half your skill/MMR and pairs the enemy team with 4 players that are better than the 3 on your team. This causes a lot of pressure on you to carry. It only is a problem for people around onyx and the people that unfortunately get placed into their matches. 

Also, if you are good and want to play with your friends that are ahem ""less than good"" then you will most likely have to carry very hard, it won't put bad players on the enemy team just because you have bad players on your team.

The other issue is balancing weapons based on input. Mouse players have a major advantage with weapons like shotguns, gravity hammers, rockets, and energy sword. This is because they can flick their mouse very quickly towards enemies, much faster than controller players at least. Controller players have an advantage with BR, bandit, snipers (with the exception of skewer). You would think mouse would be better at sniping but controller has very strong aim assist and bullet magnetism with them. Also mouse has aim assist that you cannot turn off which makes it feel a little weird.

2022 review: I have a lot of mixed feelings about Infinite... for new players to Halo I believe they will absolutely love the experience but as a veteran player it's gonna hit a bit different

The gameplay is fantastic and makes it worth playing already so the tl;dr is yeah I recommend the game and the multiplayer is free so you can always try it out

My mixed feelings come from the following:

. Maps: While the maps aren't necessarily ""bad"", they aren't nearly as memorable or interesting as any Halo 1-3 map, some of the spawns are a bit scuffed tho

. Weapons: I feel like a lot of the weapons are hit or miss, the human weapons (apart from the shotgun... why tf didnt they just use the OG shotgun) generally feel really good. The AR is actually viable, the sidekick is awesome and the BR is punchy. Alien weapons like the Mangler and the Skewer are so satisfying to use but then others like the Shock Rifle and Pulse Carbine feel off and I think classic weapons would've been a better choice

. Progression......... why can't we just have Halo Reach credit system back brooooo and why don't we have a player level? How am I supposed to know if my team mates are brand new or sunk some hours in at a glance? Having a level reflect your time investment is important in my opinion, the battle pass levelling is insulting slow

. Gadgets: Love the new gadgets, I was concerned when the grappling hook was revealed but man it is so fun to skyjack an enemy 

There is a lot to love but there is also a lot of stuff where you just think ""why did they do that"", overall a really solid game and I enjoy it a lot but some quality of life improvements would make a world of difference. If they made a classic multiplayer mode with all the OG guns that would be so fun",1641615604,1701917094,True,2,0,0.532979488372802734,0,True,False,False

I can confidently recommend this game to anyone who is nostalgic for early 2000s shooters or someone who is looking for a slower paced multiplayer experience. 

The addition of Forge means that there are literally endless possibilities regarding maps, modes and, thanks to the addition of firefight, single player content. 

Downsides: SBMM (skill based match making) is still an issue. At best you will struggle with consistency in ranked or unranked lobbies. At worse you will not find a game in some less-populated game modes as you are either too skilled or suck at the game. 

Desync is still an issue, although I feel as if it's getting better with every season. 

Campaign: 
Is fun, even for the price. The enemy variety feels like old Halo 1-3 campaigns, although the variety of factions is limited to Banished and Banished with sentinel support. 
Bossfights are a fantastic addition! Makes you truly feel like Master Chief as you defeat a powerful enemy in single combat. 
Gunplay is amazing, and the gameplay in general runs silky smooth. 
Only downside is that the open world feels a little shallow and that 343i has shown that they aren't afraid to soft reboot the story, so the cliffhanger of an ending may never be resolved... 

TL:DR 
Multiplayer has become great and looks to continually improve over the coming years. Network and SBMM issues still persist. 
Forge has added endless content, both MP and SP.

While Microsoft didn't give the rights to develop Halo games to any other developers they own, they at least did the next best thing: Remove Bonnie Ross from leadership, and hired three new leaders for 343 Industries (One of the three leaders, Pierre Hintze, was responsible for fixing MCC), which has proven to be very beneficial for both 343 Industries and Halo Infinite.

While there were a few aspect of Halo Infinite completely abandoned (Multiplayer story, and most likely Campaign DLCs), 343's priority in fixing the game's multiplayer aspects and lack of contents helped turn the game around. New additions like Halo 3 Refuled, Forge AIs, cross-core helmets and armor coatings, and Firefight King of the Hill gave Halo Infinite a new life that it desperately needed to survive. Heck, after the mid-season update on December 5th, the game now has everything 343 promised on launch.

All I hope for now is that 343 had finally learned to release future Halo games with all the contents they promised. While it took Halo Infinite a dreadful 2 years to get to this point, it was a journey worth going through.

plus despite the fact 343 lowered shop prices near launch because they were way too high, they raised them back recently to take advantage of the fact the ability to use any helmets on any armor etc. was added (but it's only helmets right now but they changed prices ahead of time for shoulders (there was a shoulder piece for roughly 300 credits, now it's 800)

Honestly the game is in a lot better of a place than I said previously. I want to actively really love it, but the issues I still have with it just make me sad. There's no reason for such monetization. I play on Xbox these days, but my criticism still stands. I'll give this game another chance.

Update: 12/5/23
I think this game is worthy of a recommendation now. Been playing it on my Xbox and PC if I feel like sitting at my desk and I really gotta say, this is what we deserved. I know for many people it's too late but I've always been a ""better late than never"" kind of person with these types of things. The shop could be better, but honestly the sheer amount of content we're getting in the passes whether it be the paid or the free is very, very nice and worth the investment of time if you like your customization in games.

Why are bundles being raised in price with justification of cross core which was marketed as a launch feature?

Why is the SBMM in specific playlists (halo 3 refueled) almost unplayable?

Why do I need to download UI elements??? 

Why do I need to pay for pilot helmet when the point of the winter contingency pass was to include the other reach cosmetics that 343 got flamed for making us buy?


Most of these strike me as corporate meddling or bandaid solutions as the game was held together by rubberbands and silly string on launch


Other than those issues the future looks pretty bright for this game",1637103954,1701814830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a sea of positive reviews, I mark this as negative to draw attention to these issues. This is not a dismissal but an invitation for developers to consider constructive feedback. I acknowledge the game's strengths in both single player and multiplayer experiences, making it worth the purchase. However, my concerns lie in specific aspects that, if addressed, could elevate the overall gaming experience.

I have been a dedicated Halo fan since the early days of my gaming journey, and the franchise holds a special place in my heart as a nostalgic staple. The memories of sitting on the couch with buddies after a day of street lightsaber battles and Nerf gun wars are etched in my mind. However, despite my deep-rooted love for the series, I can't help but express disappointment with the launch of the latest installment.

Let me start by acknowledging the positive aspects of the game. Whether in the single-player or multiplayer realm, the classic Run and Gun gameplay is commendable. If your focus is solely on one of these aspects, the experience is solid. The single-player campaign provides a great experience, and the multiplayer, while not reaching the heights of Halo 2, still delivers a decent time.

However, my primary gripe lies in the absence of cooperative multiplayer at launch. Playing through the Halo campaigns has always been a communal experience for me, passing the controller, sharing laughs, and strategizing with friends. Unfortunately, this crucial element was missing, and it significantly impacted the overall vibe of the story.

The absence of co-op at launch seems like a colossal missed opportunity. Halo has always thrived on its cooperative experiences, and delaying this feature feels like a misstep. Additionally, there's room for innovation in multiplayer dynamics. Imagine the ability to seamlessly pass the controller to a friend during single-player mode, allowing for a shared experience even in a solo campaign. This could elevate the game's appeal by fostering a sense of togetherness, a feature often overlooked in today's online gaming landscape.

The gaming industry is evolving, with online experiences becoming more prevalent. However, it's crucial not to forget the value of shared experiences. While online multiplayer has its merits, creating opportunities for interaction and shared enjoyment enhances the overall gaming experience. This aspect is often why people turn to streaming or watching others play, seeking that communal feeling reminiscent of the pre-online era.

In conclusion, while the latest Halo installment scores well with an 8 out of 10 from me, it undeniably could have been better. The absence of co-op at launch and the overlooked potential for innovative multiplayer experiences are substantial missed opportunities. As the gaming landscape evolves, it's essential for franchises like Halo to find a balance between modern online features and the timeless joy of shared gaming experiences.",1701755903,1701755903,False,2,1,0.506066083908081055,0,True,False,False

At the time of the old review, things couldn't have been bleaker. Fortunately, that was the lowest point. 343 refused to give up and really REALLY knuckled down and got to work.

OLD REVIEW:
It's been a year sine the first MP beta. Nothing has been done to address the network issues that everyone knew about a year ago. It's been 10 months since people said no to challenges and begged for match XP. Match XP ""beta"" is maybe coming a full year after release.

The transformation Infinite has gone through since the turn of 2023 has been nothing short of a miracle.

With the extension of Season 2 into 6 months, the totally pathetic roadmap, launch of the terrible TV series, and the 343 / Microsoft layoffs all coming one after another. Early 2023 was probably the single lowest point Halo has ever been in. 

But thing have changed a lot in 9 months. All the incompetent leadership at 343 who were basically sandbagging the game with terrible choices were sacked, and the man who helped turn MCC from a complete trash heap to gold was put in charge. And his leadership shows. Halo Infinite in January 2023 and December 2023 are almost 2 different games. Nearly every fatal criticism that people had at launch have been accounted for. 

Was it bad that it took 1.5 years to get here? Undeniably, but there's only so much ranting and raving we can do before we just have to accept what happened, and look towards the future instead of forever mulling over the past.

If you played in 2021/2022 and were left feeling very disappointed like many were, now is a better time than ever to try it again. I think Halo Infinite is now a serious game that is actually worth your time playing.",1638039102,1701494335,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It has amazing combat/gameplay mechanics, an absolute stellar foundation. Holy god, they somehow screwed it up so bad though.

It's such a shame that MCC is better in practically every regard to this half baked low content game. I think this could possibly be worth my time in a couple years but until then, I'm going to keep playing Reach and 4 because playing the same less than a handful of maps is dreadful.

I had waited before putting a review up to see if there was an chance of 343 fixing this game and it's still shit. Granted it is less shit than it was at launch but at the end of the day a polished turd is still a turd. The campaign is mediocre with parts that completely undermine previous games plot points and character development. Such as Chief's exchange with Cortana from Halo 4 quoted below.

Cortana: ""They'll pair you with another A.I. Maybe even another Cortana model if Halsey lets them. It won't be me... you know that right?""
Chief: ""I won't let that happen""

Granted Halo 5 walked back Cortana's death and turned her into the villain but Chief still never gave up on her and followed her to the end to try and bring her back.He never gave up on her and gave her the benefit of the doubt that she was still good and could be redeemed. In this game he almost deletes ""The Weapon"" or the New Cortana without hesitation. 
Not only did they skip over the massive war that took place between the UNSC and Cortana's Awakened, but the Banished come out of nowhere (Unless you have played Halo Wars 2.) and now ""The Endless"" are another antagonist being added to Halo's Lore. The Endless based on what they gave us with the Harbinger are laughable and look like the Sangheili's dollar tree cousins.The Harbinger is not even worthy of kissing the Arbiter's feet.

A few notable Campaign fixes include:
They fixed most of the performance issues. It no longer burns my 3090 Ti or crashes every 15 minutes.
Co-Op has been added and is now more stable then when it was launched. It also saves progress without all players being present and can be picked up any time.
The Achievements now pop when they are supposed to instead of never or hours later.
The broken UNSC/Spartan Audio Logs have been fixed and can now be collected.
The AI has been improvced significantly the enemies are now more of a challenge and the Marines have survivability and no longer get stuck shooting dead bodies or a wall.
Levels can now be replayed and difficulty can be changed anytime.

Multiplayer is a pretty much dead joke.
Multiplayer problems include:

Customization: 
Cross Core Customization is limited but technically in the game almost two years after they promised it.
No FREE Armor unlocks unless you buy the Campaign and find all the collectibles. (This game is what stopped them from making new unlocks for Halo MCC.)
Many of the customization items are ""vaulted"" permanently if you didn't buy them during the limited time they were released.
Battle Passes with no value or real customization options. Yes I totally want to spend 10 hours grinding for a shoulder piece that I have in the same color on a different armor core!

Mechanics:
No Assassinations Which leads to the bullshit back slap system where Hit Reg and latency is like Mario Chance Time and always screws you over!
They still haven't fixed the MASSIVE Controller Aim Assist Advantage. Most players on Controller can beat out a MnK player with 5-10% better accuracy and in a FPS where first shot and seconds count means you are going to get fucked especially in Comp! The second major issue is Hit Reg. Hit Reg STILL has not been fixed almost two years after release. Me and some friends stress tested the Hit Reg system for over an hour. The energy sword lunge is broken and in a worse spot than ever. The gravity hammer whiffs extremely hard and there are now three versions of it each with their own issues.Point blank shots will miss due to latency issues or just not register. Hitting someone around a corner still happens to you and against you.

Entire classic modes are still missing such as Regicide, Fire Fight, and Juggernaut.
We are also missing classic vehicles and weapons from previous games.

Forge has become the new excuse for 343 to be extremely lazy. Because why would they need to try when the community makes content for them which they turn into nostalgia bait or extremely poorly thought out game modes. While it is the best Forge we have ever seen I cannot give 343 credit for what the community accomplishes with it that 343 profits from.

Infection has been added and is an extremely massive disappointment this is by far the worst infection we have ever received.
Husky Raids is very poorly thought out on a tiny CTF Map with Fiesta Weapon rules. However due to the size of maps and the poorly thought out spawns you can sit there and be spawn camped by a Rocket Launcher or Grav Hammer until you eventually manage to break out. With brain dead teammates who quit out of frustration it is the worst offering I have ever personally played since Halo 3 ODST Multiplayer.

Matchmaking is a joke! You either get matched with clueless idiots who can't get a single kill and matched against a four person squad clearly in VC. Or you get matched with people way more skilled who make fun of you against a team that you end up seal clubbing.

Every update that I play 343 goes back on any goodwill additions they have made and makes the game worse to play and more of a grind, that feels worse to play! All to push increased monetization.

As I sit here to update my review and look over my 400 hours I've played. I thought about any fun I have had in all this time,The only fun or challenge I had was grinding to Onyx in Season 1 which was only fun because I was playing with friends and my Legendary/LASO Runs of the Campaign. I can't even believe I spent 400 hours on this dog shit game.

End of story do not support this game! Even for a F2P Multiplayer I still want my money back! It has improved to be sure but it still has a LOOOOOONG way to go to be anywhere as good Halo 4 or even Halo 5 Multiplayer!",1684381460,1701427511,False,2,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

I have grown to love Halo Infinite, I have way too much customization, way too many hours.
But me, my friends, and hundreds of others in the community agree that SBMM is awful.
I am constantly being queued into matches with genuine level one players. Trust me I have checked the levels of most of my teammates and I have seen dozens of people with only 5-20 games played (I feel bad for these players because both me and my friends sit around 2000 games EACH and the game is making beginners play against us, ruining the experience for BOTH TEAMS)

Multiplayer: I'll do this first since this is what everyone is here for. It is a shocking return to form. If you're one of those neckbeards that hasn't stopped playing Halo 3 since 2007, this is the game for you! Gun play is solid, there's skill gaps for the power weapons and movement is fluid (kills are extremely satisfying). If you're looking for a ""fun"" multiplayer experience, this game should be the stop for you. As for my opinion, I fu**ing hate the multiplayer. I have only played about 500 or so MP matches in my time playing this game, and I have hated just about every single match I've played. I enjoyed Halo 5's MP so much and was good at it, I can't get good at Halo Infinites MP. Wanna know why? Skill based matchmaking...IT DOESNT FU**ING WORK 343. Why am I getting pinned against people that have played 1000's of matches and have an accuracy of 75+%??? I have played 500 matches and have AWFUL AIM. Wanna know why I have awful aim? Because I'm trying to hit 3 people at once that have 200 times the skill I have and will die no matter what. I work 45 hours a week (I know a lot work more) with the point of: I don't have all the time in the world to ""just get good."" I want to load into a match and play casually, shit in one hand and want in the other, right? There is NO casual in this game, no matter if it's infection, BTB, Team Slayer, Super Fiesta, Husky Raid...nothing is just for ""sit back and relax."" Thank you for coming to my TedTalk...Next up: CAMPAIGN!


Campaign: if you're just now playing it, is a fun experience. 343 introduces some new elements, like seemless cutscenes, showing the humanity in chief, and introducing a new foe. I can NOT stress this enough, this game gets old fast. Campaign replay-ability is close to none. Sure, you can go do a mission in a different way...but it doesn't do anything. It's fun to explore the campaign map for the first few times, but it's mostly empty and there's minimal combat engagement. Every bit of hype you might have had prior to the games release...don't worry, the game will not live up to it. Believe me, I was one of the freaks that analyzed every pixel of every bit of every teaser, picture, tweet, video, anything that came up of Halo Infinite.

TLDR: Campaign is fun the first or second time with questionable Batman-style enemies. MP is a good return to form with satisfying gun play, and kills. MP is also a fu*k fest of try-hards that only play for kills. MP also will match against HCS level players while you're just a nooby.

Lots of fun modes, TONS of maps, Forge is HUGE, new weapons and equipment slowly added with each season- this game WILL flourish. The gameplay is the best halo has ever been, its so tight and fun and the gunplay feels so F O C K I N N I C E. 
The potential for absolute greatness with this game is still there. It just needs some more logs added onto the flames. 
P L E A S E add firefight or some PVE gamemodes- Y'all made F U N AI for the campaign- USE IT!!! I would love to be able to earn armor while slaying some of the most fun enemies in halo history. The hunters themselves are literal mini bosses and so engaging to fight. 
AND P L E A S E keep making stuff cross core!!! I honestly hope to see the whole ""core"" system thrown out the window and every piece of armor is swappable, but I dunno if thats too much of an ask. Id like to believe its possible.
 Wrists and utility should come next being on all cores, I feel like those are probably easier than others but I also know nothing about programming a video game!  but allowing helmets to be swapped on every core has opened up so many possibilities for customizing, please don't stop! Don't be afraid to do stuff like MCC did,  like the tech suits, you could make a core like how MCC's techsuits are for instance, that way you keep the already existing core system, but almost give it a back seat and also allow some extra customizing to our spartans- AND-
IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO MIX AND MATCH YOUR PROSTHETIC LIMBS. 
okay maybe that one is too bold. who knows.
The gameplay is 11/10, its action packed, fast, and FUN- and most importantly- its Halo.
There is some slight performance issues that I think don't belong, but I honestly believe that's specific to my rig, because others have had no issues.

-> Horrible dialogue: obnoxious side ally, semi-obnoxious pseudo-Cortana, insufferable main villain (please just stfu with your wannabe Shakespearean nonsense)
-> Beautiful graphics, pretty shitty AA though. Ever since the industry shifted from MSAA to all these horrible AA like fxaa, txaa and pretty much all the garbage tech Ngreedia has put out the past 13 years, AA has gone down the drain. Disgusting company.
Shitty long range textures also, textures become ""blobby"", think PS1 era graphics. LAUGH OUT LOUD.
-> Bland environments (only standards forests a la Halo 1)
-> Good sounds
-> Fun multiplayer, big battle mode should be more than just 8v8 though, was hoping for 32v32 or 64v64 at least
-> Disgusting skins, most of them look nothing like Halo 1, 2, 3, kids' designs with nonsense accessories
-> Marines AI are back and they're pretty fun to mess around with, you can equip whatever weapons you want on them so there's some great shenenigans to be had. Would be fun if you could commandeer multiple squads and tell them what to do but you can't expect much from 343 industries (aptly named, considering what 343 Guilty Spark was: a disaster).
-> Very good optimisation: running high/very high settings on a 4790k, DDR3 32GB, 5700xt on 60+ FPS at 1080p. Could probably do 1440p easily if i dropped just some settings to med. You don't really notice the difference anyway.
-> Story obviously made by multiple teams and undecided what it wants to be. Beginning is confusing as hell as to what happened, audio dialogues piece a lot together, but it feels like most of the audio logs should be playable backstory before even getting to Halo
-> Very little explanation as to what happened after H5, if not for audio logs
-> SP not worth full price tag, but definitely fun for discount (got it for 30$ CAD)
-> Master Chief has gone from dry humour in H1, 2, 3 to autistic one liner lord by H6.
-> In game abilities very fun, only progressive thing for the series.

For a 6th entry in the series, underdelivers. Grapling hook is great addition but copy pasted out of Doom. 
Story forgettable, no moments to experience like the beach landing in H1 or Library flood attack or anything.

Way too much Mchief + Cortana love story nonsense. Feels like pure 6th grader fan fic of a boy who can't get the girl he wants at this point so he writes some sappy love story between him and the woman of his dreams that he wants to protect.
Kinda cute in that scenario but pretty pathetic for a mature level game.

If you've been turned off from the game back when it first started, now's the time to give it another chance. It's so different & fleshed out now that your experience is bound to be a much better one.

Thanks to new management, 343i was able to evolve it from a greedy & incomplete pile of trash, instead into a fun & feature-filled game with an actually respectable financial structure. Its IAP format can even be regarded as industry leading in some ways, doing better by the player than most games currently do.

It still has a long way to go to address all its remaining outstanding issues, but it's been heading in the right direction with a lot of very big strides made towards improving the game in all the ways it desperately needed.

Over a year later and it's still a half-assed incomplete mess with unsatisfying multiplayer and a campaign that has less story then the first 4 levels of halo combat evolved.
A baffling mixture of some of the best gunplay and movement in a Halo game combined with some of the worst level/map design alongside weird decisions to make bullet sponge boss enemies that completely ruin the pace of combat make for one of the halo experiences ever. The story accomplishes virtually nothing, has no stakes in the Halo universe or any sense of urgency and feels like a generic side quest in a vast barren open world. 
What was billed to fans as a return to form feels little more then an intermission at best and a gross misunderstanding of what Halo is supposed to be, as there was an inexplicable decision to ""appeal to a broader audience"" and make the game a generic fortnite clone with obscene monetization. 343i has had 3 mainline entries into the franchise and all of them get it wrong in unique and amusing ways, and each entry completely ditches any potential the previous one had as a foundation to build upon.
I would love to see Halo return to the greatness it once was but in the current environment I dont see it happening. I still return to this title because it is what we have.
It's 2023 and... a lot of good ideas, but the game itself just doesnt hold up, cant find matches that have less than 250 ms of latency and there are no social features that promote casual gameplay or communicating with teammates or enemies. Skill based matchmaking means every single match you get slapped in to just is a wholly unsatisfying chore rather than a fun experience. It isn't right saying number company bad but the only real good to come from 343i is Halo Wars 2 and Halo MCC; and even that took over 3 years to be something worthwhile.

Rather egregious prices in the store tho, however these are entirely cosmetic items offering no advantage to gameplay, so rather irrelevant when it comes to a question of the games overall quality imo (multiplayer is 100% free, including new content, they have to fund the studio somehow). There are however, also plenty of free cosmetics offered through battle passes, and the entirely free operation passes. Also best implementation of a season pass system I have personally seen. Purchased battle passes are available to progress perpetually, no more fomo (bungie take notes). You can buy a battle pass now and pick it up in a year if you were unable to complete it when it was released.

The campaign gameplay is fun, overall, but a lack of interesting environments makes it feel the same after a while.
The story is weighed down with cleaning up narrative garbage from its predecessor.
I don't envision replaying this campaign many times like I have for previous Halo games.

Multiplayer seems like an unhappy marriage between the best and worst yet for a Halo game.
On the good side, the most impressive Forge system yet is giving life to many amazing map and game mode creations in an explosion of creativity.
Content updates are regular now, and largely deliver fun things.
The weekly challenges and other seasonal content are easy to complete and give you cool skins and customization for free.
On the bad side, it took over a year for the game to finally deliver on these great things that it should have had on release. Why did it take them this long? (COUGHbonnierossCOUGH)
Maybe some hope can be had now that the man who revitalized the Master Chief Collection into greatness is head of 343.
On the ugly side, you have Skill Based Match Making that will cause tears and rage.
It punishes you for doing well in a game, and doesn't seem to let up when you get stomped into the ground over and over by superior teams.

However, I did write rashly due to my anger over a wasted save, and I must admit I was wrong about my first impression of the campaign.

As a lifelong Halo fan, I think Halo: Infinite reads as a strong step in the right direction, and 343, despite the severe mishap of releasing Infinite too early, continues to work to things right. In general, things feel like a return to form for the Halo series.

-Excellent Core Gameplay-

What really ties Infinite together is that its core gameplay has always been excellent. A lot of things feel calibrated nicely, and as such a lot of game modes are a blast. I feel like the Assault Rifle is in a perfect sweet spot for the franchise: it's just usable and reliable enough that it doesn't feel bad to start with. This means that when games come down to the wire, I feel comfortable rushing onto a point or towards the flag armed with the AR and can reasonably expect to make an impact, but if there's downtime I'll look for other weapons that outperform it.

The equipment system strikes an excellent balance that wasn't necessarily there in older Halos. The one-and-done of Halo 3's equipment made using them a major investment, while the rechargeable nature of Halo Reach's equipment made them spammable. The charge system, on the other hand, allows equipment to be strong and multi-use without feeling unfair.

A lot of the equipment is a blast to use as well. Grapple is a standout with the amount of mobility it offers, especially in conjunction with melee weapons like the sword. At the same time, the thruster pack stays relevant with its instant boost winning out in close combat. On top of that, the repulsor offers a lot of situational uses that are almost always satisfying to pull off, like booping people off of cliffs or reflecting a rocket back at someone.

The mobility also strikes a balance that, while not necessarily Halo-like, is well balanced. Clamber is just too convenient to pass up even if it doesn't totally mesh with classic Halo movement, and the casual sprint, while more COD-like than Halo, helps you get back into the action but isn't oppressively useful in the way it was for Halo Reach.

-Story/Writing-

Given what a serious downturn Halo 5's story took, I think that Infinite's story is as good of a compromise as you can get without hard rebooting the franchise. In many ways, it reads as an admission of fault on 343's part: it goes back to the basics as best as possible. ""The UNSC is scattered on a new mysterious ring. You will gather the marines and stop the bad guys, just like in Halo CE."" Infinite does its best to own up to what happened in Halo 5, and then move in a healthier direction for the story. It was never going to be an easy or smooth thing to effectively fess up to their mistakes and then correct them while still moving the story forward. Most studios and writers would opt for a hard reboot to make the story clean and pretty again, but that can alienate old fans. I think this kind of compromise is the most responsible choice for them to make.

In addition, the campaign dialogue is excellent. The marines are back to being properly hilarious, as opposed to the cocky attitudes of the Spartan IVs. The Banished are also hilarious, and I appreciate that they at least act a little differently from the Covenant in their attitudes, even if not in the way they fight.

The multiplayer storyline is a bit awkwardly written, and I'm glad that they, for the most part, seem to have pulled back from pushing it too much.

-Networking issues-

The one major issue that a lot of people have noted is that the netcode seems to have some problems. The gameplay has been excellent enough for me to generally overlook this issue, but I will admit that I will also complain at times that some kills are total BS. Sometimes they're kills *I myself* have gotten that I think I shouldn't have.

My understanding is that 343 is taking a genuine and deep look at their netcode and seeing how they can overhaul it. I get the impression they are taking this very seriously: at one point, one of their engineers sat down and very clearly explained what was going on with it and what kind of solutions they've been tinkering with to try and fix it. I'm willing to give them some leeway for this as a result, as frustrating as it can be at times.

-Confused Sandbox-

I think my only real concern about Infinite is that I'm not entirely sure that the balance team fully understands the Halo sandbox. It's a bit like they're working with tools that they know they need to include, but that for some of those tools they're not entirely sure why those tools were there or how they were calibrated in the first place.

Where they do understand the sandbox, they have excelled. Case in point: the Skewer and the Hydra. Both of these weapons have, effectively, replaced the anti-vehicle niche of the Spartan Laser, a beloved classic, and they've done so in ways that fit very well. The Hydra has far superior tracking against vehicles, but has a long time to kill, while the Skewer offers burst damage and is especially satisfying to land against other Spartans.

In other places, they've produced some guns that just feel bad to use, especially in light of the guns they replaced in the sandbox. The pulse carbine joins a long line of plasma rifle replacements (to be fair, this mistake dates back to Bungie) that no one wants to take as it's outperformed by nearly everything. Both shotguns (the bulldog and the heatwave) lack the punch of the old shotgun, and they both feel a little awkward to use in close quarters combat as neither really lines up well with the flow of combat. The Commando is strong with an annoying amount of recoil management, but it's frankly more enjoyable to just grab a BR or AR and use those in their effective ranges instead. And the Bandit feels like a bizarre, disappointing DMR replacement, with its variant the Bandit EVO feeling like a clone impostor of the DMR.

The older map designs in Big Team Battle have not been conducive to vehicle use either due to their very narrow lanes, and reflect the balance team's struggle to properly incorporate vehicles into the sandbox. Newer maps, like Oasis, do a much better job of incorporating open spaces and wide lanes where the mobility of vehicles can really shine. In addition, the Banshee underperforms compared to the Wasp (it would be nice if the far superior mobility of the Banshee actually gave it any kind of advantage in aerial combat, seeing how the Wasp is generally far superior for air-to-ground assault).

The sandbox issues extend to the campaign as well, as I'm not entirely sure if 343 fully understands the importance of Halo's gun limitations. Part of what makes Halo interesting is the fact that you're constantly picking up new weapons as your old ones run out of ammo. Sure, the plasma pistol that a grunt dropped isn't the most exciting weapon, but your battle rifle is all out of ammo so you have to make do with what you've got. Not the case in Infinite, where you can always pop out your favorite gun on demand, and refill it at the many helpful ammo boxes around.

-Conclusion-

Overall, I recommend Halo: Infinite. Its core gameplay is an absolute blast (and is what's kept me coming back hour after hour). The (finally implemented!) career progression is fair, and the battle passes are reasonable. The devs, having eaten a hearty slice of humble pie, seem to be working to take the game in the right direction. Had the game released in its current state instead of its half-finished state from 2021, I think it would've been hailed as the triumphant return of the Halo franchise, instead of the lukewarm reception it got.",1671250577,1700999652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being a longtime Halo fan and playing since Infinite's launch I can see the ""infinite"" potential, growth, and success this game has with it's foundation that's already been laid. But as the franchise's first F2P game, the live service runs into hiccups that needs a lot of improvement, and has a way to go. Like the pricing of micro transactions and cosmetics, listening to community feedback, regular engaging updates to keep players coming back, and doing right by rewarding loyal active players.

The Campaign
The scaled back plot and focus on Master Chief and humanity being left stranded on a Halo was a great way to return the series to it's roots. The Open World feels like it fits here naturally, with the look and feel of the original Halo CE level 2 and 4, captured near flawlessly. However, lack of variety and focused encounters leave the game feeling extremely repetitive quickly. There is only one outdoor biome, with a day/night cycle, and tons of same feeling forerunner constructs to navigate for the story levels. With some banished fortifications and ships tossed in, the campaign feels like one giant Halo mission and almost overstays its welcome. Upgrading Master Chiefs armor and equipment was a positive new addition to the game, and the bounty alternate weapons combined to create an interesting sandbox to play in. The ability to spawn just about any vehicle from the outposts is also an extremely welcome feature, as it made traversal, combat, and the experience as a whole all the better. There is a good selection of new and returning weapons on Zeta Halo, and they all have a use - as I've stated the core gameplay mechanics are awesome, and the sandbox here is potentially the best in the entire series. However, with all the toy's Halo infinite goes no where new or exciting, it's setting up the series for a potentially great story, but the plot is very anti-climactic, the missions extremely repetitive, and a world design with no variety what so ever. Infinite did not convince me that it needed to be an open world game, and appears it would have benefited from a classic linear approach. The collectables and side missions all feel like a grocery list of chores to do, and again offer little to nothing new here. If you've played an Open World game in the last 20 years, you know what you're in for. Speaking of collectables, the lack of customization for your multiplayer being unlocked in the campaign is a crime, as the campaign ($60) is detached from the Free to Play multiplayer. The campaign does not feel like $60, and for purchasing it, you receive a few customization options for your multiplayer character - most of which you will not use. Today they also announced that split screen coop is not in development for Infinite now, after promising it in 2017. and leading us on in 2022 that it is in the works. Network Co-Op is still not out of beta a year after launch. 

Speaking of multiplayer---
Halo has never been in a worse state to my knowledge than in infinite. Customization is terrible thanks to lack of freely available options, colors hidden behind a destiny style shader system, and pieces of armor not being interchangeable between ""armor cores"" - not to mention the shaders cannot be used across cores. All of this done in the sake of monetizing EVERYTHING. The map pools are entirely to small a year after launch and game modes are still not all accounted for. Forge after a year is not available, and the desync makes the game unplayable at times. The ranking system counts your MMR in ranked and unranked playlists together, meaning you can play extremely poor in social and then jump into a ranked match with a low MMR and quickly climb the ladder to Onyx rank winning against teams of lower skill level. If you don't do this, prepare for EVERY match being a sweat fest. often coming down to the last score, socially or not. Speaking of social, there is no lobbying and Mic's are turned off by default, you will likely not meet a good group to play with IN GAME and are expected to use discord/other forums to meet players. However, all this being said, the groundwork in terms of gameplay is possibly the best the series has ever been, but their is no content here, the fixes are behind schedule for a year at this point and looking grim for the near future. 

Checklist of things 343i haven't included, have delayed, or lied about including in the game
- Campaign Co-Op was supposed to launch with the game, neither split screen nor network is out a year later.
- Split Screen Co-Op is cancelled after being promised directly from the developers in 2017.
- Infinite being a ""live service"" after a year only 2 ""battlepass"" seasons (normally games have 4 a year), 1 4v4 map, 1 16v16 map added, a few game modes were added that have always been included with previous titles, but it's still missing key modes. Bugs that existed from over a year ago still unaddressed, desync still a major issue.
- No Forge a year out, delayed AGAIN
- No custom games browser
- No matchmaking lobby to meet players and team up
- No pre-match voting
- If you are a free player, a total lack of any customization, the free rewards are mostly terrible, and the event items are missable if your unable to play.
- Theater is broken and saves get corrupted, some replays don't show what happened correctly.
- Developer Roadmaps that are promised but never come, or come out but aren't followed.
- Promised you couldn't buy cosmetics directly, needed to be earned by playing the game (you can buy them in shop)
- No FOMO was promised, well the shop rotates weekly and by season, so you may only have a shot at buying something once. Not only this, but the free event passes that work like a battle pass are driven by FOMO because if you don't finish the track - tough luck!
- No performance based exp per match, meaning no matter how well or poor you did, no matter what metals you earned, you will only get a set amount of exp per match win or loose. Exp is earned by mundane challenges
- Forcing players to play a specific mode, weapon, style with challenges being the only way to get exp toward battle pass and event tracks, mean that you will run into teammates playing poorly because the game is forcing  them into a certain playstyle.
- ""10 year plan"" this game is supposed to last 10 years, no sequels yet we've not seen any slight tease about what's next for the story, and it almost seems unlikely we ever will at this point, as it has been delayed a year, and it's looking like they won't be were they should have been at launch until the 2 year anniversary.

The gunplay, art style, map design, sandbox, etc are all amazing parts of this game; but it shows that this game is only a shell of what it could be. 
I hope over time this game will receive the updates that it deserves.
Functioning custom games, Forge, a progression/career system, more maps, weapons, better customization, more modes, file sharing, and many other things are missing or incomplete... all of which should have been in the game at launch. 

Halo Infinite is very fun and over time will be one of the greatest Halo titles, but it's not there yet.


Edit: The Steam Awards told me to update a review for one of my nominees, so I realized that this one would be perfect. I nominated Halo Infinite for the Labor of Love award this year (2023) and I really think it deserves it. If you look at all the things I listed off at the end of my original review you'll see that *all* of them have been implemented. 2023 has been an amazing year for the game. The new leadership has made so many player-friendly decisions in terms of balance changes, stability fixes, community content, and more. Forge has changed the game. 343 has added 50+ new maps into matchmaking made by community members. This plus Forgeable AI has made this the best Halo for creative players. The new dev maps and modes have been stellar too. Overall, in terms of content, I think Halo Infinite really deserves praise for what 343 has accomplished in 2023. Looking to the future, if they can keep this steady stream of content (events, maps, and modes) along with new sandbox items, Halo Infinite will easily be the best Halo experience in a single game. Now that the community is generating so much content, I think 343 would help the game the most by continuing to work on the netcode and by adding new sandbox items.

The sandbox is great and all weapons are viable (we aint gonna talk about the ravager or disruptor) and most importantly, they are fun to use. The story is a lot better than that in 5 and the multiplayer has had a comeback aswell. Dont listen to the haters and atleast give the game a try.

What makes Infinite special is how fantastic it feels to play. The entire game has a rhythmic flow where each beat is an input by the player: whether you’re jumping, sprinting, sliding, shooting or grappling, it all feels like a choreographed dance with your opponent. Hitting each input at the exact precise time feels so natural, and it’s bolstered by its excellent performance and scalability on PC. I’ve played this on a laptop GTX 1650, and an RTX 3070, and both have managed to achieve at least 60fps on a variety of settings.

The sandbox of Halo creates outstanding depth to the combat, perfectly encapsulating the phrase ‘easy to pick-up, difficult to master’. The grapplehook, for instance, begins as a means to reach high vantage points or escape situations as fast as possible. However, by the end of the campaign you’ll be swinging like Spiderman using momentum to slide through levels at breakneck speed. It requires precision and knowledge to know the exact distance the grapplehook can reach, it makes any terrain in the game explorable, and any combat situation escapable.

The campaign took me around 28 hours to see and do absolutely everything, including wiping every Covenant structure off the face of Zeta Halo. Alongside this journey is your new AI campaign, curiously called simply ‘Weapon’ for almost the entirety of the game. She is, effectively, Cortana v2 and provides a light-hearted relief to the sobriety of Masterchief. However, rest assured, this is through genuinely witty and well-written dialogue rather than quips of tension breaking jokes.

Multiplayer has earned Infinite a mixed reputation among the community. However, it’s important to note the vast majority of player impressions come from the first year of Infinite’s release. Let’s not beat around the bush, Halo Infinite’s multiplayer was severely lacking in content in 2021. It wasn’t strangely until 343 announced mass layoffs that the game started to feature regular content updates. Forge mode, while still technically still in beta (although should have been there on release), has given the community tools to create endless maps and gamemodes. There have also been new official maps, weapons, equipment and more added, as well as a new progression system.

These inclusions really should have existed when Halo Infinite was first released, but better late than never. Theatre mode is, sadly, still not functional which is simply unacceptable given how long ago this game came out. For the most part, Halo Infinite is a 9.5/10 campaign with a multiplayer which, while starting very slow, has evolved into a very respectful and competitive PvP experience. The emphasis on movement and creativity reminds me of genre classics like Quake 3: Arena, while a high time to kill ensures that you’re never truly out in the cold if someone gets the drop on you.

Halo Infinite is an absolutely outstanding game and one of the best FPS games I’ve had the pleasure to play. For me, it represents the peak of the series alongside Halo 3 and Reach, and has better core gameplay loop than both of them. The price is a bit steep, but get this for £30 or under and you’ve got yourself an incredible game. Or, better yet, try out the multiplayer for free.",1650235441,1700839080,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Campaign is pretty okay, lacked a lot of what we were promised which sucked, but the open world stuff and the side content was entertaining. I played the campaign four times through on various difficulties and enjoyed tackling different opponents in different ways each time. Not really a fan of how the story beats are changing the general direction of Halo, but that was set in motion back in Halo 4 & 5 so it's a broken record by now. 

Gunplay? Pretty rewarding and satisfying, I enjoyed some of the new weapons in the Halo universe. The vehicles were alright. The UNSC vehicles have lost their meaty engine sounds which makes it sound like I'm driving a Fiat 500 instead of a Dodge, whereas the Covvie vehicles are just as satisfying to play. Vehicles have really come into their own in an open-world environment, as what you choose to zoom around in will often dictate how you handle patrols, mini-bosses, etc etc. 

I don't think the campaign is worth the price they're asking for, but it's a Halo game, and relatively good fun to play and there's plenty to do on an 'off-day' where you just want to do little tasks or collect audio logs. 

The multiplayer is very 'okay', in my opinion. Nothing wildly special, I know they wanted to pull it back to Halo 3 and the earlier Halo days, but a lot of the playlists feel very dissatisfying, and I didn't find myself playing the MP playlists much at all. I don't need to talk about the micro-transactions, that's beating a dead horse. In all, the game was 'alright', with ups and downs. I kinda wish they'd set the IP down or focus on a different aspect.

Problems?
The campaign is lacking the epic Halo set pieces, diversity in locations and most of it's story. It's open world is incredibly bland and feels like it's there to serve the grapple hook rather than creating an interesting place to explore.

The customisation choices are some of the worst I've seen in any game, charging for colours and locking armour behind cores just screams that you're trying to nickle and dime the players for everything they have. I don't actually mind the shop as a way to sell armour and colours but it should be for things that weren't already in all the previous Halo's from the start. ""Non-canon"" armour sets, fancy armour shaders, emblems and coatings are fine.

heres my top cons:
 -  poor hitbox placement & consistent server lag make for duck/peak headshot glitching is adopted amongst all the good players.
 - cycle out ur fav matchmaking playlist/game modes every week. including ranked.
 - not enough players. especially past midnight and especially if its later than midnight during the work week.

On the topic of campaign, after Halo 5 hoo boy Infinite was a breath of fresh air but I think it has some major problems such as the open world being kind of lacking in different biomes and I felt the story while fairly decent didn't really have a lot to it in the end, felt like act 1 of a much larger story, I wanted more, I wasn't completely satisfied like I was by the end of basically every Halo game with the outlier being Halo 5 of course... God this game was so ripe for campaign dlc and with the firing of like all the story team at 343, it seems heavily unlikely that's a possibility now which is a real shame but all in all pretty decent campaign, just could have been a lot more and multiplayer is the thing that'll keep you coming back to the game anyways so overall I recommend this game!",1700809238,1700809238,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Genuinely enjoy the game, and find the game play to be refreshing as someone who skipped the MCC days. The monetization however is beyond awful. You're gouging the players for so much money to do anything, and the battle pass is the slowest thing to complete, especially when you force people to use guns that don't perform very well.

Correct the monetization. Don't let this game get ruined by your greed.

Ill be honest the first few days were very rough for me cause I would crash almost every game so I couldn't progress with my buddies. But 343 seems to be doing a good job at putting out patches, sent a email to them about the issues and they responded with in 2 hours. There are a few things about the game that pretty much everyone does not like.

The Battlepass is the main issue along with the XP system. You no longer get XP by how many medals you earn or kills you must do the challenges to rank up which does suck and can feel more grindy / repetitive  to some people.

But the gun play and overall feel of the combat of this game is amazing.Weapon sounds great and they feel good . My new favorite is the Gravity Hammer along with the standard assault rifle.

The customization is not Halo Reach Style Sadly but it not terrible, they had to input their own design sadly but it has so much potential. I think SWAT will be a great game-mode along with Snipers. Like I said so much potential to satisfy a very large player base of returning Halo veterans along with new Halo players who are just now experiencing Halo for the first time. Over all I recommend this game and cant wait to see Master Chief return to finish the fight.


(Edited review) So after 2 years after this review above, Halo Infinite has had a lot of changes,updates and game improvements to the multiplayer. Yes I agree that all these new features we are getting should've been at launch 100%, but now that its here and they still have more plans to only make forge better than what it is now. Firefight is the best its ever been in any halo game. 10/10 game. If halo died for you when this came out I don't blame you for not touching it.

With Reach being my personal favorite I don't think anything can top that for me, but that doesn't mean I don't know of it's problems. Here are the pro's and con's of this wonderful game.

Pro's:
- Fantastic sandbox. Not that many weapons compared to some other games, but for the most part every gun has a distinctive role in the sandbox. In campaign, the weapons that people would consider the weaker ones of multiplayer (things like the Ravager) are using their pre nerf functionality from the initial first flight, so the Ravager is actually quite effective against the Banished. Other weapons like the Stalker Rifle when used in campaign is essentially hitscan, so as fun as it is to use now, sniper jackals make a return too :(

- Campaign is amazing. What a way to bring people that felt alienated from Halo 5's story back to Halo. A fantastic sandbox that works surprisingly well in an open world setting, a story that grips people in (albeit with it's on issues as any game has, no game is perfect), and what seems to be leaving the door open to some post launch dlc, a first for the Halo franchise.

- Multiplayer is just as fun as the older Bungie games. Like many others I also had my issues with Halo 4 and 5 multiplayer, more or less with 5 being targeted towards competitive play (I have played Halo since Halo 2 on the OG Xbox and despite that amount of time, plus me being a very competitive player when it comes to other games, I have never really liked how ranked play works in Halo. I especially don't agree with BR starts as I think the sandbox suffers from you starting with a weapon you can kill anyone from any range at.) Standard loadouts across the board, nothing too overbearing in terms of movement unless you pick it up on the map yourself, and the groundwork layed to have some great custom games in the future once Forge and a custom games browser is added. Seriously great multiplayer.

Con's:
- Monetization. Seriously, the store and customization of your spartan in this game is atrocious. If you have been following Halo at all since the launch of the multiplayer back in mid November then you have heard all about the terrible progression/customization this game has. Unable to swap armor across cores? Item's costing 2-3 times more than they should and being locked behind bundles so you can't even buy the one specific piece you want? Battlepass progression not being performance based? What a mess this is, although they did make those 3rd week changes to help with progression from offering more front up xp from playing a few daily matches, but they still have a long way to go.

- Gameplay is pretty good for the most part, but that isn't to say it's without it's issues. Some guns like the Ravager, Pulse Carbine, Stalker Rifle (maybe i'm just bad with this one) feel underwhelming to use. Ravager I think should be reverted back to how it worked in the first flight as it doesn't really serve a purpose in the sandbox right now outside of using it for challenge kills. Same goes for the Pulse Carbine, but i'm not sure if this was changed from previous flights or not. Tracking should be sped up on the projectiles and maybe a slight damage increase as well, unsure on the damage part though. Stalker Rifle, doesn't feel like a gun that belongs here as it's role as a DMR doesn't really make it feel like a DMR. Having non hitscan functionality to it, or at least having the projectile feel too slow that it's really noticeable, plus having drop in the projectile too makes it really feel like it isn't serving the purpose it's supposed to. I cannot for the life of me use this gun in multiplayer at all. Again, maybe I'm just bad with it, but having played 300 multiplayer games so far and only ever picking it up to, again, use for challenges kinda tells me something about it.

Some Vehicles feel out of place as well, the Chopper takes a couple seconds to get up to speed when using it, the weapons on it feel underwhelming, and the way it controls is kinda of trash too. Not to mention the fact that it can't destroy vehicles from running into them anymore... I think this would have been a scenario where if they just copy pasted how the chopper worked in Halo 3, everyone would have been fine with that. The Ghost feels fine to me, same with the Warthog, Razorback, Mongoose/Gungoose feel like they could probably have a little less stiff turning on them. As for air vehicles the Banshee controls pretty awkwardly with how floaty it feels for an air vehicle. Makes sense, but also I would like to see its movement be more adjusted to that of Halo: Reach's Banshee. Also the damage of the regular and alt fire for it seem weak as well. For the Wasp I think this is pretty fine as well except it feels a little too easy to kill. Also, I notice this a lot when doing dogfights against other Wasps, but it looks like rockets tend to hit when they very clearly are still floating in the air and haven't hit the Wasp yet. Maybe it's the hitbox is bigger than the actual vehicle, maybe their is lag involved (which I doubt as this seems to happen almost every time) or something else entirely, but something worth noting.

Conclusion:
All in all I could probably make this review longer with more positives and negatives I have to say about the game, but I think I have shared enough of this. At the end of the day, the gameplay, campaign, and multiplayer as a whole is some of the best offered in a Halo game to date. Monetization is atrocious and something really need to be done about it, after all, I don't think anyone in the Halo community asked for this game to cost $1B to make, or to have the multiplayer be free to play. I would think most people, myself included, would have rather paid $80 up front if it meant Campaign and multiplayer being part of that as well as not having nearly as an insulting storefront. They made the game as expensive as they did when no one wanted it that way, and now they try to pass the expenses down to the players because they never stopped to think if it was something we wanted. We wanted a fun core sandbox something more like the Bungie games and less hyper lethal weapons like Halo 5. Yes, we did get that, but what did it cost us? Continue to speak with your wallet and perhaps they will continue to listen to us.

I also wrote this post Jason Schreier article about this game's troubled development. Yes it is possible that not everything in that article is 100% true, but I believe it to be true. As such, that tells us that the reason the game is in the state that it is, has to do with such a troubled development of the game with a lot of it being scrapped/hard to develop for due to limitations with the new engine not allowing them to do everything they want right away, and need to create the tools from scratch to do things they didn't anticipate would be needed right away. That doesn't excuse the state that the game is in in terms of the negatives, just adds some more insight in to how we got here. With that being said though, it is a miracle the good parts of the game are as good as they are based on what has happened here. Interesting read if you want to know more about this games development.

I'm leaving the rest of the review untouched from my original posting. 

Honestly, as a long time fan of the Halo series since my early childhood, it genuinely pains me to not recommend a halo game but from how 343 treats the Halo IP and community I cannot in good faith recommend this game. But why?

Firstly the good elements of the game, this is a very pretty game, I love traversing the open world and coming across say a burnt out valley full of destroyed UNSC vehicles or a massive mountainous valley, is just beautiful. The open world, while small, is detailed and has lots of little secrets be it a little story in the environment, a upgrade core or even just a random power weapon. And the final good point is the core gameplay, it feels amazing getting in an intense firefight and moving around using the terrain to your advantage and having your marines operating as a unit with you. And that's it, that's all I like about this game.

The negatives is what in the hell is 343 doing, we waited since 2015 with the trainwreck that is Halo 5 for this? A lackluster online with less gamemodes than Halo 3 from 2007, I think even less gamemodes than Halo 2 from 2004? We seriously don't have infection as a gamemode? As you can tell, the lack of gamemodes online is literally taking the piss but oh no, they make sure that their microtransaction store is fully stocked. The maps are okay but nothing to write home about and honestly is a joke. What's upsetting is this is the most fun gameplay for an online halo game I've had since Reach back in 2010, it's satisfying, fluid and genuinely flows well.
As for the progression on this game, holy jesus I cannot believe this, it's a literal balls of a system. Firstly it is greedy as hell, constantly demanding money, you to buy battlepasses, armour cores, bloody colours for your armour, weapon skins, vehicle skins etc. It is insane that you can make Halo 5's system look night and day by comparison, sure Halo 5 had lootboxes, but at least you can earn them ingame without buying shit. This game does not deserve your money for its online. There is more I would discuss for the online but honestly I'm putting the effort 343 put into this game and just not bothering. 
As for the campaign, it's just kinda dull. Now 343 have some credit to be given here, they've made Chief himself again. He's back to a stoic badass who breaks alien backs and has a few funny 1 liners, however the campaign has a few major issues, such as;
1) The pilot is a whiney complaining asshole who is not charming or funny and has a 180 on his opinion on Chief towards the end of the game despite spending the whole game ragging on him for going into danger, by then deciding to follow him into more danger.
2) Cortana or the Weapon is just annoying as hell, a very niave ""uwu quirky"" kinda vibe and it's honestly just a pain to listen to her half the time. What's more annoying is Chief in the campaign has a failsafe to terminate her cause of the OG Cortana going rogue, and she gets offended by this and has a huff, like... she does realise it's a failsafe...?
3) Escherum, the main villain, has no damn presence. The whole game it's ""oh our duel will be legendary, set a fire in your heart spartan"" and while yes is awesome dialogue, it means nothing. Atriox kicks your ass at the start, this is Atriox's army, and 343 decide to fanfic the game with their bigger badder villain who doesn't earn it? If they changed it so he was one of Atriox's top men and he helped destroy the Infinity and in the opening he beats your ass with Atriox, maybe kills a spartan, I'd get it a lot more.
4) The level design for the forerunner stuff is just boring as hell. Bungie in their hayday made forerunner levels imposing and monolithic, sure elements repeated but it was visually interesting. I barely remember any rooms in this game but Bungie era Halo is seared into my brain. However, I will say, 343 are improving when you compare it to Halo 5's forerunner bullshit.
5) The main antagonist after Escherum, that weird tentacle floaty bitch who hates forerunners, has no presence, even less than monkey boy. Her whole goal is to expose the crimes of the Forerunners and claim some auditorium and I'm not gonna lie, I haven't a fecking clue what she wants or is on about. It's classic 343 trying to make a super complicated plot with threads and details that nobody cares about.

Overall I cannot recommend this game, it is bursting to the seams with issues. However I will say, if you just want a fun campaign to sink some time into blowing up Banished in satisfying gameplay, I would say get it on sale. The core gameplay of the campaign is fun, I genuinely enjoy it but the online being a barren wasteland of content, the campaign having a convoluted nonsensical story with dogwater characters other than Chief himself lead to this being the most disappointing game I've played in this past year, and its taken a while to come to terms with that. 343, you've shot your last shot with me and many other Halo fans, hope pissing on Halo's legacy was worth it",1660173532,1700734772,False,13,0,0.642431378364562988,0,True,False,False

The shop is slowly sliding back to what it used to be which isn't great but I'll let that slide. The absolute biggest issue in this game right now is the SBMM. It is absolutely horrendous and starts making the game a chore rather than fun. It doesn't make me want to end on a win and only makes me want to stop playing. However, I still have high hopes for this game and love to play even with terrible SSBM.
Updating for end of season three and 8 times the play time: This game continues to get better and better and I can not recommend this game enough. Also, Microsoft can suck my *** for screwing over this games initial vision and development
Its fun to play need I say more. My absolute favorite campaign and the multiplayer is miles above MCC in terms of player count. This game is only getting better and I am excited to see where this game leads us. To be fair, there are still some issues, such as monetization issues (though not blizzard levels bad) and some technical and design issues, many if not most can be attributed to Microsoft, understaffed, and Halo 5 technical debt.

Definitely has a solid movement. Sandbox isn't bad, but it could use more weapons based on or ported from previous Halo games.

Campaign: Was pretty good, definitely different from previous games, but did enjoy. Definitely was more fun with a friend in CO-OP. I did 100% the campaign in the first 24 hours the game was out (took that day and the next off from work to play). I like the idea of unlocks being around the map, just wish they were more special items like maybe a H2 or H3 helmet (like recon or Mark V or Mark VI).

Multiplayer: When you are playing more fun game modes like infection/big team infection or custom games, it definitely is a lot of fun. Can't get around the current SBMM that is used. Definitely needs some tweaks but can definitely be fun.

Custom Game: Forge and the new forge-able AI has given new life to Custom Games. New campaign-like experiences and fun maps like tower defense are now possible. Definitely worth a try on it own.

Customization: Definitely have made many improvements to this and hopefully will continue to get more. Biggest complaint with it is there isn't enough armor or things to unlock by playing modes like Campaign or getting achievements like there was in previous games. Give me more reason to search through the campaign or dig through a map to find a hidden skull on each map or something like H3 DLC maps had.

Pass System: Definitely the best system out of gaming today. I am not a huge fan of the here is a list of items go through it. I did like what they did with MCC. You work through the items, but out of the 10 you can pick as you go. I will give them props though for implementing a system where if you buy the pass, it doesn't go away. You can finish the pass at any point if you bought it.

Store: This is probably the worst part. Items all are in bundles. You can't get a single item from a bundle if you only like one item. Prices of things are too high. I feel it could be a bit better by letting players buy single items (emblems, helmets, shoulders (as a set), chest, etc), and giving them prices reflective of the time. 

<Item>: <Common>/<Rare>/<Epic>/<Legendary>
Emblems: 25/50/75/100, Helmets: 125/175/225/275, etc.

Another gripe could be the coatings. I get they want to monetize a free multiplayer and game for basically customization, however, paying for colors I feel is not okay. I don't agree with that move, however, its what is there. If it is going to stay I would have preferred or like to see the ability to rotate the color palette possibly. So the center circle color stays the same, but the colors on the out side can be rotated and switch positions on the spartan. Some combinations wouldn't look good. That's okay. It up to the players on if a look is good or not. That doesn't effect gameplay. Last thing with coating is have a wear option/toggle. I like the clean spartan look not the battle warn most coatings have. Allowing the player to select a scratches layer or turn up or down the damage of the coating would be nice.

We all know Halo Infinite didn't have the best launch. From the delays to the management and developer turnover to the slow content release schedule... to the engine and netcode issues.
But if you haven't played recently, [b]Halo Infinite is in a really good spot now.[/b]
343i has continued stumbling these last couple years, but they've slowly (but surely) been figuring it out, fixing things up, and giving us some awesome content.
At the time of writing, the ""Halo 3 Refueled"" event is running and it is ADDICTIVE. They just swapped it to AR/BR starts per player request and have been tweaking it with other feedback. Some great classic maps (plus the ones in Squad Battle) are here and it's a lot of fun, if challenging SBMM/EOMM.
A whole netcode rewrite is in the works, and more content is on the way.
But the custom games... the Forge creations... You can play entire Halo CE campaign missions with like 12 people! It's a blast! Firefight is incredible, the community BR mode is a lot of fun. There's just so much great gameplay time to be had for the low cost of free, it's really worth giving it another go.

Some stuff is cross core and they say they'll do more, but the vast majority of the customization is still behind paywalls and the cash shop. 6.5/10

The campaign is fun though. Definitely better than the hot garbage 343 made in Halo 5. Unfortunately at the time of writing this there aren't any more plans for continuing the campaign story.

 So Halo Infinite.. the first time I loaded, I COULD NOT Walk AWAY. Beat the game on the hardest difficulty, then re-played again. LOVED Every MINUTE.
As it does, life resumed, and I had to put my efforts and focus elsewhere. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago.
Halo Infinite now takes 6-10 minutes to load (First load) and I've NO interest in A. waiting that long to play ANYTHING as this isnt 1999, and im not on a Playstation. or Atari (Im more than aware these systems are long after 1999.
Yet another sterling example of how multiple companies (Nvidia @ $1.2tr) Bungie (now Sony(Shocker....))@ $3.7 billion. Lastly everyones favorite company...windows ( intentionally lower-cased) who has been garbage since  Win 2k (SP3) valued @ $2.81 trillion, not surprising, Halo is now pretty much unplayable. Even on the Shit-Box Series V or C or whatever the F their on.
How Nvidia slipped a patch SO detrimental to the game, passed QC / QA, is IN NO way a shock to me now, after the debacle that is MWIII ('Prefontaine' zombies who run 4.4's) But what can be say for Blizzard that hasnt been said about a Wal-Mart bathroom, bombed out, and should be passed over. That however is a review for another day. 
As I am now perma-removing Halo Ephemeral and MWIII ( the re-re-release) or whatever they are on, I hope each and everyone of you have a MIRACULOUS holiday!

Just buy the campaign when it goes on sale or buy a cheap steam key online don't pay full price for it like I did. When it really comes down to it it is a huge upgrade from halo 5 and halo 4 in terms of story telling and gameplay. But thats not to say it doesn't have its issues for example : Desync , hits not registering properly , lack of content as well as a myriad of other issues I can't be bothered explaining. 

Though for what you get it is a decent product , just don't come in here expecting classic halo this ain't it. 

I recommend playing the campaign and avoiding the multiplayer for the mean time unless you're like me and don't want to deal with fucking FOMO . 

Ultimately it is up to you vote with your wallet or if you're a freeloader just play the multiplayer cause you know......free to play am I right or am I right?

Halo Infinite's Multiplayer is good all around, and since it's free, it has no real competitor in terms of how much it offers. But because it's free to play, options are limited on what you can earn without forking over a dollar. My recommendation is to buy a $10 battle pass, and use the currency from the pass to buy the next and so on. But there are plenty of playlists to choose from, and the playlists are varied.

Common complaints:
- Desync and Network issues (343 put this as their #1 priority to fix as it requires reworking the network entirely)
- Many Weapons capable of EMPing Vehicles (Haven't had to deal with it much personally)
- Shop items overpriced (They sell items in bundles and not individually at a cheaper price. This likely won't change)
- Custom Game EXP is nice, but doesn't give much (120 Exp max per custom game, while the average matchmaking exp you gain varies between 300 - 500, this isn't including double exp boosts)

I'll be honest, Halo has been playing catch up for about two years, and now does it feel like a complete game. What I want to see if more content to be added, a reworked network, and for more items to be added to the sandbox...and campaign dlc if possible.

But if you're only interested in the multiplayer, even with the downsides, this is an easy recommendation for a F2P FPS game. Unlike MWIII that wants you to pay $70 for an updated multiplayer and a terrible campaign in comparison.",1700668262,1700668262,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Outside of the story line, I can't say it's a complex open world type game. Traversing the open world and it's content is pretty simple and straightforward, but fun to explore and play. I hope they come out with more soon since it's been out so long now. Big Team Battle is usually my go to, but lately matchmaking is eh. Out of the last 15 BTB games I've played, we won twice and I quit twice due to spwn camping and being over powered. It's not usually like that, but the past few days has been for some reason. I enjoy a good game over a 'win', but lately we just get stomped on. With that, it is just BTB. It's a social mode and there's things out of the developers control obviously. I'm not a big fan of the vehicle drops in BTB. Most of the time they drop something useless like a chopper, rocket hog, or gungoose in the middle. It should be something worth fighting for if it's going to be there IMO. I find people tend to just skew the middle vehicle so no one has it. Vehicle drops for the teams is usually the same situation, minus deliberately destroying the vehicle. Plus, vehicle drops are usually out in the open in front of the bases. Not sure why. It makes more sense to drop them behind your base where it's more secure. It's game over if the other team has a scorpion and then steals yours. Which I've seen happen a lot. Not so much due to not being able to disable/destroy the stolen vehicle, but I'll pull the scoreboard up and half the team has quit lol. So there's no chance really. I notice small tweaks, in particular vehicle strength, power, ect.. Coming from more of a social player standpoint, multiplayer is usually fun.

It's good now. Campaign co-op, better customization, a proper progression system, the best iteration of Forge we've seen yet (there's scripting! and PvE AI! someone literally recreated the entire Silent Cartographer level from Halo CE!), custom games browser. Although I wish there were a few more classic Halo guns in the sandbox, 343 has crafted a fresh new take on the classic sandbox that works quite well.

After two years of updates, it's a blast to play. I just wish it would have launched in its current state. Halo deserves better treatment from the suits at Microsoft.

Original review posted below for posterity:

[i]The campaign is really fun. Gameplay and mechanics are pretty solid.

UI is a hot mess. Progression system is just bad. I wish there were no unlockable items in this game, and then I might be able to enjoy it. 

It's a shame because so many of the cosmetics are actually quite nice, especially when compared to the H4 and H5 stuff. But they're either exorbitantly expensive or locked behind hundreds of asinine challenges in the battle pass. Leveling up the battle pass is so frustrating it has turned me away from the game. 

Almost 10 months post launch and there is no co-op, no forge. Boatloads of new cosmetics though, both in the battlepass and in the shop. 

This game reeks of  bad decisions made by leadership at 343 and Microsoft. Clearly there are competent devs at 343, who I can tell love the game and want it to succeed, but Microsoft has gotta get their $$$ first.[/i]",1656220459,1700634457,True,0,0,0.525862038135528564,4,True,False,False

Some being desync, really weak vehicles, hit detection, weapon sandbox, SBMM, etc. Not a single word on where assassinations are, playable elites are probably never coming, and monetization is still hindering the armor customization of this game. Hey at least the art style is great.

Campaign is still pretty fun to play, wish they didn't go the open world style but it could've been done worse. Story was okay considering they had to come up with the best they could after Brian Reed completely murdered Halo 5's story. 

Poor devs were hindered by terrible management, hopefully we see a turn-around soon. Probably won't considering Microsoft but who knows. Anyways the live service model is killing modern gaming and it's probably here to stay.

2023 Multiplayer Review:

Despite and incredibly underwhelming launch, I believe it is safe to say Halo Infinite has bounced back. Virtually every issue the game had at launch has been addressed, ranging from an incredible variety of maps and modes to a now very flexible customization system that is still undergoing updates to be even more flexible. While the weapon and gadget variety has only seen a handful of additions since launch, all of them are unique, fun to use, and well balanced. Unfortunately, 343i has yet to introduce any new vehicles or add customization for over half of its arsenal. 

2023 Campaign Review: 

Halo Infinite's campaign is very underwhelming in terms of game play, but excellent in it's character development. It may not be the direction most people would want for this franchise, but in terms of writing, it was executed very well within the present limitations presented by its game play design/sandbox. If the story of Halo is what intrigues you the most, then this game is an exposition lovers dream. If you care more about game play, then wait for a decent sale, as the loop is nearly the same the entire way through. With its open world design, it fails to have any set pieces or explosive moments like you would see in past titles, making it visually boring despite having finally nailed a worthy art style for the series. Even on legendary, the campaign still feels incredibly easy by comparison to any other Halo game, especially in co-op. It is worth noting that this game still does not have split-screen, despite being the first promise ever made for Halo Infinite, before we even knew the title.

2023 Overall Review:

- Excellent visual art style and graphics, a new best for the series.
- Incredibly entertaining multiplayer with great variety. 
- Very well balanced sandbox with fun to use weapons, vehicles, and gadgets.
- Good armor customization, serviceable weapon customization.
- Underwhelming campaign game play, good story and character arcs.
- Egregious monetization in some places, very generous and new standard setting in others.
- Intuitive updates to Forge by comparison to past titles.
- No split screen co-op (But it does have online co-op)",1700626242,1700626242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Old Review:
100 Hours later and a few updates. The game is now how it should have been at launch. The seasons and long time between updates is terrifying boring. For comparison OW is currently on season 3 and it released in Oct 22. We are not even in season 3 yet its been out for 11 months more. With this current update of community made maps, it has shown that they are starting to listen to the community a lot more. Lower prices in the store as well is always welcome. This is hopefully the start of a better game and company. 

However, I am unable to give this game a positive review. There is no current play for DLC for the (60$) campaign. There is still not cross core items besides visors. I will never change the review until they fix that and possibly if they do not add more ways to customize colors. I am still shocked they removed basic free functions from previous games. This would have been a great indie dev game. Not a billion dollar industry AAA game. Overall 5/10 game.

[b][strike]No.[/strike]Probably?[/b] 
[strike]As much as I would love to tell everyone that this is the next step forward for this franchise, I 100% recommend skipping this for at least another year (unless you're seriously invested in the cosmetics but we'll get to that) and instead spending $20 less on MCC. While MCC isn't getting much content anymore, what it has will satisfy you in spades compared to this.[/strike]
As of now, I'd probably say that it's better than MCC to some degree. I can solidly recommend it thanks to numerous changes below, but I'd honestly say both are of equal recommendation.

[h1]Campaign[/h1]
[b]It's.. fine? Could be a lot worse.[/b]
+ The story is serviceable, the characters feel great, and the music is really good. 
? It's open world rather than level to level. You have a mix of open-world based missions and a decent amount of standard Halo levels, though it takes a little too much from CE rather than the entire series.
? Data pads are the only form of world-building the game has, so I really hope you're not a new Halo player otherwise you'll be extremely confused about literally everything going on.
- If you were expecting any further continuity with Halo 5, you'll be extremely dissapointed. Halo 5 barely matters but also kind of does, because new Halo players are probably not going to understand any prior references to other Halo games (which this one does a lot for the sake of references.)
- If you were expecting the plot to go forward *at all* currently, you'll also be missed. Ontop of 343i doing that wonderful thing of setting up a villain or multiple villains and then killing them off just as swiftly, we also go literally nowhere. The same few things you know at the beginning of the game are the same few things you'll know at the cliffhanger.
[b]Campaign: 7.5/10[/b]


[h1]Gameplay / Multiplayer[/h1]

[b]No, that ""Mixed"" tag isn't for nothing. This is currently the largest mixed back we've ever had.[/b]

+ Core gameplay is extremely solid. The feel is there. I *can* have a fun time with this.
+ The return of equipment from Halo 3 is great and adds a lot of variety to the gunplay.
? The maps are.. fine. There's a staggeringly low amount but (for the most part) what we have is fairly solid. 
[b]2023: We have quite a few more maps now, so the actual map pool is solid now. I'd still say they're just solid, but there's a map for everyone here.[/b]
? Whether or not you like this is entirely up to you but, the game is heavily balanced towards e-sports play. Halo 5 was done the same way so, take that as you will.
[b]2023: Still holds true, but they're doing better to listen to both scopes nowadays.[/b]
- Weapon selection is cramped, despite the number of weapons. Some new weapons are hybrids of like, 2 or 3 weapons from the past that personally should have just stayed 2 separate weapons, while some weapons feel genuinely useless in the core loop. There's a lot of new or exchanged weapons rather than the iconic lot, with fan favorites like the DMR and Magnum being absent in favor of the Commando and Sidekick which feel generally worse compared to their assumed precursors. I know this was done for a ""balanced sandbox"" but I don't care for it. Just give me all the weapons, and let map makers decide what they want to use.
[b]2023: Beyond the addition of the Bandit and its changes (EVO) included, this mostly holds true still. The Bandit (i.e. new DMR) is easily the best addition to the sandbox.[/b]
- Progression is a filthy mess that HEAVILY relies on your wallet. While the Battle Pass has free items during the Season period, almost all of the free items are either higher up than they should be or aren't worth it. On top of this, several items are tossed onto the store which has a laughably small amount of items each week compared to other F2P shooters and you'll sometimes be found buying entire bundles for only a couple of items that you actually want. 
- (cont.) Challenges are the ONLY method of progressing the BP. Your actual match statistics are so worthless, you don't even have a Service Record to see them. Unlike MCC, you can only progress the BP system by completing your weekly challenges, which can range from braindead to absolutely frustratingly specific. If you don't get the right match or the right weapon, you're gonna be stuck with that challenge unless you want to spend a precious challenge swap to be stuck with another of the same stink. You can be the absolute trash of a match, but you still get more XP overall if you got your good-boy objectives done.
[b]2023: I can confirm this is pretty much 100% rectified. Challenges are more accessible and abundant, XP is actually based on match performance, Battle Passes are smaller and streamlined, free items are more accessible; it's not perfect but they listened and cleaned up. Good job, 343i. Keep it up.[/b]
- Seasons have currently been 6 MONTHS rather than the 3 month periods we were promised. That means 2 seasons a year relatively. Ontop of this, events are laughably sparse. Good luck getting like more than 2 or 3 unique events across 6 months. This also means content drops are currently stagnant and very few and far between. If you miss these events by the way, don't expect to see their items return. (This includes the store rolls, by the way.)
[b]2023: See the above comment, they've pretty much fixed this too. Seasons are coming out on schedule, and Events are basically mini-Battle Passes.[/b]
- Fan-favorite gamemodes such as Forge and Firefight are nowhere to be found. They're supposedly working on them but we've yet to see official footage. Content creation for this game is essentially nonexistent, especially since Theater is broken as well. More inclusive gamemodes such as Infection, Assault, and Grifball are offline only so.. good luck.
[b]2023: Forge, Firefight, and Infection are all here and are amazing to play. Other stuff is always coming.[/b]
[b]Overall: 5/10[/b]

[b]Overall (2023): 8/10[/b]

[h1]Summary[/h1]
[strike]I cannot recommend this to anyone at all, in its current state. Halo Infinite has way too many issues that, with simple fixes, could easily put this up as a favorite game. I'm going to still trench through it, but I can't easily say anyone else should.[/strike]
I'd recommend it now. Obviously there are problems, but they hear them out and have them on a list for fixing.

Cheating still occurs very frequently and just leaves a sour taste for the game. I've been playing Halo since it was originally released back on the OG Xbox, and even Halo 2 didn't have this many cheaters.

UPDATE: As of 8/10/2022 cheaters are still overwhelming online play, making it no fun what-so-ever. I was hoping for this issue to be resolved, or even have something in place like they did back in Halo 2 where they would get kicked from the match after 10 seconds...but I have seen no change. Looks like this will be the end of Halo.

UPDATE 11.16.23: Decided to give Halo another shot after it's been some time, and it seems a vast majority of the cheaters have either been caught or moved onto other games.

There's content, new gamemodes, new maps, classic remakes, AI in Forge, people playing, custom lobbies out the wazoo.
A couple years ago I wouldn't have believed it if you told me. Now this game is actually a fun fully featured game.

Ranked isn't terrible, and apparently there's a rework to the biggest bane of this game: the netcode coming at some point.

What a time to be a Halo fan. It is sad that this game was tossed by the wayside by microsoft, it really is a banger now.

We also have cross-core customization, which isn't all encompassing unfortunately but is as much as the customization system allows.

This isn't all butterfiles and rainbows though, the shop pricing scheme is ridiculous, with what you get for your money being insulting.
Don't get me wrong, the quality of the cosmetics are nice but 25$ nice.. not quite sure.


If you are still apprehensive about trying this game based on what you heard a year or even two years ago, this game is entirely different from what it once was.


Old reviews below:
[spoiler]EDIT: (December Drop Pod for Winter Update:
The Forge, Campaign Co-op, Customs Browser, Maps, gamemodes and partial progression fixes are finally enough for me to say there's enough here now. This is more or less how the game should have launched.

Networking is improved (same with most of the desync issues), Mouse and Keyboard feels far better now. We also get red reticles now too! 

I actually am enjoying shooting people in this game and not wanting to punch a hole in my monitor!

Custom Games are fantastic and some of the earliest maps for Infinite look fantastic, I've already seen and played some pretty wacky gametypes too.

Match XP is now awarded and gives you a passive way to just unlock stuff.. finally.

All seasonal cores are now available to all in addition to some limited starter colours available for players to use.

If you tried it before and hated Infinite, I HEAVILY suggest giving Infinite another shot. There's endless entertainment with Custom Games.

[strike]EDIT (Season 2 update):
Mouse aiming feels a bit tighter, desync is still very prevalent and feels unchanged, many weapons were nerfed (including the Mangler), some jumps have been removed (one on Live Fire), and sliding has been nerfed. But we get two new maps, and some new gamemodes.. so it's not all bad? I'm probably not going to play this much.

Great game, deal breaking issues.

TLDR: If you enjoy your sanity and not having your skill shat on by bad networking and performance issues, avoid until fixed.

First the good:

The gameplay and multiplayer design is fantastic. Halo is back to being a sandbox shooter, with all sorts of chaos you can cause with interactions between pickups and different weapons.
Movement is what I would expect, and feels kind of like a modern Halo 3, with a minor sprint and sliding mechanics. 
Master movement and you can bounce around, crouch jump and launch yourself to become a menace to other players aiming for your head.

Maps are pretty solid, if not safely designed with not many risks taken. Visually the game looks like the correct blend between new and legacy; which luckily was their intention.

Now the bad:

I love the gameplay, on LAN it feels awesome and really is a sweet Halo game. However, we don't all play on LAN together do we?

Client-Server de-sync ruins this game entirely, as you will question almost every death you have unless it is obvious. 
Being shot behind walls, phasing through players and getting back-smacked from the front, trading constantly, repulsor spinning you 180 degrees due to client-server desync, etc.

Just a few issues that cause me headaches:
Floaty mouse-aim, lack of communication, low performance on high end hardware (map specific), network desync, lack of region selection, cluttered interface, the list goes on.

As an Onyx player, the matchmaking up until the last patch was attrocious and made me swore off playing Ranked entirely due to frustration.
I suspect the rank difference issue has been addressed, but at this point hoping for anything is just not worth the investment. 

On top of ranked games with players in completely separate ranks, getting matched into Australian servers constantly due to my rank 
(context: I am in southeastern Canada), with no toggles to avoid that is unacceptable for any 'ranked' experience.

For the cherry on top, there's little to no big picture plan as far as the community is aware and issues that are present since launch are still not addressed.
Unfortunately the only experiences you can access are the ones with these issues.
With little to no custom games going on and a lack of a Forge mode, get frustrated and be ready to go find another game because you can't just play something fun at the moment.

I want to love this game, I love the gameplay, but the rest of the issues just leave a bad taste in my mouth, and frustrate me to no end. [/strike][/spoiler]",1646103402,1700598098,True,0,0,0.501599133014678955,0,True,False,False

PC performance is significantly better as of the Season 4 patch, and the game feels good on MnK now too. The store has been reworked so that you no longer need to wait for items you want to rotate back in, allowing you to purchase bundles directly from the customization menus. Career rank was also added in Season 4, giving players something to work towards outside of the battle passes. Season 5 is also adding some of the biggest features the community has asked for, like cross core on some armor coatings and all helmets (with more coatings and armor pieces on the way), and Firefight. They also finally gave us the ability to use campaign AI in Forge mode, something that we have been asking for since Forge launched with Halo 3 in 2007. Career rank finally has armor rewards as well, offering you Master Chief's full armor set as a kit for reaching max rank.

Overall though the issues with lack of content have been resolved, creating a very solid PvP experience. The current PvE options are finally starting to shape up, with an official Firefight playlist dropping later in Season 5 and community made Firefight and Campaign experiences available to players via the amazing Forge community.

I'll be honest in that I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign experience - interesting and memorable characters, cool locations, and a solid take on open world gameplay combined with a linear story. I would love to see some expansions on the story and the world. The FOB based progression along with the unlocks at those FOBs based on side ""quests"" was a nice touch. The grapple hook adds so much to gameplay and how to approach situations, its just stupid fun IMHO, and lots of times ends in hilarious results when it goes wrong.

Multiplayer is fun IMO, I don't find it as annoying as some of the latest installments in the series. Halo 3 and Reach (give or take the armor abilities in Reach) will always be the golden days of Halo MP I think, and there's no good way to capture that lightning in a bottle again. I will say Infinite MP is the most fun I've had in an arcade shooter MP in awhile and fits typical Halo MP styles in that power weapons and/or precision weapons rule the field. 

I love the customization of my Spartan in MP, however as someone who played the game at launch, and picked it back up later, it's a bit overwhelming with all the armor cores, and how to acquire specific pieces. I always loved Reach's style of armor progression, and this is similar, albeit a bit more convoluted and heavily laden with microtransactions. 

Overall, as a long time Halo fan, I enjoy the Infinite experience.

Also, and this is more of a personal prefence, the bullet magnetism on controller will not prioritize headshots unlike every single past title. Controller just feels off still, but that's just me. Overall the game is much more complete, and custom games is alot of fun. Def give this game another shot.

This is best played with a squad of 3 or more because nothing screams nostalgia more than you riding in a warthog with the squad once again. The Weapons, the spartan cosmetics all scream original and i cant wait to see what 343i has in store for this game

(Campaign Review) HOLY S%$# I LOVE THIS CAMPAIGN! This has managed to fix a bunch of problems that Halo 5 introduced and fixed them to best fit the story. Focusing on The Chief himself was the best choice they could of done. It has all those magical moments from the first 3 Halos. I couldn't get enough of it. The story was inticing and it kept me at the edge of the seat to whatever happens to the new duo. This is on track to being one of the best campaigns. With the main theme of the story focused on Acceptance it makes you cry everytime you hear Chief talk and have flashbacks. 

(Cons) Optimization can be wonk at times. Game tends to crash if you try to grapple melee and die.

Post Season 1 Review: The Gameplay shines when you have the moments and you can enjoy a solid combat loop with the encounters changing ever so slightly. But the Lack of Content is whats going to strangle this game and suffocate the player base. No CO-OP, No Forge, No Firefight and Customs now starting to work for people. 6 month seasons with only 2 Maps and they cant be force selected to play them so people can try them at least instead of being just put into the map pool. No new weapons but new armor cores and monetization. Please 343i, let me love this game like i loved halo reach.

post update: They have spit in our faces to sell micro transactions. cutting all the things that made halo great in the first place in favor of what the popular kids are doing instead of doing what made halo itself. Halo inst meant for us anymore. Its all corporate now.

Entire features of this game are still missing over a year after its release such as infection, a designated objectives game mode, racing, VIP, firefight or invasion, battle in my big team battle, etc.

There is no hope of a proper progression system, matchmaking can still lag during the low hours of the day, and only recently has forge and a customs browser been added. Any decent looking armor customisation is still locked behind a paywall leave every character looking ugly or an easy to spot sellout.

To unlock things for free you have to grind weekly challenges which you are restricted to progress through four at a time. Thankfully 343 seems to have heard the outcry and have made them less specific, but take that with a grain of salt as I've only played multiplayer for two days in the last year.

There is a serious lack of new maps or game modes, and any new maps they have added lack the memorable aspects that made Halo 3's Guardian or Halo 2's Lockout instantly recognisable and beloved. They're more of that symmetrical, competitive based layout that we've all seen before and I'm frankly tired of.

I've also jumped back into a fresh campaign and somehow it has devolved since I last played. I remember the game looking beautiful, but now textures can look like they came from the PS1 era, which is insulting to the PS1. I've had things deload, the second boss teleport on occasion (and no it's not because he's invisible, I've seen him fall from the ceiling or fly to the opposite end of the room only to slash me from behind a second later), and enemy corpses get stuck in the terrain so often that I had eight different instances stop me in my tracks before said second boss (or before I finished the third mission).

They also removed the Tank Gun easter egg and that is unforgivable.

With 343 facing a mass exodus right now, I'm just going back to MCC. There is no positive future for Halo Infinite, not for the next few years. I've already paid my money and am not giving them another DIME till they sort their shite together. Don't spend money on this game.

Edit: It's been over a year and it still feels like the game is in early access. I still suffer from crashes, freezes, ugly textures, and unacceptable loading times, and I'm not just talking about matchmaking. Non of my customisation options load meaning I can't change my spartan's appearance, or equip anything from the battle pass that I PAID for. I also can't load the campaign anymore; it crashes every time I select the option from the title screen.

They have added several game modes or the ability to make game modes viva the node system in Forge. Which this is a massive improvement along with the new bookmark system for maps, gamemodes, and player made forge objects. The introduction of AI is great and with the node system allows for some fun little gamemodes, firefight, and even custom campaign missions. Bookmarked forge objects and nodes is great and can help people create interesting maps quickly and share them.
    I personal don't like battlepasses, but I think 343 has implemented the best battlepass system allowing to go back and unlock, for a price, prior seasons battlepasses. I rather have a reach credit system mixed with GTA Online pay money for ingame currency to unlock new additions you want or still gives the player the ability to grind to unlock.  I personal don't like the core system and the coating systems but they've made helmets, coatings, and visors cross core. I believe they said they are trying to get shoulders down the road. I really hope coatings and armor cores don't move on into the future. I rather have better selection of colors, add in patterns, and take a que from Doom 2016 of weathering, damage, and blood sliders. The shop prices are still too high but at least they put some better content for sale and cross core makes more things available for you. Also 343 gave everyone all the base cores so you won't be stuck owning something you don't have the base core to. So that is a positive.
    I've only played a few solo campaigns, a few solo firefights and got hit with some minor desync. Haven't jumped into multiplayer yet to see how bad it is. The reason I didn't tonight was I randomly crashed when trying to load a bookmarked map. I really hope desync gets fully resolved for that was the major reason I stopped playing Infinite in the first place. I have a minor gripe with the copy protection system. I thought the system was going to be that the map creator was permanently credited even if you edited the map the original creator was still credited. But its not like that, it won't allow you to open up the map in forge. So if you want to edit spawn locations, weapon locations, vehicle spawns, or just a minor addition then well best be making your own map from scratch then. 

TLDR
343 has made enough changes to make it worth playing though there are a several annoying things still plaguing Halo Infinite. I really do hope they deal with the dsync issue since that is the biggest issue. All the things you can do in forge, the custom games options, and easy file sharing system (bookmarks) makes its easy to enjoy some fun new gamemodes, firefight, or even a mini campaign levels with friends. So it can be fun with friends. Its in a better state 

Old
I have to say music and artstyle are great. The grappling hook is great. The open world is ok though feels empty and not great to drive around on a warthog. This game has problems, like desync. Not your Halo 3 you have a bad host and rubber band but your position client side and server side are in different places over a longer period of time. The PC port doesn't run well. Over all I would call Halo Infinite an Early Access Game. A lot of features and gamemodes you would expect are not there and seem to be held hostage by the live service system. 343 might make this game feature complete but like all Early Access titles that might not happen or be buggy like Halo 5 drip feed content. The live service battle pass system uses challenges for xp which feels like a second job and just devolves into people just grinding instead of playing the gametype. Halo Infinite currently is just creating bloat as each color and gamemode are doubled instead of being able an option for all or a setting in a gametype. The armor core system is terrible and locks armors and attachments to one core along with colors except for the bloat. AI can cross core. The core system should have been different bipeds, like a Spartan, Marine, ODST, Elite, etc since some of those assets are in the game and could have been reused for that purpose. I personally don't like the battlepass system. Customization is terrible and locked behind the armor core system which I think hurts the store system they have. Armors and colors are locked behind the pay store. Season stories are terrible and mostly is focused on the seasonal core so no cool stuff for the base core. The live service isn't really live as it takes six months or more for basic updates let alone injecting content that was in prior games at launch. Its a shame because a lot of thought and talent when into the game but 2/3 of the game is missing. A lot of the social features seemed to gone or too buggy to be used. The Academy is a neat idea but feels like it took away from development of features missing from the game. Halo Infinite feels like an Early Access title that only gets minor updates with maybe a crumb of content once a year. I would not recommend this game in its current state and would say wait ten years and maybe they'll have the game feature complete. MCC is probably can scratch your halo itch with all the new modded content being made. Its a real shame because infinite could have been a great game but something went wrong in development and the live service destroyed player expression. I don't get the core system since it goes against the store system. Why buy cat ears if the core I use doesn't have it? The weapon and vehicle editing could have been used to make the weapons and vehicle look like the classic versions. Warthog still has the toilet seat turret plate instead of the ICONIC hexagon plate. The weapon sandbox is ok but the missing weapons can be felt. There isn't a close range shotgun like the classic one and the plasma pistol is useless. The Bulldog is ok but doesn't fit that shotgun type in prior halo. The Skewer is perfect replacement for the spartan laser and is more balanced. The rng or time to spawn vehicles is ok but there isn't a map with those power vehicles at start. So the wraith and scorpion feel rare and no epic vehicle battles like a heavies game.  The UI system kind of sucks and could have been reorganized to be me streamlined to be better organised. Maybe remove the 3d backgrounds for cool concept to help with the load times. A lot of gametypes and settings are missing. No VIP, no multi teams, no infection, and no assault. The gametype settings are missing options and looks like 343 solution is to make new gametype to have to edit which will add to bloat. No forge yet, though from leaked footage looks like it will be fantastic and give players more options to make maps and add to gametypes. Though should have been at launch. Split-screen Coop Campaign got the axe though there is a glitch to get it to work. Looks like a battle royal is going to be added but I'm never going to play that if basic features are still missing. But you can already make a battle royal gametype-isk with the settings already in the game.

The TLDR
There was some decent ideas put into the game and would have been good if it was a feature complete game. The desync, bloat, and pc port stability of the game are a big issue. A lot of features, gamemodes, game settings are messing. The core system, coating system, and live service are bad and hurts the payment system. It is a shame that the game is in this state because you can see that someone put some good work in some aspects of the game. But the vision of the game went in the wrong direction. You can feel that 2/3s of the game was removed. Halo Infinite is an Early Access Game and you should wait until it is more of a feature complete game before you buy it.

I've played and explored them thoroughly and I have a good knowledge of the franchise.

This being said, I played this game for a bunch of hour upon purchasing it and dropped it because of my disappointment, but I decided to give it a second chance and complete the campaign at heroic difficulty.
I need to specify that I'll only talk about the campaign.
Here's what I found:

PROS
- Beautiful graphics
- Sound FX are well made
- Nice landscapes
- Gameplay is solid, satisfying and fluid
- Great selection of weapons
- AI is not bad and can be a nice challenge in a few section
- The duration of the campaing can be significantly extended thanks to the side missions, which also bring some upgrades

CONS
- The storyline is weak and totally forgettable. Also, there's no sign (or mention) of the characters met in the previous chapters and the past events are barely mentioned, making the player feel like there is no link between the current events and the ones experienced in the past of the saga, with the exception of Cortana's madness.
- Tends to become very repetitive after a while
- Same happens with the environments: for beautiful that they can be, there is no really variety
- Master Chief became annoying and hirritating as he tries to be unnecessarily bada$$, leaving just a memory of his silent, quiet yet charismatic personality
- Checkpoint system is really messed up
- A few crashes were observed during the gameplay. This was not related to my hardware
- The power up feature that tries to implement a sort of RPG element could have been a good idea, but is very superficial
- It doesn't really bring anything new in terms of gameplay, enemies, veichles, abilities (with the exception of the grappling hook)
- The soundtrack is just a weak revisitation of the old ones and some uninspired new stuff.

This is not a bad game, but is very far from the glorious past of Halo.
It is not nearly as epic, as solid, as connected and as memorable as the titles of the first trilogy.
It's just a good looking shooter with a good gameplay which feels like a mix between a Far Cry title (but way less complex in terms of interactions) and Halo (but way less epic), but nothing more.
Halo 4 delivered a different yet memorable story that could have been both a good epilogue to the Halo trilogy events and a great start for the Reclaimer saga, then Halo 5 messed up the whole franchise with an embarassing campaign (that followed an even more embarassing advertising campaign); this title feels like a nostalgic operation that made a weak attempt to resuscitate the old atmospheres, but with no great success.
It was kinda fun to play and to explore but, in my opinion, is not worth the price.
Still a better game than Halo 5 though.",1639577348,1700322311,False,0,0,0.487721711397171021,0,True,False,False

I love halo to death and I tricked myself into loving this one at face value. The engine, the work, the art,as nice as all of it is, it doesn't do anything to fix the outrageous narrative,  lies made during development, cut content, unfixed bugs since day1, and aggressive micro transactions.

Campaign is a lot of fun, but I feel like the story was lacking in a few different ways. I missed the large supporting casting that the previous games had. The game play wise the campaign is super fun, but it also felt a little hollow. plenty of POI's to visit and marines to save along the way but I didn't really see the point. Kinda hard to tell what's going on unless you're listening to audio logs scattered around the map, felt like a lazy way to tell the story on that front. That being said, the missions themselves were a blast to play through and were actually pretty well crafted, the game for sure has a lot of replay ability. 

Over all I'd give the Camping a 7/10- A fun experience but for sure could've been better. Might've been higher if I played co-op with a friend (If only it was there at launch :\ ) 

As for the multiplayer its not bad, for a free experience I can't complain too much. Games feel fun and action packed, although there is a decent level of desync, so not all your shots register as they should, but its also hardly noticeable most of the time. That being said, I'm mainly a ranked player and I do have one major complaint with ranked play. There is a massive problem with people leaving mid game. I'm not sure if people leave or crash but its a decent chunk of the time, even at high plat/low diamond lobbies. 343 definitely needs to add more reason to not want to leave a game, and in the event of crashes, we should be able to just reconnect to matches. Personally I wouldn't mind if people who leaved ranked games get banned for an hour or two, and the rest of team doesn't take a skill rating hit. After all playing a 3v4 in higher elo often feels near impossible a lot the time. 

other than that I would give multiplayer a 8/10 experience. All things considered, its Halo. Always a great time to jump on with buddies and play ranked or hit up a Custom game.

Is it perfect? Not by any means. Do I think it's a bad game? not at all. For sure worth checking out if not just for the free multiplayer. Some glaring issues need to be addressed, but I actually enjoy the game a good chunk.",1700161019,1700161019,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But they've somehow made operations worse and harder to progress in (5 levels for doing weeklies instead of 10), and they don't even count as events anymore, requiring you to set it as your one and only active battlepass. Monetization has also gotten a lot worse in general.

There's a few positives of having less tiers (50 vs 100) on the regular battlepasses with more condensed content, and forge continues to be amazing with way more featured forge maps in the regular playlists, but it's clear money is the driving factor above and beyond everything else, regardless if it costs the rest of the game to suffer.

---Original Review:---

[b]Monetized to hell.[/b] The game itself is great, and forge is amazing, but the extremely pricey store is given so much importance that it negatively effects every aspect of the game. Even if you could buy every single item in the game, the customization would still be lacking because of how deeply ingrained the monetization is. It completely cripples a potentially really neat game.

343i has a bunch of people who genuinely want to make a good game, but publicly, they will routinely lie about what they will or won't do to save face while doing the complete opposite (likely at Microsoft's request?).

Only the truest Halo fans such as myself held out hope for a good game. 6 years and 500 million dollars later, we get.. this. Somehow this is the best a first-party Microsoft Development team can do for one of their biggest flagship franchises?

     I've been playing and trying to love this game since the 2 week early-access period for multiplayer, and while the core of Halo: Infinite's gunplay and movement is solid, there are far more things that the game does wrong, or not at all. For most of this games life, it's been plagued by some major issues, namely the lack of content when compared to Halo titles from a decade ago. On release this game was even more bare-bones than Halo 5, and it's only recently reached a point where it feels like a feature complete game, if only it wasn't 2 years too late and 90% of the player-base was still here! Although I'm not sure that more players could save this game, even in its current state, as there is a hidden matching system when playing online where you will be consistently matched with braindead teammates, and sweaty opponents. All to ensure a 50-50 winrate. Truly one of the ""ends justify the means"" approaches of all time, but why? In practice it ruins the fun in matches, and makes every single one feel like an E-Sports qualifier.

     The issues with Halo Infinite's multiplayer are only made worse by the game devs appealing to the lowest common denominator, and locking almost all of the noteworthy customization items behind Microtransactions. For a year and a half this game had potentially the worst F2P model of any game that I've played. I can't stress this enough, they tried to monetize a freaking color wheel for almost 2 years before making a compromise.. Just think about that next time you give 343 Industries and/or M$ your hard earned money.

     The campaign barely deserves to be labeled as such, I don't recommend buying it separately for any reason. Instead of a traditional linear action packed story like Halo is known for, It's more of a Ubisoft-tier empty open world with side missions and collectibles sprinkled in as an afterthought. Possibly the best thing about the campaign is the high quality and well animated cutscenes, but more than half of those are just Master Chief standing around with his arm extended holding cortana in his hand, talking about some plot that we known nothing about because they never explained it to us. There is some fun to be had with the Grapple Hook, even though it basically invalidates vehicle transportation entirely as a side effect of existing. The Tank Gun and Flyable Pelican glitch are also a good way to find amusement in this otherwise bland experience.

     Overall I can't recommend this game in good conscious. Despite it being free and changing leadership hands recently, 343 continually prioritizes Microtransactions and the F2P model over an actual fun game. Not to mention that the campaign is still being sold at such a high price. It's also worth mentioning that the game has some pretty lackluster performance. if you don't have a card newer than the RTX 2000 series, you will have to make some compromises in the settings to run it well. (I'm able to crank out 1440p144fps with no res scaling at lowest settings on my 3070 Ti, just barely.)",1699836109,1699836109,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The campaign, while competently made given their transition from level based missions to an open world design, wasn't very memorable. The story doesn't really have much going on. We get to see a softer side of the Master Chief but aside from that I could not tell you where the story left off or what was even accomplished. 

Losing exceptional level design and the big set pieces was not worth it in the end.

The multiplayer suite on launch, given what we've been used to since Halo 3, was a devastating blow. We had very restrictive custom game options, no forge, and none of the community made modes we've had since Halo 3. The maps, like the campaign, mostly shared the same biome and weren't very appealing. 

Fortunately, we're in a spot where all the major bullet points have been addressed and the game is in a really healthy state. We've got more maps, better armor customization, the most robust Forge mode of all time, a custom games server browser, and stacked matchmaking playlists with user generated maps peppering the various modes. 

The game always had an exceptional foundation. The gun feel has never been better and the weapon sandbox was on point. Now it has a ton of content to put it all to use. If you dropped off on or near launch, it's worth a redownload.",1699828781,1699828781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The game has small content updates once every blue moon, whether a new season, post-season updates to game modes, or limited-time events. The wait for new things is just too long for me. Past seasons were active for months (season 2 was the longest one we've had along with the post-season ""Winter Update"" to the season with a free 30-tier pass for armor parts when we should've had in season 1.)

- Some in-game mechanics are scuffed (theater mode is still broken, and is probably worse than H5 IMO.) The connection issues with players desyncing (mostly because of players using wifi or playing from a different area in the world.) and hits are not being registered (projectiles/ ghost melee's.)

- You'll get matched with players that are new/bad at the game and occasionally they'll leave/rage quit and get replaced with a brain-dead bot that does little to nothing but feed your team or the enemy team. You'll have matches against an enemy team that is sweaty (which is not terrible, but having terrible teammates equals having a terrible time). In ranked mode, I try to stay away. Either you get bad teammates, good enemy teams, or cheaters (I see cheaters a lot more often now with aim/wall hack, and if you see/play with one or multiple, please report them.)

- Spartan customization is somewhat limited, and this time there are no male or female gender options, just 3 body types, and 4 masculine and feminine voice options. 
Multiple armor parts are ""vaulted"" behind a poor in-game store (which the store changes every-week, and some are repeats) at high prices. On the positive side, 343i does offer limited-timed events that give players free goods like parts to armor, coating, nameplates, background, skins, etc.
The game developers added a new store function to buy (some) past bundles even if they don't appear in the poor in-game store, which is better than nothing.

The time I've put into this game, money (yes, I know. I'm disappointed in myself for buying a bundle that had the one item I was interested in.) ,and the interest to keep playing is slowly fading away as there is just little to do in the game and the issues being there.

The game had great moments and the campaign and art style feels like a true return to form, but poor developmental priorities and the continual nickel and dime monetization is abhorrently on perpetual display. It's a game I feel I have to justify playing, and I just can't anymore.



I want to love this game. I do. But it suffers from some of the same issues that games like 40k: Darktide suffer from. Poor prioritization and a disconnect between the consumers/fans and the producers/devs. They know we want campaign dlc and they know we want a better progression system with actual, meaningful unlocks. But they goof about with rediculous Fortnite-esque shenanigans.

This game launched with about six to eight maps, some of which you wouldn't even see unless you were in certain game modes. Speaking on gamemodes, there was a significant lack of variety including series staples like firefight, SWAT, or infection. The poor optimization shows an underexperienced crew trying to patch post launch, where most of the development was outsourced. Changes and tweaks to weapons for the sake of multiplayer balancing domino into campaign and the singleplayer experience suffers for it. There's no real flavor in the MP, you play for 2 hours and you've seen all the maps and you're just going through the motions. They just push out seasonal ""events"" which is really only artificial fluff to keep the player numbers up. And, the progression challenges for these events usually prevent you from actually enjoying the game with friends, forcing you into certain modes that might either not be that popular, or don't allow team play in the first place.

I am aware that as of posting this, the game has moved leaps and bounds from launch (to include most of the missing modes with the exception of firefight)... However, it should not take over a year to bring a game up to what should be release feature complete, and I will not defend a company that outsourced most of the development and complains about the issues it has fixing problems that would've been avoided if developed in house. (Or if they focused on the game itself instead of a microtransaction shop that was implemented since launch...)

The microtransactions store is just as egregious if not more so since launch, charging for horrendous color schemes instead of just letting us pick our own from available color palets. As well as the prices increasing due to what they claim is an increased value from the cross-core customization feature that the community waited a year for. So now instead of the color ""teal"" or ""maroon"" for $4 for a particular core, its now like $10. Not to mention they often bundle things together with no option of individual purchase. The best and most recent example of this is the OG Halo CE armor ""kit"" in the shop for appox. $22. It's not even it's own core armor.",1699577801,1699577976,False,1,1,0.501557648181915283,0,True,False,False

Campaign- is a poor below average halo experience compared to past entry's with huge plot holes and a story that makes no sense and half if not more of the characters are not even in it, 3/10 the points go to music cool new guns and sound effects everything else sucks

PVP- is un fun boreing and laggy with high ping for me being 300ms to 1200ms of lag i have read guides and tweaked settings to try fix this and nothing works, pvp is also lazy as thiers nothing to play for or earn as everything is locked behind the cash shop heres some examples.

The garbage F2P live service multiplayer is the worst of any Halo series, with frustrating and inconsistent gameplay. Even worse is the ranked system which is expertly designed not just to keep you playing but also to motivate you to drag other people through the mud with you. All for a chance for 343 to get in on some of that sweet microtransaction money.

Stay away if you are on M&K. Controller players have a huge ""accuracy"" advantage with ""reticle magnetism"" aka aim assist and playing against them is basically playing against an aimbot at close to medium range. To make up for cranking up the controller aim assist too high, 343 implemented ""reticle friction"" in M&K that changes your sensitivity when the reticle is over an enemy. It will mess with your muscle memory like mouse acceleration and you CAN NOT turn it off. You'll wonder why you can't dial your sensitivity in quite right and it's because the sensitivity is only at about 80% when you're tracking someone, so you have to work harder to track them than you did to snap to them. IMO this is completely unforgivable; every game needs to provide raw or linear mouse input options for M&K, period. If the devs feel like ""reticle friction"" helps balance against the OP controller aimbot, great, put it in there, but let me choose to turn it on, otherwise it's just a slap in the face. But what are you gonna do? It's a dumpster fire F2P live service game; they can make up the rules as they go because you didn't pay any money for it.

""Desync"", 343's word for lag, is still a huge problem. Hitmarkers are extremely delayed, on the order of half a second, regardless of your ping. You will regularly melee someone directly in the back but then they'll teleport two feet and take no damage. There are times when it will feel good and responsive but these are few and far between. Combined with ""reticle friction"" it makes M&K a nightmare.

Matchmaking is the worst I've seen in any game especially with ranked matches. Solo ranked is an uphill battle;  you need to squad (fireteam) up with other decent players in order to have a chance of reaching higher ranks. Matchmaking literally works against you harder the higher you rank up, which might actually seem logical, but it does so by setting you up to lose by teaming you with lower-ranked players, not just pitting you against higher-ranked players. You might think ""so what, I can still get a good score even if my team doesn't care"". Well, even if you have a 50% higher score than anybody else and actually played the objective while your rando teammates just went for kills, and your team lost the game, that's -8 skill points for you. If you win a game under the same conditions, that's +9 skill points. Guess what kind of game you're going to have more often? There is a huge score bias in going for kills vs the objective and losing carries an unreasonable penalty regardless of how much you contributed individually. And again, the matchmaking system WILL intentionally set you up to lose and the skill point system doesn't care how well you did, only whether your team won or lost.

On top of that, if your connection drops or the game freezes, that's -15 skill points. If somebody else drops making it 4 on 3 and you want to bail so you don't have waste the next 10 minutes getting thrashed, that's going to be -5 skill points if you're lucky. If you stay on and try to push through but inevitably lose, that's -8 skill points at best. The skill points are mostly about punishment and only occasionally give you that little hit of a reward to keep you playing.

Shame too, I WANTED to like this game. I really wanted to play halo again but 343 has shown that they STILL don't know what makes Halo stand out from other shooters. Whole freetoplay thing was a excuse to strong arm players into buying battle passes or using the cashshop. There no incentive for you to play like Reach did when it rewards you ingame points to spend in the shop. Even if you BOUGHT the campaign they don't give you a option unlocking a few armors that appear in the campaign, its $60 but the campaign is so barren lifeless and boring and the story goes nowhere. You can't play as big hulking elites or even brutes heck even a spartan 2. That made Halo PVP fun when you encounter other players playing as big Elites. They refuse to add them but they have no issues adding ""fracture"" cores which is like a different universe cliche instead of using Halo rich story and lore to add in a core. In the end these cores clutter my menu being blank slates because I didn't buy the battle pass. Speaking of stupid cliche designs they plan to add infection but its part of the """"""multi-player story"""""" that doesn't focus on YOU. It focuses on some group of lone wolfs that stick together lol and currently a evil bootleg skynet ai takes over spartans making spartans more of a joke. Nothing about fighting the banished but you guys fighting in simulation FOREVER.

Most of the game feels like they threw away what little they had that people liked from 4 or 5 to make a bland PvP arena shooter with minimal effort to pump out microtransactions.  ""Games as a Service"" is a concept I find deplorable, and it seems to be further destroying one of my favorite franchises.


343 continues to kill my favorite series.  Campaign feels weirdly empty at times, and I don't just mean lack of enemy patrols (which thankfully break up the monotony of sprinting and grappling through the wilderness).

The weapon selection is stiflingly small.  So many things are missing.  No SMGs, no SAW, no DMR, no SpLaser, no Grenade Launcher.  The old shotgun is gone, and the new one feels lackluster and weak...in your hands only.  Marines and Banished have no problems using them to great effect, but even looting the exact same gun from a Brute somehow feels weaker than they could use it.  As much as I like the Commando, it feels underwhelming in any role.  The Assault Rifle feels better as an assault weapon because it puts out rounds faster with a higher magazine, the DMR has better range and damage at range, and the pistol (or it's variant) has just as much if not more kick.

And that's just the UNSC weapons.  It feels like they took as many weapons as they could and removed them to ""condense"" things.  No Plasma Rifle.  No Mauler or Spiker.  New Brute Pistol does feel okay, and when you get used to the heavy arc it's okay at range.  A new Plasma Carbine feels fine, but the shots feel too slow to travel compared to the more hitscan nature of other weapons.  The old Carbine is replaced by a new Stalker Rifle which feels like a Needle Rifle with no supercombine, the Needler is underwhelming unless you're in fistfighting distance because it doesn't track or even really have any accuracy.  No Brute Shot. No Plasma Launcher or Fuel Rod Gun.

A few forerunner weapons are there, but other than the sentinel beam nothing we recognize from old games.  No Promethean weapons.  Ammo for any of them is so few and far between.  New electric weapons, which seem to just be to disable vehicles and don't hit hard enough to justify replacing a human weapon.

Having marines follow you is hard because your walking speed is much faster than theirs and they get stuck on terrain or just decide to guard an area instead of following.  Want to load them up in a Razorback (the ""new"" passenger 'hog)?  Good luck, the covenant will blow the wheels off or you can't access the place you want because it's a up a sheer cliff you need to grapple up.

Also on the subject of vehicles, it feels like the game decides to punish you for using them.  Grunts with electric pistols (not plasma pistols) are hitscan snipers and EMP you frequently.  The Wasp (UNSC flier) is made of paper mache.  The Banshee has no Bomb anymore.  No Gauss Hog.  Scorpion Tank feels much more fragile than previous games.

I've only seen one wraith tank in the entire game, and it was as a boss fight.

When you boot up the game, it loads up multiplayer.  Then, you have to select campaign and sit through another loadscreen.  You can't even access the campaign without logging in online into the multiplayer client before you can go offline to play campaign.

Customizations aren't visible in campaign.  Multiplayer customizations are almost all locked behind microtransactions...but also only in bundles or paywalled behind premium season rewards.

Initially posted a positive review, but have since changed to negative.

343 have provided a product that is both hollow, broken and feels abandoned. All halo fans should feel insulted from the work created by 343, and the game-destroying failure to do anything in a timely manner. 

The Campaign is trash, and alone is pulled apart by many other reviews you can read for yourself. Cookie-Cutter missions. The sandbox elements is worse than what Ubisoft provide in their own disasters.

What strikes me most is just how [i]disappointing[/i] it is to play. Occasionally I will find a heated match on the right map that reminds me what this game could be. What it is 90% of the time is quiet, slow, jerky, and boring. I played a social match that was rockets with infinite ammo, and it was a deathly quiet 8 minutes of running around looking for people. The maps are big, empty, and lifeless. There's some fun behind it, some good basic gameplay and cool designs, but every time I give it another shot it feels like I'm playing a game that was abandoned years ago. I think the pinnacle of this is the tutorial cutscene that hits with so much chaos and character, immediately followed by silent open spaces and bland shooting.

The Campaign: Without going into spoiler territory, It is in my opinion the best part about Infinite, however, it also illustrates a lot of the problems of Infinite. For example, there are a lot of unanswered questions about what happened between 5 and now. There are audio logs that attempt to tell you something (but not without removing some mystery to it), but most of it is audio about what happened during the 6 weeks chief was drifting in space, not about 5. I love the new suit for The Chief, but it's introduction is very similar to 4's suit... it's just, there now. According to sources, it's been a year since 5, but no one is, again, telling us what happened in that year. Would be great to know how Chief got a new suit (and not in a cryptic trailer).
With CO-OP having been removed, in the first open-world halo no-less, it feels like to me that they not only sacrificed that for the multiplayer/open-world, but it also tells me that this campaign was second in mind to 343. Their focus was where the money was, and that was the free2play market. But, how's that going for them?

Multiplayer: Too many microtransactions and little rewards for playing the damn game. Too little players playing the game to be rewarded too little. Sure, it has a stable player base, but it's because the mechanics are solid, and the game is good. Just, good. It's not Halo 3 amazing, not Reach amazing, and if we ignore Halo, it's not even Split Gate amazing. The battle pass should have not been the only way to ""earn"" customization and experience. We should have had an old fashioned account level-up system like COD. What's the point of playing a game, if you're just going to get angry at sweats, campers, bad teammates, etc., and not at least be rewarded for your personal experience? Let me tell you, I feel it's not

With CO-OP coming soon and not being better than 4 chiefs and an open world, no forge for close to another year or less, and what's on the horizon only feels like the shadow of a game series that used to dominate and define the fps genre, all i can say is, i'm not going to support this, and I can't recommend it to you. I can't stop everyone from playing as they are their own people, but I can hope I can at least have them see my view, and think. Disagree in the end or not. Thank you

343 should have listened to Chief's speech to the Pilot about mistakes.

Edit (Nov. 2023):
Saw people online raving that this update and the change in management at 343 made the game ""good now."" I admit, out of spite I decided to be either proven right with my scepticism or be proven wrong and admit my faults. After another few (understating) more hours of gaming with this new update, and I feel the game is still terrible. A change in dev teams doesn't mean a change for good. Sure, there is a lot they have fixed, added, etc., but the game at its core is flawed. Down to the last digit of code. A part of this anger I have is from the fact that as a story fan i'm stuck with the terrible story and campaign overall that we were left with here, and that they had cancelled all dlc for the story (not that leaving you on a cliffhangar to try and sell you dlc is a good idea in the first place). However, a lot of my anger is also from everyone's personal experience dictating the overall value of this game. Just because you had fun with buddies and/or have fun in general online, doesn't mean we can ignore the scamming store, the live service squeeze they put on players and players' wallets, and many other problems in this game. This also can go for someone like me, can't fully claim that Halo 3 is awesome just because of my personal experiences, but the difference being that overall that game IS finished, player friendly, has a great story, etc., an opinion shared by many and critics.

Call me names, lonely loser, etc., but this has felt like a rollarcoaster of betrayal, from Halo 4 to Infinite, and i'm deciding to no longer ride on this decaying contraption.

Definitely recommend hopping on with all the new maps and forge AI 

EDIT 2023: SEASON 4 mid season update. I  jumped in to try one game and it seems to be way more optimised than before. Load times are twice as long however. Alas in typical Infinite fashion the game crashes on the second game. No lag, no error message... Just straight up killed itself.

EDIT 2023: Season 3 Update. Definitely some steps in the right direction since Bonnie Ross left, yet this game is still ridiculously unoptimised, Multitudes of crashes with just loading into Forge made maps or scrolling through the menu... This game will not respect your time whatsoever. I want to love this game... But I just can't. It's almost like being in an abusive relationship. I really should let Halo go. Yet no matter how hard it beats me over the head with a metaphorical or physical Gravity Hammer, i'll still play it.

EDIT 2022: Winter update. This game is utter garbage. no saving it at this point. 1 year later and we still have desync, Co-op sucks, no splitsceen, 2 new maps that aren't even dev made, forge doesn't work for me, can't load into games and cant view community creations. 

2021: I would love to rate this Multiplayer with a thumbs up, but unfortunately as of now there are just too many issues surrounding the game.

 I'd say that some time down the line this review will be positive, I know 343 have addressed many of our issues and concerns, but these issues will take time to fix.

Best way I can describe this game is - FUN. It's a very fun game with a lot of flaws.

CONS

- No Forge (it will be here in 9 months).

- No progression system (except the battle pass)

- Theatre mode doesn't work or save films.

- Custom games do not save settings & has issues with teammates joining.

- No custom game browser.

- No pre game lobby or veto system.

- Players aren't alphabetised in friends list.

- Hackers galore.

- Poorly optimised.

- Constant crashes. (have disconnected or crashed from nearly 30 matches out of 300+) I haven't played a single game where at least one player hasn't left or disconnected.

- No report feature.

- If you win a game sometimes it will put you on the losing team last second (or vice versa).

- Predatory monetisation features. (£7.99 for the colour red?).

- Free content (with a paywall). 

- No match composer (Why can't we select what game mode we want to play?).

- Challenges cannot be viewed within matches nor do they track correctly. 

- Only 7 slayer maps & 3 big team maps (Needs more biomes & Covenant maps).

- Vehicle spawns should not be randomised. I have seen a Wraith maybe 3 times in my 100+ hours.

- Vehicles are too weak bar the wasp and ghost.

- Major de-sync issues with the servers. sometimes it will take a full BR clip to bring someone down due to this issue. 

- Collision is technically in the game but doesn't work half the time meaning you go through the enemy & disorients you.

- Missing staple modes like infection, swat, snipers & action sack. (yes I know they are coming. but they aren't here now).

- Bots ruin slayer games by going 1 & 20.

- No reconnect feature on ranked mode.

- On ranked I am currently Diamond 4, yet I will be placed with Gold, platinum & Onyx players.

PROS

- The game is really fun to play & has the potential to be the greatest Halo game to date.

- The visuals and art style really pay homage to Bungie & 343i in their own unique way. 

- The weapons & sandbox are amazing. There are infinite ways to play this game.

- I love the Map interaction when you score a point on BTB (e.g - the mac cannon firing).

- the Capture points change per capture on BTB & total control adding replayability. 

- The AI are fantastic but there should be an option to tun them off for players who don't like them. (same for spartan chatter).

- The loot cave was a really inventive idea on the big team maps. we definitely need more map interaction like this on the other maps. 

- BR starts on Ranked mode.

- AR starts on Quick play. 

- the academy & training modes are a great way to test out the game and learn the weapons and sandbox.

- The maps are well designed and fun to play on.

- The gun play feels amazing (bar the sniper rifle).

- The equipment such as Grapple, Thruster & Repulsor allow for such versatility and positioning to gunfights.

- Weapons feel very balanced (bar a few)  MOST weapons feel like they have a use on the field Especially the Sidekick. it feels amazing.

- Plasma pistol needs a buff
- Ravager needs reverted to it's flight build
- Sniper needs a revamp
- AR needs a small nerf 

aside these the weapon sandbox feels very unique.

The vehicle doomsday mechanic is really cool, however the vehicles need a  health buff especially the Banshee. The Wasp and Ghost are perfect.

- This game really captures that 30 seconds of fun & has some of the greatest features in any recent MP game.",1637024190,1699326468,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That did not come to be though as the game went through development hell and 343 seemingly becoming worse and worse at making Halo titles. The campaign's narrative was very weak and incredibly generic, and frankly making the campaign open world did nothing but screw with the pacing and smother me with monotonous busy work. I feel like mission design for campaign missions as well was hampered by having to work or be apart of the open world, and that nothing about the environment in the open world is varied or interesting. I will say on the upside though I found the AI in general in this game to be fantastic, and if there was one team worth keeping in 343 it would be those behind the AI. It felt like 343 finally did something better than Bungie did with their games. As well as during those curated story missions they did have, I felt like they had great enemy placement and pacing that just felt ""right"". The core gameplay loop of Halo is here, and it feels the most ""Halo"" out of all 343 entries but it flubs everything else besides that. 

I also want to touch on music real quick, because Halo has been known for its soundtrack, and I find it to be an important aspect of Halo. The music in this game is just one big nothing burger, no tracks stood out or enhanced my experience and are just a much weaker derivative of the original series score. Which is really disappointing to see because 343 has made a great soundtrack before in Halo 4, it was very different from Marty's scores, but it had an identity of its own and elicited a sense of mystery and felt much more alien than any track that could be found in the originals. To see 343 going so safe with the soundtrack was really disappointing and left it feeling unmemorable.

Multiplayer, I would say the heart and soul of Halo, in every single mode in Halo you could play it with a friend. Except this one, Co-op campaign didn't release alongside the game but was instead delayed. It wasn't a short delay either it was delayed for almost a full year, and even then they cancelled local Co-op, something they said they would never do. I wish that was the only thing missing, but Forge, Firefight, and many multiplayer gamemodes were absent from the games release, but with the ""promise"" that they would be coming ""later"". But given that it took them multiple weeks to get slayer added as a sole matchmaking option, it hasn't inspired confidence that we would get those features and modes in a time frame where the game would still be relevant. Its been 2 years and many of these features have not yet returned. I have enjoyed the multiplayer that is here and there is alot of room for skill expression and truly feels like an evolution in moment to moment combat, but that doesn't change the fact that there is no meat on these bones.

Customization/Monetization is clearly where 343 put most of their time into, as it was the main recurring revenue driver. This game unless you are willing to shell out hundreds of dollars is the halo game with the weakest customization to date, most of the cool cosmetics are locked behind battle passes and Infinite's in-game shop, but even then they cycle out the in-game shop every week making you have to come back every week to the game in order to have the chance of purchasing the cosmetic you've been eyeing. There were very few campaign cosmetics, none of which were tied to achievements or difficulty and not a single one was armor piece. They were only camos and victory poses, all of which paled in comparison to the ones that could be found in the battle passes and in-game shop. Even with their premium offerings I can't recreate the colors that my spartan has been using for decades in all the prior titles.

343 should just take the L and start over. Just don't get this game, its not worth your time, and frankly its not worth 343's time.

To new players, try it out, it's free (mp). If it gets sweaty, there's plenty of social modes and custom games to mess around in, it's a lot of fun and I even risk saying it's the best Halo mp since Halo 3.

As for campaign...it's fun but feels incomplete (biomes, story). Plus, it drops the classic Halo mission layout in favor of an open map with missions, objectives, collectibles etc which doesn't fit Halo very well (it can be implemented but in this case, it kinda fails).

Of course I am definitely Biased towards HCE, H2, and H3 as these were the ones I had growing up in the early 2000's, but all in all this game is an adapted version for a more modern gamer, and I go about playing it trying to recognize this fact. 

I give the campaign a 7 out of 10. for the simple fact that there really isn't a variety of different environments to play in. Just a generic Halo environment with grasslands, and the signature Halo Evergreen trees. It looks beautiful, but lacks diversity in different types of places. No deserts, no tundra, No marshlands. just generic Halo environment. The story was okay, as far as it being a retcon of the events in Halo 5 goes. It just gets sort of bland towards the end, and I feel like things are about to get rather convoluted with this new foe in the mix. The Banished however, are very fun to fight. Lots of fun ways to take down brutes with the new equipment and weapons, and Grunt bashing never gets old. 

Now for the worst part and I'm going to really hold back here... The multiplayer experience is almost as bad as H4 and H5.  The gun play is fun and engaging, the hit markers and sound FX are a nice touch. The maps are fairly balanced for the most part and they look great. The smaller maps can be a blast to play on with evenly matched teams, and the fast pace may be sweaty at times, but if you're in the mood for that sort of thing its a blast. and... well that's it. Unfortunately This has to be worst Halo for connectivity issues I have ever played. I constantly get errors about connecting to data centers, and sometimes I wont get matches at all. My PC has never had a problem with this, and my internet works beautifully with Master Chief Collection Multiplayer. This is a Halo Infinite issue, and its a shame, because I wouldn't mind hopping on every now and then for a more fast paced Halo Experience. Notice I said Every now and then... which brings me to my next issue... Skill based match making. It turns every match into a sweat fest. This is fine sometimes, and again I understand that times have changed and halo is adapting to a changing market and audience, but us Oldies want to just vibe with some team slayer or Odd ball without getting constantly stomped and tea bagged by G-Fuel addicted kids. Specially in casual matches. I would love if they had a veterans lobby with more slower paced games for us late 20's to 30 somethings that are past our prime. It feels like Halo is leaving us behind...

All in all This game gets a 5.3 out of 10. From a life long Halo player, with as measured of a review as I can. this is because of the multiplayer mostly, but it is also due to a mid campaign at best. averaging out to a 5.3 out of 10",1699165526,1699252553,True,0,0,0.504613339900970459,0,True,False,False

+ Best gunplay in the series with superb movement
+ Graphics and sound are perfect
+ All equipment is useful and viable
+ A wide array of maps, game modes, with fun and unique in-game events every few weeks
+ Campaign is the best 343i has made (take that for what it's worth)
+ All previous battlepasses can be purchased at any time
+ Armor customization (despite crosscore and microtransactions) is a blast and you can make some amazing looking spartans. The various armor cores are gorgeous.
+ Forge and the geniuses in the community that can make incredible things
+ All previous leadership has been fired so we actually have decent human beings in control of this game

- Microtransactions. This is just how gaming is now and it's awful. All this games issues come from being free-to-play. 343i has been super scummy with prices. The good old days of unlocking your armors through gameplay like Halo Reach are long gone
- Helmets are crosscore, but nothing else is. Almost all the best coatings you have to pay for.
- No couch co-op. This may be a legacy feature, but this is Halo. Couch co-op is a staple and was the first feature they announced they'd include in the game, but to no avail.
- While I like the campaign, it is very samey. It's weaker than ALL Bungie campaigns. Only one biome makes the campaign feel very limited and all the missions blur together.
- Vehicles are still underpowered and easily destroyed.
- Vehicle spawn timing is still off. You will rarely ever see a Scorpion.
- Despite how many amazing arena maps are here, the BTB maps are lacking. Very narrow corridors makes vehicles worthless on certain maps.
- Several weapons are completely unusable. It's been 3 years and we've only added in 2 new weapons, and they're both the DMR.

Overall:
This game has unlimited potential with future updates, but the F2P elements really hurt the overall quality of this game.

Playlists have been implemented. Overall, it feels like what it should have been two years ago. My revisions will be placed after each paragraph.

I desperately want to recommend this game. But 343i has shown they simply cannot release a good product. Given a few years (or at the rate of updates this game is getting, a decade) it might be worth playing then. 
-----I was right. A couple years later, it's worth playing.

The game has incredible potential. It has a solid foundation in terms of gameplay. The guns feel good, the sound design is great. The weapon balance is pretty good. But the vehicle balance is god awful. Big Team Battle is a toss up on whether or not your team will get heavy weapons or vehicles. Ground vehicles are about as durable as wet tissue, whereas the singular air vehicle is almost god mode in comparison.
-----Not too much to say about this, seeing as I haven't played TOO much with the vehicles since coming back. I'm more of an infantry player. But it does feel like ground vehicles are BETTER than they were, though the Wasp (the human aircraft) is still a bit too durable in my opinion.

The maps are interesting, but entirely too small. Gone are the battlegrounds the likes of Blood Gulch, Sidewinder, Hangman, and other interesting maps. Now it's all CoD style maps, with defined lanes throughout each map, with no real soul.
-----""BTB"" maps have remained much the same. Though there was one that was good fun, I can't remember the name of it. But there's much more variety, and it feels like they've really actually put a lot more work into new maps since I last played.

Graphically, the game is good. But the customization was made entirely too strict with regards to what could work on what. Want to use a specific helmet with a specific chest piece, and gloves, using a certain ""coating"" for aesthetic? Better hope they're all compatible with the ""core"" of the armor you're working with. And on that note, who in the actual hell thought tying [b]PAINT JOBS[/b] to armor cores was a good job? Not to mention who thought the entire idea of ""cores"" was a good thing in the first place?! According to the lore of the universe, this is some of the most advanced armor design humanity has ever developed. Why in the actual hell would they not all be interchangeable?!
-----Customization is still ridiculously strict. Only helmets being allowed ""cross-core"" is still annoying as hell. I get that some of the armor sets are from ""different timelines,"" but like........come on. It doesn't make sense! 

Last, but most definitely not least, the networking of the game is absolute shit. And that's being nice. For a game of this type, you absolutely cannot go second rate on the servers, yet that is exactly what has been done. It's, plain and simple, fucking bad.
-----This was my biggest complaint. At the launch of season 2, I wanted to play the game, and see if it was going to be good. I even spent the money on the battlepass before I even went into a match, and I quit out of that first match because the networking was still atrocious. I've been enjoying the game now though. 

As I said at the start, I [b]WANT[/b] to recommend this game.  I really, really do. But it's a game plagued by a thousand small problems, and a hundred huge ones. The game has been out for a little under a year at this point. Season 1 was supposed to last 3 months. It lasted 6. They promised no more 6 months seasons, yet Season 2 is going to last 10 months. They promised after Halo Guardians there were going to be no more Halo titles without split screen co-op, yet they just announced that they've canned plans for just that within Infinite. Campaign Co-Op was also supposed to COME with Season 2, yet here we are, having just experienced its ""beta testing."" Forge Mode, again supposed to have come with Season 2 I believe, has no foreseeable future in the game.
-----Forge Mode has arrived, and apparently it's absolutely crazy. I haven't tried it myself, but I've seen some of the work people have done. It is apparently the most robust and useful version of Forge there has ever been. So I'll have to check it out later. But it's never been something I've concerned myself with. Campaign Co-op I can't speak about either, as my friend is waiting until the campaign goes on a sale to buy it. 

At this point, it feels like the game isn't even on life support. This is a mockery of everything Halo once was, yet it's convincingly masquerading around in the skin of its predecessors while it's trying to pickpocket you for cat ears on a helmet.
-----Still too many things are in the cash shop, and the battlepasses are still overbloated with what can best be described as ""duplicate"" items (shoulder pads being unlocked one shoulder at a time? Really) but overall the game is in a much better place than it was two years ago. It's where it SHOULD have been two years ago. I can, at this point, honestly give the game a good recommendation.",1662515057,1699212453,True,0,0,0.513761460781097412,0,True,False,False

While the micro-transactions are still outrageous and you still need to pay 20 bucks to buy one skin you want as a part of the bundle, the battle passes have started to improve by removing the filler 50 levels that came before it. At the end of the day its a fun free to play Halo. It's fun and it has its issues but I still keep coming back to it..

Everything but the campaign though. Since it's open world and one biome with essentially repeated, ""copy and paste"" missions,it gets old quickly. It's been 2 years since the campaign dropped and there still isn't news about any expansion. My complaints still exist for the campaign  


[b]Previous review:[b]

When the game originally came out, 343 marketed this game to have new editions every three months. Those 3 months turned into 10 and only includes 2 new maps. Missing features plague the game, features that were originally marketed to be in the game are now being cut. 343 still focuses on comp play rather then social queues which is why voice chat is hidden in the game and is heavily restrictive on who you talk to. You leave the lobby every time you play a game so you can't go back in a match with the same people. 

Instead of changing the way the season pass works right away, they said they would wait till a later date. The season pass prevents players from playing with their friends since each of them are tied to certain game modes that other friends do not have in common. 

Campaign was fun but there's only 3 atmospheres in the game patted out to be 20 hours. My guess is that they're going to do an expansion in each separate area based on how the campaign ends in a desert but even then, more visual variety would've gone a long way. Side-quests are not it though. Unless you can come up with a map like Breath of the Wild where the player discovers wayponts or puzzles on their own that rewards them (you can reward them with maybe an armor core instead of putting them in the bases) the sidequests are not worth it.",1637008562,1699127271,True,0,0,0.477112680673599243,0,True,False,False

There is a few missing and new guns. Not sure why. Some new guns are super cool, some suck so bad I am not sure how they got put into the game. Story is kind of bland, but whatever, its gameplay anyone cares about at this point.

New multiplayer update has made single player take a lot longer to load. sometimes its instant. Like before the tips even load onto the loading screen. Sometimes it takes 30 minutes. No idea why. I have a decent computer, and I am above the recommended specs, but even starting the game takes about 5 minutes anymore.


Multiplayer: I can sum this one up with 3 words: pure damage inconsistency

The only plus: its free

But for the details.....

Missing features. Weird textures and unloaded LODs at random points. Finally got playlists, after like 2 years. Bad progression system is hard to even say as it really isn't a progression system at all, because its just garbage challenges you have to complete, like ""get 50 headshots with the pistol at 100+ meters in distance"" . And yes, these challenges are almost always so awful and oddly specific its like they didn't even try. Not to mention you have to buy the season pass to have anything to progress towards. You literally have to buy a feature that should be in the game normally. Its honestly kind of sad.

This multiplayer is basically a broken promise in every single way possible. They barely got custom maps like a few months ago, and I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW! They are already dead, super glitchy and in some cases just completely broken.

Also, the way the game works is the server and your computer are 2 separate instances entirely. This means the server registers the game, and your computer registers the game too. Basically, you can full on kill a guy, get the kill, kill someone else, and all of a sudden die randomly. Turns out the server registered the first guy hitting you instead, and corrected your computer by killing you randomly. The kills will stay the same on your side until you load into the menu. This can also remove your challenges that are sometimes super hard to complete too, so pretty annoying when the game says you completed a challenge and you actually didn't.

Don't worry though, if you want to re-roll any hard to complete challenges, you can pay real money for it!

I had a match where I had over 50 headshot kills from a single person who just didn't die even though I kept shooting him in the head (which I just thought he was cheating honestly), and once in the menus, the kills no longer existed and it turns out the server read that I had not killed the other guy a single time. Also had a few friends confirm their kills were off in their menus to what the server was reading for the rest of us.



There are also armor cores. BOY OH BOY HERE WE GO! These are basically playable characters. You can have up to maybe like 10 or something like that now.

So, lets say you unlock the master chief leg armor. You want to use it with a really cool chest plate you have. One big problem though. You don't have these unlocked on the same armor core(character). What this means, is if you bought the master chief legs, you have to buy them again for the correct ""character"" in order to use them together, and if you earned it, well you will have to earn them again for the right armor core if you want to use them both together.

The newest update also fixed this issue! BUT... only with helmets. Like seriously, at this point, what the hell? It is like leaving a dollar to someone in your will, it shows you remembered them, you just didn't care enough to give them anything really useful or cool.

Believe me when I say, there are a LOT of cosmetic items in this game as well. Most colors are not unlockables too, and they come as set patterns, you cant change them whenever to whatever like the previous games.



This actually brings up the other annoyance I have with this game. Timed items. Not items that you only have for so long, but items you can only unlock/buy within a certain amount of time. Lets take the cat ears for example. Want some cat ears? TOO LATE! You could only buy them when season one was happening. You can still preview it, but you can no longer buy it. Yes, it was a purchase only item. something like $5.00 for each core. IN FACT, there is a preview for this item in other armor cores that you could only get after the season 1 event. Why? I dont know. You still have to download these items, and there are quite a bit of them too. So you download them, cannot buy them, and cannot earn them. No reason why so many items were even included in this game in the first place honestly.

Honestly, if you have played classic halo games, this will be the biggest disappointment for you. Ironing out gameplay and performance like every game does, but its already aging in looks, has a poor time rendering in some things, poor multiplayer and boring story are just sad to see. Then the greedy micro transactions, pathetic battle passes, missing weapons and just soullessness of the game as a whole. It has so much to it and it still feels lifeless.

But one of the most frustrating things is that every customization option is locked behind a tiresome and grindy battlepass, with the majority of the content being generic garbage that makes your Spartan look more like a fucking Power Ranger than a real supersoldier: stupid patterns for the visors, bright and clean color palettes that give a plastic look, fucking cat ears WTF?? And yes, I WILL go back to saying that Bungie with Halo Reach had the best Spartan customization and gameplay by far.

343 dont understand the Halo universe and much less the Master Chief saying that ""hE iS HuMAn"", instead of embracing the autistic power fantasy that a Spartan II is. They dont know what to do with the story (I can already see that they will never make an expansion for the current campaign and develop another game with another narrative and make shitty books to fill in the gaps), they dont understand their community and they dont understand their game (they really still believe that Halo is a competitive game).

Halo died on January 13, 2022, when the servers of the original Halo games on the Xbox 360 were shut down. Everything else is just a zombie, an abused corpse with the only objective of making a cash grab out of a beloved franchise.

343, fuck your store, fuck your campaign, fuck your games, fuck your cat ears and most of all, fuck you.

I gave it a shot. A serious, honest, shot. But there are numerous things that are lacking, including a heavy amount of unprofessional-ism in their Discord groups. 

First. The game has beautiful graphics, the sound has been artfully done outside of minor bugs - the models are true the nature of the universe. It's like you have all the pieces for a lego set and you built it wrong from the ground up. The direction of story is... mediocre at best, but, even with a near confirmation from 343's official discords' moderation team.

The only thing
They give a care about
Is their in-game shop and season pass sales.

Free to play multiplayer is great. It's a fast way to get players in and test gameplay mechanics - with the upcoming Forge mode, that'll be a huge expanse. But they really only care

Really and truly

About their cosmetic shop and their season passes. It's about making money short term and their approach has utterly killed off the IP for me. 

Edit: October 23, 2023 (TL:DR Negative Review to a Wary Positive)

343 Industries delivered a fairly large update alongside all the other seasons. I stopped playing around  Winter Season. I never touched Season 3/4/5 until today, and by that, I mean looking at the actual passes in game.

I noticed Halo Forge AI and 343 delivered. I'm not all too gleeful it's not it's own game-mode with comparable PVP EXP gain, at least in the way I desired the game mode to be. (And that is some huge numbers of enemies and extended past 4 players on Firefight) But it's appears to have had a bit of a 'broken' number of Spartans on certain maps, allowing for a rather large group Firefight experience - which is something I've wanted for a Halo game for a very long time.

That was certainly delivered upon.

I installed the game again on a whim, and I walked in expecting nothing. What I got was about seven crashes loading into custom games for Firefight. I am not sure what caused those CTD's as there was never any error code - I suspect it was mostly caused from my loading the game from an internal Hard Drive, since I sure as hell don't desire putting the game on my NVME - especially with prior experiences.

But what I also had gotten was a legitimate FIrefight experience, and one with so much customization and ability to change anything using Forge, that its rather an impressive direction taken by 343 as to how one could approach the game mode. I dare say that their approach to make a Player Custom Firefight-Campaign building experience is honestly superior than that of the older approach to Multiplayer PVE content

I still will not apologize for thinking their Discord Mod is a c.v.n.t for being rather rude and disingenuous, but I doubt the mod I ran into prior Covid, and the mod they have now are the same (Still miffed about that and will remain miffed as I expect better from any company, regardless of the product they sell)

Every season pass, on top of it, can be purchased any time. I actually like that, a lot - That approach should be made a standard in gaming, rather than say, Red Dead Redemptions' Outlaw passes which will never come back and a rare few had 'pay to win' options in them which any player today can't get, ever. 

I dislike the costs of the shop items, but the game does run very well and is similar to COD's in game shop costs ((Which I also hate their costs too))
They Added many game modes from when I last played and there were only two.
They Added Custom Games, and now Forge AI - which the latter is what I wanted the most, but as a proper game mode.

Forge AI is actually not bad - it's not what I wanted exactly, but the community does make up for it with maps and game modes for Forge AI. Even Campaign like missions, apparently.

As for buying the game. It's a free to play and the campaign is a rehash of all the missions from all the games put into one campaign under a different story and skin with new gimmicks and a knock-off open world - the writing isn't super amazing, I kinda wish the Civilian you are with had more depth or involvement as I actually enjoyed him as a character.

I'd say buy it on sale if you really want to, now that the game modes for MP actually have the content many of us expected there to be, day one.

And be frugal all your cosmetics are behind a paywall. Keep that in mind - you can't even custom paint your character (Which I still find personally as unfair, but that is the direction the company chose)

Give the game a shot, I guess. It's not top on my list, especially how pissed the company got me before. But I can not say that they've done nothing for the game, as that would be a lie considering the updates they've put forth thus far.

-PVE-
No more campaign content planned for Infinite. Enough said.

-PVP-
-Most cool PVP cosmetics are still locked behind the battle pass or are ""vaulted.""
-Desync. 
-Bad maps, no map voting, and crap game mode rotations. Seriously, who actually likes stockpile?
-Heavily weighted playlists instead of just being able to choose what game mode you want to play.
-Games take way too long to match/load up.
-No pre-game roster view.
-Bad post game UI. Stat screen interrupted by rank splash screen. 
-Rank rewards locked cosmetics if battle pass not purchased. The days of Reach ranks and customization are long gone. (ya know, unless you just play MCC)

Save your time and money. The live service model need to die off, and 343i needs to fail so Halo can finally rest or be acquired by a company that gives a crap.

HUGE story events just happened completely off screen without even the justice of a cutscene, with only hints at it through dialog and some flashbacks really; the previous story was effectively just tossed out. It felt like reverse power-creep because the ""big bad"" of this campaign didn't seem that impactful compared to 4 and 5, and the actually threatening enemy barely got screentime and felt like was cut short. Open world is an interesting idea, but it leads to very same-y gameplay and scenery, and the missions just feel like dungeons and not the dedicated experience like they've felt like in previous games. It feels way more like a sandbox game and less like an intimate and tailored campaign experience that Halo is usually. If I had to rank 343's campaigns, it would go in order of release: 4 > 5 > Infinite. The actual gameplay is fine, but the story as-is was a huge miss. Also, no legendary completion reward is pretty lame.

The open world is actually pretty well done, and I do enjoy going around and finding all the hidden audio logs, etc. that are scattered around. I just don't think it fits the narrative and cinematic heavy experience I usually want from Halo.

Campaign spoiler complaints:
[spoiler]Cortana being defeated *and* dying off-screen is a WILD thing to do to one of *the most* iconic and impactful characters in the canon; it should have been an intimate, emotional experience. The Infinity (the *largest and most advanced vessel ever developed*) just being completely destroyed off screen to a random enemy no one has heard of in-game is wild. The Endless seemingly being invented out of nowhere and not even utilized felt like a bad ret-con, the story felt like just a big cliffhanger that didn't even feel good. If the story was set earlier, with us deploying the Weapon and fighting to combat Cortana and the Banished, it would have made a much better story imo.

The game is a lot more fun than it used to be and has received some great updates regarding lessening the FOMO, Forge, BP and Customisation. The game-play is still the best since Halo 3 but the lack of content back when it was released could not accommodate or heighten its potential even further.

Infinite has better value when it comes to the BP thanks to it never expiring which should be a common practice but I'm at least glad that Halo, a franchise known for setting standards, its still doing that even if its to a smaller degree.

The community maps and experiences are worth a try and its what will keep the game alive until the next game, if there even is to be another game. As warning however, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT buy anything from the store unless its a the HCS skins or something that will only cost 100 credits. The shop is one of the worst in the industry and nearly destroyed one of Halo's core pillars which was customisation, an aspect that is very important in expressing yourself and to show accomplishments. YOU CAN EARN Master Chiefs armour just by going up the career rank which is a fine reward although more could have been added as it will take a long time to achieve.

Check the game out, its a lot more fun but the fact it launched in the way it did almost 2 years ago now is insane and thank god 343 went through a complete restructure, getting rid of all the bad eggs as a result of this game not being the most financially successful, whether or not the new management will help put Halo in a good spot, is yet to be seen as it is too early to tell.














Fun Campaign but the overall package is a pathetic excuse for a video game especially when compared to previous Halo games. I've been playing halo for almost 20 years and whilst they have found a nice balance between old gameplay with a new level of verticality and movement, the content (or lack thereof) for the multiplayer is inexcusable and not worth your time.

Honestly, with the lack of communication and honest to god care from 343, this game aside from campaign, is not worth your time or money for those who want the armor and battle pass.

there are still issues, the worst of which, in my opinion, being the matchmaking. their system of ""skill based"" matchmaking is probably the worst SBMM of any game I've ever seen. It will literally predetermine who the winner of each match should be and give that particular team players with a significantly higher skill rating than the other team to make sure they win, so they can guarantee each player has a ""mixed bag of wins and losses"" 

in essence, nearly every match you play will feel like an absolute steamroll one way or the other, and it has a tendency to take the fun out of the game after playing long enough if you aren't an absolute die hard fan of the game.

- add in popular classic and old maps from Halo CE-5 to add more variety in matchmaking. Lately most matches have been playing on the same 2-3 maps out of what? 5? Which gets boring over time. 

- getting rid of the paying system and start using a earn-to play system like Reach did and fix the customization which will make the game be more interesting.  Every spartan in the game doesn't have their own character style and everyone seems to be the same. Players want that uniqueness that stands out. 

-Add in game mode selection than having players randomly pop in a random game-mode match. I get it random makes it fun but when it's constantly the same  match after match. Some people just want to play slayer without objectives or vice versa. 

-Change infection style to Halo 4  flood spartans to make it fun or atleast add a design mechanic to allow players pick AI infected or Flood infected forms customization.

The sandbox is still pretty terrible (several different weapons which can EMP vehicles across the map because they are ALL, seemingly, hitscan), seems to favour long range hitscan weapons which turn every squad battle/BTB match into a shooting gallery, and there has only been one new weapon since launch.

The motion tracker remains useless - a trait which has been carried over from Halo 5. Now those eyes in the back of your head won't matter because by the team an enemy player appears on the radar, they are already halfway up your rear. Why they gave the tracker a shorter range after giving players the ability to infinitely sprint? Don't know.

Hit detection still seems to be weird and it seems I'm not the only one. Sometimes my bullets feel like they're disappearing into thin air shortly after leaving the barrel. Other times I'm somehow capping people around corners with the BR. Or they're doing the same to me.

Community features like theatre, custom games and the custom games browser seem to have been left to rot. They remain broken and they have been broken since launch. In theatre's case, it has been broken since Halo 4. Which came out in 2012. For some reason pre-game and post-game lobbies have been shelved and it has been this way since Halo 5. Met someone in a match you wanted to hang with? Too bad, you'll never see them again after the match. I mean, you could go into the carnage report and find their GT through there, but it's less convenient.

Lots of graphical issues too. Vehicle explosions look horrible. Vehicle damage models are now only marginally better than release - which isn't saying much at all. And some of them still haven't even got damage models. They still handle very poorly, and their armour is made out of cardboard.

Majority of armour pieces are still locked behind paywalls, or vaulted or shoved into bundles of other things you don't want. Speaking of armour, colours are still monetised. Including ones which were free in previous games. The lack of Red VS Blue also means that some players can arbitrarily blend into the environment depending on which map is being played on, meaning you won't know a dude is there till they are firing at you. Outlines do not solve the problem as they are far too faint and take longer to register than a full-body colour.

Oh and still no playable Elites. No I don't care if they're ""unbalanced"", keep them out of competitive, problem solved. Halo isn't a ""Spartan story"" and never has been. It has a far larger, richer universe than ""muh superheroez"" but for some reason this company seems hell bent on ignoring the most popular alien species in the franchise.

And all of this isn't even mentioning the issues with the Campaign.",1698287461,1698287461,False,216,18,0.68027108907699585,0,True,False,False

The game has issues with MTX, progression, pacing, and some overall issues that if battlepass progression is what interests you, I'd wait. 

If you came for the gameplay, I cannot recommend more.  This game is the most fun Halo I've had in a long time, Infinites Sandbox is crazy diverse and everything serves a purpose, modes are a little lacking and events are still in the beginning.  Overall, fun gameplay, lacking some modes and battlepass progression as well as MTX need a rework bad.

Update: As of writing this we're a week into season 5 and i can very much recommend playing the game.  Yes MTX are still pretty annoying, yes desync is still a thing, not as bad as of recent though, but the game has added quite a bit content and brought back old favorites such as infection and extraction.  The game is very much improving and each season is outdoing the last, definitely becoming one of the better f2p games out there, I can strongly recommend giving it a shot or a second chance if you already tried before, I promise you wont regret it.",1637810785,1698200268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I still believe the campaign is a massive letdown in terms of the game play and storytelling that the Halo series has been renowned for. The multiplayer also launched in a very rough shape, with very limited customisation, limited game modes, infection, or forge.

That being said, two years later the multiplayer is finally in a good enough state that I can recommend it. 

The moment-to-moment game play is great. All the guns feel well balanced and great to use. The wide variety of maps and game modes means there’s always an enjoyable experience to be had regardless of your preferences.

The customisation is extremely in-depth. I’m still not thrilled with the whole armour core system, but at least the base each core is unique in their own way, and work is being made towards some items becoming universal across all cores.

The expansive armour unlocks through the battle pass system means that even with a micro transaction store component, it’s possible to make a unique looking spartan through just dedicated game play. The battle passes don’t expire once purchased, so you can work on any previous battle pass that contains the armour customisation you want.

One multiplayer negative aspect is, like every multiplayer game these days, the monetisation.  Store items can only be purchased as a fairly expensive bundle. See a helmet you want? It’s likely in a bundle with a coating you won't use, a helmet you won't use, a visor you won't use, and knee pads you won't use for $10. It's also got a somewhat predatory FOMO store, with rotating stock that may or may not return at a later date.

In conclusion, I'd definitely recommend at least trying out Halo: Infinite's multiplayer. If you played the multiplayer at launch and were dissatisfied, I'd recommend giving it another chance.",1662135120,1698195473,True,0,0,0.503472208976745605,0,True,False,False

Comments disabled, kinda like the poster themselves and less than 20 minutes of game play on record. What an absolute joke. This game had a poor launch and until the latest season release, I stayed away. Now after coming back, this game is as it should've been. The maps are fun as hell, especially the community made ones for CTF. Forge with AI opens up way more possibilities than reach or 3 ever could. Oh yeah, you get over 30 maps to forge with. The re-skin of some og halo 3 maps is really cool, especially the pit. Kind of reminds me of a feudal temple with its wooden interior. 

As for the battle pass...Does it suck we can't unlock all the cosmetics without forking over $10? yeah, but for casual gamers it's not really a pressing issue. Yes, the skins are cool but its not a pay to win scheme so do with that what you will.

Overall, if you were hesitant on giving it another chance, call a friend and have them get on with you. My friend and I did that last night and we couldn't log out, it was just that much fun. Oh yeah, you can talk to the other team while in the middle of the match. The amount of verbal mud flinging almost reminded me of the good days....the lawless times of the xbox 360 chat lobbies.

I will leave my original review below as some of what I have stated before still plagues the game however I feel that this game can only continue to go up.

Original Review:
Play MCC instead if you want to play Halo, this game is not optimized at all and is rarely fun. Desync issues, input lag, extremely long loading times for no reason, the UI and menu is a NIGHTMARE to use. This game shoves battle passes and the IRL money shop down your throat for customization. The campaign is a complete joke and feels unfinished not only in story but in gameplay too. They expect us to purchase books/comics to finish the stories they tell in games instead of just telling a full story in game. Enemies would just randomly despawn in front of you with drop ships constantly running on a loop then despawning in front of your eyes. The only plus side to campaign is there is a big area to explore but once you finish the story there is rarely anything to do. I only play the a few games of multiplayer in the rare instance I do play this game and everytime I do I remember why I don't play it, it ins't fun.",1689411943,1698149309,True,0,0,0.502268850803375244,0,True,False,False

343 had a golden goose, this could have been the perfect Halo game. But they messed it all up.

A broken challenge system that forces you to play THEIR way to progress, predatory micro-transactions, rampant server and desync issues that haven't been fixed 116 days after launch, a complete disregard/disconnect from the community's feedback, broken UI, terrible performance even on a high end PC, removing staple franchise features (i.e. armor cores/armor coatings), no new content in 4 months (no maps, no weapons, only cosmetic items. Mostly paid...), campaign performance is even worse than mulitplayer, no co-op in campaign, and almost no communication to community from devs.

343 should be ashamed of themselves for the blatant predatory micro-transactions and lack of content, and for the complete mismanagement of one of the biggest franchises in video gaming. I was so excited for this game to come out, and I was completely disappointed. As a fan of this franchise for over 20 years, I am heartbroken to give this game a negative review. 

I refuse to end this review without stating at least one thing I like about the game. I like the design of the game, and a return to more classic aesthetics. Whoever designed the armor in the game, I hope you get what you want for Christmas.

I will joyfully update this review if they fix/improve this game.

The gameplay is solid (mostly, don't even get me started on those stupid power seeds), but the story is rough and feels lazily written. The environments and levels are very repetitive (like the end of halo 1) all of the most interesting events happen off-screen and you don't get to participate in them. Very little work was done to bridge the gap between the previous games and this one. Established lore is often disregarded to setup a terrible story point that simply doesn't make in-universe sense. They didn't have a good villain so instead of making one they just make a brute monologue at you a lot. The writers wanted humanity on the back-foot but didn't care how they got there, which means a very lazy way to reset the power dynamic in-universe. 

The saving grace would be the multiplayer, but the way they've setup armor customization unlocks leaves a lot on the table. That combined with the lack of effective anti-cheat makes multiplayer a miserable grinding experience.

2. The main menu got a small visual overhaul but still works the same, is laggy as hell and difficult to navigate.
3. Connection issues all over the place, hit registration is often wonky. Why do I need an internet connection to play Forge by myself???
4. They added a small XP bonus for Custom Games (big W) but joining one doesn't seem to work 60% of the time.
5. 20 bucks for a skin is not a microtransaction anymore, that's just a regular transaction.
6. Cross-core helmets good, coating system still bad and not fully cross-core, does not even allow you to color individual limbs/parts.

The gameplay is great, arguably the best a Halo game has had since 2010, but that's all there really is right now. Between the challenges that force you to play modes you otherwise wouldn't, the lack of map variety that makes it boring to play after about half an hour, and some things are still broken or missing almost 9 months after launch, Infinite desperately needs either a miracle or a complete relaunch in order to recover.

And there's cross-core customization now, which is great!

The weak part of this game is the Campaign, which had some great ideas with the whole open-world thing and good gameplay mechanics, but never really delivered a great story. Though, I do appreciate the regular Grunts being funny again. Halo 4 and 5 were lacking the humor the Grunts bring to the Covenant.

-They have literally fixed nothing. The menus are still SH#T, still take forever to do anything.
-In custom games, none of the options selected actually save.
-Still no campaign over LAN. So still cant play with my GF who is right NEXT to me on the same network without like 300ping. 
-Just basic sh#t doesn't work properly- e.g. I got into a custom game and my movement speed was like 2%. I checked the movement speed in the options, (was set to default), started a new game and still the same. I started a whole new server and just selected a basic 343 mode, didn't change anything other than add bots, still movement speed at like 2%. I just wanted to check out the new levels by myself but can't even do that. I love Halo, but just give up with this game. Uninstalled. 

Old Review:
I'm a Halo fan since I got my first Xbox with Halo CE. The games in the Halo Trilogy are my favourite games of all time. 343 are ruining it. The campaign was pretty good... but the multiplayer isn't what I like about Halo. 

-Awesome that they finally released campaign CO-OP. But FFS was it that hard to let us play it over lan. Why do me and my GF both have to have 300 ping when we are sitting in the same room.

-I Hate that it is free to play! Yeah its free but I still bought the campaign on Steam because all the BS talk 343 does made me feel like I wanted to support the new direction they were going in. I have Xbox Game pass I could have played it there. 

-I HATE Micro-transactions. I HATE that players have a highlighted outline just so they can sell you colours. It takes away from immersion. I HATE the customisation, why can't it just be like the old games. I would have rather paid extra for the multiplayer upfront!

-I HATE that custom games is broken, I want to set up a game with my friends and goof around with heaps of customisation options, i.e. unlimited graple hook, or campaign weapons, unlimited grenades, using more than 1 equipment at a time etc. 

-I hate the UI- like when I click on maps just take me to the maps I have installed and have the '343 industries, popular, recommended, etc...' maps off to the side! I don't need to see that menu every time I try selecting a map or game mode! why do I then have to click again on another menu to bring up the maps that I have. 

-While in the menu, why does my GPU need to be at 100%, I don't need the menu to be at 200+ frames. Is it really that hard to add a frame rate limiter for the menu.

-I HATE that 343 trying to appeal to a greater audience therefor thinning out or changing things that made Halo great! Just make Halo! Focus on fixing all the other normal Halo stuff first, it feels so shallow compared to the original games. 

-Every other platform has awesome first party exclusives that aren't filled with micro transactions. PlayStation releasing their games on PC now is the best thing that has happened in such a long time!",1656021737,1697764972,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Terrible netcode which severely harms the multiplayer.
- Excessively overpriced cosmetics and unfulfilled promises related to them.
- Overtuned Skill Based Match Making in nearly every gamemode which either makes every game a sweatfest, or a poor team balance in which one player is expected to carry the rest.

Since launch the only things 343 have implemented that I would consider significant are:
- More selection for game types, which should have been there from the start. (such as Team Slayer)
- More stuff to unlock through a second battle pass, and event battle pass.
- More stuff you can buy in the shop.

THAT'S IT. In the 9 months this game has been out the live service model that was promised has been nothing more than a farce. I recommend waiting until season 3 or 4 when this game has fleshed out content, otherwise don't bother playing.

EDIT: It's season 5, game is pretty fleshed out. Forge and custom games are fantastic with official firefight right around the corner, though Forge has already effectively added firefight. Almost every game mode from previous Halos are here except an official race gamemode. Shop is a bit less of a mess, if you get the battle pass you're effectively guaranteed a helmet or pack in the shop or the next battle pass if you complete it.

(still played and got to diamond 4 in ranked) Game was okay but everyone stopped playing as did I. Picked it back up during season 4, infection release. Very fun gameplay and the game was alive again for the most part. They need more customization and ways to make your spartan unique without gating you so much to cores. (dumb system to this day). halo 3 was the  best followed by reach, if you think halo 5 was good, please go back to fortnite or cod because that tells me the type of gamer you are. When the original team got yeeted off halo inifinite it was the best thing to happen to the game, more content better customization, season 5 has been awesome. Forge is fantastic, custom games are alive and insanely fun. Give the game a shot if you are a halo fan, plays like halo 3, not like the attempt of halo 5 trash that ruined the game.

We will just have to wait and see if it's too little too late, only time will tell.

-------------------------------Original Review---------------------------------------
343i needs to go. Change the upper management, or pas the torch to a new development team. Halo is dying and it is all 343i's fault.

It breaks my heart to write this review. My introduction into gaming was Halo 3 split screen campaign at an old friends house. Loved it so much that I got my own xbox360 for xmas that holiday. I was in a kid then... I'm in my 20s now, and still love to game. But Halo is no longer the beloved franchise it used to be, and is no longer in my rotation of games I frequent. 

This game was not, and STILL IS NOT done. It NEEDED more time in the oven, at least 2-3 more years. Which baffles me, as a 6 year dev cycle is what brought us here. What the heck were 343i doing during 6 years of development??? The game lacks core features that have been staples of Halo since the franchise's inception. Halo CE had more fucking content at launch than Halo Infinite, and almost a YEAR LATER NOTHING HAS CHANGED. They will have 4 more maps at the end of the year... 4 maps and like 4 ""new"" game modes (that should have been there from day 1) in a whole year of a ""live service"" game. No. Unacceptable.

Halo DOES NOT NEED TO CHASE TRENDS. The game is already dead, and resources have been allocated to (alleged) develop a battle royale..? WHY NOT USE THOSE RESOURCES TO GET FORGE OUT THE DOOR SOONER, OR BRING THE PROMISED, and now NOT COMING SPLIT SCREEN!

343i is a dumpster fire. Get rid of them. They had 4 chances... Halo 4, Halo MCC, Halo 5 and now Halo Infinite and they have FAILED EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY LAUNCHED A NEW HALO.

Seeing the games I grew up loving getting mutilated by new art styles, trend chasing, battle passes, F2P nonsense, lack of content etc... just breaks my heart man. 343i needs management changes, or please for the love of god pass the series off to a new developer. One who will actually care.

The year is now 2023, and while the game has considerably improved in some areas, I'm not sure I can recommend it quite yet, if at all. Like many games using the ""games as a service"" model, a bad first impression can really tank the experience overall, especially when it starts out and continues to be monetized out the ass. Here's a small breakdown of notable changes:

- Netcode has improved, but still needs work
- Performance has improved significantly on PC, though results may vary
- Actual multiplayer playlists and not just 3 of them
- Customization is slowly being overhauled to allow more player freedom
- Forge is back and better than ever with forgeable campaign AI
- Playercount has gone up on Steam

Overall, it's not nearly as terrible of an experience as it was at launch. It might still be worth checking out if you're looking for a new multiplayer game to play, or if you just want to screw around with a damn good level editing kit, but my thumb shall remain in the downward position for the time being. Plus, with it being free to play, there's no real sense of commitment if you end up not liking it.

I can finally start recommending this game to others. Not just Halo fans, but also FPS players in general. 343 have truly started to right the wrongs of long gone leadership. And we have entered the stage in the game's development that there are things beyond what should have existed to begin with. 

Campaign AI in Forge is a [i]sizeable[/i] step for the franchise. For this to be natively available, instead of requiring mods, opens up the creative floodgates of the community. I can't wait to see what the Forge folks create. 

343 I still have my eye on you. However my rage is dissolving and behind it lies admiration. I'm excited to see what current team comes up with moving forward.

I am going to leave my original review for the game down below. To show how far this game has come (and remind myself to keep growing as well). 

[hr][/hr]

6/8/2022
Fuck you 343. As someone that Halo 3 was my intro to online multiplayer, the Halo franchise has been near and dear to me. You stumbled around with Halo 4 and Halo 5 but we all figured that third time is the charm.

Old review below
=======================================================================
[h1]This SUCKS.[/h1]
I don't understand how they fumbled the bag this hard. It was AWESOME at first, but the cracks became very apparent not even two months into the ""Live Service"".

The update cycle for the game is INCREDIBLY slow. There have been items in the game files since launch (Example; Reach's CQB and MK V helmets) that haven't appeared in either a Battlepass or even the store, the seasons are...six months long, for some reason. And the store itself is incredibly lackluster and leaves a LOT to be desired.

In terms of actual gameplay, there have been issues since the flights of the game that haven't been fixed - primarily desync, and melee connectivity (which is linked to desync as far as I'm aware). Countless times, I've hopped behind players and SHOULD HAVE been rewarded with a backsmack, but am PUNISHED INSTEAD because the game's servers are awful.

Annnd because I'm venting, here's a short list of all the issues I can think of [i]off the top of my head;[/i]

There is no red reticle for PC. Custom games are broken. I forgot Theater was even supposed to be part of the game because it doesn't work properly. There is [b]NO OVERALL PROGRESSION SYSTEM[/b] or [b]CAREER SYSTEM.[/b] The ranked playlist is abysmal. SBMM has ruined most of my casual matches, everything feels like a sweatfest. The main menu feels clunky and has no flow. The game refuses to run @ 144fps on a [I]3080 AND 12900K[/i] @1440p medium settings, in multiplayer.

The only reason I'm still playing this game is because I want the event pass items. Otherwise, if there's no progression system come season 3 (with backlogged leveling, preferably), I am uninstalling this mess. Halo has fallen from grace.

[b]tl;dr - Just play MCC.[/b]

[h1] Old Review Below [/h1] 
[spoiler]Progression system sucks. Store sucks. Some of the best gameplay in the entire series.
Very proud of 343 for delivering an amazing Halo experience, even if it has some quirks right now.

Edit: Original review written with 30 hours of playtime, currently sitting at 63 hours and 45% Campaign completion.
So far, the story is blowing me away, and 5 out of the water. It's definitely no jump-in for newer players, but it's up there with the original trilogy in terms of quality. It feels like a continuation of Halo 3, if anything. Only thing I'm not fond of is the Harbinger. Otherwise, Chief feels like a perfect mix of the original trilogy and Halo 4's more ""Human"" Chief. Emotional, but strong. The story itself has some very impactful moments right out of the gate.

The world itself is MASSIVE, the bounties are a lot of fun. Bosses aren't bullet sponges, they require thought. Clearing Banished settlements (FOBs and what I'll call ""Raids"", since I can't remember what the actual name is) is unique to each location, and some are harder to infiltrate than others. Some people think the sandbox is too limited for the campaign, but I personally don't mind it too much, with the exceptions of no Spartan Laser or Fuel-Rod Gun. I do heavily dislike the single-biome approach and hope that they add different biomes and weather in a future expansion.

Excited to see how the story goes. This truly is a return-to-form for Halo, and I can safely say it's tied up with Combat Evolved as my favorite Halo experience. 9.5/10, fix the multiplayer progression.[/spoiler]",1637487397,1697604680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Previous review:

The Multiplayer is frustrating because of melee desync. I'm bored of the few maps already. It seems like the good players have already left because even when I get a 20 kill game, my team still loses. The campaign is really good if that's your thing. The shop is really overpriced.

ORIGINAL:

I've played Halo since the very beginning.

I remember sitting on the floor with my dad, playing through every single game starting with the original Halo: CE.
I remember all the vehicles I ""tactically"" drove off the map because I didn't know how to drive in H2.
I remember sending my dad into a brute chieftain with a grav lift in H3.
I remember the sombre music and dark styling of ODST.
I remember playing through Reach countless times, making maps in forge and playing online. I remember having to survive, and the impact that had on me.

I remember having fun in custom games lobbies in 3 and Reach.
I remember making maps every night i got home from school in 3.
I remember walking around the empty multiplayer maps in CE and H2.

I remember the groundbreaking customisation of Reach.
I remember the meme but fun dual-wielding of H3. 
I remember firefight from OSDT and Reach.
I remember grinding so hard to get to the next rank, to show off my achievements to others.
I remember the feeling of the music in the main menu of every single game, sitting there with literal chills every time.

I don't remember games as a service
I don't remember having to wait months and months, at this point a year just to use forge
I don't remember having to pay for the color blue
I don't remember there being no lobbies at all
I don't remember static player emblems
I don't remember having to pay for the color blue #2
I don't remember having to pay the price of the original game for access to 2 cosmetic pieces.
I don't remember it ever being competitive

I remember the fun
I remember forge
I remember splitscreen
I remember my spartans

I remember what Halo was,
I choose to forget what halo has now become.

Please, devote your resources to bringing this in line with what made Halo great.
It's never been about being the next CoD or Battlefield, it beat them all so easily every time because it was different.

For the memory of those who have passed, for those who look at lobbies that were once filled with like-minded friends. For the people who turned to Halo as an escape.

I stuck with the game and since Winter Update, I think 343 has been trying to pull things around. Once the former leadership left, and especially with the release of Season 4, this game has done nothing but improve and show that the team is capable of putting out consistent content and actually want to listen to the community. I will admit, I was anxious that Season 5 would release with something broken or glitchy and all the new eyes would be discouraged. But Season 5 is more than I've ever seen on this game and it is fickin sick. Get off the Halo hate train and if you ever loved Halo and got discouraged and stopped playing or are trying the game for the first time and is curious, just try it. It's a free game, why not.

The combat is the best in the entire series; I killed myself just to replay some parts and the grapple hook is so fun: you can swing into enemies, grab guns, and gear with it, and of course you can swing around. The map is pretty good so far, there are a lot of stuff you can do, there are things to destroy, there are things to capture, there are bosses you can fight, and you can save marines, there are also dungeon like places where you can get armor for the multiplayer. There is the story, which is pretty good so far and the writing is very funny and clever. so I say it's worth $60 (the multiplayer is lackluster of course).",1650058577,1697590524,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Only 1 medium sized battle with vehicles and good Halo songs were only used during cut scenes and were short. No epic ending, just the 100th generic boss battle. I played through the first time on Legendary and I would say Halo 2 is still harder. The grappling hook is retarded and makes the game easy as fuck, you are a literal Master Chimp swinging around on vines. Not really into the open world stuff, but they at least got the fact that Master Chimp doesn't talk much right this time. Halo was about the good music, epic battles with vehicles, and the revisiting of locations to see how they have changed. They are hopefully going to make another Halo 3 out of the cut content.

Halo Infinite's campaign is honestly one of the best to date. 343 finally hit the nail on the head instead of slamming their thumbs. If you do not know anything about the previous games, they do a great job of making a story that doesn't rely TOO heavily on previous games. With that being said one of the main story points does rely heavily on a relationship built across the last 20 years of the game. 343 somehow manages to make this still welcoming to new players while rewarding returning players. Halo Infinite is deserving of the $60 price tag even if the campaign feels a little short. The open world aspect helps to fill the void of how short the story is. Overall the campaign is a solid 9/10 for me personally. 343 delivered a stellar campaign that has me excited for the next chapter of Halo.

Edited from here down:
When this multiplayer dropped it was pretty pitiful, but 343's new leadership has turned this game around. Tons of free content and with AI being added to forge, there are endless possibilities for custom games. People will rip on Micro transactions, but the truth is that this game has a more consumer friendly battle pass model than 99% of other games.

All of these things eventually led me to quit the game. 

I decided to give this game another chance and DAMN - this game has improved in every aspect. 
These are some of the things Halo infinite now has, but previously didn't at launch:

8v8 mode with iconic maps from previous halo titles
12v12 Big Team Battle with Heavy Vehicles/Weapons
INFECTION
Husky Raid (A new 4v4 where the map is just one narrow alley and you try to capture the other team's flag - my new favorite mode) 
Huge variety of customization with armors and effects (Most are still paid, but some of my favorites are free)
4v4 Ranked Sniper 

This game has made A LOT of improvements and they're headed in the right direction, but I would still love to see a game mode that is totally re-defining to the halo franchise (battle royale?) Regardless, I HIGHLY recommend giving this game (another) chance.

Side note - I haven't interacted with anything Forge related, but I've heard that it's quite robust now.

- Better Event rewards and a longer duration for each one
- A reward (Master Chief's Infinite armor as a kit) for the career ranks that were added not long prior, giving players a reason to grind for max
- Firefight (PvE horde mode) King of the Hill will be added part way through the season
- Many of the shop items that were once expensive are seeing a lower cost which seemingly continues to decrease with each season
- Every battlepass is still able to be finished with the currency earned from the previous one, so as long as you haven't spent any credits from one if you ever bought a pass before, you can use them to buy another pass, finish that one and earn its credits, and then repeat the process
- Passes have a more streamlined rewards system, with more rewards bunched into a single tier, and the amount of tiers in each pass has been dropped from 100 to 50. With the bundled tier rewards, the passes still have the same amount of content as before but are more rapidly attainable.
- The free tiers in each pass are now achievable in succession, rather than having to go through premium tiers to reach more free items like before
- If you have played it before, and enjoyed the gameplay but quit because of a lack of meaningful content, I can finally advise coming back to give it a second chance
- Forge now has campaign AI tools, so enthusiastic creators can make fun PvE experiences for the custom games browser

I played it around launch  when the hype and goodwill was still there but soon quit because there just wasn't much to do after finishing the campaign. MP was barebones and custimisation was absolutely horrible.
Now, more than a year later, it doesn't look that different, unfortunately. They still charge you 20€ for the colour white in a pack in a shop. We got one new weapon which is just another semi auto rifle and it isn't even available in the campaign. Speaking of: the campaign didn't get a single update since launch aside from the enabling of coop which should've been there since the start.

Halo Infinite tries to be both: An old Halo game with a proper Campaign and MP 
and 
a live service game.
But 343 fails to deliver on both fronts. Yet the core gameplay is good enough to make me WANT to like it but everything around the game just doesn't sit well. Really a pity to see such a big franchise dwindle like this.

The skill based match making makes life harder for them and easier on me when we play together as a way to try and balance win rates a bit or something. Its not to the point where they can't do well but its always harder for them when we play together.

I guess in regards to monetization the battle pass system is pretty good if you care about unlocking stuff since they never expire.

The Story Mode for Halo is definitely worth 60 bucks, because it not only lets you enjoy the peak story cutscenes, but it also lets you explore, and prepare for the combat in multiplayer mode.

The battle pass system is literally the best in the f2p platform, you get some pretty good stuff and even then we get events every month you don't need to pay for and completely free to participate in. so damn good.

of course it's not without it's issues, UI could use a clean up, they made helmets cross-core compatible, but being able to mix and match ALL you're armor pieces should've been in launch but that's not that big a deal. Also the lack of collision physics between players really needs to be addressed.

All that asside I'm still loving the game and what' it's become. I really hope we start getting stuff from the old games like assassinations from reach, 4, and 5, weapons, vehicles, but for now the game is amazing and it's definitely is getting slept on.

I grew up with Halo and still love the lore and universe, but Halo Infinite somehow every time I boot it up, skyrockets my depression after an hour of playing it.

Wondering where the fun of Halo went, just to realize here we are near 2 and a half years later getting something slightly close to ""Firefight"" and that you've been forced to play against virgin sweatlords emptying Aderal like a child with a container of Flintstones gummies NONSTOP FOR ALL THAT TIME, and don't even GET ME STARTED ON CHALLENGES. --- DID YOU NOT LEARN YOUR LESSON 343???

The answer is yes. If you want to see for yourself, the game is free, so the only harm is in you not checking for yourself and accepting the words of others.

Halo infinite is rapidly shaping up to be a tale of redemption on par with Cyberpunk 2077 and No Man's Sky. After a truly disastrous launch, the game's recent seasons have been outdoing every other shooter on the market. Here's a quick summary of what's changed:

Maps: 
We've gotten 40 maps, (yes, really 40!) including high quality forge remakes of classic 8v8 Halo maps in their own dedicated 8v8 playlist called Squad Battles, in the last 4 months. I don't think any other game out there comes close to that release schedule.

Multiplayer Modes and Playlists: 
Most classic modes are back, with more on the way. There isn't really a classic multiplayer mode I find myself wanting for. The playlists are fun and rotate frequently. At any given time, there's somewhere between 10-12 playlists running. Season 5 is bringing back Extraction.

Progression and Rewards: 
Events are more frequent, Battlepasses are better, customization has improved a lot. Season 5 (launching one week after this review) is bringing cross core helmets, and likely more. There is also a classic progression system with military ranks similar to Halo: Reach. The max rank reward for the progression system is the ability to look like Master Chief in Multiplayer for the first time in any Halo game. I personally consider this major sticking point from the game's launch almost completely fixed up.

Custom Games and Forge: 
The customs browser works great, and forge is easily the most advanced level editor for players in any game. Starting with Season 5 next week, Custom Games will grant XP for progression and Forge will allow for enemy AI placement, allowing people to make Firefight, H5 style Warzone, or anything else they can imagine. Halo Infinite has easily the most robust Custom Games and Forge of any entry in the series.

PvE: 
Season 5 is bringing Forgeable campaign AI for the first time in a halo game, and the mid season update is bringing Firefight to multiplayer. If PvE is what you have been waiting for, the wait is over.

Netcode: 
This is the big one. Things have improved a lot. There has been no single silver bullet update that single-handedly erased the rough netcode, but the game has slowly gotten much more stable. I'd say 80% of my games are completely without issue, and the remaining issues are largely small like being shot around a corner once or twice a game. Compared to launch, the game feels totally different.

Overall, Halo Infinite has been maybe the biggest comeback story of any shooter. The game is now in a state I can call great, maybe even the best multiplayer of the series. If you love halo, or you love shooters, the game is free, so the only thing you have to do is click install.

My original review, preserved as a testament to how far the game has come:

This game is what happens when a developer does nothing for 6 years, only for their boss to arrive and tell them to actually release it. Halo infinite is Microsoft's best first party game in more than a decade and is still an empty, barely functional, straight up depressing game to play. It might be free, but if time is money, this game is worth no time. Despite being marketed as a ""live service,"" which on its own should be enough to make you stay away, the game has received nothing more than some extra armor in the six months since launch. The second multiplayer season, which will last another six months, will feature a whole two new maps, bringing the total to still less than what previous games had at launch. This game is an embarrassment and needed another two years of development time easy, and whoever ordered its release just to line up with Halo's 20th anniversary should be ashamed and reassigned. They got some things right at least: the OST and sound design are almost on par with classic Halo, and the art direction is pretty close too. Like everything else with this game though, they both need ""more,"" as neither feels like it stands up to what came before it. The campaign, gameplay wise, is very fun, but the writing is really weak and you can absolutely tell that there was much more planned, only for it to be cut during development hell. The graphics are also pretty sub par in the campaign, with really bad lighting and distance rendering in the open world. MP looks fine, at least, but campaign is definitely not the next gen system seller they wanted it to be. The monetization is horrendous, so much so that 343 is already backpedaling with Season 2, with an underwhelming first season Battlepass and an overpriced MTX store on top of the 60 dollar separate charge for the campaign. At the very least, it is clear that the developers want to make the game better, but the suits above them ruined a lot, and they don't have the staff left due to Microsoft's terrible contracting policies and 343's terrible management to update the game quick enough. If this game released 2 years from now, it would be the best halo game, but since it's out now, I don't know if I, or anyone, will be around to see if it's better by then instead.",1650652736,1697211172,True,0,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

There is weight to your movements, whether running, shooting, reloading, making/delivering pipe-bombs, it all feels quite sensational. A fine balance exists with Thomas Halo of weight and agility, due to the fact Timothy Halo being a super-soldier, so weapons don't appear too heavy or cumbersome for James Halo.
Next the sound design is superb. Darwin Halo brought back some killer music with some freshies. Not only that, but the guns sound delicious, so good you could eat them like the floorboards beneath you. Even the basic guns are fun to shoot. Extra medium sized plus from me.
Big George Halo's art style is really nice, very clean, easy to look at, not over done and cluttered like the dishes in your kitchen, but simply pleasing to the eye. However I do wish sometimes the environments looked better graphically.
There are some negatives however (like your dishes) I would like to address.
Unfortunately Karen Halo smoked 'Battlepass' and 'An unfathomable amount of microtransactions' with CoD and Fortnite, therefore destroying much of the progression seen in the past (Chalooby Halo), and putting paywalls in front of simple cosmetics.

[THE GOOD]

It has a decently looking map (for the most part and using max graphics) with really fun gameplay. I really went in expecting the open world to not fit Halo at all but it works out very very well. Decent amount of places to go and while there isn't a whole lot of variety, it definitely feels like realistic terrain that you can immerse yourself in. The sound effects are very good and the weapons all feel useful for the most part (besides the shotgun). The music is so good as well honestly some of the best Halo OST I have ever heard from 343i and dare I say some are better than some of Bungie's OST. It's amazing fighting so many enemies from all over and really makes you have to change up your playstyle a lot but in a good way, you truly do feel like a badass spartan fighting an entire faction of enemies.

The abilities are all very useful and fun to use as well especially the grappleshot. The random generated enemy spawns are a nice way to make things feel fresh and I like the attention to detail with enemy dialogue where they comment more in depth with what occurs (ex. I kill elites and grunts come out a door and ask ""What's taking so long are you guys done with him yet?"" which I find awesome. Spawning weapons and vehicles at the FOBs and gearing up a squad is cool. The wildlife is a nice touch to the atmosphere but there isn't much compared to other games.

There are plenty of things to do besides the mediocre/awful story. There are FOBs to capture that you can then fast travel to or spawn weapons/vehicles at. You can do high value targets which reward you with special variants of weapons that you can then spawn at FOBs. You can find captured marines to save. You can infiltrate big bases and do objectives that lead to capturing them. You can find tons of audio data entries from both UNSC and Banished, cosmetics, and spartan cores which are used to permanently upgrade abilities. I also like how everything is cataloged so you can look back at after the fact or re-listen to data entries.

[THE BAD]

Where do I begin? The story is god awful. Go here, press a button, get ambushed, run through the open world with lackluster random encounters of enemies sometimes, small interior killing enemies, boss fight, emotional cutscene plays that has nothing to do with Halo. That's basically how it feels in the main story. Chief talks a lot differently in this and it just feels weird. He really feels like a different character in this even if he doesn't speak much. The other two main characters aren't really entertaining. Main enemies are meh at best.

*There are a lot of bad design choices and gameplay/technical issues as well as some glitches in this game. Some noteworthy things I experienced are:

1. You have to use the min/max fps setting and set them to the same value for frame pacing to look normal.
2. Lots of weapons/vehicles despawn if you get even a room away sometimes (when I went to try to ride the scorpion to ""The House"", it de-spawned as well as my teammates when I went forward a tiny bit to clear out enemies so they wouldn't damage the tank).
3. The map will sometimes glitch out and go to random places or sometimes when spawning you will have it open randomly and also the map closes if you hit a load zone which is annoying when you use a banshee and check your map because the game doesn't freaking pause when you have the map open so you'll slowly fly passed load zones which close whatever you were looking at.
4. Invisible walls everywhere that split the islands up even when you could clearly make it across and probably were just overlooked by the devs in some situations.
5. The audio logs and forerunner rings are messed up where say you collect #6 it will actually count as collecting #1 sometimes which makes finding the ones you missed SO confusing.
6. It's hard to navigate around to find audio logs and spartan cores because of the clutter on the map without any filters to specify what you want to see.
7. Banshees will magically despawn mid-fight when riding past a load zone which can be quite obvious when fighting them and they just get removed from existence.
8. Forced visual hitmarkers that cannot be disabled (you can only disable audio hitmarkers).
9. Vehicles barely have any visual damage before deciding to blow up.
10. Hijacking an enemy wraith just puts you in the turret and makes the driver get out. Also shooting banshees makes the driver jump out before it blows up which just looks silly as they fall to their obvious death so jumping out was pointless 99% of the time for them.
11. Scorpion tank can only have a driver/gunner and no other passengers.
12. Ammo feels way too generous since there are ammo depot boxes everywhere.
13. Plasma pistol doesn't stun vehicles because 343i wants you to use their new shock damage to make it seem like they invented a new mechanic when Bungie already had one in place.
14. Jackals speak English now for whatever reason, which just feels off and out of place.
15. It's borderline impossible to do close combat against a hunter on heroic/legendary because they fire at you even at point blank range instead of using melee attacks (very rarely they will try to melee you) and also they sound like dinosaurs which I mean whatever but it does feel out of place just like the Jackals do.
16. You literally can't kill teammate AI at all which is something you could always do in Halo so now there is no more fun in getting marines to fight you. They don't drive vehicles or follow for very far. Useless.
17. Open world feels lacking in detail and stuff to do besides killing enemies in the same way.

MULTIPLAYER

[THE GOOD]

Some levels look pretty and have decent design. I like new game modes such as the one with power seeds. The weekly challenges are generous. Forge is incredible along with the custom game browser. Some guns feel more useful like AR.

[THE BAD]

This is utter trash. You can tell they focused heavily on ""launch this, work on it later"" and just expect to drip feed small content every few months. The playerbase is low and for good reasons. All the weapons are basically trash besides like the AR, sidearm, cindershot, and power weapons. After playing the campaign I can clearly tell these weapons were designed for campaign first, as they actually work well there just not here.

The sprinting sucks I know many will disagree but I hate how people just run around all over the place. I miss when people felt incentivized to use vehicles in MP and there was a lot more variables in combat. Also the cosmetic system is garbage. No playable elites or red v blue anymore since now there are outlines which make it feel way too easy to spot players it just feels weird.

Lots of de-sync issues and bots are basically useless and only benefit the enemy team when they join especially in Team Slayer. Game modes like King of the Hill make no sense how they changed the way you earn points. Oddball is so lame because of you have the skull, you don't kill enemies with 1 melee anymore and instead is the normal 2 melee while not being able to sprint or use abilities or anything. This is a huge disadvantage to holding the skull and I feel like is the reason many don't even go after the objective here.

★All in all, the game has some great elements to it and also some areas where you can tell 343i really tried to get back in the roots, but this is still far detached from the Halo games we grew up with and even worse than Halo 4/Halo 5 in some area.

Campaign:  Overall, I'm impressed.  Halo works surprisingly well for an open world, the classic Halo gameplay makes for a fun outing on Zeta Halo.  The minor progression system (similar to Doom 2016's progression system) and goodies around the map are rewarding and gives exploration a pay off.  I enjoy the mix of open world and linear levels, although I would say the linear level sections are superior to play through.  New weapons and enemies serve a good niche and I love unlocking the ""souped up"" versions of regular weapons from open world enemies you defeat. The story is worth telling and the characters and environments are compelling enough to get you to want to learn more.  Bosses in Halo Infinite are the best Halo has ever had as well standoffs with your common enemies! I would say there are some weaknesses in Infinite's campaign... that being that the 2-weapon system and multiplayer-size ammo capacities do not hold up well to something like Borderlands 4-weapon slots with 5 billion weapon varieties.  I also think there are some other less adjusted parts of the sandbox, that being generally weak (and single occupancy) vehicles and the marines taking the backseat on combat as power weapon holders in your troop carrier. In other words, they are good for shooting enemies and dying, if you want more you can always fast travel to the base to pick more up, there is not a limited number of marines in the campaign which makes saving them less significant.  Anyway, those weaknesses are minor, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives and you should give this game a play, it feels just like the good old games that take place on Halo rings!

Multiplayer:  This multiplayer is probably my favorite in the series.  I believe that Halo Infinite has hit the sweet spot on adding a different element to the golden triangle (Weapons, Melee, Grenades), that being their inclusion of equipment!  The equipment is similar to armor abilities of the past, however these are pick up only and have limited charges, meaning you will need to find another if it runs out. The movement and sandbox is good and makes the game as team oriented as ever.  The maps are well designed and objectives are fun, and the recent inclusion of forge allows more potential for custom games.  There is not every mode of the past represented in Infinite's multiplayer (infection, race, etc.) but there are more game modes on the way with every update.  I would say the only place the multiplayer is lacking would be that it needs more updates, namely more maps, weapons, and especially equipment, as more variety never hurt and keeps the game from getting too stale.

Seems the change in leadership at 343 has done wonders, because there's WAY more content now than there was at release and first 2 seasons. It's great to see more people playing this game again. They've also changed the challenge system in a way that the challenges are actually reasonable, so Battle Pass progression is way more performance-friendly now that most challenges are things like ""Kill 5 enemy spartans with headshots"" and stuff like that.

As for the multiplayer, I didn't like it. Going from halo 3 and Reach to this feels too different. The battle pass isn't appealing. And armors don't really mean anything. Before certain armor pieces reflected a ton of hard work and solving puzzles and campaign Easter eggs and so on. Now you just have to either buy them or have the battle pass and level up.

*Old Review*
Gameplay is great,  But it is lacking greatly in content. All previous titles launched with 10x more content. 
Microtransactions are pretty ridiculous as well. High prices and alot of armor locked behind a paywall where as other Halo titles allowed you to unlock armor through gameplay. 
Oh also desync is terrible. Fix these issues and it just might just be my favorite Halo game. Until then it gets a negative review from me.",1642570854,1696738068,True,0,0,0.468033760786056519,0,True,False,False

1240440,147815295,76561199238322827,0,3,3457,0,1894,1705633779,"Let's begin with the multiplayer suite, since that released twenty-eight or so days before the campaign. It was, to be frank, a barebones but solid experience for quite a lengthy period of time. Now, however, it's enjoying regular content updates and lots of community love through Forge maps. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it from the start, and for me it was a massive step up from the previous game in terms of connection quality. I was constantly being kicked out of games with no warning and sometimes with matchmaking penalties in Halo 5: Guardians. Thankfully, there's been virtually none of that match ejection nonsense in my experience playing Halo Infinite PvP. Moving on to something more positive! This game has, in my opinion, the best sandbox in the series so far. The weapons sound good, yes, but they play well too. The Battle Rifle is trusty, the Commando is useful for those who prefer more control over their utility weapon, and the Sidekick is just that—a faithful companion to whip out in close quarters combat. The new Banished weapons don't just fill the same basic roles as their human counterparts; they each have something unique to offer and don't make the sandbox feel overcrowded or homogeneous. The Pulse Carbine is great for softening opponents' shields, or going for a show-off kill (it's challenging to land all the shots in two pulses to kill an opponent). The Ravager is good for area denial, and the Mangler echoes the original M6D pistol from Halo 1, but with a more balanced set of traits, namely a smaller ammunition capacity, bullet drop, and slower rate of fire. The new equipment items are fantastic map pickups and they enhance the flow of multiplayer matches, such as the Repulsor, which you can use to ascend levels or push enemies into walls or over map boundaries to their doom. The Drop Wall is a way to briefly fortify a position, but can't be used to break the flow of matches in the same way as the bubble shield from Halo 3, since it can be destroyed from the front. And the Grappleshot? Oh, this is so. much. fun. You can grab weapons, pull yourself to opponents, and swing like Spider-Man across structures. It feels good to use and it looks so stylish when you pull off a counter-play with it. There's a lot more weapons, equipment, and vehicles I could talk about, but I don't want to make this review tooo long.  The only thing keeping this multiplayer suite from being a 10/10 for me is probably the lack of true offline play, which is crazy since this is the first Halo to officially feature multiplayer bot players. If they add offline capability, it would definitely be a 10/10. 

Now, for the campaign... 

I loved it. So, so much. I grew up reading the Halo novels—in fact, I read The Fall of Reach as a kid before I played through any of the games (my parents couldn't afford a game console at the time). That book shaped my perception and biases toward the Halo universe, and it defines the Master Chief for me. He's not an empty husk for the player to inhabit, he's a person with distinct traits and his own character, to which I personally can relate, at least on some level. Thankfully, I didn't have to go through kidnapping and physical augmentation. I've read most of the novels in the series, and played through almost all of the games, and there's been a remarkable consistency in the writing for the Master Chief. Halo Infinite is no exception.

This campaign is a character study of the Master Chief, and it shows that beautifully. The open world is fun, and as others have pointed out, it's essentially an expanded version of the original level Halo from the titular game. The enemy AI for the Banished is amusing, intelligent, and challenging. It makes them seem extremely competent, and certainly more deadly than the Covenant (except Halo 2's Jackal Snipers, of course). The Grappleshot enhances just about everything because of its versatility, and the combat is satisfying. 

I won't go into spoiler territory anymore than I already have, but suffice it to say that this is my favorite modern Halo campaign. It's absolutely stellar.",1696698963,1696698963,True,46,2,0.692138373851776123,0,True,False,False

With the 'Winter Update' is the best update for Halo Infinite so far! Forge Beta is out, the campaign finally has Co-Op, and XP seems to be easier to earn. Although this game still has a lot of content updates to be added, I'd say I'd recommend this game right now. Finally Forge is in beta and so far I've seen some beautiful maps, modes, and straight up meme maps which is great! Hopefully when Forge is out of beta there will be a Customs Games Browser for Infinite. I'm glad it's going in a good direction. Co-Op Campaign was really needed and being able to replay missions on the fly is also fantastic up to 4 players. The open world is still boring in my opinion but the main missions are very good and they've even added some more achievements! =]

Season 3: Echos Within - One of the biggest Infinite updates yet! It added many new maps, from the developers and plus some from the community. Plus some new armor cores, such as the Chimera and Mirage and a new weapon the Bandit; it's just a descoped DMR. Overall this is a pretty good update.

Season 4: Infection - Is another big update for the game. It finally added Infection to the playlist and 343 has done a great job changing the look for some maps just for the gamemode! Instead of it being infected flood Spartan's they added the infected AI which is actually cool and a unique spin on the gamemode. Later in the season they had the Tenrai III event and added Japanese community themed maps and more modes to play. Plus in this update they finally added a Career Rank to Infinite! It's not as much as a grind as The Master Chief Collection or Halo 5: Guardians which is fantastic in my opinion. The Ranks are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Onyx, and lastly Hero rank. Personally think it's the second best ranking system in the Halo series falling right behind the original Halo: Reach. Season 5 is around the corner and I'm currently Corporal Platinum Grade 2 and I've taken a few weeks off from playing and grind out only a few days a week. All around a good update!

Original Review: As I hate to write a bad review for a Halo game; Infinite is not it. This game had so much potential to be a good if not really close to being on par with Halo 3, but alas no. It's true if you've heard that this game has a lack of content when it comes to the multiplayer portion. As of writing this review I have 61 hours on Steam and another 100 on Xbox. I've also been a fan of the franchise since 2003 a few months after the original release of Combat Evolved. 

Multiplayer: It is just so bare bones compared to the likes of Halo 3 or even Halo: Reach. The customization options are good and there but you can't execute what you want without paying money even if you can't mix and match armor sets yet like in Reach and the cosmetic shop is abysmal. No way to earn good rewards by playing normally. Some of the maps are good and some are just eh. I feel like nowadays I play a few games and hop off to something else because the sandbox doesn't feel like Halo. (It does, but it doesn't??) and if the rumors are true and they are moving from the Slipspace Engine to Unreal then Godspeed 343.

Leveling UP: Well, there's actually none whatsoever. They only thing you can level up is your battlepass. No SR (Spartan Ranks) nothing like that. When the game was announced I was hoping for a reach style of leveling but that obviously wasn't the case and thought also it could've been the lazy style of SR like in Halo 4, and Halo 5: Guardians (plz put Halo 5 on Steam 343 lul) but they instead chose to have nothing.. (Starting in Season 4 they've finally added an SR system. It's somewhat similar to Halo: Reach which is good but personally think they could do better. The final rank in Infinite is Hero; a huge miss opportunity for it to be named Spartan.

Campaign: Overall the campaign is good. The story is fantastic but when you're out in the open world it just feels empty.. My first playthrough was on Legendary, and I completed everything the open world had to offer and I swear I tried to go through every crack and crevice of the playable ring as I possibly could. Collecting all the collectables, finding all the dolls (without a guide mind you), maxing out my valor. It was only after I completed my second playthrough I thought; ""Where's all the wildlife?"" I could only spot the gopher type of wild life and I was like ""Oh, that's it huh"". The actual campaign missions are good and great but the open world is lifeless and empty. Maybe once The Endless DLC comes out they will expand and add more variety of life to the map and possibly different biomes.

All in all, if you're brand new to the Halo franchise and want to dip your toes into the multiplayer, I'd say go for it. I would highly recommend getting Halo: The Master Chief Collection if you have the money and want a true amazing Halo experience from Campaigns, to Multiplayer, and even the Modding scene. Is Halo Infinite Campaign worth the $60? No, I do not think so. Get the campaign on SALE! Never pay more than $30 for it, don't wanna pay that much either?

The multiplayer is fine, whatever, I've never played these games for that. What I came for was the story, there has always been something special about the story of Bungie's Halo for me. 

John is kidnapped by a downright fascist government at the age of 6, subjected to a brutal training regimen as a child. Then as a teenager he is transformed into a genetically enhanced super soldier for the explicit purpose of killing human separatist rebels - just in time for humanity to make first contact with alien life. Unfortunately that alien life is the hyper-religious conglomerate known as the Covenant - even worse they have been manipulated by an upstart politician to commit genocide upon humanity. By the time Combat Evolved starts humanity isn't losing, they've fucking lost. Reach - the defacto capital of the UNSC has been glassed, all that is left is earth. But humanity has got one ace up its sleeve...

Gigachad Master Chief Petty Officer Spartan John ""Halo"" 117. This motherfucker singlehandedly blows up installation 04 along with most of the fleet of Particular Justice. Blew up another fleet on his way back to Earth, saved Earth again by making the Prophet of Regret shit his space diaper, which causes him to stumble upon another Halo where he accidentally helps the flood infect the Covenant capital of High Charity - does not give a fuck and leaves his hot brain GF behind to hitch a ride back to Earth. 

He then literally just yeets himself into Earths atmosphere and proceeds to murder every single alien in Africa - then he chases the motherfucker who started all this through a portal to the command center of all Halos outside of the MFing galaxy and goes on to dismantle the Covenant with the help of his best space buddy (who definitely has the highest human kill count but we don't talk about that) and then goes on to rescue his brain GF and save the entire galaxy from a extinction event in several different ways.

Then when he tries to go home he gets trapped in the aft section of his ship as its cut in half by the closing portal. He goes to a cryo chamber to sleep like its NBD but before he goes to sleep he tells his brain GF that if any space hoes try to fuck with her to wake his ass up and he will do it all again.

343 just doesn't get it man. They shit all over the Chiefs legacy to the point where I don't even recognize their lore as cannon anymore. Its just shitty fan fiction.

To me John is still out there, waiting for someone to find him and bring him home. There is no Ur-Didact locked in a shield world. There is no Captain Del Rio. There is no UNSC Infinity. There is just Chief and Cortana, together, waiting. To the rest of the galaxy the Chief is a legend. The man who did the impossible and sacrificed everything so we could all live. I'm sure they believe he's still out there and one day, when we need him the most. He will be back.

I made a good decision doing so. 

Its bewildering how it almost feels like a new game compared to what I played in seasons 1-2, and I have been loving my time in the game again. what once felt like a half hollow shell of Halo has finally gotten to the point where I'd absolutely recommend giving it a try, or dipping your toes back in if you were upset with how 343 was handling the game.

Great game play with some new tools to mess with.
A surprising number of new maps (Squad Battle has a bunch of old Halo remakes that play amazingly btw)
and despite not playing for over a year, after a few rounds I was back in the groove. 

343 really did pull the rabbit mostly out of the hat, and I'm quite satisfied with the game now.

343 has absolutely no artistic integrity whatsoever. They do not care about Halo and they do not care about their customers.

While this is true, at least we had a functional product and a Campaign to keep us busy for a while. (If you bought it) 343i has infamously always had issues keeping their games going with enough material to hold their player base. Now it is late 2023 and Halo Infinite will be 2 years old soon. How is it?

I think its good. There is a lot to enjoy here and I actually ended up buying another Battle pass to unlock some new cosmetics. HUGE props to them making it so premium passes NEVER expire and you can choose which one you want to work on. What does this mean? You can stop playing for a year, come back, look through the passes and choose what kind of cosmetics you like, and take all the time in the world to unlock them. It feels very pro-consumer unlock other timed Battle pass systems in the F2P game space.

Infinite has a ton of new (albeit user created) maps to play on now. There are a few developer made maps but I haven't seen them in rotation much. There are a ton of playlists to choose from now for matchmaking (Squad battle and Doubles are awesome) If matchmaking isn't for you, there is the custom games browser (Community tab > Custom Game) to hold you over for hours. I still feel like the game needs some kind of PvE or Firefight mode.

When it comes to free to play games, I think Halo Infinite is probably one of the best games out there right now. It costs nothing to actually play and you can lose hours at a time playing it. I hope 343i keeps adding new modes and maps to the game through their Community playlists, they've done a great job so far.",1696105643,1696105643,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't buy it for the baseline $60, but that's in no small part because I have no intention of playing the multiplayer (I am hilariously bad at FPS multiplayer). My understanding is that much of the complaints about the game are directed against the multiplayer, and I certainly don't blame people for hating microtransactions. They're an absolute disease on the gaming industry.

Overall, this game is a frustratingly mixed bag when it comes to the storytelling, but it's a lot of fun to play. I've put more details below, with a spoiler warning.



SOME SPOILERS FOR OTHER HALO GAMES, MINOR SPOILERS FOR THIS ONE:


I'm a massive Halo fan. It was a huge part of my childhood, and I've circled back to it periodically as an adult via the Master Chief Collection. So of course I was going to play this, because I wanted to see how the story continued. In that regard, it's kind of... weird. You're dropped into a story that expects you to have played Halo Wars 2, which frankly is ridiculous. I don't know about other fans of the FPS games, but I wasn't going to play that. Over time the context is clarified and you understand what's happening just fine, but I didn't really like that we had a significant time skip after Halo 5 and an in media res opening for Infinite. In my opinion, good storytelling practice would have been to start with what the Master Chief was doing during the events of Halo Wars 2, and then progress over a couple levels to where Halo: Infinite begins. The opening would be less jarring that way, and more compelling. 

As is, it kind of felt like all these spin-off Marvel movies trying to introduce some crazy new villains and up the stakes after they realized most people didn't care post-Avengers: Endgame. That part actually doesn't get any better as Infinite's story progresses. The best explanation I can give without significant spoilers is that on top of the opening sequence antagonists feeling like a post-Avengers Marvel villain, at one point the phrase ""worse than the Flood"" starts getting tossed around in complete seriousness about a thing that just comes completely out of nowhere. That bugged me a lot, because historically Halo has done a good job building up to reveals. The first time you encounter the Flood in Halo: CE is absolutely iconic, as is the reveal of the Gravemind in Halo 2. This might be controversial, but personally I loved the buildup to revealing the Didact in Halo 4 and the nature of Cortana's plan in Halo 5. In that regard among others, I was rather disappointed by the plot of Infinite. 

Now for the good stuff. At the beginning of the game you meet an AI that's a copy of Cortana, but intended to outsmart and destroy Cortana. Something of a Mendicant Bias, Offensive Bias thing for those familiar with the lore. It's a fresh duplicate of Catherine Halsey's brain, so it has none of Cortana's memories. For whatever reason, it also diverges a lot from Halsey and Cortana's personalities, and oh my god is it amazing. I took to calling this AI ""Cute-tana"", because her dialogue and reactions to things were just so wholesome, encouraging, and funny. Unpopular opinion and a dumb hill I will die on, Cute-tana >>> Cortana. There's also a pilot you meet just before the first level, and unlike in some Halo games he actually has a compelling, substantive personality. Master Chief has more character depth than even in Halo 5, which was the first time he was given any depth. The genuine, non-trivial acknowledgement of his being human was such a great aspect of 5, and it's emphasized even more in Infinite. The presence of a cast of interesting characters was something I loved about all the main series games besides CE and 3, with Reach and 5 standing out in my mind. Even though Infinite has only three non-2D characters, it still works really well and got me to care about them in a way I haven't except in 2 (solely because of the Arbiter), 5, and Reach. 

In terms of gameplay, there are two key ways this diverges from past games. The grapple hook, and the open-world parts. Both had me skeptical at first, but I was quickly converted. I'm not sure there's ever been a mechanic in a Halo game that gave me as much pure, giggling joy as the grapple hook once I realized just how far you could push it. Is slingshotting yourself up the side of a sheer mountain in keeping with any sort of seriousness? Absolutely not. It is also the single most fun feature of any Halo game, in my opinion. The open-world portions of the game felt odd at first, because I didn't really know what to do with them, but once I got a sense for how it worked I had a ton of fun there too. 

As I said in the pre-spoiler portion: The storytelling is a pretty mixed bag with compelling characters yet a really poorly-written plot, but the gameplay in single-player is fantastic.",1695846423,1695846423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1240440,121816320,76561198153360211,0,4,20116,50,9012,1707902481,"I originally wrote my review for Halo Infinites multiplayer at about 150 hours of play time. Since then, I've played 110 more hours (260 something hours now), we've had 2 more seasons, and many many updates. In my original review I said that I could not recommend Infinites multiplayer in its current state due to a very long list of issues. I am very happy to say that many of those issues have now been addressed and fixed!


So let's start with the (mostly) positives:
- Halo Infinites core gameplay/mechanics continue to be very fun
- The gunplay is just as engaging as ever
- The game has retained it's excellent sound design and beautiful art style (art style =/= graphics btw, the graphics still look sub-par)
- Store prices have come down a long long way since launch ($8 AUD for the colour blue 💀)
- The reduction in FOMO by allowing the purchasing of previous season 1 and 2 store items, and some items being persistent for longer in the store now with the introduction of weekly, bi-weekly, and daily rotations
- Forge and customs games browser is finally in the game! Although with how low Infinites population is there's not usually a lot of games (about 30 lobbies or so on average)...
- No longer are seasons 6 - 10 months long! season 3 was 3 months and season 4 is about 4 months iirc
- A lot of the issues with desync have now been fixed, although there are still issues on occasion, and a region search has been added to help mitigate high ping matches (more on this later)
- The game now has iirc 18 playlists, over the like 5 at launch! With a dozen or so rotational playlists every week and an experimental playlist for testing new/changes to existing gamemodes
- Theatre mode has been fixed and is usable now! Bookmarks work most of the time now too
- Cross core has been partially implemented, with visors now being cross core. Some coatings are too, but you have to buy them in packs in the store...
- Challenges have been majorly reworked and are super easy to complete now. No longer do you have to do really specific tasks, in a specific gamemode, usually with a specific weapon. Most challenges can now be boiled down to just ""play the game""!
- Career progression has been added! Although, there is no rewards for obtaining ranks aside from emblems and reaching Hero rank currently has no reward (probably cause they weren't expecting someone to reach it in like 2 weeks)
- Match based XP is finally in the game, with you receiving XP for: completing the match, winning the match, being in the top 50% of your team, being the MVP of your team, and owning the season pass. This finally gives you an incentive to keep playing the game even after you finish your challenges for the week, which was a big problem before
- The main menu background has been fixed and will no longer cook your computer!
- The number of maps in the game has been greatly expanded, with new maps being added semi-frequently! A lot of community made forge maps are being added to main game/rotational playlists too! (Although admittedly, this just feels like 343i being lazy and not bothering to make their own maps. But hey, the community maps are usually really good so I'll let this mostly slide)


However, Halo Infinite has still has some issues:
 - There is still a heavy emphasis of micro-transactions / the store / the season pass
 - FOMO still exists with season 3 items not yet being available for purchase, season 4 items still being rotational, and event items being no longer available, even for purchasing, after the event has passed. Purchasing previous seasonal items is kinda hidden too, with you having to go through the customisation menu to find it, rather than a big store catalogue in the store menu
 - If you live outside of America, such as Australia, searching within your region often leads to lengthy match search times or outright not finding any matches, meaning you have to search for expanded regions, aka America, leading to high ping matches. This is even more the case when playing out of peak America playing times.
- Due to the low population of the game, some gamemodes are really hard to find matches for or are just straight up dead
- Skill based match making, mmr, csr, whatever you wanna call it. The way Infinite matches you up with other players is just plain terrible, leading to long wait times if your skill is high enough and getting really unfair and unbalanced teams. If you want more info, Mint Blintz has talked about this a few times now, especially recently
- The lack of any social features such as pre/post game lobbies and cross team chat. I've been fortunate enough to meet some awesome people playing this game, but having to use Xbox Game Bar to friend them and then party chat with them (if I wanna talk to them during loading times before/after matches) just sucks
- A lack of a match composer. This might possibly be coming in season 5 based on some leaks? But we will see. If it does/doesn't, I'll edit this review
- Staple gamemodes are still missing from the game (some of them have been in the code since launch, and some were even playable before being taken out again). This has really hurt Infinite badly, especially at launch. Withholding gamemodes for the ""narrative"", such as keeping infection back for season 4, was just such a dumb move and has ultimately helped contribute to the reduction in the playerbase that we see today
- This is a sentiment that a lot of players like myself share, and has been a problem since launch, but giving us a ""free 10 tier season pass"" but most of those unlockables are just emblems really sucks. And having stuff like shoulders and knees be individual tiers, rather than grouped together on the one tier, just doesn't make sense (this goes for the main season pass too). Really the ""free 10 tiers"" is more like 4 or 5, maybe 6 tiers


Compared to my original review, the list of positives is now much longer which is great! But the same goes for the list of negatives, while the list has changed it's still just as long. The game is in a far FAR better state then it was at launch or even in season 2 and is way more content complete, as it always should have been at launch, but there is still a long way to go. Infinite is on it's way to an MCC style redemption arc, but even with that MCC is still missing some classic, or arguably core, Halo features (particularly social features) that are still highly requested even now.

So with that, what do I think. Is the game worth playing now in 2023? Honestly, yes! I have personally found myself having heaps more fun playing Halo Infinite since season 4 launched, especially recently, and I think that's a testament to how far Infinite has come since launch! Not everything is perfect though as I'm sure you can see, so don't expect to always be having a great time. But if you do decide to play, whether that be for the first time or as a returning player, especially if you being some mates along with you, you're guaranteed to have some fun! And with season 5 around the corner, now is a great time to jump in, or back in, and see how much the game has improved since launch!",1662430919,1695796456,True,0,0,0.808871090412139893,0,True,False,False

It's like that one joke your grandpa always tells - it never changes, and it's not really funny anymore. In the world of gaming, stagnation can be a real killer, and Halo Infinite seems to have mastered the art of staying exactly the same since launch.

Customization, oh dear customization. It's like trying to turn a cardboard box into a luxury sports car - it's just not happening. Since the game's inception, it appears the customization options have been frozen in time, much like that glacier in your freezer you keep saying you'll get rid of but never do. You're stuck with the same old, same old, and frankly, it's about as exciting as watching paint dry. There's no freedom here, no room to let your inner creativity shine. You're basically handed a crayon and told to color within the lines, and even then, there are only two colors to choose from.

And then there's the joyous world of skill-based matchmaking (SMM). Ah, what a joy it is to be pitted against players who've practically taken up residence in the game. These folks know every nook, cranny, spawn point, and map detail like the back of their controller-clad hand. They sweat, they strategize, and they'll make you feel like you wandered into a pro gaming tournament by mistake. It's like trying to have a friendly game of catch with a Major League Baseball pitcher - you're not even sure when the fun disappeared, but it's nowhere to be found.

Let's talk about the melee, shall we? Ah, the melee. It's like trying to swat a fly with a wet noodle. One moment, you're lunging like a superhero, and the next, you're swiping at thin air like an over-caffeinated toddler trying to catch a butterfly. It's inconsistent in ways that are almost poetic. You never know whether you'll hit or miss, and when you do hit, there's a 50/50 chance that the game just won't acknowledge it, leaving you to ponder the mysteries of the universe.

In conclusion, Halo Infinite remains a constant, like that one uncle who insists on telling the same embarrassing story at every family gathering. Its lackluster customization, SMM that leaves you questioning your life choices, and a melee system as predictable as a roulette wheel with a few broken spokes all combine to create a uniquely frustrating experience.

I've played this game like 200 hours or so and here is what I think. 343 studios took a enterely diferent road for Halo Infinite. Now the MP component is FTP and the campaign is optional (paid). That is totally reasonable because the microtransactions, since the success of the Fortnite store, it has become one of the best bussiness models on gaming and they wanted to gain a piece of that cake, but is not what the Halo fans were specting. Did Halo succeded on it? I think they haven't yet, but the level of customization is very good. As I said, the MP is totally FTP but now it's more what I'd call ""pay to dress"".

[b]About the Halo Infinite Campaign[/b]

This is a direct sequel of Halo 5 Guardians, which also connects the events of Halo Wars 2. The game is now with an open world setting. This new setting feels like it kinda fades out the importance of the story, nonetheless is maybe the best written in all of the series. The game has memorable events and the characters start to grow on you (except the very last villain). There are lots of collectibles that helps the player to understand the plot. Graphics are good, the gunplay is perfect, the soundtrack is excellent and the enemy AI is still good (sometimes kinda odd), so it's a good Halo game. Being absolutely objective, the real problem of this campaign are the performance issues (which I've experienced some) and the state of how the game was delivered since its launch. Also, the split-screen component was dissmissed some months after game's release. So, after all the patches, delays and broken promises, the game now is actually good, but these fixes came too late and, in short terms, it didn't fulfill the expectations and 343 studios is paying the price for it.

[b]About the Multiplayer[/b]

Having in mind all the controversy of being FTP with just a few free good cosmetic pieces and how long took the game to find a good shape among its seasons, it's the best on the franchise. The gameplay, the maps, the equipment and the level of customization are next level. I used to be a big fan of the Halo 3 MP on the Xbox 360 days, and this installment retains what I used to love of that Halo with more juice. There are minor issues where I cannot aprove what they've done with the franchise, but what they have brought in season 4 are improvements on the MP, and 343 deserves to be recognized for that. In any case, it's free, there is no paywall to play it. 

[b]What the devs should be fixing?[/b]

MP still has some desync on the matches, you get random crashes on the MP, players should have the right to reconnect to a match if disconnected, some items on the menu doesn't load properly (I think it's related to CPU load), they constantly change the playlists (but now it's more stable than before). They should add Firefight (which is currently in testing) and other playlists that a Halo game should have. And last but not least, give the final touch to the campaign which was the DLC they cancelled.

Every time I do play it though, I can't get over how 343 basically killed the titan that was Halo slowly but surely.  It's not like it isn't an improvement to their other titles (except 5's multiplayer, which was surprisingly enjoyable) but it just lacks the soul of what made Halo what it is. Back in the day when I was growing up playing Halo 3 during it's prime, everyone wanted the sword, Hyabusa armor, rouge armor, EOD armor, etc. Why? Because having them meant you accomplished something. In 343's Halo, everything can be bought with money, there's no accomplishment. When you see someone with something cool like that, you immediately don't care because you know that they could have just paid for it, additionally, there's a lack of incentives to accomplish any kind of challenge at all. Your gameplay in multiplayer doesn't matter either, just their ridiculous challenges that you are forced to do if you want to make any substantial progress in leveling up their paid season pass. The campaign launched at 60 dollars by itself (A ridiculous change of form considering Halo has always been a full package. Admittedly, it was a good campaign) but completely detached from the ""free"" unfinished multiplayer aside from a few red skins. Consider for a moment if Halo Reach, the insanely successful  conclusion to Bungie's time with Halo launched this way with all it's promotion and hype. Back then, they would have been laughed off the stage the next time they did anything. Instead, they delivered what is probably the most consistently fun Halo ever created. We shouldn't accept now what we wouldn't then, 343 is a joke and doesn't deserve to squander the name of Halo any longer. They had the greatest opportunity to bring Halo back to a golden age considering both COD and BF where bad at the time of release, but they wasted it regardless.

1. keep the current challenge system, but after unlocking the weekly reward please add infinite radiant challenges to allow me to continue to unlock the battlepasses at a quicker rate (although the battle pass unlocks at a reasonable rate as is now)
2. add the spartan lazer & the hornet (man i miss them)
3. i would like to see more unlock-able cosmetic content perhaps tied to the new ranks system?

Gameplay is genuinely fun, weapons are fun to use and movement doesn't feels really tight and responsive and I think the maps are fine enough

But the user interface is embarrassing. The decision to make the multi-player free to play makes all the armors, colors, ect. Be locked behind a paywall or limited time events, which is lame. The menus feel clunky and loading into a game takes forever.

We'd go on late night walks along the creek with the moon gently glimmering along the water like diamonds strewn across a black velvety plain. You could hear the gentle breeze wisping through the thick brush and the crickets singing their songs. I remember once he looked me in the eyes and whispered, 'you're the greatest 1 tapper I've ever met' and gently kissed my penile. I was scared, and had never truly experienced love like this, but I knew it'd last forever. Unfortunately time was not on our side. We grew distant, ever since he orally caressed my meat n two veg, it just wasn't the same. We uninstalled, sold our skins, and became strangers.

Multiplayer for Infinite has always felt good to me, the main issues for me were in regard to how XP, Challenges and leveling worked. Most of that has since been addressed so I'm happy. Player population and general player sentiment around the game seems to be not great, but I think a lot of that has to do with the potential the game could have reached and people just being disappointed.

I'm writing this as a long-time Halo fan who first saw and learned to love Halo Combat Evolved and then Halo 2 20 years ago. 

Fuck you 343 Industries.

As nice as the gunplay feels, as massive as the music is; nothing legitimises your constant lying and postponing of content that should have been implemented a long time ago. No co-op until someday (be honest, you don't even believe it will come in after the new postponement), split-screen cancelled (which is an ABSOLUTE cheek), no forge, just endless customisation options for a multiplayer that you have to buy as a gamepass. 
In addition, a confusing storyline, even by Halo standards, which only ties in with the previous parts to a VERY limited extent and already implements new enemies. You can like it, but unfortunately it doesn't make a good story, because the summary is:

Infinity was destroyed, the Master Chief survived and...well. Killing aliens for the reason of killing aliens. It has no goal or mission until the middle of the game, but is just very, very flat. Too bad! But honestly: Refund the game. What 343 is trying to do with their fairy tales is absolutely sad.",1662275776,1694988148,False,3,0,0.51852726936340332,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer is a lot of fun especially with 343 finally adding more maps. However, the ability to spawn camp was just overlooked on certain maps, forge is only a recent addition, the weapons are bare bones compared to previous Halos, and customization is locked behind a paywall (I guess that is what we get with ""free"" multiplayer).

The campaign is good, fighting the banished was way better then the combat with the prometheans and jul mdamas covenant. The return of the old art style is amazing, I think it perfectly blends the old artstyle with the good aspects of 4/5. The open world aspect left a lot to be desired, there were only a few types of activity (spartan cores, saving marines, banished outposts, HVTs) and it could've been done better, but other then that I loved the campaign. 
The multiplayer released in a poor state, but nearly 2 years later, it's at a great point, having some of the most fun pvp in halo in my opinion. The customisation is still a little disappointing, especially the micro transactions being the main way you get armour for some of the cores - but infinite has to have one of the best battlepass systems in gaming currently. Being able to buy it and keep it permanently, and if you log on during a season, you can later upgrade that battlepass is near perfect. I do hope they release armour pieces strictly for skill.

Edit 12/06/22
343i are making steps in the right direction. They just added a custom games browser to go with the forge mode released during the Winter Update. They've given everyone every armor core, and have made several colors that were not available on those cores now available. Network Desync seems to have been addressed to some degree, and a brand new arena map in matchmaking is awesome. Good job 343i!

Things aren't looking good for Halo right now. Not sure what the future of this game will be. Right now the game has content, but it isn't much compared to what other games had at this point in the game. I don't know the whole situation at 343i so I can;t say for certain the future of this game.

Halo Infinite is very fun now. They added an 8v8 mode on classic Halo maps from Halo 2,3, and 4. They have some issues in terms of weapon/and vehicle balancing, such as the Halo Infinite Wraith being far superior to the Halo 2/3 wraith, and assault rifles being accurate at much larger distances than the Halo 3/4 variants,  but hopping into a warthog with the boys and doing a killing frenzy outweighs any concerns of 'balance'... that is until that god damn wraith blows us up anyways.",1639801307,1694710839,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Loved it. The gameplay is the best in the series, love the open-world aspect, the voice acting is great, the story is extremely good (still think the peak is Halo 2, then maybe ODST), the perfect balance of game knowledge and book knowledge, collectibles are fun, bosses are fun, music is a blend of new and nostalgic, etc. The only complaints I have are the atmosphere and level variation. I mean, it is either the forest of the open-world or in a Forerunner structure. A few exceptions, but compared to the atmosphere of ODST and the level variation of Halo 2 and 3, it is kinda disappointing. Other than that, near perfect. And man, the amount of emotional moments surprised me... I have only gotten emotional during a halo game once (Halo 4 ending), but i probably teared up numerous times throughout due to nostalgia and the emphasis on Chief and Cortana's relationship. I just care way too much about these characters, especially after reading the books, which are awesome btw.
Multiplayer:
Love it. Gameplay is stellar, feels like Halo. Menu music is excellent. The look and feel is great, weapon balance is pretty good, especially for a Halo game,  Maps are also pretty good, even if there are only a few. Training mode is also a welcome addition, even if i believe the ""story"" element of it is extremely unnecessary and kinda disrespects certain lore aspects thus far. Only major complaint is lack of progression systems outside of the battle pass. And i guess the absolutely RIDICULOUS prices in the store. Like come on, five bucks for a color? Seriously? Regardless of these issues, the game feels great and that is what is important.
EDIT: 
Still love the gameplay, but need to add the fact that this game is in TROUBLE. Content is still lacking big time. 343 is promising it'll be fixed, but I mean how long is it going to take? So, even though the core game itself is great, beware of the little amount of support the game is getting.

The relationship between Chief, the weapon, and the pilot are a breath of fresh air making me want to see more from them. 

The multiplayer has become amazing since 343's management upset making this one of the best multiplayer experiences, especially among modern shooters. Forge is also the best its every been and just getting better with Enemy AI bots coming to it soon. 

The battle pass system is the best because its only $10 each and they never expire. 
I will say the in shop armors/skins are ridiculous priced and i can never excuse that. 
The multiplayer being free definitely  adds to the enjoyment of the battle pass unlike games that still charge $60 on top of battle passes/dlc. 

The game left a bad taste in everyone's mouth at launch and I don't blame them. But after playing halo since 2005, I can confidently say players should give Halo Infinite a second chance.

atleast it is to me its got good fundamentals but they are way too stingy when it comes to content and customisation its been years and still no cross core customisation

the armor customisation peaked with halo 4.. id want a hybrid between halo 4s and halo reaches system with more options like textures in addition to colors but also fully custom undersuits

if your going to charge us for basics make sure the basics blow us away and are worth every penny instead its bare bones

also they removed the booty from reach armor.. this is some demon behaviour honestly also no PVE with your custom spartan is a massive missed opportunity you could have just reused the campaign map for strikes, fire fight and stealth missions

this game is very lacking in content and soul and it makes me sad.. i think 343 has been through the wringer so many times they are done now again this makes me sad

Not sure what was going on during development but it's hard to believe that this game had any more than maybe 3 years of development time. rip.

So, I have to change my review for this game because it's clear that the initial hype and promises made is what made me excited for this game. From purely a gameplay perspective this game is great but besides that a small lack of sandbox elements and weapons dampen gameplay a little bit but not much. In all truthfulness it's easy to see that something went wrong here and development must've dragged every other element of this game down. The story is pretty good but very simple and hardly memorable, something that probably could've been told within a quarter of this game's runtime and still leaves the player with tons of questions but the characters are good, I just expect an epic scale for Halo. Beside's that multiplayer is just in a broken state of constant desync issues, progression is garbage, challenges are too reliant on padding runtime and RNG. Playing this game feels like a beta in practically every single aspect of it even 4 months after release, this definitely needed more time, care, and development put toward practically every aspect of this game because it all feels either rushed or unfinished without a really memorable experience. I can't even recall names of bosses or nearly any major characters and there's still so much unexplained from previous titles. 343 needs to be replaced by a proven developer because it's clear that devs constantly come and go and complain about their experiences there, passion is important for this franchise to succeed and Microsoft is having a hard time finding people who are passionate about Halo to work on it, whether its the games or the show Halo fans are constantly let down. The previous games had such wonderful writing and cinematics and badass moments in such an interesting and deep sci-fi setting, but now there's not enough passion.

Edit: Within a whole year Halo will have only gone through 2 seasons and it's development is stagnant. Only 2 new maps have been released and the game isn't even a finished complete product missing launch features. Because of this, I will be keeping this review as it stands. This is a very dissapointing product of modern gaming where the developers thought ""hey we can fix it later with updates"" but just don't have the man power to do so. The game on it's own will never be inherently bad but content planning for Halo Infinite is a disaster, gameplay alone can't carry this videogame, it needs CONTENT.

Edit 2: The way CSR is handled is incredibly horrible, if you match with people who team kill or leave you still have the possibility to lose rank. Not only that but if your game crashes or you disconnect you are nearly guaranteed an overall rank decrease in Diamond and you have no way of rejoining the game or gaining forgiveness. I am really not an incredibly skilled player but I've been grinding ranked Halo to make it to Onyx for 2 months and I have been stuck in Diamond 5 for an incredibly long amount of time because of leavers, team killers and playing the objective. Also, the game prioritizes K/D, because this game is objective based you are guaranteed to die in order to win, even if you are the highest scorer on your team if your kills aren't much higher than your deaths you will either get a low increase for winning or a higher decrease than your companions who might be ignoring the objective. Ofcourse rank depends on how good you are at the game but I refuse to chalk these issues down to ""Get good"" and ""Don't Solo Queue'. I HAVE TO SOLO QUEUE, NOBODY I KNOW WANTS TO SPEND ANY OF THEIR TIME PLAYING THIS GAME LET ALONE RANKED. Playing ranked often times makes me feel like a masochist.

Casey Note: This is now apart of one of the many games I have played which genuinely pushed me away from gaming. Not that I don't game anymore but I find studying for college and technical certifications genuinely more interesting as a result of the lack of effort during development in this industry. Half of these games now a days feel either disappointing or like I'm doing chores, so why don't I just invest in my own future instead?

Lots and Lots and Lots of bugs are fixed and the community seems to be growing back. 3. I still do not recommend this game to anyone but hard core halo fans. Halo Infinite is still lacking in: 

Campaign expansion DLC (Lacking in biomes that Combat Evolved had, Halo 2/3/reach had. Snow, Sand, Foreset, Water, Forerunner Ruins, Alien ships) and fresh experiences.

Edit Update: Game is still incredibly unstable. It is obvious that the developers do not actually care at all about this game. They are more concerned with making armor for the store that can't be used between the innumerable ""Cores"". Heck, even something as simple as camo is ""unable"" to be used between them. According to the developers they spent countless hours making camo specific to each Core. Therefore colors cant be used.

This game is a complete mockery of what the Halo franchise is. It is inexcusable to have a game in this state. This used to be a 'flagship' game for the Xbox franchise, but here we are now. A buggy, un-optimized game riddled with bugs, FOMO (which they promised not to have) expensive armor packs.

Legit the best gameplay loop in any Halo game to date. The open world is pretty cool and fun to explore but has little replay value because of how repetitive its layout is. The linear segments are fun but not very inspired. Unfortunately the story is pretty lame (but nowhere near as bad as Halo 5). All the characters are pretty awesome except for the main bad guy. The big bad guy is nothing, she does nothing and is underwhelming. Honestly it was not worth $60 or the 6 year wait after Halo 5. The grunts are funny though, so there's that.

Multiplayer:
Fun but lacks variety in gamemodes. I feel like every week there's more bad news with this multiplayer and that's really sad. 343 Industries has proven to me that they have no idea how to launch a multiplayer and merely got lucky with Halo 4's.

A mix of a weird and small weapon sandbox, the shop (thankfully not as FOMO anymore, but still not great), and significantly less social environment than previous titles and other still-relevant-shooters (like Team Fortress 2 has still managed to keep) just makes Infinite feel... not soulless per se, but definitely not memorable. DX12 also, at least in my experience, is a huge hindrance as it's a majority reason why I have subpar performance on a solid mid-high end rig, too. I haven't played consistently for multiple months now and just decided to finally uninstall.

I bought but never finished the campaign, mostly because I just found the boss fights not all that fun and exploring the open world just didn't feel quite interesting enough in addition to the story being just alright. The unique weapon variants from some of the world bosses are interesting and the upgrade system is pretty fun- I also just genuinely can't place anymore if the grappleshot makes the game better or worse.

But that was then, now the game has content, a community in it, updates(that are lacking in creativity) 
This is not halo 3, It is its own variant and thats ok, Guns feel nice for the most part, maybe a bit of tweaking on some of them and maybe some classic guns because it would make the older community happier and that way both old and new players are happy.

The biggest problem I have with halo infinite is the player bases mental, and understanding of objectives.
While no one can really tell you how to play as long as your having fun. Its quite heart breaking to play competitively only to have some more focused on holding a angle with a 25% chance of a hostile being there while the rest of the team is already fighting all 4 hostiles on king of the hill or ctf or basically anything thats not slayer. 

Of course it doesnt help that a lot of the new players dont take a lose on the shoulder and just dust it off and play next or play later. Instead ive had none stop quitters or people who take loses personal and int in the next game, mind you getting a player on your team twice can be quite common so id suggest giving it a 2 ish minute break each game. 

Armor designs are alright. Of course all reach styled armor are just fine, mark VII is not bad at all. But Chimera and Eaglestrike dont belong. Chimera especially, makes no sense to really be in the game as it not only doesnt fit the art style it doesnt fit the new or old lore, its kinda just there, and Eaglestrike is just a reference armor with References and easter eggs. Which are nice and all but WW2 scifi armor, Wolfenstein and Rocketeer easter eggs alone with no halo touches really just kinda seem lazy.

Just play mcc, on sale you get it for half the price of infinite's campaign. 343 clearly has deep rooted issues and if messing up 3 games over 10 years with hundreds of millions of $ didn't spark them to change something internally, nothing will. It's time to finally accept halo is never going to be back :(

UPDATE

Campaign is still clearly unfinished, it's not being updated as far as I can tell

I have to say the multiplayer can be pretty fun now that nearly 2 years after launch they are adding new maps, the playlist selection has SLOWLY but steadily improved to a reasonable state. But even when you're having fun, there are still several confusing design choices that are easy to forget about when you come back to the game, but are obvious when compared to past halo games; 

The ai assistants don't have enough voice lines to be talking as much as they do. 

The sniper used to be a gun that was hard to use up close, but if you had the skill it was one of the strongest and most fun weapons in the game. Now it's reticle is way smaller, players can change direction way faster, added bloom, and then they decided to turn it into a huge beacon every time you use to scope. A total nerf across the board. I like to think I'm a better player, I've nailed countless no scopes with the reach sniper, but in infinite it doesn't feel like it shouldn't even be a power weapon outside of top esports tournaments. I can never resist picking it up, but I'd probably have a better k/d if I did.

Plasma pistol is useless fodder weapon, tracking is too weak to hit players and it no longer stuns vehicles. I'm not sure why it's even on the maps.

Still no player collision, close quarters combat comes off very janky as a result, you're both phasing through eachother trying to back up and get the other person in front of you, it's a total crap shoot. As far as I can tell this is a universally disliked change.

The mp music isn't bad...but there are so many amazing songs already in the campaign that would add a lot if they mixed it in. So much effort was clearly put into infinite's soundtrack only for 80% of it to only get heard once in the campaign.",1639396057,1693777546,False,1,0,0.501912772655487061,0,True,False,False

The playlists are still the same that where in the flight and the devs clearly have not worked on this game properly, the custom game options are a mess, when you pick your options for your custom game and when you switch maps the options are back to what the standard options were, and if you go and switch the options once again with the right map then the map switches to another map. Then we have the big obvious one that really takes the cake, while the bugs can be fixed and probebly will be fixed i hope, the microtransactions are way overpiced and just completely trash. The cat ears got alot of praise and they where like 15 euros for a helmet attachment, then we got the battlepass, rewards are alright you get the whole nobleteam armours from waht i've seen without the need to buy them seperately on the shop, but the fact that they decided to put a battlepass where you unlock cosmetics and decide not to include currency to unlock the next battlepass by just buying the first one pisses me off alot, fortnite has doen that since i started playing it in S3 and APEX which is owned by EA the microtransaction gods themselves have put currency to buy the next battlepass and a litle more to maybe buy something else with the extra currency put in it. It's a real shame halo took a turn for the worse, if 343 do not do something about this then its safe to say that the mutiplayer on this game is not something for me. You could argue that they added free events to get more cosmetics but you have to think about it, you get COLORS which if you think about it should be a standard thing you could customise by just playing the game like in the older vesions of it, and not only that if you get a colorcoating for a weapon then its just for that one weapon not all of them which seems a bit bs if you ask me. Then we got the optimisation, im running a computer with old high end stuff such as 1080TI and a 7700k and i get around 30 at lowest fps during the campaing in the open world and standard fps is around 46-60 fps depending where i look. I checked with friends if they had the same issue and they did, apparently the game runs on your CPU and not your GPU which is the main reason the game has such a poor performance. I'm really sad to see halo got to this point and hope the devs do something about the issues that are currently in the game before the game ends up like the launch of MCC and dies.

UPDATE:
The game keeps crashing non stop this game is fucking trash dude, not only that but its full of fucking hackers literially wh and aimbotters.

UPDATE: The games name is Infinite cause the infinite ammount of times it crashes on you.

Update number fucking whatever: the game still crashes after the infection mode was implemented, feelsl ike im playing the beta still and its un fucking believable how dogshit this company is.

Another update, the game is unplayable whenever im about to end a game the game decied to fucking crash honestly unplayable bs game should have been fixed a long time ago.

Campaign:
Not worth 60 bucks, missions are super repetitive, every single room looks like the previous room, vehicles handle like turd, you can skip to the final mission, literally. LASO is a meme with the tank gun and Bandana skull, no reverting last checkpoint, no mission select, no coop, no forge mode, bosses were a chore, the main boss of the game literally cared more about cringey dialogue and telling us his lifestory than anything else, game is just really filled with cringe dialogue especially between Chief and the new ''Cortana'', and unskippable cutscenes. It was basically one of those sob stories you keep hearing in America's Got Talent and all the judges automatically give them a golden buzzer. You just keep doing the same things over and over again in the Open World, the side stuff is very repetitive. There is not much replayability. You'll feel like a SWAT team just kicked down your door and threw in a flashbang whenever you blow up a banished phantom

Multiplayer:
Poor UI, terrible customisation, the progression system is absolutely awful, you're not rewarded by the game for playing well either, you just get xp for playing the game, nothing else. Aim assist is broken, BTB doesn't work, meleeing is off, vehicles handle like turd, not very many maps, and the maps they have are lazily designed they are just like the 3 lane CoD maps, there is a serious lack of content, not many different game modes, the micro transactions are outrageous, i mean 10 dollars for the color blue...

It's obvious that the game wasen't finished when it was released, it really should have been delayed further

UPDATE: Now crashes on startup on Steam Deck. Microsoft and 343 love enshitification.

UPDATE: It appears that having a high resolution texture pack enabled was causing the crashing on startup. I had to go to the DLC section and disable high res texture packs to get infinite working again. So here's the real review: Halo is fun. I like Halo Infinite, but it feels like every update they do everything they can to prevent me from playing the game. Whether it was the load time issues in the Winter Update or the crashing issues that seem to have started in season 4, there's always some technical problem that makes it hard to play the game. I LIKE Halo. I don't need them to release ""content"" every quarter to find the game enjoyable. I get the feeling that Halo is on life support. They're doing as little as they can to prop up the game because their brand needs Halo to continue, but they aren't willing to give the franchise the commitment and investment it deserves to be relevant and technically sound in 2023.

- Gun play can feel nice the majority of the times --> All of the weapons (-1) feel great to shoot and I don't think any are terribly balanced. The only issues I have is mainly due to ping (I live in Australia). I also am not a fan of the disruptor; might be because of my ping, but regardless i don't see the weapon being good in any way.

- Movement is smooth -->[It really does ""feel"" like classic halo movement with a bit more tech (sliding and sprinting). I love how it pairs well with the grappling hook; the amount of speed and control you can get with that thing is soooo fun.

- Abilities/Equipment pick ups are versatile and also work great --> As mentioned before, the grappling hook is an amazing ability. I also love using the repulsor, mainly for how it effects the player using it. The fact that you can use it looking down and it gives you a super jump is great, and allows it to be used not only as a tool for pushing enemies away, but to also be used as a movement ability like the grappling hook. The threat seeker is good (not much to say about it, its just nice to have). Drop wall at first felt under powered. But when using it to priorities cover for my teammate rather than myself, I was happy with how the item performed. The don't really like the thrusters, but like the upgraded campaign version (it gives active camo for 2 secs after dodge). The new smoke screen ability is a good welcome.

Some main issues that I have with the game, which I'm certain has been mentioned time and time again...

- lack of content from launch --> When the game came out, we were dip fed content for soooo long. Only recently the devs have began releasing content back to back, which is good. I think this is due to a change in management within 343 (good job guys, keep up the good job).

- Connection Problems --> Due to me living in Australia, it takes me a while to find a match. It would say approx. 1 min to find a game, and then would feel like 5 - 10 mins have past. I do hope servers get improved or redone, that would make things so much better. It would also help if people from aus played it more.

- Cosmetics and Shop --> everyone knows it, micro-transactions suck, no matter what the game is. I do like how you keep battle passes you've purchased and can purchase previous battle passes (i think any game with BPs should do this). I wish armour coatings weren't a thing, and instead people would be allowed to choose there own colours. An idea I had for a replacement would be instead of the colours, it would be armour patterns or materials (idk how the community would react to that thou, just a thought).

- Gamemodes --> A lot of them are pretty average. A lot of people love squad battle and I can agree.I hate regular fiesta due to it being random and inconsistent with weapons (one person could have a pistol and the disruptor {me} and the other has a sniper and a rocket launcher {not me}). However i do like super fiesta since all the guns are buffed (including the disruptor :'D ). it also has the quickest queue which surprised me. I don't BTB mainly for connection issues. And the new husky raid 'would' be alright if it didnt use REGULAR FIESTA   
=======
Right now the game is in a great place going forward, but I would say wait a bit for next season. I heard that firefight is coming soon so probably wait for that.",1693448938,1693554135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, I do not recommend Halo Infinite due to it being yet another live service game which implements the same features all the other live services do, just with the Halo branding.

[b]FINAL UPDATE to my review which I have continued to edit up until August 2023[/b]: 
As a free to play title the multiplayer is worth checking out if you're interested and maybe have a friend to try it out with. The multiplayer offers some solid gameplay, just be aware that the experience is geared more towards a competitive experience rather than a casual one. I appreciate the flow of Infinite's multiplayer as 343 Industries added their own touches to the Halo formula (i.e. sprint, slide, clamber, new equipment, etc.) These mechanics introduce a new learning curve to the movement and combat engagements of Halo's formula. Forge/Custom Games Browser were much needed additions from release and provide excellent value. New maps are always welcome, especially after the addition of a remake of The Pit from Halo 3 and unique playlists based around such maps. Halo Infinite will only live on through its small content updates, balance changes, and competitive multiplayer/tournaments.

[hr][/hr]

[b]Brutally Honest Opinion:[/b]
Ultimately, the one word I would use to describe Halo Infinite is DISAPPOINTMENT mainly due to its awful launch and lack of content when compared to previous entries in the Halo series. While content is slowly being added to the game, there is good fun to be had with the gameplay/learning curve in terms of movement techniques as well as competitive play. However, I do not believe much can be done to build up a player base/excitement. The in-game shop is Infinite's biggest sin (among the other additions due to the game being a live service). This game is an FPS built upon the inspiration of a 20+ year old franchise that was stretched out as a failed attempt to unite old fans and new ones alike to the Halo franchise.

[hr][/hr]

(The three portions of the review below are my impressions of the game as it released, its campaign, and the state of the game following its second major update.)

[b]Initial Impressions upon release:[/b]
Halo Infinite's multiplayer gameplay is fun and engaging for me. But, limited matchmaking playlists and a flawed progression system are two issues on a long list associated with the multiplayer.

[b]Review Update 1 - Campaign:[/b]
343 mixed up the gameplay through a shift to an open world style. It is best played on Heroic difficulty as it allows for the most opportunity to use the new special abilities in combat. Overall, the open world hindered the story and the gameplay as an almost entirely open game is inferior to a more hand crafted level based game when it comes to Halo. Other than his armor looking cool, Master Chief along with the supporting cast of characters are incomparable to those of the Bungie Halo games. Due to catering towards the open world, the campaign falls flat for a majority of the playtime.

[b]Review Update 2 - Season 2:[/b]
Updates/patches will be rolled out slowly. This game will receive content in chunks so do not expect significant changes on a frequent basis. Mostly those who are sticking with Infinite are doing so for updates in and around the times they drop or those solely focused on competitive play. I can enjoy the gameplay loop when in the mood for the game and will also continue to be optimistic for additions in the future (whether additional content, maps or changes to the guns/mechanics). Main suggestion for Multiplayer would be to bring back maps from previous Halo games, as the current maps lack the classic charm/thoughtfulness.",1638988570,1693540757,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is still as poorly optimized as it was on launch, yeah it doesn't crash anymore but with a 3060ti just getting a choppy 60-80 fps at medium settings is unacceptable. And content wise yeah they've added maps some guns, but idk, the shop still is a mobile game store with ridiculous pricing with no cross-core costomization, they also even added a ""progression system"" but it doesn't even give you anything is literally just seeing a number go up, and is clear it was never meant to be there, because you cannot see you rank in the in game leaderboard or in the main menu lol.

I still don't recomment it specially the campaign, yeah you can play once in a while but tbh if you want to play halo just go and buy the MCC. Atleast is free but meh, if I  bought the battle pass and the campaign, and the MP still feels empty I can't imagine how it feels for a free user with almost 0 level of constumization. Yeah gameplay is fun, but it gets repetitive overtime imo.

[h1] Original Review [/h1] 
The core game is pretty pretty good, is fun, it recaptures what a halo game is and is great, the artstyle is going back to the halo 3- reach days and its pretty cool.

But I can't recommend the game sadly, I have a 3060TI and the performance is pretty pretty lame, in menus I allways have around 5-20 fps and is pretty annoying, when I alt+tab the issue is fixed but it returns after 30 seconds or so and it's extremely frustrating at times and sometimes happens during gameplay and playing with that level of performance is just not acceptable for me, I reported the issue since the flights in June 2021 and I still have those issues and is the only game that has this issue on my PC, reinstalled the game, drivers, etc and didn't change anything...

The performance is too heavy for a game that is not that graphically intensive and I just simply do not know why, and that with the horrible customization model with those kind of prices is lame, I bought the battle pass but if you paid for the campaign just as me you will be dissapointed because the stuff that they give you for completing the campaign is lackluster, f2p halo was a mistake in my opinion, the campaign should cost 40 and the multiplayer 20...",1639978792,1693508587,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can tell you right now, that the campaign is worth it. There are some problems (The Endless and the Faking of Atriox's Death), but the upsides out weigh them all. The weapons feel great, the enemies feel like classic halo, and the vehicles are very fun. The story is amazing, it tries to go back to the ""human master chief"" that Halo 4 tries to do, but does it better. It shows the Master Chief scared, something the bungie games never really showed. The Weapon and Bro-hammer are also great. The Pilot doesn't want to be here and just wants to go home, his dynamic with chief is both emotional and hilarious. The Weapon is adorable, she is unaware of her origins and is overall new to the state of the universe and what universe she is in. Then there is Escharum, OH GOOD GOD I LOVE HIM. He is like a tactical Ork. He is sick and is on his brute deathbed, but he doesn't want to go out from a disease. He wants to go out fighting a worthy adversary, The Chief. He is a good villain and I enjoyed his boss fight. Sadly he is not the final boss, that goes to the ""Endless"" jellyfish lady.
It is all a shame that it ends off with a cliffhanger that was supposed to be followed up with DLC stories that we never got and likely never will.

The multiplayer on the other hand...
They dropped the ball HARD. I know very little about the actual gameplay of the multiplayer, so go find other reviews that can tell you all about it. Other than that, they locked armor and colors behind a pay wall. That is right, you have to pay for FUCKING BLUE! Ok, they do have some starting colors, but if you want something better then it is a trip to the in game store. Keep in mind, in previous entries in the franchise, both color customization and armor customization were free. 343, you owe me a god damn EVA Helmet. Most negative reviews are going to be about the multiplayer, mostly due to how shit it was at launch and even now.

They finally added infection, which was terminally overdue, they've added many weapons and equipment that have unique spots and interactions within the sandbox, and it has numerous game modes that are all fun to play with Forge serving as a great tool in which fans have lovingly created classic Halo maps that are all extremely fun to play on.

The campaign is fine I guess. It has a few, but not many, strong individual moments but overall the campaign feels kinda one note and uneventful while also dragging on too long. The open world was a good idea in theory but it ends up feeling like a modern day Far Cry game wearing the rotting corpse of a Halo campaign. If this is the sacrifice we had to pay for unforgettable set pieces and unique biomes it was not worth it.

We wanted to be Spartans and Elites in our own way. We wanted to look unique and powerful in our own armor we so proudly earned, we wanted to be the USMC and Covenant armies clashing on the battlefield with every kinetic and energy weapon ever used in all the Halos. We wanted to team up and fend off wave after wave of our favorite enemies donning brand new, detailed, high-quality looks as we watched their purple and blue bloods spatter the green grass and arctic tundras of maps we have never or would never forget. We wanted to laugh and drink energy drinks or beers and feel that warm feeling that every single person who has ever enjoyed Halo has felt as our friends around us either raged or bit their lips in concentration. The stories of Master Chief, Noble Team, the Arbiter and Covenant, and ODST in New Mombasa ENCHANTED us- people have tattoos of that stuff. Think of that- marks on their bodies that they will wear to and IN the grave on people because of a fantastical story that charmed their souls. ""Pure magic""; those are the words to describe the Halo franchise apart from this game. The corporate agenda and out-of-touch think-tanks have desecrated yet another sacred identity in our lives. 

You really messed up, people. As I write this I look at the mock-copy of Halsey's Journal from the Halo Reach launch sitting on my bookshelf. I carried that book every day through middle school and read it with fascination no matter the taunts from those around me. How disrespectful are you that took something so beautiful, strapped it's legs and arms spread open, and painted ""free **** for everyone who wants some""! I am disgusted.

Fast forward. I'm not eating my words, but it is definitely a fun game. Is it a true Halo game? No, it is definitely NOT. Infection was great, the cosmetics are getting me better- I am enjoying completion of the battle passes, they're what keep me playing honestly (because they're actually decent now thanks to cross-core stuff). It's grown on me, I play this almost every day even while I have Baldur's Gate 3 installed at this very moment. This game is doing good and getting better- we want more old Halo maps in squad battle, that is for sure. Also, Quick Play is the best option on multiplayer right now. Its just balanced and all the sweats are playing squad battle as of now, sweating away, stinking up their parents' basements.

But I can't. The story, in my opinion, is unremarkable. From what I've played of it. Kinda got bored of it, so I never finished. I only played to get what items they have in the world that you can collect to get multiplayer cosmetics.

The customization? It's good. Could be better, but it's probably the best part about this game. I wish they'd take advantage of the customization by having your custom Spartan more involved in the story with cutscenes and stuff (Speaking of which, I hate that you can't re-watch cutscenes from prior seasons). It's wasted potential to add so much customization and NOT have your character in cutscenes and stuff. 

My biggest problem is the way the controls feel. I use an Xbox 1 controller. (Yes, I'm using a controller for a PC game. I just like them better for certain games.) No matter how many times I've tweaked my settings, the controller sensitivity feels off for it.

The game was missing campaign co op, infection, fiesta, and even more modes at launch, and there just wasn't anything to do.

The game still plays like shite and the on going Desyncing, lag and hit registry still makes this game unbearable to play along with its botched Halo 5 style zoomer movement system makes it feel like sweat fest cause of the poorly designed and implemented sandbox. Removing the EMP function of the Plasma Pistol and making ARC based weapons that can half way across the map is total BS. The equipment in this game is designed to disorientate and confuse the enemy player.

~~~TLDR~~~

Save your money and time and play on The Halo Master Chief Collection. 

~~~Rant~~~

The game feels like it was just functionally to have the store working and the base single player story game. 6 years of development that had a lot of Project leads leaving during the development on top of the technical debt really shows how much this game is held together with duck tape style coding. 

The problem with it going to F2P means there's less focus on actually content and pumping out cosmetics on your Spartan doll. Cosmetics is not content, especially when it's paywalled.

I can't in good faith recommend this game in its current state. Halo Infinite didn't had much with competition on release with the disaster launch of both COD and BF:2042 but is now struggling to maintain player numbers even with the multiplayer is F2P. Player count only really spikes after there's been an event being dropped. 

It took almost 7 years to get the MCC in a solid state of play so use that as a clear indicator as to how long it'll take to make Infinite a stable and content filled game.

The amount of of content that's been the bread and butter of any base Halo game is missing, broken or on the back burner to be added. Once the BR mode drops you can bet that there'll be less support going into the base Multiplayer going forward.

This game is quite commendable. The gunplay stands out as exceptional, providing an unparalleled experience in terms of shooting mechanics. The fluidity of movement adds another layer of excellence to the gameplay. While the campaign holds its own, delivering an adequate experience, it's important to acknowledge the array of positive aspects that come bundled with this game. However, regrettably, there remain a few downsides that continue to cast a shadow over my overall impression.

The campaign does justice to Master Chief's character by expanding his story with somber moments and showcasing why he's legendary. The introduction of the Banished faction adds freshness, offering new weapons and vehicles that harken back to Halo's roots. While enemy designs and the return of marines enhance the experience, pacing issues and unbalanced unique enemies arise as downsides.

However, the campaign's main flaw lies in its storytelling. It relies heavily on exposition, failing to visually immerse players. This weakens the emotional impact and connection to the stakes, as they're told rather than shown. This hinders the campaign from effectively conveying its narrative with the addition of a weak villain. Additionally what irks me personally is that we're told there is an enemy greater than the Flood. Again, told but not shown which is a great disappointment.

Now let's delve into multiplayer, customisation & Forge; A place of great positives and negatives clashing head on. Forge just shines and has brought the community together, creating exquisite maps. The added bonus of AI bot functionality on these maps enhances this. Multiplayer has a plethora of game modes and endless joys to be had in custom games. Then, there is the ugly side we all must face.

Customisation, many steps forwards, but many more back. It's laden with potential, but is constrained, with a significant portion of content locked behind paywalls, looking to squeeze as much money from us as possible. Turning to multiplayer, Australian players will have to endure long wait times. Once a match does begin, frustration sets in as pings escalates to 200+ and occasionally spike to a disheartening 350+. Teleportation replaces the expected smooth gameplay that Halo is known for and the entire experience becomes sour. The enjoyment you want from Halo dissipates.

[h1]In conclusion[/h1]
Overall, the positives and negatives of Halo Infinite are on equal footing. The game feels fantastic to play. Campaign brings a nice story expanding on the human elements of Master Chief, but tells more than it shows. Multiplayer can be great, with many game modes offered to sink your teeth into and Forge/custom games being it's strongest pillar. Unfortunately, if you're in Australia/Oceania, expect long wait times and high ping. Customisation should be better and not lock 80% of it behind a paywall. 

I would love to recommend this as a long time fan, but with a heavy heart, [b]I cannot recommend this[/b] as an Australian player. The game is solid & still fun to play, plenty of entertainment to be had. Give the game a try if you wish, and if you find more enjoyment than I can, I'm very happy for you.",1692949722,1692949722,False,1,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I will start with the technical issues. After almost two years of patches and updates, the game runs like shit. After the release of season 4: if I visit the multiplayer lobby and would like to play campaign, I must hard reset my computer, otherwise the game crashes when I try to enter the campaign lobby. Additionally, the servers are terrible, with regular disconnects and high ping at all times.

Now for content issues. Campaign first, as that is what I actually was looking forward to when the game was announced. Compared to the disappointment that was Halo 5, I actually was impressed. Pelican Down was actually a great experience, and the intro (Warship Gbraakon, Foundation, and Outpost Tremonious) left me feeling hopeful that the game was going to go great. The game was quite pretty, the UI made sense and felt very in line with previous titles, and the overall aesthetic was a return to the classic style of the franchise. Movement and gunplay felt great, and I love the grappling hook. That's all I have that is good to say about it. 
As for the bad: Once you are in the open world, there is little of interest to do. As a veteran halo player, I started the game on Heroic, however, I should have started on Legendary, as with the wide open spaces, advanced movement abilities, and infinite power weapons/ammunition from FOBs, the game was far too easy. The environment, though beautiful, had no variety anywhere on the map. I had hoped for the amazing variety of biomes like those in Halo:CE, but instead a rocky tundra with sparse pine trees is your only company, with occasional pits into space surrounded by hexagonal metal pillars. The story is also an issue. little of significance occurs over the course of the campaign, with most major events occurring before the game starts, and no questions answered by the games end. It seems like a retraction of any actual progress made in Halo 5 (the little bit that there was), continuing 343 Industries' trend of completely ignoring (or even contradicting) the previous title when making a new game. The Banished are just another Covenant, with no new gameplay elements, and the new enemy faction is basically non-existent, with no explanation of their motives or history, and no real gameplay impact. Honestly, I am disappointed. Many others have spoken about the letdown that is split screen co-op, so I will not spend any time on that.

Now for the multiplayer. This is the area of the game with the most publicized issues, and I will go over the ones that affect me the most. First is playlist variety: with a bad selection of BTB maps, no infection, no swat, and even a basic Slayer gametype all missing from the start, the stage was set for how bare this multiplayer really was going to be. I dislike season passes as a concept, and if you don't want to pay for them, you will be missing out on almost all customization options, a far cry from the exclusively gameplay-unlockable cosmetics of Halos 3, Reach, and 4. Map variety as underwhelming, with one of the smallest launch lineups of any Halo to date, and it took quite a while for Forge to even be released so that the community could make our own maps.

I could continue with my complaints about the game, but there's no use in beating a dead horse. If you want more ranting, just watch The Act Man's videos on the game. In summary, it's bad, but it could have been so good. I really wanted a good Halo game. I wanted this to be a fantastic entry, a return to what Halo could be, but it was not, and I think it could be the end of Halo as a franchise. That's all I have to say, before I start getting sad.",1692684035,1692684035,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There was little in terms of game-play modes, features,  maps, and the focus was to heavy on e-sports.  no denying that is turned off a bunch a people a gained a bad reputation.  

The things is 343i has done alot of restructuring behind the scenes and ton of work has been put in to fix the game. After 2-ish years of updates Its good.  Maps are plentiful, game modes have a good variety, the forge has been released, the community is creating new game modes and maps.  Battle passes are fair, but don't seem necessary.  There is always free events around the corner. Major problems have been addressed and fixed. (if you have any crashes disable high res textures on your steam dlc).  This game is getting constant and substantial seasonal updates.  If you are a fan of the classic halo games check out the Squad Battle playlist.

I am not going to say its perfect, there are some game modes that are missing (grifball, rocket race, the action sack mini games). I do wish the store was overhauled so you can get cosmetics individually instead of bundles. 

This is not a dead game: Its being actively developed and supported, I can get into a matchmade game quickly, and there is a growing player base.  Don't listen to any article that only shows the steam chart numbers, this is a crossplaform game with console and window store. Steam is only part of the population.

I've almost got 2,000 hours in the game. And I have faced my share of problems with this game in both Multiplayer and Campaign, BUT NOTHING that will stop me from enjoying the game.

Something you will hear a lot is how fun the sandbox is and how advanced the forge mode is (map creator), and its all true. The game play is fast and at first it may not seem it but strategy is very important. Its  by no means perfect; if you are not playing in America and you find your self ranked above average, it will take longer to find a game and the low matchmaking times are usually limited to a couple of playlists. Playing on M&K is rewarding but difficult as the game favours controller (this is coming from a controller player who moved to M&K.... for some reason... despite the disadvantage I cant seem to go back to controller).

With all that said, DO NOT forget the state this game came out in.... its unforgivable, 343/Microsoft lost hundreds of thousands of players due to releasing such an incomplete and at the time garbage Halo game. A lot to follow was also terrible. The customisation currently is unacceptable, you have to pay for all cosmetics and in my opinion they are 10 times the price they should be and in the case of your spartan colours the price should be free!

The Free-to-Play aspect however is egregious with basically the bare minimum of armor pieces and nothing to work towards but challenge swaps and stickers if you don't buy the premium pass. Even if you buy the pass it isn't worth the 5 or so armors you get and the armor ""sets"" that you can't edit are a slap in the face. Thought if I paid 60 dollars for the campaign I'd get free armors and an option to work towards things I wanted like in previous halo's. Boy, I sure do love stickers and colors for my 60 dollar purchase Microsoft, thanks I don't know how I would have had fun without you showing me what I do and don't need! Btw where's my free clown makeup coating? I've already got my power ranger one.

But seriously I've played almost 50 hours at the time of this review (mostly multiplayer) and my armor still looks identical to what I did at the moment I got the game. it's also going to take me another 100 to unlock any other armor pieces without paying for the battle pass. The helmet I wore all the time in reach is in the store for 20 dollars and even then I don't have the base core unlocked to wear it. I'm not paying a dime into the multiplayer unless it changes to a reach style customization plan.

But, I have to say Infinite has a very strong gameplay flow. I never find myself frustrated with sprint or mantle, I think the movement in particular has been executed very well. I find myself missing some of the old weapons (covenant and human), but I think all of the weapons have a place in the sandbox and I enjoy using most of them. Going back to the classic art style probably saved the franchise, and I am very happy with the looks of the weapons and the armor, (a few of the armor cores are a bit ridiculous). The sheer amount of armor customization was a breath of fresh air after Halo 5, and the only thing holding it back at this point is the lack of cross core customization. The progression system, haunts me in my sleep. Going with the battlepass style progression system is very lazy, and I find incredibly unrewarding. I find it hard to believe that any Halo game after Reach has looked even remotely different where unlocking armor and such is concerned, I don't have any suggestions other than follow what Reach did, it is universally loved. As much as I dislike the idea of spending real money on in-game cosmetics, I like the idea of a rotating item shop. But, I do not like the fact that half of the items I do not have unlocked, might come back to the store one day, and I might be online that week if I happen to catch it when it does, maybe??? Something needs to be done about that. The challenge based XP is so very frustrating to me. I like the idea of challenges, I always have, but they should be in addition to earning XP through simply playing matches and earning metals. If you get an overkill, or a killing spree during a match, you get XP based off each metal and it's difficulty/rarity to obtain. You should be rewarded for playing well. I have had an absolute blast with custom games thus far. Forge is undoubtedly the best of any Halo game to date, and I see room for it to grow and become even greater. If we can create out own content, this game will be in an amazing place. The lack of a pre-game and post-game lobby is very sad to me, it feels pretty much impossible to meet people and make friends without it. I know 343 worries about bad interactions with less than sanitary characters, but it certainly doesn't help the community, grow either way. Finally, the goofiest issue this game has, only because of how incredibly fixable it is, is the menu for selecting a mode in multiplayer. It absolutely blows my mind that they didn't take inspiration for the MCC, it is literally perfect in every way. The current one we have in Halo Infinite doesn't display everything at once, and it commits the biggest sin of them all, it's so incredibly boring. This game's menus need more character, and if you need help with that 343, look at Halo CE through Reach.
I have very mixed feelings about this game as it currently stands, but there is no denying it's is in a far better spot than when it launched. If this is what the game is like after a year and then some, I believe it will be in a great spot in another year. I just hope 343 has their priorities straight, the wrongs need to be right before they keep adding content.

Mainly we have 5 big issues that need to be addressed

Network Issues
There are just too many network issues to mention. I can go on about rubber banding, ghost melees, desync, hit reg, crashes etc. I played on a variety of platforms now since launch. Xbox One Slim, Xbox Series X, and PC. This game, no matter the platform, wired or wireless, or whatever settings you use, there are just so many issues. This game truly shouldn't have been released until it was finished. I know some pressured for release but I was one of those that would gladly have waited for this game to come out working buttery smooth at launch then what it launched as with all the game breaking bugs. I get bugs overall are unavoidable. But ones that do this much damage and create negative impression to consumers was destined to do unnecessary harm rather then let this game cook in the oven more. It should have been as well because it was a almost a completely new engine, Microsoft should have been willing to pour every resource in delays to make sure it released finished as they was potentially going to be a rebirth of the franchise if it had been done right. It could have been the Baldur's Gate 3 of setting standards for the rest of the AAA industry, instead its just one of the buggiest games. Even last night the game crashed 4 times trying to search matchmaking for infection.

Greedy Monetization
They promoted this whole premium battle pass with NO FOMO talking about how much customization there would be... and then in the end the vast majority are locked behind a FOMO paywall store. Letting players buy some of the best items instantly without needing to play after to earn good items thus leading to less player retention needed just to get that sweet sweet cash only to keep the population low.... when the whole solution was the PBP as it would keep players engaged while also being a revenue source. But they just gave up and indirectly made that free too so they can justify the store. In that whole problem with the PBP they started off at launch with skyrocketing prices, like $20 bundles. Lowered it after they back received backlash. They promised cross-core, that we are still waiting on, allow people to buy past items to get rid of some fomo. But everything is still tied behind bundles. And since the heat died down they have, just like Battlefront 2, slowly been increasing the prices again. They even recently put a $35 bundle on the store. And they took away team colors and color selection just to push this type of monetization and lied to say that it couldn't be done even though mod tools shows it was possible, it's possible in blender for custom spartan armor and color selection with alphas just like previous iterations. And forge you can now customize colors on dead spartan assets. They could have easily monetized a way that was more in line with what we have seen with Armor Core 6 and Warframe where colors are free and instead you can buy patterns, materials, wear and tear, roughness/glossiness, metallic levels, like you can do in Quixel/Substance painter. Give everyone any color but have the basic look but if you want your spartan to have a gold look instead of yellow then buy the metal, add some camo patter, give it some grunge, dirty, scratches to look more personalized. They had so much potential on this front to still make money while not being anti-consumer by taking away long existing features. It's a damn shame.

Missing or Broken Day One Core Features and Content
This one has improved the most I'll admit but some have been phoned in efforts that need to be called out. At launch this game was missing plenty of modes and features. Forge has been the only thing that has been done really well. But sadly, that's just it. Custom Game Browser was added but its still unplayable and unstable. I can hardly every play on it. It's fun when I can get on and enjoy people's creations but it is just rare. The matches sometimes crash but more often just trying to get into a match is the challenge. It will glitch out multiple times while trying to join, close the game, re-open, glitch out again, close, reopen game, try to join back again, glitch out, close infinite again, open the game join... and maybe... MAYBE... it will work. This just frustrating just to join a custom game. Theater got some fixes but still has it's issues. campaign co-op has been difficult to get a friend to join and very laggy. Splitscreen coop was promised, it even works through glitches, but yet still 343 cancelled it. We still. don't have grifball. Firefight still waiting for. Finally added Infection but it was not what I was looking forward to. More on that about the ""Halo Infinite is a Competitive Focused Game""

Terrible Design and Gameplay Decisions
The UI/UX is just lackluster, the HUD is a big WTF. It goes against the entire design that Halo has maintained from Halo 3 to Halo 5. Now all the information is crammed into the bottom left and right corners rather than utilizing the four corners making it hard to read. The removed classic medals for goofy ones that didn't need changing like for killionaire. The changed the killing sprees for stuff like ""Boogeyman"" when ""Invincible"" sounded so much cooler. It was just an unneeded change. 

Halo Infinite is a Competitive Focused Game
343 has publicly stated they believe Halo is a competitive focused game but its a social party game. But because of this ideology from 343 that they aren't willing to let it go they have made the game too sweaty. There is little to no appeal for the casual audience that make up on average throughout Halo's history as 90% on average, even long time halo fans, like myself play halo casually. There is just nothing fun about how sweaty the experience is. Other than from what we got at launch, there has been little to nothing for the casual experience. Again CGB is broken. Campaign still has some fun glitches removed that harmed no one and diminished the fun there. Now every match is a slip n slide Titanfall match where sweats will derank their mmr to play in social against easier player just to trash on everyone to help encourage people to not continue playing. Modes that have always been mindless casual fun, have now been added with sweaty elements. If I want BR only SWAT, I have to play ranked. Infection now has alpha infected that have perma camo so they can camp for cheese kills as well as Requis' bedsheet ability they can spam while running at you like they just snorted a line of gfuel and moving at cr4ckh34d speed while the beta infected get teleporters to slingshot all over the map. At first it might have seemed fair/balanced but now that its been out for over a month with S4 everyone has adapted to the meta and infected feel like they win almost 99% of the time. They have to give the last player all these BS abilities with a 30 second timer, not because the last man will dominate, but because the last man is lucky if he can even survive that long before getting overrun and swarmed by the horde. I missed the anxiety of classic infection with last man standing running around swordbase seeing the zombies chase you down, slightly faster but not by a lot, so they would slowly catch up and you know you have to face them sooner or later, gun a few down and then run again. Constantly panicking as a horde of infected are chasing you around the map. That is fun. Infinite's infection is just a boring sweatfest that if you want to even survive you just have to get you and like 5 or 6 others to just camp the hallways to even hope to have a chance to survive... and even then... with all the benefits the infected have... scrubs still complain and demand removal of""turrets, camo, OS, chokepoints, etc. Gimme standard social infection and swat, please

But now the game is actually coming together, much due to new leadership at 343. The guy who fixed MCC (which is EXCELLENT now) is now trying to do the same for Infinite. In my opinion Infinite Menu UI is awful, ugly, slow, and confusing. The custom games browser is not as smooth as MCC, and I cannot join games I try to join, and it's confusing to cancel join since the UI is goddamn clunky and poorly designed.

The good:
Campaign - the actual levels are entertaining, open world between is kinda dull with there only being the same landscapes. No snow or swamp areas like Halo 1. Loved the underground Forerunner areas, yet wish there was more variation. NO new Campaign content on the horizon which sort of sucks. This Halo should have abundant Flood references or more but...nope.

Gameplay - best Halo has been. Heavy or Normal BTB is addictive. Squad Battle has beautiful Halo 2 and 3 maps which super fun. Waterworks, Zanzibar. No more imbalanced pelican drops on BTB, thank goodness.

Forge - incredible custom maps, more Forge coming in a season or two.

343i first raised (remember those initial trailers with different biomes, machines under water and herds of wildlife?) and then crushed the hopes, excitement and good will of millions of Halo fans by launching the game in a disastrous state. 

So whilst 343i do deserve some credit for dragging the game in to something approaching a respectable state, sadly I fear the recent updates are too little too late. 

And unfortunately, the very obvious, and pretty cringe below the line PR effort by 343i/Microsoft in the last week or so that has seen a flood (see what I did there?) of YouTubers suddenly, and all at the same time making positive content about Infinite, has also triggered a tsunami of hackers. Hackers have long been lurking on Infinite, but now I am running into one every 3 or 4 games.

When this game first came out, I had a blast playing it over and over, it felt like a proper Halo game again compared to Halo 4 and Halo 5: Guardians, and as the time goes on, the game did get stale very quickly with the lack of maps and game types. I do recommend playing this game, but not if you're wanting to play it every day in it's current state, without forge and a bunch of maps, it's really hard to keep playing the game without getting bored of really quickly. I feel like once forge and a custom game browser is added, this game will more likely boom again and hopefully get more players to return, but that doesn't look like it'll happen anytime soon. 

I understand why a lot of people dislike this games, with the shop, lack of content, and many other stuff. I do believe this game can and will get better if 343i properly listens to it's community and actually put in the effort to fix the many issues with the lack of content, shop, and ect.

UPDATE: 8/17/2023
After months and months of waiting to update this, I have to give my an updated opinion. This game is really fun, I'm having more fun and getting excited for each update that it brings out. One major issue still stands and that's micro transaction for armor and the lack of players. Game play is fun af, I love nearly every weapon from the BR, DMR (Bandit Rifle), to the shock rifle. Don't listen to the haters, most of them are still just salty about the micro transactions, the maps are getting better with each release, the throwback to older maps with forge is great, and the game modes they're bringing back are always fun. Can't wait for more seasons and updates. 343i with new management are doing much better with the game, yes they started rough, but so did EA's Battlefront 2017, but after updates and time it became a great game.

This is by far the best Halo 343 has made. Mechanics feel just like you would expect from Halo multiplayer. In terms of game play I would say the games is almost perfect. However changing secondary fire on certain weapons like the plasma pistol render them pretty useless. New weapons fill those roles but I would prefer if the old weapons still functioned the same. I cant speak on performance because I have an i9 12900k and an RTX 3080 TI so it runs great for me. Not sure about lower end hardware. My only major complaint is the challenge system and store. The prices are to high for cosmetics. An the challenge system can be infuriating. Challenges that can only be completed by playing specific game modes with no way of opting out. I hate rumble pit which if just free for all. Yet I get tons of wasted challenges because I refuse to play modes I don't like. You can swap these challenges if you have a challenge swap. If you don't you have to earn them via leveling up the battle pass. If you don't have the pass then you have to pay for swaps with real money. That sucks an is obviously done on purpose to get you to spend money. All in all its better than Halo 4 and Halo 5s multiplayer. I would recommend it highly.

Randomly (and quite frequently) switching of the equipment (grappling hook, wall, etc.) will break and you are stuck with whatever you had selected at the time. May start working again after dying and re-spawning. Makes it so you can't actually rely on this core feature.

Mission checkpoints and progression break sometimes. When all people in the squad die, you reload to a much earlier checkpoint than you are supposed to, but all the enemies are dead and all the doors that you would unlock by beating enemies or pressing a button are locked and can't be unlocked.

[hr][/hr]
It's a story that every Halo fan is familiar with. 343 Industries, a studio spun up by Microsoft to be the stewards of the Halo IP going in the future, took over the franchise in 2011 after the departure of series creators Bungie. They then proceeded to drag the franchise and its fans through two sequels which, while not awful in totality, were proof that 343i had no clue what made Halo so special in an aesthetic nor a gameplay sense. 

[b]Halo Infinite[/b] was seemingly meant to be the course correction for the Halo series in the modern era. It had the Bungie era aesthetics, music evocative of Marty O'Donnell's amazing scores, and a gameplay loop that brought the focus back to the sandbox. Weapons, vehicles, power ups, and equipment placed on the maps, equal starting loadouts, and a set of base abilities that blended old and new felt refreshing in an age of gaming where this kind of arena design was dead in the mainstream. Despite a solid foundation however, 343i's attempt at creating a live service ecosystem around what they had built was doomed from the start because of just how bare bones the launch game was.

Critical features like campaign co-op, the custom game browser, and Forge mode did not ship at launch, split-screen co-op didn't launch at all, and the features that were initially included were half-baked or broken. The content updates were extremely slow to come out, utterly failing to keep the core community engaged as new maps trickled out at the slowest rate they had in the series history. The free 2 play cash shop and the battle pass system being the only meaningful ways to earn cosmetic items critically damaged the experience of the average player, a problem only made worse by a horrible armor coating system which disallowed players to change their armor colors as they saw fit. This combination of failures and downgrades made much of the community write off Infinite for good, seeing every update as too little, too late.

Despite the general attitudes around the game, a hiring freeze that prevented new developers from coming onto the game to help fix it up, and a huge management shakeup that led to the previous studio heads departing from the company, 343i kept on working diligently to fix the game's issues. Pierre Hintze, the man who led the Master Chief Collection's amazing overhaul, taking over as the head of 343i has led to an incredible shift in priorities from the developers: building up on top of the solid foundation they already had by giving the community what they want.

Halo Infinite is officially in comeback mode.

The new developer-made maps are a huge improvement over the stock maps, finally allowing the arena game design to shine. The playlist rotations keep things fresh every week. Free events happen all the time, finally letting free players collect some great looking gear on a regular basis. Custom games are lively and full of tons of creativity. Forge mode is astoundingly powerful, with some forged maps looking indistinguishable from developer made maps. They've even started to implement the best of the community's maps directly into the matchmaking system, in both competitive and casual playlists. Shoutouts to the Squad Battle playlist.

It's amazing to see how much better Halo Infinite actually is right now. Even in a gaming landscape where games launch broken and then somehow get even worse though post-launch updates, there are many reasons to be optimistic for the future of this game due to the dedication 343i has shown in the last several months. I hope that people will be able to give it a chance again, because if 343i stays the course, this could be one of the best Halo games of all time.",1691896961,1692017546,True,252,7,0.899509966373443604,0,True,False,False

There are some issues I have noticed within the single player, various bugs and such but nothing that completely ruined the experience for me, if you are looking to play the singleplayer then I would wait until its on sale, i picked it up when it was 50% off but you can also get it on gamepass too for very cheap.

The multiplayer is free to play and is supported by cosmetic micro-transactions within the store and the various battle passes within the game. I like that you can work on previous battle passes that you missed out on which is similar to MCC but you have to buy these individually. The multiplayer is very fun but as someone who is not a halo expert or veteran it did feel quite difficult for me to play because of the low player count the only people that really seemed to play was the hardcore fans who were very good at the game, do not expect a huge amount of players, its a shame because it is very fun and its improved a ton since release.

But after coming back nearly 2 years after launch, i have to say, i'm really fucking impressed with 343. (That's something i never thought i would say lol) This game made me give up on halo completely, lore, game everything. And for someone who has played halo since they were 4, that hurt. That's how soul crushing this game was to me on launch. Most, if not all of my complaints are still true with the campaign, so im keeping that section. But ive changed my stance on multiplayer quite a lot since returning.


Its actually not that bad lol. For a live service game to work, there ofc needs to be microtransactions. And honestly, Halo Infinite does it better then most, little to no fomo or fucking ludicrous prices and pretty frequent sales, The battlepass is GREAT, buy 1, and the rest are free with the in-store credits you unlock with levelling it up. THAT'S AWESOME! The challenges are also WAY better now, with WAY more to do (if you played on launch u know the HELL that was the challenges) and the gunplay is still fucking great. Honestly, great fucking work 343, it did take a LOOOOONG while, and your still missing some content. But this is now a truly great halo *muliplayer*. Thanks! 

campaign still fucking sucks tho



OLD REVIEW MINUS TWO PARAGRAPHS THAT WERE ME RAMBLING:

They really blue balled me when they decided to kill Cortana off-screen and not give me the chance to kick Atriox’s ass for throwing Chief around like a stuffed toy in the opening. I spent the whole campaign growing stronger and stronger just to fight videogamedunkey with lung cancer. Don’t get me wrong, Halo Infinite has the best gameplay in the series, I just feel like the campaign ended WAY too early especially when 80% of my gameplay was side missions rescuing marines and clearing bases while The Weapon (for god sake give her an actual normal name) nags me for not wanting to go to 3 different towers to press 3 buttons to advance the plot. I kinda felt like I was just killing guys guarding buttons for most of the story, which gets interrupted by a cutscene of Esperanza talking shit to me over FaceTime.

And my god the multiplayer... it's a cluster fuck of overpriced skins, soul crushing battle pass progression, and like 3 modes... I understand this game is a long way from finished and even in this state is FAR better than its competitors but holy balls is this game fucking brittle, it desperately needs some damn meat on its bones. For what it's worth, good job 343 for making a semi-decent Halo game. Now try and make a good one


Now while this review is overly pessimistic I will say, this is THE best feeling halo game, its smooths and light, yet weighty and gritty, Its genuinely perfect!

The story could use some major expanding but I'm sure 343 will sort that out in future DLCs!!! (ugh) (Cant wait to dump 20mil on a trillion DLCs borderlands style). 

Is it worth 50 bucks rn? No. Not at all. You can beat it in like 14 hours, 100% it in like 25. For 50 smackers, you could do better. If you really care about the story go watch a HiddenXperia video. This game has the solid foundation it needs, but there ain't a lot on top of it.

Despite that, it always felt like the proper evolution of Halo from Halo 3 that I've been wanting, the movement evolution that made sense from Halo 3 and Reach. I'd been seeing more positive things about the game lately, and finally had a chance to return to try it out, and I truly believe that Halo Infinite has finally made it as a proper Halo game.

There are, of course, still some draw backs. Thanks to the way the game monetization was originally envisioned, there is still a little bit of a lack of cross core for elements that should be cross core, but there has definitely been improvement in armor variants and availability. The store has also been improved, for those who don't mind spending a little money on what they really want, such that more items are available for purchase from the store menu, and several other item packs are available through the armor customization window even if they don't appear in the main store page.

Multiplayer/PvP:
Overall, I think the game has definitely improved and has the playlist and map content that people have been wanting for PvP since launch, and more content is on the way.

Campaign:
While fun and intriguing, campaign/story mode is a little lacking in content (essentially a glorified version of Halo CE's 2nd level) and the lack of substantial story updates either through subsequent campaign releases or Spartan Ops-esque levels a la Halo 4 does give me pause on recommending the purchase of the campaign unless you're a die-hard Halo fan that will accept any amount of playable story content.",1691961937,1691961937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then it dwindled as 343 failed to really deliver what they promised in adequate time. Now, in late summer 2023, I can confidently say that it has reached a point where it feels more like the Halos we loved in the past with a modern edge. Of course the microtransactions are annoying, but they did manage to find a way to add free functions to progression into the game so it isn't alienating those who don't want to hemorrhage money into a free game. Alas, the producers need to make money, and sure they did on the campaign, which was quite solid and hopefully they do get the green light to continue the story with DLC (though that looks unlikely any time soon). Alas, it is halo and it feels like halo, they are making up for their mistakes upon release and sure enough, they could have released it this fall 2023 and it would have much likely done a better job with retaining players -- but I understand why they released it somewhat pre-maturely. It's a good game, despite its flaws. People on Steam don't seem to play as much, but the Xbox player base seems to be quite strong -- thankfully this is a cross-platform game, so us few PC folks can play with Xbox folks, making that mediocre 5000 peak daily steam players seem less important.

I'll start out with the technical stuff. The game just plain looks great. Clear images and animations, and decent framerate for most of my playtime. There were occasional points of lag (especially once I got the Wasp plane and flew over what I presume are prominent loading zones), and a few did admittedly cause me to falter and die, but I was never extremely frustrated by it (Though the consistent lag at the credits was weird).
For me, the biggest issue was audio. I'd semi-consistently get moments where either game audio (voices, weapons, etc.), music, or both lagged then played all at once on top of each other, or dialogue lines being spoken out of order and pace.
As far as design, like I said above, the game looks great. Good character models (especially for Chief and the Pilot), a decently detailed environment (I didn't need to see every pore, and it wasn't blocky either for most of my playtime), and nice general aesthetics for each area. Yes, the areas can become samey (especially for the overworld itself), but it didn't bother me all that much. The light was excellent, especially towards the end.
For gameplay, if you like Halo, you'll like this. No weapon feels truly bad to use (Except for probably the Disruptor, I never used it unless I had to), but you will definitely have your favorites (for me, probably the Battle and Assault Rifles and the Commando). I surprisingly liked the Pulse Carbine as I kept using it. My biggest surprise was the Sentinel Beam. In Halos 2 and 3, it was okay, but not my first choice. In Infinite, I fuckin love this thing. Instantly my first choice if I ever find it.
One thing that surprised me (in a good way) was the enemies. There's at least a decent variety (mostly those you know with a few new additions), but their behavior and difficulty are the big changes. The dialogue they have gives them a lot more humanity (ba-dum tsh) than before, and they'll even improvise and use other factions' weapons. One other nice note is that they commonly use the species' actual names pretty frequently (but still use Human names enough for you to recognize them), which I thought was cool. I honestly thought the Bulldog shotgun was a Banished weapon at first because of how many Brutes used it. Good arsenal, challenging AI (I played on Normal), and interesting scenarios with the mini-bosses.
A big note on the gameplay is the exploration and rewards of the open world. I was happy you get the Grappleshot early, as that made exploration a lot easier and more fun. While there aren't many opportunities to truly be Spider-Man with it even if you get good, it still makes climbing things a lot easier. The upgrades for each item you get are useful, but I mostly stuck to the Grappleshot until the end or in dire moments. There are a lot of upgrade points to be found for said equipment, and I have mixed feelings on the fact that you don't need to find all of them to completely upgrade your gear. The audio logs were an okay listen when I found them, but I usually don't care for that kind of thing anyway.
Overall, I had a great time with Infinite. Wide and pleasant world, good characters, great gunplay, and solid writing help carry the game well (even if some story beats can go over your head if you aren't a mega fan who saw things outside of the core games). While there was some visual and prominent audio issues, I can't say for certain whether they're from the game or my crappy wifi, but discretion advised nonetheless.

Whatever common issues with the game people have (like the generic environment), I have good faith that 343 will expand on this to truly great heights in the future, which I'm very excited about. Solid 9/10.

For the Multiplayer:
I have a kind of weird back and forth relationship with Halo Infinite as of late. I hardly think about it, and a notable amount of said thoughts are usually pity that it isn't what it once was under Bungie. The core of Halo that's always been there is still there (fun weapons, great adrenaline and satisfaction when you get into it) and the polished updates have certainly been nice (I only had one notable instance of teleporting around the map, and even then it was minor and pretty quick, though match finding and initial loading were a little slow), but those inherent flaws in the game are still there, mainly with customization and progression. The battle passes are relatively cheap (10 bucks for full access, around 18 for full access and 1/4 of a pass already done via XP chips, and once you do buy said passes (possible at any time) you can work on them whenever you want, which is very much appreciated), but that general system has never been great IMO, and limiting color and armor sets to certain avatars still sucks, making me feel bad for not having them or just sucking when they aren't available for purchase if I had the money. Still, those are pretty much entirely on 343's decisions and the industry at large, not the game itself.

Overall, the game is fun, and definitely very much polished compared to the original release, but it's also 1000 times better with friends in a voice call like the old games would've been.",1691886343,1691886343,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Campaign really lacks content, some cutscenes are just Chief and The Weapon talking, no explanation for the Endless or any Biome change in all of the Campaign, which it makes it kinda repetitive. 
About the multiplayer, well, I really like some armor cores, and like I said, the gameplay is very fluid and very satisfying. But the limited spartan colors, and the pricy sets are kind of a letdown in customization.

As an example, I am a hardcore Halo fan with untold hours in this franchise. I have even played and competed professionally in previous titles. This game though? It's a chore. A stain on the franchise, much like Halo 5: Guardians. The Campaign was actually half decent, though rushed, but considering its such a small ""part"" (DLC) of this sorry excuse for a game, I feel I cannot actually include it in this review. To get the good points out of the way, the gameplay itself feels rock solid - movement, ui and all that jazz is actually pretty damn good. Forge is amazing. But that's where it ends.

I'll start out bluntly; this whole game as a service model needs to stop. Battle passes suck, Halo did not need to change it's previous formula at all. Selling these ridiculous battle passes in lieu of actual progression is an absolute cancer on the games industry and it undermines the efforts the developers have put into making this shamble run somewhat smoothly. Having to pay to progress in what is honestly an already a fairly hollow experience is an insult to injury. For the past few years 343 Industries has been trying to undo its mistakes and make this game fun to play. Sure, the new content additions go a long way to help that happen, though they should have been there at launch. But playing this content gets stale, real damn quick. This isn't a matter of ""your expectations are too high"" - it's a matter of if I want to feel like my play time is being rewarded meaningfully, I have to shell out my hard earned cash to do this.

I don't go to work each week and bust my balls just so I can come home, donate that to daddy Microsoft and then bust my balls again for nine hours straight to unlock a piece of content I have already paid for. You are literally making me pay for the ""pleasure"" of grinding in matches just to get the content I paid for. This is a game, not a second job. You CANNOT have both, and no, I don't care if other low effort, predatory games follow this model. You should be setting an example, not falling in line. Halo has always been a trend-setter, yet all this particular iteration of the franchise cares about is milking it's consumers again, and again, and again.

The fact you charge £60 for a somewhat decent, yet half baked campaign and have the absolute gall to then enforce this god awful, cancerous battle pass model is ridiculous. Yes, servers cost money to run. I get that, I also don't care. You should have factored these costs into development rather than trying to update an engine (no, Slipstream isn't a new engine - shut up) that's long past it's retirement date. This game has been grossly mismanaged by a company that's grossly mishandled the franchise on more than one occasion. I just hope the next entry into this franchise is not built on this engine and handled by another developer.

Bug fixes, progression system, 8v8 BTB on classic maps, Infection, the ability to toggle the AI voice, better Forge features, new maps being added regularly, events give you better rewards than before, just so many improvements. Customization is still lacking (due to lack of cross core armor pieces) and they nixed seasonal story cutscenes so they could double down on game fixes, but otherwise a huge improvement.

Season 3 review- Okay, this game is now good. Infection is around the corner, the seasonal story content isn't trash and is pretty good, more skins as default settings so you don't need to spend cash as much for a look you like, and the season is only about 3 months like it should have been.


Winter Update Review- okay, it's safe to get now. Still not where a Halo game should be, but FAR better than launch. We still have to wait on a lot of stuff, but customization isn't *as* scuffed and there's good stuff here with more good stuff on the way.

*ON LAUNCH REVIEW* - This game is great, but I'm losing interest because of the constant server issues, broken Big Team Battle, and it's disgustingly overpriced content in the store. Also, there isn't a lot of customization to be unlocked by playing the game. You're forced to complete weekly challenges and that's the ONLY way to rank up/earn battle pass customization options outside of some freebies that you get from collecting stuff in the campaign. They promised tons of customization, but what they failed to mention is the fact that you need to give them more money for it. You can't earn it.

There are loads of bugs.
Tons of server issues. Can't connect to a game, or our entire party gets thrown from a game 20 seconds into a game.
There are hit detection issues and a heavy dose of server lag that will irritate you beyond belief. You'll be dashing behind a wall, and once your 10 feet past the wall you'll be dead from a sniper or something even though you were behind cover for the last 2 seconds. 

If you play for just the gameplay... This is a great game.

If you expect them to deliver on any of their multiplayer promises, I invite you to join our healing circle... Because I don't see them fixing this anytime soon. They're at the bank making deposits right now.

UPDATE
*AS OF 8/9/2023*

The game is great. It's fun. The weekly challenges are still your only shot at getting good XP in the game and you can knock out an entire weekly challenge in a few hours or a few days depending on how much time you're able to play.

The store is still an overpriced dumpster and their battle passes have the slowest rate of progression you'll ever experience in a game. 

I wish all of the armor pieces were interchangeable with all of the armor cores. It's stupid that I really love different pieces of armor from each armor core, but I can't use them on my favorite core. That really sucks. 

They fixed a LOT of the gameplay issues, bugs, and maps. 

I hate this game. 
I love this game. 

It's been out for a while now. Buy it if you want a cool campaign.

Somewhere out there, in an alternate dimension, this game rules.

There's an unfathomable amount of wasted potential seeping from this game - mechanically sound and hypothetically fun, but it's the walking definition of how competitive game design can suck the fun out of every part of the gaming experience, which absolutely bites for the franchise that used to be the casual gaming juggernaut. Its campaign is ultimately mediocre, especially with the Master Chief Collection available on PC for direct comparison of the Halo catalog; the Co-op experience feels like a bug ridden alpha at best; and the multiplayer experience is an abysmal slog that becomes more chore than game in anyone's hands. 

And what pray tell does all this strife equate to? Surely the grind for rewards might make it all worth something? Absolutely not. Some 20% of the game's customization unlocks can be earned through gameplay, and the rest are ALL micro-transactions, with no feasible way to go freemium. Attempting to do so is a fool's errand. After completing 2 of the game's 4 seasons I can fervently proclaim that it is simply not worth the trouble of investment, and moreover my honest disappointment in any lack of improvement across the board. 

With rumors that 343i as a studio has been gutted in the face of this game's general failure, I have faith that things are not going to get any better from here.

This game has made enough changes that a lot of what I had posted was no longer correct.

Of all the things, there is STILL no exclusive fullscreen option. I am butthurt about that.

Anyway, my biggest gripe for this game rn is how badly it performs with pretty good hardware. I have 3080 Ti 12GB GPU and rendering the game at 1080p, I still see VRAM usage upwards of 11GB at times. I don't know if its just poorly optimized or if there is currently a memory leak of some kind. either way, you end up needing to restart the game every half an hour to fix it.

On a more positive note, the game has come a long way and there are a lot more maps available in matchmaking including remakes of older halo maps.
The weapons all feel mostly good with the only two questionable ones being the nerfed commando rifle and the nerfed disruptor pistol. 
There are a lot less bugs than were present at launch as well.
The ingame purchaseable cosmetics seem to be even more expensive now than they used to be, which is annoying. 
Overall, this game is fun, but lacks soul. It is something I play every day, BUT only because I have friends to play it with. Playing this by yourself is simply not very enjoyable.

The campaign is good. It's not great but it is fun. The overworld map is cool and exploring the whole map is a funb time waster.

This is easily the best Halo Multiplayer has been ever. Movement and shooting are smooth, the pace is just right and the sounds and action are great. The new features are game changing. The mark feature will get into your head when playing other games and going back to MCC without it is almost jarring. Grapple is also terrific and really alters the feel of the game in a good way. When you are in the middle of a match it is clear this is the most polished Halo experience.  

Oh but the bad... To reach this point has required 2 straight years of almost constant work. Along the way most of the player base lost their patience and left and now we are left with a complete product and too few players to fill the modes. It is a given that some modes are so unpopular that you can't find a match at all. Depending on the day and hour you may also find that you are unable to get into a match in some of the more popular modes. Not ideal.

But the worst thing to contend with are the bugs. Despite the time and effort the game still crashes on PC for many players resulting in drops. The game looks good. Not great but good. For that the game requires an inordinate amount of resources  to play smoothly. In some cases I have had system breaking bugs including one so bad it erased my  hard drive letter from windows and I had to physically remove the drive from my computer and power cycle it to get it fixed. There are still persistent problems with synch and net code that result in missed melee and wild weapon issues (disappearing rockets and grenades). Problems like this on launch day? Ok. 2 Years later? Not OK. And lastly, because its Halo, most of the community is hot toxic garbage and the few hits you get on chat are bound to be negative.  

Its kind of remarkable then that this is a for sure buy despite the issues. There are very few team based non hero shooters out there that play well and also add to the genre and this is the best available. It has its issues, but there is the best Halo has ever been for running and gunning so if you enjoy that gameplay you must check it out.",1691264147,1691264147,True,109,4,0.766120970249176025,1,True,False,False

Don't buy another scam, Multiplayer plagues with armor cores behind battle passes trinkets COD warzone style that dingle-dangle when you run..but they canceled DLC for campaign,canceled couch play co-op, Canceled plans for sequel for now Yay!..

Auto-drooling console players will plague your dreams across map. Break your arms trying to maintain a glimer of your own dignity , meanwhile Steven the 7year old crayon eater is beating you with one hand on his joystick and preparing to give you his 2,7cm of glory.

I played the campaign twice back to back now and I can say, It's pretty damn good.

Multiplayer scared me though.. Such horrible shit they spam at you just in the main menu.. Battle pass. Premium Shop... This and That .. Buy a Red armor color ..but not for all armors! just for this one..(outrageous scams)
Might be fun, but frustrating grinding and getting ""meme'd"" by Controller users who auto-aim will give you a few headaches or not being able to select specific mode to play.. not all modes present from previous games..and such..

Campaign was fine, I'd say it wasn't memorable but I did have fun while playing it. Multiplayer was absolutely a joke though at launch, missing several core modes and a proper progression system. I've never seen a game release with a really solid gameplay loop and decent customization, only to get the ""easy stuff"" absolutely wrong.

A few years later and 343 has finally made some solid moves and seem to be finally listening to the community. I think what's proper to note is that 343 changed leadership back in September of 2022, and I think we have Pierre Hintze to thank. 

Halo Infinite can be the game they envisioned that will satisfy fans further by continuing to improve on what they've already added.

Continue to add in more classic game modes. Add in remakes of fan-favorite maps from previous Halo titles. Keep adding more weapons to the sandbox, and maybe even finally tune some of them to be useful like how they feel in the campaign. Give us Firefight.

Obviously, there are some MAJOR issues with multiplayer progression and the battle pass, but considering the amount of feedback I've seen about it, I'm hopeful for its redemption. Notable examples of its issues include dogshit rewards for free players, (almost) no XP for completing matches (and none for medals or how well you do), and awful customization limitations (such as specific armor pieces and colors only for specific armor cores and emblems for armor, vehicles, weapons all being individual, etc) even when progressing past halfway through the battle pass.

There are more issues of course, but I don't want this to strictly be a negative review. The game is great, mostly balanced very well, acquiring weapons throughout the maps and the damage they do are great, and, while this might seem like it shouldn't have to be noted, the game runs well (I did want to include this due to optimization issues I've experienced and heard from Cyberpunk and Battlefield 2042 most notably). Lastly, the multiplayer is free, so if you haven't already, try it.

Hope remains for 343i and Halo.

Yes i would have rated it higher if it had the good old mission 1-2-3 etc but that's not enough for me not to buy and play this game.. It is good game simple as that .

Its a hard call for a developer when to make a change to a franchise or to just leave it and keep the same model. But for me this should not be the case for single player campaigns if its what put you on the map then leave it.. improvements should be hardware related only . You got a new idea then create a new franchise with it.
 However Muti player over time may need refreshing  to keep the play base hooked but not all game will need that . Counter Strike is a prime example of keeping it the same.. ""don't fix whats not broken this metaphor is for real people""..
Just add new game types if needs be but leave the rest alone. Call of Duty MW2 is a great example of a massive collection of FPS game types to suite everybody's needs and my hat goes off to them .. They get the stick but for that AAA game price there is a lot of content .

Campaign: While the idea and execution of the open world was done fairly well, the stories that take place in it are dry. I couldn't get into it. Chief and The Weapon sound completely uninterested  and uncaring. The banished feel like generic bad guys #487 in all interactions. I like the simple gameplay loop of go kill thing, go save x, and so on. This loop however, while nice and simplistic, lacks connections to each other and uniqueness. It doesn't feel as if my efforts amount to any change in the world. Sometimes the need to travel everywhere does get annoying as if I run over a small rock and flip my hog into a hole (Which happens decently often) I have to start over from a FOB or walk for an upwards of ten minutes through empty terrain or enemy camps. The story element of the game is simply non-existent. The Developers seemed to realize Overall I got bored with the story after the first five missions, the game feels disconnected and the characters feel one dimensional.
Multiplayer:
First of all, monetization 100, gameplay 5. Micro-transactions seem to be the only way to obtain ANYTHING cool and they work on very much rigged battlepass seasons which I shall simply state is distasteful. Every game feels the same, run around, shoot a guy, get shot, respawn. While the weapons in the game as a whole feel great, I rarely have a fun matchmaking experience and those are limited to BTB and CTF. On top of that the mouse and keyboard controls feel clunky . The abilities are ok, but the TTK(time to kill) makes their use difficult and situational. Connectivity issues are similar to that of the older games and MCC but with a little more input lag.

TLDR: Infinite not as bad as it was! maybe even good?

I honestly did not expect to leave a positive review for this game, back when multiplayer first released I found myself rather disappointed with what Infinite was. I played maybe 3-4 hours of it and dropped it. 

2+ years later and we actually have a game that stands up to the old days, it doesn't surpass it, but it is definitely a fun experience. Especially now that we are getting forge remakes of old classic maps!

If you are a halo boomer like me who found themselves preferring MCC to Infinite at launch, maybe give this one a shot again. They finally brought back some good modes and are starting to change up the weapon sandbox with the DMR addition. (Coping for the old covenant carbine and spartan laser, a boy can dream)

Looking forward to the future of Halo Infinite! 

Side Bars
- I still very much dislike the customization system
- We need more maps from previous games in (forge or remakes idc)
- I would love to see more classic equipment too (drop shield, mine, gravlift)
- Sipping the cope-a-cola hard for a firefight update
- I miss older weapons

Unlike MCC which is a collection of everything Halo including Single Player, Multi Player, Forge and Firefight. Halo Infinite has only focused on multiplayer.

The sandbox can be the best it's ever been when the weapons work, with many being inconsistent. Meleeing tracking with the Energy Sword and area of damage with the Gravity Hammer. Area of Effect weapons such as the fan favorite Rocket Launcher with explosions you think should get you a kill but instead only damage your opponent. The needler felt great at first but tracking also is inconsistent with times being able to down your opponent with a few rounds while other times it requires a full clip but only requires a few rounds when used against you. There are alot of precision weapons that require aim assist to efficiently use, favoring controller users.

From the challenging production of the game, the Single Player has suffered the most. The mystery to what happened to Cortona did not payoff and doesn’t give a respectful tribute to her character after being a major part of the franchise. The villain: Escharum is only given long cliche speeches, you never spend enough time with him and understand his view, his purpose, you never relate nor view him as a threat. He is just another obstacle in your way and is not even the most memorable fight along your journey. But speaking of that journey, traversing the open world is extremely fun, the ability and gear progression is very rewarding. I hope they continue this going forward.

It has been almost 2 years and there has been no news or updates on the single player, everything has been focused on the multiplayer. They’ve added Forge and have made party game modes permanent but you can still be on 5+ losing streaks, it falls under the same problems with matchmaking as other games. You are just playing under the developer’s algorithm’s definition of fun, trying to make you win and lose 50/50 but in reality you can go on long losing streaks regardless if you are carrying a team or being carried. I just don’t understand why skill based matchmaking is in non-ranked game modes, what is wrong with random matchmaking?

If there is no single player content and you are not having fun in multiplayer… what else does this game offer?

I would recommend a purchase of this game only if it’s on sale for the single player, you are a sweat, have a dedicated team or prefer a controller.",1690440383,1690440383,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has come a long way since its initial launch, and if you've never played it before or took a break, now is a great time to return. However, there are still some areas that require improvement.

Improved State and Desync Issue:
Halo Infinite has seen significant improvements since its launch, but one persistent issue is the desync problem. It continues to impact the gameplay, especially when it comes to registering hits accurately.

Expanded Cosmetics Options:
The developers have expanded the range of colors available for customizing your Spartan. Personally, I prefer the more neutral colors over the flashy ones. Having played since the game's release, I've participated in events that rewarded me with armor pieces. New players will have more options, but I believe investing in the battle pass is a better choice.

Conclusion:
Halo Infinite's multiplayer has certainly evolved for the better, and it's a good time for both new and returning players.  That beign said 343, addressing the desync issue should be a priority.",1690428713,1690428713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The artstyle is a hot mess - don't get me started on the aesthetic of the chimera armor, eugh - they still haven't fulfilled year-old promises of cross-core armor sets and new armors aren't even cross-core to show that they even remember making that promise. Would it not be easier to make new releases already at that stage to not have so much work in the future?

The matchmaking is still super scuffed, if I'm not the one getting half the kills for my entire team someone else is. Hitreg is a mess even a year after release, CTD issues are widespread and hard to work out, lag spikes aren't uncommon and most friends I've tried to get into this had to get past seemingly non-optional graphics warnings that didn't actually mean anything. 

This game can be a laugh at how bad it can get at best and infuriating at it's unfairness at worst. While they have been working on gameplay issues, I must emphasize this game has been out for almost two years and it's still not in a great place. It's playable and fun in short bursts, but if you're sitting down to have a fun afternoon, you're probably going to end up getting frustrated after a few games and quit.

Halo infinite is a free to play game that has a campaign element that is very decisive as it contradicts everything the series creators established their story telling formula. Due to the fact this game is free, I can recommend it, but I cannot recommend buying the campaign.

[h1]Homogenized Multiplayer[/h1]
Upon release of this game, a majority if not all weapons were completely balanced with each other; which is unheard of in a Halo title. A first in the series, weapons shipped under powered and there really wasn't any blatant outliers for weapons. The maps have unfortunately also followed suit in this new ""Homogenized"" Halo experience. Large portions of the map lack character and characteristics that make them standout that is beyond visual design. Most maps rely heavily on lanes and really tight areas which make the vehicle part of the sandbox hilariously bad. 
Strangely, most returning players will notice that, with all this balancing, the game doesn't seem to be fun anymore. Bungie said it best when they were balancing the Halos before, ""If there really isn't something interesting or catchy in a map or weapon, it isn't really fun. We want our game to be built around, 'what makes this fun' as we want to make games we would play."" Needless to say, I don't think Bungie nor the returning community would find this game fun, it does however have possibly the MOST balanced experience in a Halo game, EVER; kudos for that.

[h1]Forging Ahead[/h1]
Upon release the game made the hilarious decision to not ship with Forge, one of the most iconic features introduced in Halo 3 and has followed every game up to this one; which at this point it is expected. From what feedback I heard from the community, and 343 making a hilarious mistake in not allowing me to partake in the flight as someone who's created maps for H3/Reach that have become part of the rotators, that is hilarious. From what I understand it is as complex as it was in Halo 5, but with much much more tools than in it, which sounds amazing. Normally I would get into forge on Halo games, but I've not really had a group of friends to get into custom games lately to make investing in my creativity in newer titles. This game also shipped without custom games browser, and limited custom games, I know that this has improved since I last played it, but your game should ship complete, not in shambles; and you shouldn't withhold communications from your community.

[h1]""Live Service""[/h1]
It should be noted that this game is trying to be a live service model, which it can barely handle that and is struggling at keeping seasons interesting. Look elsewhere if you are someone who is a live service nut, as this game will leave you wanting more out of each season that they will never deliver on.

[h1]And the Horse they rode in on...[/h1]
The campaign has got to be one of the weirdest Halo campaigns ever, but it plays the best and has that signature Bungie feel to it. But that all ends once we talk about the writing and the general layout of the campaign's story. What was 343 thinking? There was some really great moments in this campaign, but a large portion of the universe is squandered heavily. The ""Open world"" like design is definitely the right direction though, even Bungie knew this but they could never get it to work on the engine, kudos to 343 for figuring out something Bungie failed to do in Halo 3:ODST. However this is definitely without it's jank, as this game had a lot of game breaking glitches occur as well as graphical ones with the changes to the engine. 

[h1]Visual Desert[/h1]
Most were probably waiting for this part, the design, where to start? This game lacks character in every aspect, it has completely lost what made Halo, Halo. It was never about Master Chief, or shooting aliens, although they were a major part. It was more about the art, the character put into every weapon, level, voice line, effect, and visual. Art sometimes is chaotic, sometimes it is better to leave those chaotic bits of the art in to make the broader picture funner to look at. In their attempts to balance the game they over corrected and cleared off everything that made Halo stand out as a shooter in the space of shooters. This game is almost completely lost the original design philosophy that the creators made years ago, and no matter how much the community tries to explain to 343/Microsoft, they never get it. If you were to show this game to a fan of Halo 1-3, during the release of those games and tell them this was the future of Halo, they would laugh at you.

[h1]Polished to Imperfection[/h1]
Halo fans will never get the experience Bungie provided years ago as 343/Microsoft continue to try to push E-sports trends instead of what made Halo special.  Sometimes chasing perfection, you can lose the vision of what it is you were trying to accomplish or achieve. In pursuit of this perfection, 343 failed to capture the magic of what made Halo 1-3 so great, but that doesn't mean that the game isn't fun or that you won't like it. You may find fun in this, but for the rest of us die hard Halo fans, we will move on and hope for a better future.

Also Atriox is better than 343, as he did something that took 343 9 years to do, in the first few minutes of the campaign, worth buying just to see the biggest mistake get taken care of in the first few minutes. #Atrioxfor343President",1690302608,1690302608,True,1,0,0.503866016864776611,0,True,False,False

Also looking forward to forge having the ability to create only game modes but custom games still need more options like infinite equipment, grenades etc. and forging game modes should be able to be done offline.

Campaign: Fun, but too big.
-The open world is empty, and the linear levels are all samey. Unlike Halos 1, 2 and 3, I can't really recall any differences between missions, they all just seem the same. No one mission or area stands out, either for game play or visual interest.
-The story feels like it was changed many times during development, and just doesn't really make sense.
 - The checkpoints can be inconsistent.

Oh and i think The Weapon should be named after the 3rd sword.

Multiplayer: Good
-I can't stand the sidekick.
-The movement acceleration is faster than in the early halos, which makes grenades less useful.

+ Banished banter is top notch, so is the art direction IMO
+ I think the dialogue as a whole is great
+ Graphics
+ Been liking the story so far
+ The grapple is well executed and fun
+ Armor upgrades are quite neat
+ The new weapons are fun and interesting 
+ You can now pick up blast and shock coils to throw them in your enemies faces. 10/10

~ No campaign coop yet - but it's coming so this is not a negative

~ There are some minor graphical glitches, the first banished chief came down an elevator repeatedly crossing his arms and looking in the wrong direction before I shot him in the head - still 10/10 lul

~ Long load times before the game starts, tac map takes a long time to open (this might be because I installed it on a hdd, don't do this if you can avoid it )

- Vehicle controls are awful on PC, it's where this being a console port really shines through. The worst offender so far is the scorpion, it's absolutely ass and very frustrating to drive as you can't rotate the hull with A/D at all.

- I can't enter any special characters in game or the steam overlay, had to copy/paste my microsoft passwords while tabbed out. 

- I can't change any keybinds (Default grenade bind being C and G kinda sucks. I do use V to switch weapons due to my mouse wheel being fucked) 

Also the displayed keybinds in-game aren't correct (I.e it tells me to detach turrets with mousewheel-click while the actual keybind is F) 

- No dual wielding, I liked dual wielding, I wouldn't even be mad if you couldn't grapple like you can't when carrying blast coils.  
:(

Overall, on PC, it's a valiant effort and I have had no issues performance-wise. But there are areas where it really lets you feel that this is a game primarily developed for consoles.

Even so, 8.5/10. Not a buy I regret and the first AAA game I played at launch IN YEARS where I can say this.

Thank you 343, you finally did good, I'm very happy. 

Edit as of 21.07.2023:
Well, with the cancellation of story DLC, the story has become entirely inconsequential. Nothing happens. Can't speak on the multiplayer, it never captured me in any of the halos (except 3, really) but that's a bummer. I am no longer very happy. I thought the core was good, the story was a bit lacking in variety but with the prospect of future expansions I didn't mind at all. 

Now, 343 is working on a Halo in Unreal Engine. After having spent how many years on developing they ""All new fancy schmancy In-house"" SlipStream Engine? Boiiiii

Halo: Infinite is a shadow of what Halo once used to be. 343i and the developers for the game 
have spent years crafting what is arguably the worst Halo entry in the franchise. The campaign is a generic story using the halo title, that attempts to close the loose ends that were established by the previous entries and doesn't do a good job even with what it has to work with. 

I wish we lived in the timeline where the halo campaign and multiplayer in the latest halo entry was worth an hour of your time, but the game launched with an unrewarding system, buggy mechanics, generic and boring maps, horrible gun sandbox, relatively pretty graphics, but irrelevant design choices that have made what was suppose to be a Halo game, into a generic science-fiction shooter that resembles Section 8 more than it does Bungie's vision. This game launched with five maps, and BTB had three maps. To the people who were insanely upset back when 343i launched Halo 4 with 10 maps, I bet you're unhappy. 

This game has become dense. There is no coherent ranked structure, I was able to achieve level 100 in Season 1, and top the charts at Onyx ELO only for it to be the least rewarding grind of my life. This game has taken months to introduce new weapons, months to introduce mechanics that were there on launch in Halo: Reach.

Halo: Infinite, and the Halo IP in general is flailing for life and is no where near as fun as it could have been. Every single decision made at a corporate level feels like it was chosen with the idea that it should continue to kill this game.

Buckle up, Spartans! I've just embarked on an epic journey with our favorite armored hero, Master Chief, in the much-awaited ""Halo Infinite."" And boy, was it a rollercoaster of emotions and epic battles!

First things first, Master Chief seems to be in love with his grappling hook. Forget about fancy armor abilities; this time, it's all about being a space ninja! He swings from one cliff to another like Tarzan on steroids. I half expected him to do a victory dance after each swing. 💃

Speaking of dancing, the enemies seem to be in on the groove too! The Banished soldiers must have attended a ""Dance with the Chief"" workshop because they sure know how to boogie before getting destroyed. I guess they're just trying to distract us with their fancy moves, but no dance-off can save them from Master Chief's wrath.

Oh, and the open-world aspect of the game? It's like a space safari! As I wandered around, I stumbled upon more side quests than an overzealous grandma knitting scarves. ""Save this marine,"" ""defend that outpost,"" ""find lost cats"" – what's next, a cooking class with Grunts? I swear, if Master Chief starts baking space cupcakes, I won't be surprised.

The weapons are out of this world too – literally. Who needs a regular shotgun when you have a ""Gruntapult""? Yes, you heard that right. Blast those pesky Grunts into the stratosphere with one shot. They're like fireworks on the Fourth of July, except in space, and with more plasma.

Now, let's talk about the AI companion, the cheeky little weapon named ""The Weapon."" I couldn't stop chuckling every time it opened its virtual mouth. It's like a sarcastic GPS on steroids. ""Recalculating route, dummy,"" it would say if you took a wrong turn. Who knew an AI could be so sassy?

But wait, there's more! As I delved into the story mode, I couldn't help but wonder if the scriptwriter was binge-watching sci-fi classics. I'm pretty sure I spotted references to ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" and even ""The Wizard of Oz."" Master Chief, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man saving the universe – now that's a crossover I'd love to see!

And let's not forget about the Chief's new enemies, the Banished. They must have attended a ""Baddies Anonymous"" meeting because they're determined to be the evilest villains in the galaxy. Though sometimes, I couldn't help but feel like they were trying too hard to be menacing. All they needed was a mustache to twirl!

In conclusion, ""Halo Infinite"" is an action-packed space opera that takes itself just seriously enough to keep us engaged and laughing. It's a wild ride with Master Chief's grappling hook antics, dance-loving enemies, and a GPS-like AI companion that might secretly hate us.

So, if you're ready to unleash your inner space ninja and enjoy a galactic adventure full of laughs, explosions, and absurdity, strap on your armor and jump into ""Halo Infinite."" Just make sure to bring your dancing shoes – Master Chief will provide the beats! 🚀😄",1644087645,1689806049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now a lot of the fundamental problems are still there but I can't deny that I enjoy the gameplay. I'll sum up my points in a list:

Things I don't like:
- Season pass progression is way too slow, I have to play for hours and all I have to show for it is some helmets and maybe a shoulder pad thing for one arm.
- Levelling up honestly does not feel rewarding although it is nice that they decided to finally add a levelling up system because that was not a thing when I last played
- Timed items in the shop is stupid, why should I not be able to get something just because I happened to not be playing the game? (Not that any of the cosmetics are appealing enough to buy)
- I don't like the push to buy things in the first place really, I already spent £60 on the campaign lol (credits are also hella expsensive)
- The campaign is lowkey boring and too empty, also the game crashes for me every time I try to play the campaign so I can't even play it anyway (shame)

Things I like: 
- I love custom games, they are very fun especially on some very well made maps, I've played slayer in minecraft villages, played in waterparks, raced around rainbow road, played fnaf, chased people around the backrooms with an energy sword, the list goes on...
- Forge is finally in the game (yay)
- Despite the problems with levelling and all that jazz in pvp the actual gameplay is great, I love the mechanics and I'm not bored yet from the repetitive cycle that all fps pvp games have (for me) of just shooting people. which I must say is surprising
- I like that I can play training mode on random maps as well with bots, was sniping around nuketown which was kinda nostalgic for me

So really, my point is, the game is actually enjoyable so why care and complain about levelling up and cosmetics, they don't really add anything to the game other than bragging rights which is why I've decided to recommend it :)

I will keep playing because I don't want to learn different mechanics to different FPS but this game has so many fixes that need to happen and they have been a long time coming.

I would like to say it is no way shape or form is the development teams fault and that it is 100% a failure of leader ship during the initial development. I understand having to patch a game after the initial development team left because of management can not be a easy task and I wish you nothing but the best.

Multiplayer 
- They took out ranked slayer BRING IT BACK
- De-sync is still a issue and has seem to have only gotten worse with season 3
- Connection loss. Frequent match disconnects to the point everyone I play with says it happens at least once a day where someone in lobby will lose connection.
- Graphical splicing. On occasion a game will load in and textures go haywire and make so you can't see around the map properly. Not a huge issue unless in ranked where if you quite out your are penalized.

Customization
- Customization is minimum if you don't pay money or grind significant amount of time. Granted they gave it to you for free so not a big issue. My issue comes with the fact that you get no additional customization option for buying the campaign. You get a few skins where as every previous halo game you bought the campaign and could unlock every armor in the game.

Campaign
-  Campaign is lack luster only 6% of people who have this game beat it. Not sure if that includes multiplayer people who never got the campaign but that statement stands. 
- Don't have much to say on this. Played it once and forgot about it. Story was pretty meh and would have benefited from not being open world. Not every game needs to be open world.

The game is improving and all of the classic Halo is there. If you are looking for Halo fix and you are a casual it is there and hop in and play. If you play too much like me be aware it is still rough around the edges. I will update this when I feel it is in a better state.

Limited game modes, progression system to unlock armour is a grind, and they push heavily in the micro transactions department for their cosmetics that are what... time limited. I can't unlock the armour within the game that is provided to all players by default the same way I do in the Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Why? XP system is limited and is locked behind a battlepass system. If you want to unlock all of the Halo Reach armour you can purchase the battlepass now for that and unlock later. If you don't pay for it now then you won't be able to get said armour to be unlocked. You snooze you lose type of motive is what the game gives off. Why pay for a jacket at Kohl's only to be told to wear it you must work at that store for the next three days to acquire said jacket? Um... I paid for it. I should be able to acquire said item. The XP system isn't based upon skill, objectives, kills, etc. It is based upon match completion and daily challenges. The game runs great, plays great, and feels great; however the overall game modes, progression system, and micro transactions is a lacklustre experience.

Even if you bought the campaign which is 59.99 USD you get absolutely nothing but stupid armour cosmetics. You don't get double XP, access to unlock all armour without a battlepass, etc. The worst thing is the campaign doesn't really interest me. Halo: Reach's campaign seems more interesting to me due to how it is composed compared to the overall boring play style of Halo Infinite. Now, that is a matter of opinion since I find Halo Infinite boring in terms of singleplayer gameplay, but it doesn't really keep you engaged. It feels too empty. Halo is not meant to be an open-world game. Want an open-world game that is vast, fun, and thriving?

BUT, in it's current state I personally Think it's improved significantly, and I think some of the hate towards this game isn't as justified as some will say.

343 had a decade worth of material to work with for all of their games and every time they had a chance to make something great, they completely botched it.  With unlimited resources and money from Microsoft, how is even possible for this to happen time and time again.  343 first took the Halo reigns at the beginning of 2011 with Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary.  How in the world have you had the Halo IP for 12 years and still haven't figured it out?  Halo Infinite was supposed to be the one.  The game that put 343 back on the map and give Halo the credit it deserves after so many years of either ""okay"" or down right awful Halo titles.  Infinite launched with 10 multiplayer maps.  Halo: Reach, the last Bungi game, released with 14 multiplayer maps, 8 Firefight maps, and full Forge mode available at LAUNCH. 

Even though I'm completely disappointed with Infinite multiplayer, I can at least praise the Campaign.  I also appreciate what they are doing with the Master Chief Collection.  Adding unreleased, scrapped content from the previous Halo games mostly for Combat Evolved and Halo 2.  I can also thank 343i for not littering MCC with micro transactions. That's a plus! 

Closing this out, I'm just bewildered how Infinite multiplayer is a disaster.  I hope that if there is another Halo game after this one, they can finally get it right.  However I can only hope that Microsoft gives it to another Developer studio.

Performance wise, game's been an absolute hot mess since release. Playing with 6 year old hardware was possible, but crashes were common and restarts were required due to gradual performance degradation that persists to this day. Memory usage increases indefinitely while playing, causing the aforementioned issues.

Upgrading to an Intel Arc A750 and Ryzen 5 5600X has only made things worse. Crashes are less common, but (inevitably) running out of VRAM causes Halo Infinite to visually transform into an asset-flip cash grab.

All texture detail vanishes, chunks of level geometry disappear and what remains becomes smooth and undetailed, trees and foliage turn into flat sprites and everything else turns into mangled low-poly blobs. The viewfinder on the sniper rifle and ammo counters on weapons even disappear, hud elements and world interactables stop rendering, and unless you can deal with the game looking like an early access build, time for a restart.

Campaign, Multiplayer and UX in general have plenty of issues and glitches that are fairly well reported on at this point. Notably rubber banding, hit detection, matchmaking, being unable to swap or use equipment and getting soft-locked in certain menus, usually requiring a restart. A good deal of the menus have some kind server interaction tied to them, and require a response from the server to even load/open. Even when this isn't the case, the UI is still clunky and slow, going for an outdated ""smooth transition"" effect that makes navigation tedious. 

Not sure if any of that's been fixed in Season 4 as I can no longer launch the game; the screen stops rendering after reaching the main menu. Attempting to start a game via narrator to navigate the menus blindly with a blurry, frozen snapshot of the main menu either causes Halo Infinite to hang indefinitely or, when a game is started, get stuck at 46%.

If you can still launch the game, enjoy those first 30 minutes of actual gameplay before performance starts to chug because Halo Infinite looks and feels great otherwise. I'd wager a third of my hours on this game are just from fiddling with graphics, tuning every setting just trying to get Halo Infinite into a playable state, swimming through menus like they were molasses and waiting 5-10 minutes on every launch just to get through said menus and actually start a game. 

Couldn't tell you how many more hours have been spent out of game trying every ""fix"" in the book and troubleshooting from every angle.

I would recommend it, but it's difficult to recommend something that is so frustrating to interact with on every level.",1689435784,1689435784,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

 - Skilled based matchmaking will purposefully place you in unwinnable games, even in social playlists.
 - Desync is still somehow a problem (bullets, rockets, and melee not registering), this even happens during esports events which is hilarious.
 - Lack of gamemodes (No griffball, assault, VIP, etc.)
 - No way to earn xp or armor pieces through campaign, when the Master Chief Collection and prior Halo games have had this for years.
 - Theater is still pretty broken
 - Custom games browser is buggy
 - No ability to choose the armor colors that you want, you need to use 343's premade colors
 - No extensive cross core customization (Took them a year to add ONLY cross-core visors... yay?)
 - $10 for the color blue on your spartan
 - The game has been out for over a year and there is still no way for your spartan to have the basic color of white on their armor with a black undersuit, again, something previous games have had AT LAUNCH
 - No pregame or postgame lobby system
 - Even though community made forge maps are incredible and look nearly as good as dev maps, 343 is struggling to show them off to the majority of the playerbase outside the customs browser. 
 - Some of these incredible forge maps should be a part of the main map rotation for appropriate playlists (maybe not ranked as proper testing is needed) and not limited to community creations playlist
 - There is STILL no ""third mode"" (a gamemode that tries something new and fresh that Halo hasn't done before) that prior games have had AT LAUNCH, such as firefight, invasion, warzone, dominion, etc.

The music, artstyle, map design (for the most part), sandbox, and general feel of gameplay are good, and it even seems that 343 are making good improvements to the game such as the new way that xp works. However, the game is still missing way to many features and the playerbase has fallen signifcantly since the launch in November 2021. 

I think that this is a REALLY GOOD free-to-play shooter, however it falls short of being a really good Halo multiplayer and Halo game in general, even though it came quite close,

I really enjoy this game, but it's not something that I'm willing to recommend to others yet.

Campaign is alright I suppose, some cheesy Disney type dialogue sometimes but overall it was fun. I appreciate the open world, however Halo is best in its classic level design. But at least its better than the past 2 campaigns.

In terms of multiplayer, it can be extremely fun at times. But it has some serious issues that drive any halo player up the wall.

- Biggest lag spikes I've seen since Xbox 360 servers (And I have good internet with Ethernet cable)
- Classic halo features taken away (Plasma pistol not disabling vehicles and the scorpion/wraith not dying to one grenade after boarding. Instakill weapons not instakilling anymore, like rocket launchers and gravity hammers, and yes I was in range)
- People instakilling me with weapons that aren't instakill and also been able to shoot me through cover
- Armour cores remove full creative freedom of armour customisation
- UNLOCKING COLOURS!?
- Cosmetics that ruin halos identity, such as cringe cat ears and that one armour core that looks like its from the game Crisis
- UI Isn't perfect either
- And of course 343s biggest offence is taking a million years to add content, with forge taking a year and a half and infection 19 months later. Plus a new ranking system which is redundant for us day 1 players.
- (There were other smaller issues that I cant quite currently remember)

Halo 5 had better post game content and things like forge and infection got added within a matter of months. 343 Needs to sort this game out and more importantly sort themselves out as a company, they've done nothing but tear down this once behemoth of a franchise.

They say they're a threat, but that's it. I have no reason to invest myself into the story.

The battle pass idea was always dumb. I have no idea why they put it in Halo. Reach had the best armor/level progression and they chose the battle pass because 343 is greedy.

you can feel free to, but i didn't like the design direction they took it; in my expert opinion they took the ubisoft keyword staple gun to the franchise to validate jumping on those overwatch wallets that liked halo themed stuff. so that's why everyone is complaining they turned it into an open world squad game, and it didn't even release fully featured even with the delays they took to ""polish"" and ""live up to..."" blah blah blah ( i dunno who honestly thought they were laser focused on the SP side of it); but it doesn't launch now, and while i'm not one to get publicly upset company gets derp face with and IP then gets troll face cause they don't understand what legacy grants to expectations of an entity or its products, where i chisel the line in stone is: if it doesn't run then it's not product rendered for tender provided which is, despite the legal soup where they attempt to inform you that you in fact own nothing and can legally expect nothing for a transaction, theft.

so, TL;DR: it's a wallet trap with the facade of halo designed by comity, and a poorly managed one at that as evidence by the fact it doesn't launch for 'some players' and there hasn't been an update for, it's not worth the effort to count, and the devs are silent. if it doesn't work for you, uninstall it and watch spiff use the stupid cannon glitch, it was, is, and will always be the only joyful aspect of the game... but it's not worth the sale price.",1689141705,1689141705,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This game is missing DLSS/FSR support and a lobby FPS limit, which puts unnecessary stress on lower end PC's (not a huge issue for me, but I'd love to get 30 more frames).  If you're like me and enjoy SWAT, they put a different gun (Bandit) in some of the matches which is frustrating.

343 continues to disappoint. 

The Campaign: 

343 once again decided to say ""ignore the last game, it wasn't important"" and decided to scrub all the major plot points from Halo 5 off-screen. I am sure the average gamer is going to purchase Halo: How Cortana Lost book for $25 at their local Barnes & Noble to fill themselves in. Unless you want us to forget? 

The campaign starts off strong with Master Chief doing his thing, Cortana 2.0 being a nice addition, and the pilot rehashing the same story beats as previous characters in other games. However, the BBEG turns out to just be a bunch of red holograms for 95% of the entire game and never feels threatening. He isn't even someone we should care about because the BBEG from the first cut scene ""dies"" off screen?? Why?? Why not just have the guy who beat MC's ass be the BBEG??? This made no sense to me and still doesn't a year out. 

The grapple hook is a great addition to halo, but somehow 343 made a open world Halo game with less biodiversity than Halo: CE. Every other equipment feels somewhat pointless to use. 

I have beaten the game on LASO and Co-op (they also decided to scrap couch co-op despite promising never to do so again), and I gain nothing but some sorry ass skins for multiplayer. 

They have retroactively added this into the game, but how did they forget to add a ""replay"" mission button? At launch, I would have been forced to replay the entire campaign if I missed a few skulls. 

They leave the game off with a cliffhanger and at first, I was giving them a pass. But with the news of the layoffs at Microsoft and 343 cutting most of their campaign team for this game, any DLC seems unlikely. I guess the next 10 years of Halo's story will have to be in another new game instead of continuing this one. I cant wait to see them ignore everything from this game and restart for the 3rd time. 

Multiplayer:

The overall game play feels great, which is why the servers being so bad feels so much worse. The amount of times I have melee'd someone only to somehow die first is astounding. The amount of very obvious desyncs is laughable. Why is there no pregame or post game lobbies? The party system is also very out of touch and clunky. It feels like they spent the most time on multiplayer and it shows, but there are still a ton of minor issues which really make the average player frustrated. 

Hopefully with even more time, 343 can figure out basic multiplayer systems. I am sure the 4th game they make will build on Infinite's mistakes, instead of revisiting all the problems again copium.

Monetization: 

EVERYTHING in the shop is overpriced. Why am I paying money for colors? It is clear that they learned nothing from Halo 5's loot box system and instead decided to limit everything to battle passes and 20 dollar variations of the color purple. There is almost no way to earn the skins in the game without paying real money, and IMO that is a problem. I had more customization options in Halo 2

The only half decent battle pass was the reach one and that was still underwhelming. Seasons 2 and 3 are a complete joke. The monatization scheme of this game is a slap in the face to halo fans. And every map they put out is a swing and a miss. This game is not worth your time or your money.

Edit #2: This game is everything i love about FPS gameplay and everything i hate about AAA gaming. The gameplay is fantastic if you are looking for a physics sandbox shooter. An absolute blast.

But at the same time they took away what made halo the staple that it was. This game has no solid progression. Period. If you want progression, pay ten bucks for it. There is no merit based rewards at all. Not a single one. In a ""competitive"" shooter. There is no incentive to win at all.

They have ripped the heart out of customization. Want a cool color? Fork over 20 bucks. Want that nice helmet that you really like? That'll be 10 bucks. And yes ""technically"" they are 17 dollars. But you can only buy currency at flat rates like 5,10,20 dollars. And there are armor cores. hahaha dude the armor cores. The company litteraly take the time to make sure you can't fully customize a spartan. It is ridiculous.

This game disrepects its customers and all halo fans. And makes effort to do so.

But hey, at least we get the rest of the reach armor more than a year later, am i right...

Edit: so they have added a few skins. all be it through the awful thing they call a ""store"" We have no such thing as merit based progression. But you sure can spend 20 bucks for a garbage helmet and shoulder pads. Still no way to get the colors you want either. The cool camo one is a weekly that you have to get in a bundle for 15 dollars which is silly. The Tenrai event was a living ♥♥♥♥ show. 30 levels on the pass, with less than 10 being gear for your character. It was all xp and challenge swaps. & the only reason they would have challenge swaps is if they knew some of the challenges were unreasonable and just genuine garbage (which they all are) And on that note the same goes for the acctual battle pass. Gives us a ton of swaps that shouldnt be there. As well as ""armor kits"" and not all the pieces as well. Looking forward to them charging 20 bucks for Emile pieces, like his shoulder with the knife. (which is in the game but not being given to us, look up bot videos. The devs have full access to all the armor and its on full display.)
Still no winning xp so there is no insentive to win, which happens in many many games. Can't pick a mode either.
The gameplay is so fun. I just wish microsoft would get off the ass of 343 and let them flesh out this amazing shooter. Because ♥♥♥♥ me if this isnt fun as hell. I just don't know how long i will stay with the blatant disrespect to the customers.

And unfortunately the story is a complete waste of time. We don't want a story about Chief. We want a story about halo.

Pretty fun, however all progression is tied to the battle pass. And the battle pass sucks major ass to level up. Its just bounties which is a huge bummer. There also does not seem to be any progression based on any sort of level or skill. So pay up for the pass and thats how you look neat. Also its an fps with no gun skins, so why even get skins in the first place?",1688378919,1688379021,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Well, fuck me sideways. A May 2023 update fixed most if not all the performance issues I experienced with the game.

I am almost done with the campaign, almost 18 months after I initially purchased it.

The game is glorious. The action is fast paced and brutal. You are constantly on the move, killing enemies, driving vehicles and clearing outposts.

Some areas are a bit samey, but overall the game is very fun and varied.

The multiplayer had issues with hit detection, and it is fixed for the most part.

It's a damn shame the game lost 98% of it's user base, and the issues fixed a year and a half later should really have been resolved during the first few weeks.

Oh well. Worth picking up during a sale, for sure.


**December 2021 review for the campaign, played on release week.

The game is plagued with performance issues that make the framerate hover anywhere between 40 and 60 fps, at any video settings.

I have attempted to obtain a refund from Steam, but unfortunately, it would appear i have gone over the maximum play time.

This a 100% on me. I haven't been this angry about a release since Battlefield 5. In both instances, i was too much of an idiot to wait.

This is pretty much the standard these days. You wait 2 years. You get the game at the cheapest possible price. You are rewarded with a bug-free game, and all the content released to date.

Why does it have to be like this?


*Initial review for the free-to-play multiplayer portion of the game.

Halo Infinite is off to a solid start. It's got all the trappings from classic Halo games, while introducing new movement mechanics, new guns and new equipment.

I'm a big fan of the fluidity of movement, as well as adjustments made to classic weapons, as well as the new ones that are being introduced.

The game still needs work, balance adjustments needs to be made, but considering this is likely to be the mainstay title for the foreseable future, i am convinced it will all be addresses in due time.

343 is under a lot of heat right now regarding the progression system and the way you earn cosmetics. The concept of cosmetics as microtransactions is a relatively recent concept for the franchise.

I am sure the developers will eventually find a footing that's comfortable for all parties involved. Personally, i don't care much for the drama, as Halo has never really been a game about cosmetics.

If you are a fan of the series, or just looking for a good competitive multiplayer titles, i strongly recommend you give Halo Infinite a try.",1638077445,1688353747,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game definitely still has flaws but with the release of a superb forge, and continuous momentum in the right direction, I can see this game regaining public trust and interest like the MCC did.


The most solid 7/10 I've ever played. The good stuff, like the actual gameplay, art direction and sound design is 10/10. I have no doubt that this will be an incredible game come May / end of summer. 

However, the rest really brings it down at the moment. The customization is limited and requires mtx to get a lot of the good stuff. The battlepass is sorely lacking stuff. Big team battle is pretty scuffed and doesn't even work sometimes. The limited modes doesn't help this.

I'm going through it again for the third time with a group of 4 and we have the same recurring issues that stop us from completing a mission/FOB/HVT/squad. We have the area cleared but the objective will not register its clear so we have to leave and try it again. As well, the distance a fireteam member can be from one another is criminally small.

Multiplayer (7/10)
The core is excellent but playing some of the maps seems soulless. IMO there are more poorly designed maps that look great but play horrible. 343 is adding more content as the seasons progress but it shows the shop had more thought put in then the progression. They could have taken from H3, Reach, or even H4 but it looks to be more of a stumble then a success.

I am not much into Multiplayer so I will just review the campaign mode (Which is why I purchased it in the first place)

I admire the semi open world game play. it gives you more freedom to explore. 

Also I like the FOB locations or squad locations which allow for fast travel which is added benefit.

My first criticism is the game's performance, the input latency is high, with movement feeling sluggish - loading screens last 1-3 minutes upon bootup and/or switching to campaign (game installed on a SATA SSD) with the UI being unintuitive and slow. 

The campaign (the part of a halo game I usually adore) is 7/10 at a push, the characters are good and the story is ok but the map is incredibly lacklustre and repetitive, with the same biome being present throughout and the same three aesthetics being seen across the entire campaign, that being forerunner, banished and the green surface of the ring. In previous installations in the series, even the more infamous titles like Halo 5, had a variety of mission types with varying aesthetics, keeping all the missions feeling unique and distinct - Infinite does not do this and instead opts into a design that makes the entire campaign feel like one drawn out mission, with the open-world being a core factor in this issue. 

An open-world approach could of worked, however its design is incredibly unimaginative. As stated prior, the aesthetics are the same throughout, with no variety in biomes, with the same going for the enemy types, with the only 'new' type being the skimmers which just feel like a re-hashing of the 'buggers' from previous games. Furthermore, the side-objectives are more or less identical each other, usually following the lines of  'look their are marines in need of help in this random part of the ring, go help them' or 'look there is a banished base, lets kill them all and free any prisoners' - and to further solidify its repetitive and mundane nature, the effect of your work in clearing out the banished makes no difference to the world, with it feeling more empty as a result.

Another criticism I have with the game is the campaign's £50 pound price tag, which is insane as all you get is a campaign (a mediocre one at best, with the story instead serving as a band-aid fix with it setting the story on a better path from the disastrous Halo 5 story, which even that is flawed with it instead completely neglecting any characters like Lasky and any actual UNSC presence on the ring, aside from marines) whereas the same price tag would be given to the previous games where you'd be buying the campaign and the multiplayer. Making the multiplayer free not only made the campaign needlessly expensive, but also opened up the potential of absurd monetisation. You know that Halo franchise, the one that allowed you to make your own spartan that you could customise using armour pieces you earnt from simply playing the game, forget that! Now the only real way you can customise your spartan in a meaningful way is by buying the battle pass or buying it from the store. Oh, you think the campaign would give you some exclusive earnable cosmetics, you are in luck! You can earn some mundane coatings or some emblems! Armour pieces? No, you can't get ANY with the £50 campaign you bought. This only discourages long-term commitment to the game in the form of grinding for armour pieces,  even buying the battle pass doesn't present a fun way of earning rewards, with levelling up the bus forcing you to do annoying challenges that aren't even fun, nor can any be done in campaign.

I may continue this review as there are still several important factors to address but I'll leave it at that for now.",1687774141,1687774141,False,2,0,0.529411792755126953,0,True,False,False

Edit: As of April 2023, the gameplay seems to still be totally cracked/busted in regards to how jank the servers are and now even with fresh installs and repairing game files the stability is now awful and the game regularly crashes while connecting to or in between matches. 

Edit: As of December 2022 update a full year after launch the servers/netcode are still a travesty rendering the game borderline unplayable. GG 343.

While the core gameplay and campaign are ""good"" the netcode/servers in this game are insanely bad and with sub 40ms ping and 200-300mbps internet speed I can not go a single match without being killed around walls, having shots not register, etc. It's like Battlefield 4 when it came out. Content is also quite lacking and many of the classic armor sets from previous games are either not in game or locked behind paywalls, still no Forge or campaign co-op.

First off. don't you dare get mad at me for liking this game! Halo Infinite is REALLY GOOD and if your a new player or a returning one that's not being a brat, this game is stupid fun. yes there's a lack of classic guns, but the new guns i feel act a good (hopefully) temporary replacements. the movement is a good mix of Halo 3 and reach with a pinch of 5's more advanced movement. but it feels natural rather than 5's more artificial movement. campaign is good, i do wish the bosses weren't the same thing 5 times over however, but the map is fun to explore. 

Cons:
now my one complaint is lack of content. the store feels very unnatural, even to a MCC player like myself. in every game but 5 and maybe 4 you could unlock everything via grind. here there are certian things ONLY in shop... *cough cough* hazop *cough cough*.

edit: they have added three(?) maps and one weapon since release while the ui still does not let you choose which gamemode(s) you want to play. i initially recommended this game because the core gameplay loop is incredibly fun, however the live service is all but dead. it's a shame, honestly, because of just how fun the game is to play due to how smartly its gameplay mechanics were implemented. the weapon and powerup selections were all very smartly designed and balanced nearly perfectly (at launch, anyways; i am unsure of how it is now); throwable explosive barrels was an awesome idea that proved itself to be tons of fun; each grenade and tactical was very useful, there wasn't one that was made obsolete by another; and player movement generally just felt great, especially with the addition of the grappling hook pickup. truthfully, it was the only first-person multiplayer shooter i could have fun playing alone. unfortunately, this game has been ruined by incredibly poor management of the studio on the publisher's part and died before it could even live.

this is all regardless of the awful monetization via the in-game shop and battle pass system, which you can listen to someone else explain more in-depth. i don't really want to bother doing that in-depth here, but rest assured that it is as awful as everyone makes it out to be, especially relative to older halo games. in those titles, every unlock was free, either available by default or earned through playing the game and fulfilling a set requirement(s). in halo infinite, there are a select few free unlockables while nearly everything else is a paid cosmetic.

in fact, while on the subject of the older halo games, if you're thinking of playing this game i'd highly recommend picking up the master chief collection instead. personally i enjoyed halo: ce's multiplayer the best because, as a half-life fan, its simplicity charmed me, but i hear halo 3's multiplayer is supposed to be the best, so if you're looking for a great multiplayer shooter, there's your answer. if you're looking for fantastic singleplayer campaigns, since i've already mentioned half-life i will throw it out there, but the master chief collection has you more than covered with all of the bungie halo games. halo: ce through halo: reach are must-plays for any fan of first-person shooters and are nothing less than exemplary within the genre (and so is half-life). as for halo infinite, it's still probably pretty fun today, just don't expect any content updates; your time is better spent with the master chief collection anyways.",1637776619,1687632950,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The second issue is the plot/main enemies are cringey and stereotypical evil villains. All the stuff about Cortana was not interesting to me at all. I ended up skipping most of the cutscenes. I definitely think that the plot was one of the worst of the Halo games (maybe better than Halo 4 and 5 but worse than the others). 

Besides that, the game was a blast to play. I really enjoyed the open world gameplay. There's a ton of replayability here because not only can you replay missions, you can also re-populate bases with enemies after you've cleared them the first time and take them down again. And, you can just drive around the map killing stuff if you want.

There is no more red vs blue. You have team names now. Okay, I can deal with that. What I can't deal with is that everyone plays with the color armor you choose. This makes it damn near impossible to tell whether someone is on my team or an enemy. Sure enemies are highlighted red, but for me it's still hard to tell.
Next there's the microtransactions if you want different armor. I think you have to pay with real money if you want to unlock armor cosmetics, and when you level up you unlock them, but only if you paid for the battle pass. Yeah no thanks, I'll pass. Which also brings me to ask the question, what the hell is wrong with the graphics? Why is everything plastic-y looking? Where's the grit and dirt? All the levels and armor look like plastic legos.

Even with an average of 40-50 ms connection, not changing the ISP, or the computer, or anything aside from the update... connection is even worse.

Original review:
Halo good.

*Edited after a week or two of playing.
After playing for a few hours, there are quite a few problems.
1. Constant desync, lag, and connection issues.
2. CONSTANT attempts to get into your wallet for even the smallest thing it seems.
3. Not necessarily the game, but the forums are all about censorship, and very 'liberal'. You cannot mention a name unless it's praising that person, no mentioning the censorship/bans/monitor's names/etc., especially Comedic_Hermit, nearly everyone hates that monitor, and any mention immediately results in the systematic ""community reports"".
4. Multiple issues with communication from the Devs, monitors, etc. They think that no response is better than any other response, unless it's been through their PR department to see if it's non-committal, and not enough information to actually mean anything.
5. Multiple issues with MANY of the paid content, i.e. crooked visors, gun attachments looking like a cheeto, and everything being VERY expensive. ($8 for a helmet, $2 for 2 swaps/2 double exp, etc.)
6. Challenges being the sole reason people play to gain a simple color for (atm) 1 of 3 armor sets, each one being part of the ""I need to buy all the 'cool' parts and pieces""
7. Basic colors, and very few colors are able to be earned. All other colors are literally $8-$10 AT LEAST
8. Very few playlists, even the basic ranked slayer is missing. Ranked has 3 modes, single or double fireteams (4 total players per team), keyboard 1-4 player fireteam, controller 1-4 player fireteam. Fiesta, Arena (Slayer, and the objectives), slayer, and tactical slayer (aka SWAT).
9. Multiple issues with challenges being a specific objective based challenge, and then you not being able to actually GET that game type.
10. The 'Free' special game type challenges usually have issues that are the same as the other regular challenges. They are a specific gametype, and then it takes forever to get that gametype. They usually have some sort of RNG type of requirement like getting a killjoy (killing someone who has a killing spree) in a SWAT (no shields, 1 shot to the head = dead) gametype, or even trying to get a backsmack (hit from behind/assassination) in SWAT.
11. Being a free to play game, anyone and everyone can make an account, an extra account, or another account. So when a cheater gets banned, they come back. It is plagued with cheaters.
12. No ability to report in the game, even muting someone takes quite a few clicks to get through all of the BS to be able to do so.
13. NO COMMUNICATION. NONE. You cannot talk to the other team, there is no lobby, and even your own teammates have to click 'talk to team' before they can talk. I have played since it came out, and I would say at most 5% of people have mics, and it open to talk to everyone.

THIS IS NOT HALO. IT IS A CHEAP AND MINIMALISTIC SHELL OF A GAME WITH HALO THEMES, AND HALO'S NAME.

I LOVE Halo. I have played for over 20 years, since the first Combat Evolved was released. I have played on Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox 1, and now Steam. I have played literally every single iteration Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3 ODST, Halo Reach, Halo 4, Halo 5, and now Halo Infinite. This is not Halo. It is a cash grab. It is a constant attempt to take every bit of the money that you have, with the minimal attempt at putting together a playable game. I can no longer suggest my friends play this game. I cannot do it. I purchased the Campaign, as well as $100 worth of items & the battle pass. So, I've paid my dues, but I cannot even play any more without some sort of desync, lag, or cheaters.",1637340141,1687490966,False,2,0,0.512210309505462646,0,True,False,False

in the campaign when exploring the map I always stay at 80-90fps dropping to 60 in combat and when I look at buildings. I get the exact same fps when I play on low or ultra settings. My game constantly microstutters, and has a small but noticeable input lag.
Gsync and everything is enabled, I tinkered with the settings, I tried so many things from the internet, I played without the high-res texture pack, installed the new drivers. Nothing works

also, no fullscreen in the game? what the hell is that bullshit?

edit: so the game had updates sure. recently they added infection, after almost 2 years. impressive, well no, it's not. funny thing is, moderators are removing a lot of negative comments in discussions of updates or blogs wether they are constructive or not. Wonder why...

As a pretty diehard fan of halo who basically preached about it to anyone I could, i am beyond dissapointed in what happened to the franchise.

I haven't touched the game much for the last few months, only hopping on with a friend for a few hours every couple weeks and getting reminded of how horrible the online experience is. 

As someone who almost exclusively plays multiplayer games, the winter update was a huge letdown. Underwhelming would be putting it mildly. I'm sure if I was into forge I would be spending the next few months hard at work creating interesting and fun maps to compensate for 343i's bland level design, but unfortunately I am not. 

Let's start with the battle pass. sure it's great that they're giving us a free 30-tier pass, but almost all of the items should have been included in the season 1 pass. The CQB helmet in particular bothers me because it was prominently featured in the game's marketing, yet here we are an entire YEAR after launch and we are only just now able to unlock it?! Or how about the JFO helmet, or security shoulders? And don't even get me started with the MkV helmet. Every single armor piece in the winter update battle pass has been in the game files since launch, and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that 343i was planning on drip feeding them to us through the store over the next 10 years.

Second, forge. Forge is good, and it will probably be the only thing that keeps this game alive. I'm excited to see the community absolutely demolish 343i's creativity and map design, but I won't be spending much time with it.

Third, playlist updates. They removed Bot Bootcamp and doubles. That is all.

And finally, sandbox balancing and networking fixes. Kill me now. The only 2 options for region selection are expanded and local. What does local mean? How local? Why can't I choose which data centers to allow connection to like in MCC and other games? I will give credit where credit is due, my connection does feel significantly smoother and remains more stable, but that only serves to highlight more of the underlying issues such as heavy/anti-aim and poor hit registration. There's still so much more that needs work, and at this point I'm not sure the game is worth saving.

I want to love this game, but 343i seems to be intent on making it as unenjoyable as possible, especially for PC players. I'll still play from time to time, maybe find the rest of the campaign collectibles, or play custom games with friends. For now though, I'm done. I just can't have fun playing this game anymore.

Server issue: 
This game has a phenomenal server connection that give you only the best experience of someone who is made of rubber, rubberbanding is not only expected, you actually need to strategize your combat around that. Also, in order to make the game more ""competitive"", they make all the projectiles much faster, and melee speed different for different weapons, in order to reward high-skilled play ---if the ping is not this bad. 

Annoying effect: 
the explosion of grenade is weak, the vehicle destruction effect (despite updated) is underwhelming, but every time you die, your entire screen gets flash banged by the shield break effect (that is entirely white), along with what I can only describe as the halo equivalent of a vine boom. When I get sniped through the map, the last thing I want is incapacitating myself with my own death effect. 

Skill-based match making: 
The great SBMM developed by 343i will guarantee you to lose a few match, then get a win handed to you on a silver platter, then a win that is slightly hard, and then an almost balanced match, and then back to getting shit on, repeat. Not if you have any challenge that has anything to do with winning matches though, that case you will lose all your match for the rest of the night, because what screams ""player retention"" than halting progress.

In game store: 
The store is scummy, even after they make it less so. Look! A good looking helmet that will be gone in one week! Sorry one week is usually how long it take for me to think about a meaningless purchase, guess I will never have the chance to buy it.

UI: The main menu feels like it is constantly on the verge of falling apart. The battle pass butten flashes in and out of existence, the main screen cannot decide on to show the main menu background, multiplayer background, or a black screen. 
The customization UI is entirely fucked over by their visor and coating system, because instead of choosing a primary and secondary color, and choosing pattern and color for your visor, you now have a hell of unorganized coating/visor that is not sorted by color, material, pattern, ON A SINGLE ROW, which ironically means that the more stuff you buy, the more headache you give yourself. 
But you can sort with rarity, that's what you care about, right?

Update: the server is still awful

technical issues and lack of content continue to plague this game (albeit less now than ever). with that said, i'm not sure Halo has ever felt better.

most of my gripes with the game are the nature of the sad reality of modern gaming - season passes, monetized customization, major post-release patches.... this game is not free of those sins. personally, the biggest detractor has been the gun jam glitch, a glitch where certain weapons would randomly not fire when the trigger was pulled. currently, that glitch is gone, and with infection and a rumored PvE mode on the horizon, it seems we could finally have the game we deserved all along.",1687132340,1687132340,True,1,0,0.514563083648681641,0,True,False,False

Basically, I ended up going back to Halo Reach MCC because of all of the glitches and constant bugs this game endlessly provides. Don't get me wrong, forge has 'infinite' possibilities at your finger tips, but it is a waste of time trying to conquer due to functions not working like magnets, constant crashes and losing unsaved data, edited game mode glitches, browser lobby's failing, and much more. Halo Reach's forge is 1000 times more stable than this pathetic piece of garbage they call forge. I spent 3 hours building one of my first maps for the game to crash and lost all of the progress. That's when i learned I needed to quick save the game every 5 minutes because you never know when the game will crash. I've found that having any other program running while playing will make it crash. Pressing windows key and browsing for too long will make it crash as well. And just playing the game will make it eventually crash. I looked up some fixes on how to stop it from crashing and the only real fix that might stop it from crashing is to down grade your NVIDIA drivers to a older version. 

This game could have been something to cherish, but I think it's fair to say halo infinite killed the halo franchise. MCC is still fun though.

Store: Always up to date with fresh content for you to purchase with real money.

Campaign: Average, Thinking back campaign is pretty predictable, no twist or turns, the bad guys are bad. Open world format is interesting, sadly split screen co-op was scrapped (for the live service).

Multiplayer: Below Average, took nearly 2 years after release for infection. This shows a lack of understanding of what used to make the Halo community a driving force online gaming.

Multiplayer Maps: Average, if it wasn't for the community made maps, I would rate this pathetic.

Firefight: N/A, 343 has made nil mention of any PvE experience.

Updates: Below Average, Most updates are focused towards the shop, sadly any slightly negative (or even sarcastic) comments on steam updates are now being deleted by 343, even EA isnt this depressing.

I can't recommend this. It promised so much more, and under-delivered on all fronts. As someone who was following the development of this game intimately, I cannot adequately describe the tragedy of Halo Infinite. An outdated engine, development hell, broken UI, netcode/desync issues, story/campaign DLC completely nuked, creative heads and iconic Halo developers on a carousel, microtransactions, terrible design decisions, consumer exploitation, etc are all still present. They're unable pay off debts incurred by cutting corners, and I have to think Microsoft is responsible. This game oozes corporate tampering and inhibition, not in its message or delivery, but in structure/foundation.

The art and sound team did such a fantastic job that I hope sets a new standard in the industry as a whole, but Halo Infinite fails as a competitive shooter, a casual FPS, a compelling story-driven game, and a social connector; all of which made Halo what it was in the first place. The game lost its luster around hour 30, and nostalgia alone kept me around for another 170; that's because of the MLG days, not because of this game.

It had a rough launch, but everything in this halo is representative of what a halo game is. Everything is right. The Chief, the Weapon, and of course Cortana couldn't just go away without a proper goodbye... We are going to miss you.

The multiplayer, the soundtrack, the graphics and amazing performance compared to other games that look much worse with the same hardware. The gameplay mechanics staying true to what is halo. We don't need to copy the formula of other faster paced titles. This is right, and this is HALO. It might not be for everybody.

 I'm still speachless after this long every time I complete the campaign.

I suggest reading supplementary content about the lore before completing the game for a second time. The lore is quite deep, and even halo fans might have trouble understanding all of it, but once you read and thoroughly read the full story it becomes much easier to appreciate. I admit that the story cand be very confusing. I also understand how hard it must be to try to fit so much lore into a game.

Multiplayer seasons take long enough for you to complete the free pass and then switch to a different game so you don't get burned of playing halo. Never missing a season.

in its current state, the game is a 10/10

Now... the multiplayer.  I am a person who loves customization, and always jumps back into a game when new content is released.  Unfortunately, with the dripfed content and lacking seasons, I simply have to say that it is not worth the time and investment that a multiplayer game like this needs.  People may dunk on the horrendous monetization, but ironically I was able to kit out my spartan exactly as I wanted simply by playing through one event, designed as a desperate attempt to get players to come back to the game.  It did not work.  I have not touched the game for months, and have felt absolutely no desire to do so, yet still come back to halo reach and play firefight for hours frequently.  This game is good on paper, but lacks the spark and joy of old halo games, as well as the content to keep people playing.  Overall, if a game releases a feature added at WORST within a few months of release to all other games a year after launch, that should be taken as an extreme red flag, and a clear sign of incompetence and corporate greed.

I've been a Halo fan for most of my life, and I find that the gameplay in Infinite to be the most compelling. There's been some missteps in the release of content through it's current life cycle, but the overall experience and fun of Halo feels right at home here.

Pros:
-Incredible gameplay, fluid movement
-Satisfying weapons and equipment (the pistol and bulldog are where it's at)
-343 mastered the art style, a great homage to the original Bungie style
-It feels like 343 has been picking up the pace of releasing new content (maps, cosmetics, equipment) and it gets better with every release
-Free to play!

Cons:
-Some weapons in the sandbox feel very weak or unbalanced
-Although 343 has put out a lot of new content recently, the map selection repeats a bit too much
-Like most free-to-play games, the pricing of the cosmetics can be pretty high

Overall, an awesome multiplayer experience, and it's always the game I pick up when I have a free hour or so.  Excited for season 4!

I thought it seemed rushed, but I'm an absolute sucker for Halo so I gave it a shot. The campaign, which was what I was most excited for, left me bored and frankly uninspired. I played through the first few missions and then stopped. From here I went straight into the multiplayer, where I had a good time with my friends, but eventually, probably due to the severe lack of content I became bored with that as well. This led me to stop playing the game entirely, and even uninstall it because it sat untouched for months. 

Enter June 2023, for some reason over the last few months I had been on a real Halo kick after re-reading some of the books. This lead me to reinstall the game and finally play through the campaign. Here are my thoughts: This game does not feel like authentic Halo, sure they've made some improvements, but the few of those are completely and wholly overshadowed by things they've made worse. Such as, and most prominently for me, the lack of assassinations. The only reason I can think of that they're still lacking from this game after all this time is that 343i couldn't make them work, likely due to the grapple hook. Secondly, and most irritating to me personally are the weapons. Every single weapon, with the exception of the Sidekick, and BR75 are COMPLETE downgrades from their earlier counterparts, especially the Bulldog. I have a genuine hatred for every non-human weapon, always have, that is especially prominent here, where they're all either completely useless OR completely overpowered with no middle-ground. Thirdly, the story was just plain boring, a literal carbon copy of Halo: CE with some events and characters switched around. Next, the armor abilities are a plain stupid decision, and are basically necessary in some instances such as boss fights. Since I've already mentioned them, let's talk about the boss fights, they suck. Here's why, pretty much all of them can be summed up to, you're locked in a small area and your enemy has a melee weapon that can one-two hit kill you. This wouldn't be so bad, but they're also faster than you, so you better have that stupid grapple hook ready to swing around on to avoid death or you have to start all over. This game genuinely infuriated me every time I tried to play it, but I wanted to know what happened next so badly that I forced myself to finish it. Care to guess what I'm rewarded with? Don't bother, I'll tell you, NOTHING. This entire game is about NOTHING AT ALL. The only thing I felt when the credits rolled was relief, it was finally over, no more crap weapons, no more stupid grapple hook, and no more god awful boss fights. This campaign was a chore from start to finish, if you want to know where it leads, save yourself some disappointment and watch a play-through on YouTube. 

Really quickly, let me talk about the multiplayer. Most matches feel totally one sided as the overabundance of power weapons and pick ups (i.e Active Camo or Overshield) mean it isn't about skill, it's about who can acquire these items the fastest. This is especially prevalent in 4v4 slayer, and Big Team Battles. However with BTB the problem is vehicles, instead of only spawning them at a players base, powerful game changing vehicles are dropped seemingly at random, often leading to one team procuring them all and decimating the other team. The ONLY thing keeping me playing this multiplayer is the cosmetic armor options, which are easily the best part about the entire game. If on the off chance anyone from 343i reads this long-winded rant, please, give my best to the game designer who created this armor. It goes back to a military fiction style instead of the full on cyberpunk crap that plagued Halo 4 and 5. If yo glean anything from this, let it be to stay with this style of armor for the next game (which I am praying is a vast improvement over this one.)

I've droned on a while already and I'm not trying to write a whole essay here, however I love Halo, I'm extremely passionate about it and it breaks my heart to see what it has become. Please 343i, do better, the fans deserve your absolute best, not this.

Campaign, 6/10. Fun the first time around, love the grappleshot, but the open world doesn't really feel great because there isn't a ton to do; you can rescue trapped marines, find data logs or cores or armor pieces for multiplayer, kill HVT's and capture Fobs, but... couldn't that stuff have been in a campaign mission in a linear campaign instead? Why is this game open world, I feel like it would have been better if they had refined their focus more. And the level design for the missions all feel like re-skinned Assault on the Control Room, over and over, except for the first and penultimate missions. I wouldn't but this at full price, and only would get it on sale if I had nothing else I wanted to buy.

Multiplayer, 4/10. Yeah, so despite my many hours trying to love this game, I just... I don't. Many of these hours are me letting my younger brother play multiplayer on my account, but I have my share of my own, and I didn't like it. The guns are nice and impactful, map design isn't too bad, but don't even get me started on the cosmetic system. Or the overall map balancing. Or the in game balancing where it tries to keep you at a 50% win rate no matter what. I had a few fun moments, but I'd rather play Halo MCC instead. going free to play and incorporating a battlepass was a mistake.",1686313778,1686313778,False,2,0,0.48598131537437439,0,True,False,False

This game is also not Halo 4, or Halo 5.

This game is Halo: Infinite. It released in 2021. Context matters. Other AAA studios have been releasing garbage releases one after another. Games are hacked together with pushy microtransactions all over the place. Halo: Infinite is not a perfect game. It may not be the best Halo game. It is a good game.

Halo Infinite does have microtransactions, but it doesn't push them too hard. You can easily play the game without spending a cent, and not feel like you are missing out too much. The only thing they really push is the battle pass. Even then, there are no intrusive popups telling you to buy it. 

The sandbox here is amazing. Weapons are well balanced, with every weapon having a use case. Some weapons are generally worse (disruptor, ravager) and some weapons are generally better (skewer, sidekick) but no weapon is useless. BR does not win every battle. Neither does shotgun. Neither does energy sword, or gravity hammer. Only weapon that can theoretically win every battle is Sniper Rifle, and the tradeoff there is high player visibility (giant weapon, lens reflection) and high accuracy requirement. Disruptor is a common weapon that can EMP vehicles. Ravager has high damage + melee bonus at close range, and AOE is good for specific scenarios, like BTB Capture the Flag, where you can AOE 6+ enemies at once.

Vehicles are not perfect, but I love the balance of high damage and speed, to big target with low HP. Vehicles generally have enough HP to take out a few targets, before you need to jump out and find a new solution. That said, if you play your cards right, you can stay in a Wasp (flying vehicle) all day in BTB.

The frequently rotating playlists keep per-playlist population high. Social playlists are almost always under 1 minute wait time, and more commonly around 20 seconds. Even ranked playlists aren't too bad, with the worst one being Ranked FFA at around 5 minute average search time (For placement matches).

Customization system is straight up worse than Halo: Reach (my personal favorite), but not horrible. Armor cores are cool - although the lack of cross-core customization is not. Coatings suck, but certain coatings bring new style to the game - reflective colors and patterns are awesome. I especially love the visor customization. I don't care if candy can stripes are impractical, they look awesome.

TLDR; Halo: Infinite improves greatly above all other Halo games in some aspects, and falls way behind in others. It's worth playing.

Also multiplayer is free, so what do you have to lose?

The multiplayer being free is a reason to give it a time. For all you die hard halo fans that love that halo feeling, and I'm with you on that. This game will deliver short on that nostalgic feeling. It hurts me to say but halo infinite wasn't made for us, it was made for the new generation of halo fans. With all that being said I still feel like the game does a good job at being a solid FPS, It may not be for everyone but that's whats great about the game being free to play. I say give it a shot.

they had every opportunity to bring halo back and be better than it has ever been. 6 years and a budget in the hundreds of millions backed by a trillion dollar corporation. yet fallout new vegas has had more concurrent players than infinite nearly every day for the better part infinite's first year out.

343 industries took what should've been a grand-slam, guaranteed money machine of a franchise and seemingly selected every wrong path at each fork in the decision tree.
It's clear the most important aspect of this game is the microtransaction store. It's the only thing that's worked since launch day. Over the course of more than a year, they've slowly--agonizingly slowly--added features to the game that are CORE features, that should've been in there since day 1. But even still, the game doesn't feel or look finished.
Being a long-time fan, using a controller is almost impossible because they've removed almost all the aim assist. Whine about catering to controller players with aim assist all you want, but they've balanced this fine on MCC somehow. I'm still decent at that game, and feel like I've never played a shooter in my life when I open Infinite.

Fortunately, the remedy for that feeling is just to never open Infinite again, which I'm going to do.
If I want a Halo fix, MCC is always there, as well as my old consoles.

Despite the problems the last couple games had I remained hopeful that the additions those games had contributed would remain. Sadly many of these additions are not present even months after launch. Customization is extremely monitzed, progression is directly tied to purchase of the battlepass in order to get 90+% of the cosmetic items. The flashing skull flashing I get to see because of my enemies cosmetic decision completely takes me out of the moment. 

Things I like:
Snappy and responsive movement, Maps that aren't just blocked out forge maps, return to a more traditional combat(None of this constant thruster bs), new campaign experience, return of the brutes, select special purpose equipment, balanced weapon sandbox(except shotguns)

Things I dislike:
$60 for the campaign, slow release of new content, challenge system requiring gamemodes that were random to get (I played 6 matches trying to get oddball but couldnt get it), Removal of weapons/vehicles from previous games, lack of earnable progression, delays with no testing windows, vehicle controls(scorpion, banshee), The Mangler 1 shot + melee, making things more ""friendly"" ie changing SWAT to tactical slayer or making the campaign difficulty descriptions read like they were trying to lightly scare a child. 
 
Things that I hope are changed/added:
Missing weapons:
Fuel rod, Promethean weapons, Railgun, Spartan Laser, The REAL FUCKING SHOTGUN, Sticky det, Grenade Launcher, Beam Rifle

Vehicles:
Mantis, A good chopper, Prowlers, Promethean vehicles, Tank variations, Hell add some banished stuff from HW2.

I love the game but I feel like making it ""Live Service"" and free has given the developers to push the game out in an unfinished and barebones state then slowly dribble stuff out while charging for it. I really hope I'm wrong but somehow I doubt it.

EDIT JUNE 2023 : 
Been a year since I made that post here has what's changed..
They added a few maps and a dmr that doesn't have a scope, fixed the mangler being 1 shot and a melee, added even more annoying things that appear when you die/get a kill. At least they finally are adding infection in a few more months.

Everything else basically still holds true, scorpion controls are still worse than halo ce, skill based progression didn't make it past beta testing.
 The shroud screen is the only new piece of equipment and it hardly makes up for everything else missing. 
Some of the new games modes are fun but they don't stay around long enough and once they leave the rotation they don't seem to make a return for a long time, though this is likely done to keep player counts playable.

It was definitely Halo Infinite that did it, because it did it multiple times during loading between a match or loading the game in general. Then it did it trying to verify files. The last time was when I was trying to uninstall it. No other games I own has ever done this. This game is a virus that bricked my PC for a day while I tried to get it to post again. Sorry 343i, I'll defend you on Halo 4 and Halo 5 but this game will forever put you on my ""DO NOT BUY"" list along with Bungie (They sold me the demo called Destiny for $60 and then a month later released the full game for another $60 which I didn't buy. Never again Bungie.)

ORIGINAL: As someone who paid the $60 because I love Halo, all the Halo's, this game is definitely not worth $60 let alone $20 for just the campaign. Until 343 makes it worth while to us early adopters of the game, this part will never change.

The free to play aspect of the game, as of right now is hot garbage. If you take out everything and only look at what counts, the actual gameplay, it's not even worth it. You can find videos of this game online where desync is just insane. It doesn't matter how good your internet is or your hardware, the game will just screw you over for a game, sometimes your entire play session. When it works, it feels great, but 90% of the time this game hates me. 343, you guys either need to hire back the people who did the Halo 5 servers or pay someone else to get them up to par.

No matter what you guys add to the game, the only reason why I would come back to play is if you fix the server sync issues. I'm not a pro, but I can definitely tell when my shots are hitting and are supposed to hit, along with the visible aspects of bullet detection client side.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS GAME, This is because 343 industries has done everything possible to push this out, they clearly don't give a shit about it either, because this game hasn't received any attention, Master Chief Collection has been given more care and that's only because they're trying to scramble up money for their shit block games.

My BIGGEST reason for leaving a negative review on this is because:

- 343 has abandoned future campaign developments for the sake of making a new game in the latest Unreal Engine.

- 343 would rather patch up, add content, and even then ruin many of the exclusive rewards for veteran players who spent countless hours for VID-MASTER achievements, nullifying the ENTIRE point of doing the aforementioned achievements because they gave the rewards to EVERY SINGLE PLAYER (This has nothing to do with HALO: INFINITE. This is simply about 343 Industries as a game developing company)


I could go on but I would like to keep this short because I'm tired. Basically don't waste your money, just wait for Bungie's re-make of Marathon and see how it is when it comes out. 343 took over a well loved and cared for project and basically stuck their disgusting dirty mangy fingers all insides of it and skewed everything enjoyable.

I've played them all since I was about six years old, and this franchise has shaped my appreciation and approach to the medium. That being said, when 343 took over, it fundamentally changed. Not necessarily for the worst, but it did change in a way that I personally didn't appreciate. Halo infinite feels like the perfect bridge between classic Bungie Halo and 343 new Halo. 

Campaign - The story is okay. I like Master Chief's increased character, I think it works. But it isn't the space epics that we've had since Halo CE. The actually story is a lot more forgettable. However, the sandbox is pretty good! The open world concept works pretty well for Halo. My biggest gripe is that the outpost system (similar to the Far Cry series) doesn't work as well when you are an 8ft tall un-killable super soldier with a huge arsenal at your disposal. Stealth is never the fun option because  you know that if you get caught, you'll just be confronted with the same type of encounters that you have during the regular campaign missions. And if you can complete the main missions, then you have nothing to fear. The pacing of the story and therefore the game play unlocks is really slow. It's worth playing, yes. And the freedom you have (especially with the new weapons and equipment) is some of the best in the franchise. But don't expect the memorable aesthetics of CE, the epic stories of 2, the set pieces of 3, the atmosphere of  ODST, or the grounded story of reach. 

multiplayer - some of the most fun I've had on a multiplayer game, period. the ridiculous and unexpected pacing of fiesta, btb heavies, social games, etc. is magnificent. there are still some balancing issues but it does look like 343 is actively working on it. is it perfect? not at all. Halo 3 was a lot better balanced when it came out. but the direction that 343 is taking the multiplayer towards is really promising to me, and I am engaged in it. 
multiplayer is also free, so it doesn't hurt to try it out. but beware of micro transactions and a lack of customization.

- Basic armor colors like Red and Blue locked behind $10 paywalls
- Free battle-pass gives you ~ 10 armor pieces 
- Constant desync issues in multiplayer
    - Hits, melee especially, not registering
    - Phasing through enemy players
    - Unable to move after being hijacked
    - Teleporting around when doing too many 'advanced' movements such as climbing or sliding
- $60 to play a campaign that feels unfinished with mediocre story and no co-op and CANCELLED split-screen co-op
- Broken Custom Games
- Broken Theatre Mode
- UI taking 5 - 10 minutes to fully load (time varying based on how powerful your PC/Console is)
- Shriveled weapon/vehicle sandbox compared to previous Halo titles
- Barely any multiplayer maps, 1 year later and still has less maps than Halo: CE had on launch
- Terrible leveling system
- Broken ranked system
- Skill jumps being removed or nerfed

Overall I wouldn't recommend people getting this game if they're looking for a fun Halo experience. If you want a good experience, I recommend getting Halo MCC. Much better leveling/unlocking system. No paywalls for armor/weapon customization, mod tools, actual Forge mode, and tons more game modes.

UPDATED REVIEW: 05/27/23

This game is still very bare-bones for what is supposed to be an Xbox 'Flagship Series' and 343i's '10 year Halo game.
Let's get into the nitty gritty of what has happened of the course of the previous year;

- Player count dwindling, so much so that TODAY 05/27/23, took me 40 minutes of searching on expanded on all 10 current game modes to find 1 single match, in which all my teammates had then quit/lagged out
- De-sync being fixed in one patch and immediately broken in the next
- Textures on maps breaking as of 05/25/23
- Laggy co-op campaign servers that get so bad you need to restart the game to be put on a new, less laggy server
- Micro-transaction prices going back up to what they were upon release
- Ranking system still broken
- New [community made forge] maps added in limited playlists
- Multiplayer story finally 'kicking off' in a way, but not very engaging
- Personal AI such as Superintendent or Iratus being broken, game being defaulting back to Butler
- New, more manageable UI for [most] menus
- Customization menus not loading, needing a hard restart of the game
- Campaign DLC cancelled
- Theatre mode still broken
- Being moved by a friendly in a vehicle such as a ghost or wasp will cause significant amounts of de-sync

Even at this point, MCC has now lost a significant portion of its players to where I can't in good faith recommend it to people who want only to have a good Halo Multiplayer experience.
It's sad to see a franchise which I grew up with, infatuated with its universe die so painfully in front of me, and I know this to be the same with many other fans. To say that 343i's lack of willingness to produce a quality game over the many years in which they had been left charge of the Halo IP is disappointing if not tragic to say the least. I am not one who is onboard with the ""Fire 343"" trend, however I do think that significant changes in leadership and management must be made in order along with stricter overview from Microsoft themselves  to get Halo back on track, along with no longer allowing 343i to be the exclusive holders of the Halo IP as it has become painfully aware that they cannot be trusted to produce what can be called 'The' Halo experience alone.",1667437163,1685190963,False,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

John-117's story should have ended with the Master Chief being given the right to assume a higher ranked overseer position following a resolution to the Cortana incident after HALO 5, and finally being given a sense of peace. 

The Next direction of HALO should have been given to the players. Their own Custom Spartan, following a similar story from the Infinite Campaign, with their own custom AI, and a drop in drop out CO-OP option if Single-player was a little too quiet for you. The Multiplayer Narrative should have been fleshed out a bit more and gave a story driven purpose to gather up with other players either locally or online, to experience the following events after the Halo Infinite Campaign.

[b]Campaign[/b]

Halo Infinite fails to effectively utilize 343 Industries' improved storytelling ability, as crucial plot details are conveyed through flashbacks instead of allowing players to experience them in real-time, resulting in a fragmented narrative structure that hampers immersion and weakens the impact of key plot points and character developments. This approach robs players of the opportunity to forge a stronger connection with the events and characters, leading to a less engaging and immersive storytelling experience overall.

The constant changing of antagonists throughout the 343 Industries trilogy has undermined the narrative cohesiveness of the Halo universe. The switch from the Didact to Cortana and now to the Banished feels disjointed and lacks the necessary depth to establish a compelling villain. Escharum and the Banished come across as generic ""evil for the sake of being evil"" characters, devoid of believable motives or meaningful development. 

Furthermore, leaving significant story developments between Halo 5 and Infinite to be explained in a book undermines the cohesion and accessibility of the storytelling, leading to a diminished impact on players' investment in the Halo universe.

As far as characters, ""The Weapon"" was introduced as a replacement for Cortana, and tries to fill the void but unfortunately just falls short. While Cortana's character in Halo 1 and 2 was nuanced and restrained, The Weapon feels comparatively hyper-emotional and fails to capture the same complexity. This leaves players yearning for the strong, consistent characterization of Cortana's earliest iterations.

The introduction of The Pilot in Halo Infinite was a positive aspect of the game as it added a relatable and grounded perspective to the narrative. As a character thrown into the midst of the conflict, The Pilot serves as a connection point for players, providing a fresh viewpoint and allowing them to empathize with the challenges and discoveries faced throughout the campaign. This inclusion enhances the overall storytelling experience by offering a more human element to complement the larger-scale conflicts happening in the Halo universe. Still, this was the only character that I felt had any real depth in the story.

Master Chief's portrayal in Halo Infinite is 343 Industries' best iteration, but the exclusion of familiar characters besides Cortana misses opportunities for meaningful interactions. By leaving out characters like Lasky, Halsey, Locke, and the Arbiter, Halo Infinite's story lacks cohesion with previous iterations and misses the opportunity to develop already compelling characters, ultimately weakening the narrative and depriving players of engaging story arcs.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]

Halo's multiplayer has always been a standout feature, but Halo Infinite takes several missteps that hinder its potential. The inclusion of sprint, armor abilities, and clambering dilutes the core gameplay experience that fans have cherished since the early titles. These additions detract from the strategic elements and balanced encounters that made the original trilogy so engaging.

Furthermore, the game launched without essential features such as firefight, forge, custom games, a custom game browser, file sharing, and a meaningful ranking system. These omissions are particularly egregious considering their presence in previous entries. Players are left with a watered-down multiplayer experience that lacks the depth and variety that made Halo multiplayer iconic. Custom games in Halo 3 and Reach provided replayability for both casual and competitive gamers with modes like Fat Kid, Jenga, Duck Hunt, races, Grifball, Octagon, and MLG gametypes. The ranking system in Halo 2 and 3 fueled the games' longevity as players aimed to improve and advance to higher ranks, while Halo Infinite's ranking system lacks the same vision, diluting it to standard ranks seen in other games.

343 Industries' approach to customization in Halo Infinite is deeply disappointing. The game adopts a predatory consumer model that prioritizes microtransactions over player satisfaction. The limited options for customization and the heavy reliance on in-game purchases dampen the once-engaging process of personalizing one's Spartan. Previously, we earned customization options organically via achievements, in-game feats, or experience generated by playing the game. 343 Industries forsakes this in favor of disgusting cash-grab practices via the in-game store. It feels like a cynical attempt to exploit fans rather than a genuine effort to enhance the player experience.

[b]Overall[/b]

Halo Infinite represents a missed opportunity to revive the franchise. The campaign suffers from narrative inconsistencies and underwhelming villains, failing to deliver on key story elements that were built up in previous entries. The multiplayer experience falls short of the classic Halo formula, incorporating gameplay mechanics that dilute the strategic depth of the series. The absence of essential features at launch and the predatory consumer model further contribute to the disappointment.

Ultimately, Halo Infinite serves as a testament to the decline of the series since Bungie's departure. 343 Industries' shortcomings and the mishandling of its beloved elements have left Halo on life support. Sadly, with Halo Infinite, it seems that the series has lost its soul, relegating it to a legacy title rather than a thriving franchise.",1644087831,1684953471,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Because so far it seems 343 has looked at the Halo games developed my Bungie as what NOT to do. 343 turned Halo into a live service game with micro-transactions. you want your spartan to have an ODST Helmet, well first you have to pay 10 USD and then grind the game. or you could pay more money to jump to that. 
MCC, y'know, the Halo games that weren't live service and didn't have a battlepass and had developers who actually cared, has more players than Infinite. 

What I don't understand is how you mutilate a beloved franchise so much and so fast. Live service games have a reputation of failing and I haven't met many people that go ""Yeah, I LOVE live service games"". but despite that, 343 was like ""Yeah but it'll be different this time"" and then they went ahead of making it live service anyway.  remember the days where games were actually completed products and the developers would occasionally add new content? well that seems to be a distant memory, doesn't it?
Instead, you have developers such as 343 who release games unfinished then over time add what they call ""New Content"" to the game, when in reality, that content was supposed to be apart of the game at launch, like y'know, Forge. for another example, remember when Blizzard said Overwatch 2 would have a PVE mode? turns out, it was ""delayed"" and would be released after launch, but it never did, cause it turns out they cancelled the PVE mode a long time ago and never told their consumers. 

Infinite only really has good gameplay. everything else about it is horrible. 
343 is the doctor who enjoys making pretty women ugly.

I wouldn't mind if ID software took over, at least they are good at their jobs.
343 doesn't care about making a good game, they only care about making a profitable game 
Meanwhile, ID Software actually care about the games they make, Like DOOM. 

We have told 343 so many times what we want, and they still don't listen. We never once said we wanted a live service halo game with Micro-transactions, but they gave us one anyway, despite what we asked for. it's like ordering Mcdonalds, you order the food at the drive thru, wait, they hand you your bag, but in this instance, the food that's in the bag isn't what you ordered, because the guy taking the orders wasn't paying attention and instead gave you the food item HE THOUGHT you would like. that is an accurate summary of 343 and how they have handle Halo.

I want Halo to go back to it's roots, instead of trying to follow the same formula that every other game seems to be using.",1684862487,1684862487,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I cannot recommend it though, and honestly I can't really recommend any further Halo game due to how this one has been treated. I'm not sure that it was just me believing that Halo would rise to the greatness it once was but my expectations were met then crushed shortly after release.

The Campaign:
Rather than spoil it for the few who still wish to check it out, I think I'm just gonna describe how I felt about the campaign. Short Answer? I liked it. Long Answer? I felt the story was a bit off brand for chief but I think it's a solid entry, and nowhere nearly as bad as say... Halo 5, which was to me a big nothing burger. The problem with halo infinite is that it requires knowledge from Halo Wars 2 and Halo 5 in order to have context. If a Player had skipped these entries to the series, they could be lost on the significance of some characters and events and will have to go back anyways. I enjoy the cast though and their chemistry, even if a bit of the heart-to-heart moments feel a bit ham-fisted.

Game-play of the Campaign is great. While I'm not necessarily a fan of the fact the opted for a semi-open world approach for this game, it does provide the opportunity to mess with the sandbox. Whether it be loading up a troop carrier with sentinel beam marines or swinging around like spiderman, there's definitely plenty of ways you can play around with your new toys. Unlocking these new toys only feels partially natural, as a lot of the UNSC weapons and vehicles are locked behind valor. Valor is unlocked by doing events around the map like rescuing marine squads. Doing these events tend to be more of the same towards the end, which makes me wonder why they didn't just provide these weapons as the game progressed. Probably to pad out the game to make it a collectathon like most Open world PVE games nowadays. Halo Infinite definitely takes inspiration from the Ubisoft formula at the least.

The big issue is that to me, this game doesn't feel like it's worth 60 dollars, especially when the Multiplayer is free, which is an issue we'll discuss soon. Maybe if Halo was to follow through with the 10 year plan they envisioned and added story DLC, then maybe I would consider it worth it down the line. As it stands though, wait for it to be real cheap if you REALLY want it. I personally think the lack of replay-ability isn;t worth it 2 years later.

Multiplayer:
Halo Infinite's Multiplayer is a mess. Don't get me wrong, the core gameplay and foundation are there and for the most part are solid. What isn't solid is pretty much everything else; from the way it's handled to the very conception of it.

The gameplay itself, to me at least, feels good. Sure I could have a better aim, but the movement feels solid enough, my shots register and the sound design does make guns feel pushy. Infinite once again moved away from a  loadout system in order to provide a fair playing field for both teams and all players. Armor abilities have returned, but rather than it being integral like the loadout systems of Reach and Four or Halo 5's system. The abilities function more like equipment like halo 3. Limited use and you have to pick it up. I feel like it's better to have this system as it'll require map knowledge to get the most out of what you pick up. Sure sprinting is still in Halo, but unlike other titles, sprinting is only marginally faster; making only a big difference across longer, BTB orientated maps with a lot of area to cover between firefights. 

What the big problem is of Modern Halo infinite, which has been plaguing the player base since launch is the drip feed of content. Aside from the store, content doesn't seem to really come around. TO explain why this is an issue, Halo Infinite is supposed to be a live service game. Much like many other franchises who thought that Live Service is just a money printer, 343i and Microsoft apparently had no long term goal in terms of maintaining the game. Afterall, laying off hired staff in exchange for contractors that only work on the game for a set amount of time then leave was surely a good idea for an engine that was developed in house, so it's not like adding content on a regular basis would be hard right? I jest, but the fact of the matter is much like popeyes chicken, Halo infinite is more breading than chicken. It's hollow and there's not a lot of reason to play outside events and finishing the battlepass. It's not like you can show off your spartan or do things like PVE with them anyhow, so why bother.

On the topic of customization, it's laughable. Not the system itself, as it's more extensive than Halo 5, but there's certainly a lot of practices that are downright scummy. THe first issue is that Halo infinite is the first game that doesn't allow you to change your primary and secondary colors, instead opting for preset armor coatings. Sure, you get a small amount for free off the bat and you can earn more through weekly challenges (visors too) but it's a huge step down. Instead of being able to be a full white spartan, you now have to buy a 20 dollar bundle in game. Which brings us to the store. The store was, much like other live service games, designed to create fomo. High mark up on digital items during a weekly period on order to twist your arm to buy. Sure, it's not [i]necessary[/i] but a lot of armors for previous games, which were free mind you, are in this store and that will not change. This store existing is the entire reason Multiplayer is F2P and you cannot convince me otherwise. Afterall, how could they justify selling PIECES of a skin to the playerbase at exorbitant prices. It's expected of Fortnite and Call Of Duty, but at least you pay for a whole body cosmetic in that case on top of other items in said bundle; not to say I defend the practice for them.

Summary: 
Halo infinite is a good game riddled with bad decisions caused by greedy execs. I would say not to play this game, but that'd make me a hypocrite. I simply ask you to consider playing other games first before you download and possibly give games that are worth the time your attention. I really wish Halo would bounce back, but I understand that this isn't the 2000's anymore. It's maybe time to move on.",1684834736,1684834736,False,182,6,0.88317406177520752,1,True,False,False

Jokes aside, let me be real for a minute: 

The campaign starts out so strong. It's honestly great, and really pulled me in. However, once I got to the open world section (which has a beautiful reveal, by the way) the game completely fell apart. AI for the marines is embarrassingly bad. The enemies are only difficult on higher difficulties because they do more damage, not 'play' more tactfully, or engage in interesting ways. I'll talk more about that in a moment; let me take you back.

I had a moment where I stood and shot an AI marine in the face, recalling the original game where they would react as if you were now a threat and go absolutely ape shit on you. In this game, they just repeat the same three lines of dialogue over and over and don't react in any way beyond that. This one lost interaction is a reflection on the entire game.

It's an open world for the sake of being an open world. There is nothing interesting to be found. Traversing it is tedious; and I think they knew this, because they included a 'fast travel from anywhere!' feature. Enemies are sparsely placed between actual 'missions' you [don't have to] complete, and aren't worth interacting with in any way. Why would you? You can restock on your weapons at one of the FOBs you've unlocked.

There are lockers marked on your mini map with multi-player cosmetics in them. Neat idea, but it's ultimately dog-shit, and I'll explain why: In previous games of the series you received these cosmetic items by completing tasks of varying difficulty. It felt good, because you were rewarded for accomplishing a feat that not everyone could; this lead to a community that actually interacted with eachother, because people noticed and appreciated what you had accomplished, and this, in turn, lead to you helping others what they may not have been able to do alone, or perhaps something they didn't even know about. That's gone. In Halo Infinite, you receive these items simply by marking a locker on your map, traveling directly there and opening a locker. There are no enemies in this area. You did not bump into this locker by exploring. You didn't do anything special; you pressed a key. It doesn't feel rewarding in any way because of how they've simplified these unlocks.

Admittedly, I am not very far into the campaign, but I intend to complete it while skipping over most of their needless additions of Assassin's Creed / Far Cry copy pasted 'clear the area, climb the tower' non-sense. If they had made the ""open world"" smaller, and made the story more directed they may have actually done something great.

As it stands, this game's campaign has a major identity crisis. They didn't know what they wanted it to be, and so they tried to make it something it didn't need to be by adding various knock off versions of' content from other games. The worst part is that they didn't even replicate them particularly well. Gone are interesting AI interactions. Gone is the engagement of a linear, but meaningful story focused Halo. Gone are the days of feeling rewarded for accomplishing something truly fun, and difficult. Gone are the days of genuine care, and interest in a series that actually meant something to people.

Enjoy the multiplayer. It's free, fun, and it plays very well with all things considered. One caveat though:
Avoid paying for the battle pass, because the rewards are awful, and the progression is horrifically slow. 
The ""boosters"" you occasionally receive for 'leveling up' last ~60 minutes, but they aren't 60 minutes of GAME time, oh no no no. They begin counting down the moment you activate them, and they don't stop even while idling in the menu, or while you're queue-ing for a game. Oh, and nobody uses their mics anymore. It's a silent wasteland filled by [optional] Spartan chatter. 

Truly 343 has, as I like to say, shit the bed almighty.

The loading screens for everything multiplayer are terrible. A few minutes to wait for the playlists to show, a few minutes to access your weekly challenges or battle pass, a few minutes to access the shop, etc. Some days the loading screens just turn me off the game and I decide to play something else.

It's not all bad. I really like the weapon sandbox even though it's missing a few iconic weapons. The multiplayer is very fun and addictive, but only when there are no connection issues which are common. The Spartan customization is very monetized, but I also think it's the best art style and armor design in the 343 games.

Campaign is the full ""Triple A"" asking price, but I don't think it's worth that much. It's a typical open world full of collectibles and repeated objectives, mixed with scripted campaign missions. The PvE combat and miscellaneous challenges in the open world are fun enough that you don't notice the lack of innovation at first. The spectacle of the scripted missions don't live up to Bungie's Halo titles, or even 343i's titles (again, subjectively).

In conclusion, it's worth trying the free multiplayer if you don't mind the possibility of being frustrated with the menus and connection issues. If you haven't already purchased the campaign, please consider waiting for a discount. Nothing about Halo: Infinite deserves your money, at least until you judge the game yourself.

If you like Far Cry PVE where you wander around capturing spawn points and occasionally instantiate a more linear ""level"" then this game has something for you.  If you like Halo, buy one of those games instead.  The Master Chief Collection was actually pretty solid.

They aren't even pretending they're going to make this one a Halo game anymore.  I'm sure the name was helpful for selling what they made instead.  I'd want my money back, but honestly it wouldn't make me feel better.  After the last couple of ""Halo"" games the things they promised at the beginning of this one got my hopes up, but I guess Frost was right and nothing gold can ever stay.  Like many of the negative reviews here I have played the previous games and had some expectations that were not fulfilled.  Like all of the purchasers here I was sold a different product than the one I bought.

The single-player experience was pretty okay, weapons/shooting sounded and felt good, enemies were tough but not too cheap for the most part.    Over a year past launch that is still what it has going for it.  No coop yet, and takesies-backsies on split-screen coop ever.  I don't play Halo for the online arena multiplayer and haven't tried it so I can't comment on whether it is fun or not.  I sure hope so as it seems to have been the whole point all along.  The open-world-ness didn't really add anything for me personally.  It was a bit like Burnout: Paradise where it was still a bunch of linear experiences with the ""open world"" really just meaning it takes longer to start a ""mission"" because you have to walk there instead of selecting it from a menu.  I trailed off somewhere that was starting to feel late-game-y and just never picked it up again.  I told myself I'd come back when they patched in coop, which at the time they said would be in May (2022)... ah, to be young and have dreams.

Ultimately I must accept that this game is not meant for me, which makes me sad but doesn't mean it's bad.  I'm not recommending it but if you go into it with your eyes open to what it is instead of thinking it's going to be Halo you might like it.  I'll probably go back and play it again someday if only to see the end, but I don't feel like doing it now and I guess I'll probably be doing it solo.

The weapons feel good and interesting (and the grapple hook is fun), the graphics are good, and so is the music. The first two levels feel like halo. Then you get the amazing reveal of the outside world. However, this soulless open world is nothing like halo. There's no decent set pieces or epic vehicle runs. No coming up on an area like there's a raging battle that doesn't care you're there. There's like 2-3 maps, and most of it is all the same unlike the memorable changes and levels in the other games. The open world has lifeless activities like an ubisoft game. Go here and save these 5 marines, blow up this tower, open this box for this cosmetic, kill this bullet sponge boss with some gimmick weapon, and go to this camp and clear it out. The open world translates to halo terribly. The enemies will all be spamming and you from all range instantly. The AI is terrible and it's not fun. The boss fights that are part of the main campaign are absolutely garbage and they just are just even more shielded bullet sponges with some gimmick weapon. The story (early on) might as well be non-existent, and the characters are modern day tongue in cheek joke machines. The marines aren't part of the fight, they're just one liner props at your generic bases you ""liberate"". 

I did my first playthrough on heroic (it's easy until random insane spikes of difficulty) until I got to a boss fight with a jetpack enemy with a shotgun and a long ranged enemy with a endless spam grenade launcher. I couldn't beat it with my weapon set to even touch their shields. All guides mentioned using the tank or getting a sniper. So I went to go get a tank, and the 2 bosses have unlimited range where they keep shooting at you literally a full zone away. So I quit. They put zero effort into this game. Many months later, I'm trying a run on normal just to finish the game. I've softened a bit on the story as you get deeper, and the inside portions of the main missions are good.

I'd recommend on a deep sale or just go play the old halo games if you want halo. The open world does not work in this game with the way the ai and combat is.

The Campaign is fun, even though the levels feel kind of the same, but it is definitely one of my favourite Stories in a game I played in a while. Hopefully 343 will also work soon on the next DLCs because without them I will play Infinite only until I got it 100% and the forget about it.
[b] Multiplayer [/b] 
I don't play multiplayer games in general that much, but Infinites multiplayer is also ok. I'm bad and so can't have that much fun, but it is for me a better multiplayer than most other f2p games out there. It isn't the best Halo multiplayer but it has definitely some good stuff.

Gameplay is honestly fun when things are working right.
Looks pretty.

Negatives:
Campaign is honestly dull and too many unanswered questions.
Multiplayer servers are complete trash making games nigh unplayable most of the time.
Battle pass ""Progression"" is like pulling teeth and half the unlocks are barred by a paywall.
Very little customisation options and most is locked behind micro-transactions.
No way to earn credits through normal game-play, either pay directly or pay for premium on the battle pass.
Coatings are a pointless addition that frankly only exists to squeeze more money out of players.
No casual game-modes like infection.
No PVE game-modes, Firefight or Spartan Ops, Bot Bootcamp does NOT count.
Over a year since launch and still very little content.

I love the Halo series and it sucks that even after being delayed a year there is so much wrong and so little content none of which feels like it's being addressed.

I just can't find any reason to keep playing anymore.

I see a lot of people who are reviewing the game saying its bad and that 343 shouldn't have been working on Halo in the first place. In my opinion the game isn't perfect I can agree on that but it is still a really good game. 

The campaign has been a 10/10 since the start, it's something I've wanted since first playing Halo: CE. Being able to go out and explore the ring, liberate outposts, be a sneaky dude. It's like Halo took all the good parts of its other campaigns and combined them with Farcry to make this masterpiece. 

The multiplayer in the beginning was lackluster, in my opinion they could have released what they had in the technical preview and had a better game, but for some reason they removed a lot coming into the game. Believe me or not but as a developer I can understand where they have been coming from, but as a triple A company they could have done better. This again doesn't mean I haven't enjoyed the game.

The way they built the arena in this game brings me back to Halo 2 / Halo 3 where the game-play was a lot more balanced, there's no more meta like how I felt Halo 4, and Halo 5 had where it was what you had in your build. The game seems to be back to its fast-paced, tea-bagging glory, plus we get to sprint which was honestly my favorite change back in the day. Clambering and sliding can be bothersome at times but I'm okay with it for now. 

In the end I honestly have to say I enjoy the game, call me a Halo simp if you will but I enjoy the game being free so all my friends from high school and I can still enjoy halo together without having to dig into our wallets to play. As stated above, the game is not perfect by any means but please don't give up on it it's still fun to play.

Truly, it was a grand return to form, the game play is damn near some of the best if not the best in the series and the addition of ADS this time around was done tastefully. Infinite was on top, and rightfully so, it did the impossible and integrated all of the best elements from the last 5 numbered titles. But all was not well in the galaxy, 343 industries dropped the ball massively by releasing the game with as little content as possible. Repetitive play on the same 2 maps, server errors, a step back on customization in the form of coatings, and the worst implementation of ""live service"" by a AAA developer to date (probably). These issues spelled disaster for Infinite, and as time went on the issues seemed to get worse, not better. The winter update fixed some issues, but in the eyes of many it may be too little too late.

That said there is much improvement to be made to the monetization aspects, where progression feels grindy and the monetization feels greedy.

I don't think anyone will disagree when they say the latest Halo title's launch was a bit of a faceplant. Given the immensely troubled production led by people who were only concerned with meeting sales checkmarks, pleasing executives and fulfilling a vision where no one bothered to QA the game in any reasonably extensive method, on top of poor maintenance and frankly abysmal Microsoft mandates concerning contract work, it would be easy to call this game an utterly terrible flop... if it didn't get some extensive work done on it!

Everything I said just now is the preamble to understanding why Infinite started the way it did. It had a lot working against it. The people responsible for the state of the franchise, whatever your opinion on it, are long gone. Everyone who were terrible at managing, the overwhelming amount of producers, and failing to allocate resources in proper areas are long gone. What we have in its place is something special, made by developers that care about the game. Between the death threats and the constant shitflinging (No, calling the game ""Dogshit"" without saying why is not criticism). it's easy to see why some have left. It'd be very easy to just abandon the title. But they aren't. Y'know why?

It might be hard to believe, but they care. They really do. I promise they do. 

It wouldn't be fair to not give credit where it's due. We have the most powerful Forge to date, over 25 maps to play on, a robust customs browser, prefab selection, a huge amount of modes (Yes, some are still missing, but they're coming, I promise.) 140+ achievements, co-op campaign, (no splitscreen, but I honestly feel like that's a sacrifice we need to have in this current age), 7 free suits to choose from, 17 free coatings (up from 7) with more on the way, battlepasses that never expire, a nice match xp system, tons of colorful medals, fun weapons, and going back to an artstyle that had many singing with joy. You might say all of this and more should have been in at launch, and you're right, but what does that kind of criticism really serve? Like actually? Credit where it's due, or don't give at all.

Suffice to say, yes, the game needs work... but we're getting there. And the best part? The multiplayer is completely free.

Before I leave this review, I'll just bang out a quote that's gotten me through tough times, especially for ones like this game.

This will be largely negative but I will do my best to provide a thoughtful critique. At the time of writing this we have FINALLY gotten season 3.

Let's start with the multiplayer since it launched a month before the full game. The gameplay loop this game creates with its sandbox focus is very satisfying. Gun-play feels responsive and deadly, movement feels meaningful sans the mantle mechanic. The interplay between equipment, weapons, melee, and grenades creates a fantastic challenge of skill and is accessible to players at any skill range. That being said vehicles are a massive downgrade from previous installments. The doomsday mechanic comes with a massive hit to vehicle health, which no longer has any meaningful connection to player health. Making vehicle destruction feel sudden and sometimes undeserved. Say goodbye to your long warthog runs. Before long your metal chassis will start whirring and turning an obnoxious red, alerting you to an impending explosion. At launch map selection was terrible and only recently did we get the Forge tool.  [i]heh we'll get to that soon enough.[/i] To make matters worse the roster is split between your standard 4v4 arenas and big team battle, aka BTB, maps suited for 12v12. Maps that accomodate 12v12 matches don't lend themselves to viability in the regular 4v4 rotation like the 8v8 BTB maps did in previous entries. A silver lining in this is the map design has been conducted with brilliant attention to detail. Behemoth takes place in an ancient desert atop a plateau taken up by the brutalist architecture of a forerunner structure. While it doesn't make for a satisfying competitive backdrop it is certainly a location I enjoy returning to time and time again.

Matchmaking, the backbone of the multiplayer experience in this title, leaves some things to be desired. A lack of input based matchmaking is something I wish we could have for our mouse and keyboard playing friends. Many staple game-types from the series are simply just not in the game. We are still waiting on assault, territories, race, and fan favorites grifball and infection. A worrying sign when considering that many players are clamoring for a battle royale-like mode before modes that longtime fans like myself would consider a must are even in the game.

Some time following the Winter update we got the inclusion of a custom games browser, allowing for players to search for and host specifically catered experiences.

Customization in this game is heavily monetized. Often times to a disappointing degree. While I have very little ethical concerns to the flat rate monetization of cosmetics, I get the feeling that many players feel burned by both the selection and the value of these items. For myself the most concerning omission has been that of the two tone color picker in favor of a broad selection of assorted color combinations called armor coatings, which for the most part are bought piece meal from the store or available in bundles. I want my deep blue and white dang it!

This is the part where I upset a lot of people. [b]The Campaign![/b]

Halo 4 and 5 both tried new ideas. Some good, most bad, and while this entry promised to give us a true to form Halo experience it looks like some things haven't been fully shaken from the formula of the last two [strike]train wrecks[/strike] entries. The word I think best describes the degree of self seriousness the 343 games have: Melodrama! [spoiler]As much as I love a good dramatic sci fi story, the atmosphere of the original Halo trilogy never lent itself to teary eyed AI women proclaiming their love to an emotionless robot voiced by the rock n' roll DJ who does the truck ads, look it up.[/spoiler] I just can't help but feel like this isn't working when I've traded the flamboyant machismo of Sergeant Johnson and Saturday morning cartoon villainy of the profits for the emotional depth of a teenage girl in the body of a 7ft tall super soldier. It's not like I want the game to be stupid, dumbed down, or irreverent. Halo 2 was a brilliantly written personal tale of an alien that loses his religion set to the fever pitch Bush era politics of the time of its release while Master Chief kinda just shows up. Interesting that. I'm just saying stop it with the dark and brooding vapid emotionality.

When did we decide that everything has to be an open world? This is the BLANDEST open world I have ever seen. Halo does not feel the least bit engaging in an open world. Even if it did, the whole game takes place within the same pacific North-West forest biome. A severe lack of biodiversity in a series which took us to frozen tundras, mystic ruins and grand sprawling deserts. It feels bored with itself.

It's hard to explain, but if you have played Halo 3's mission, The Ark, you would know exactly what we're missing in service of mashing the grappling hook until you unlock the next fast travel point. In the Ark the player is dropped off along a winding cliff face in the desert with an elite squad of ODSTs. In the distance you can see our very own Milky Way Galaxy. One marine comments on the view, another asks, ""Wait is that-?"" He's cut off. ""We have a job to do."" The player and their team make it to the first covenant outpost. A fun engagement leads through a cliff and to a similar second encounter. You pick off as many covenant with your snipers as you can before you run out of ammo. The enemy drops off a pair of hunters. After spamming enough grenades and desperate shots at their weak-spots you fight your way further up the cliff and make your way to an open vehicle section. Tear your way through multiple encounters before you're asked to clear out a mesa plateau. Anti Air wraiths keep your people from landing so you make quick work of their squads of snipers and tank support. In real time you watch as the Forward Unto Dawn, a massive space ship, tears through the clouds and touches down right before you. The gust of wind it carries sends the nearby tank wreckage, and you if you get too close, flying away. It is one of the most impressive real time events ever done in a game and we're only about a third of the way through the mission.

I could go on, but I feel like I've made my point. The tightly directed set pieces of the linear approach to a single player experience in ONE MISSION dwarfs the whole of scope in Infinite's open world campaign. Nothing even comes close to the magic we felt on The Ark. It's safe for me to say that even if the rest of this review were to eventually change with future updates. This campaign bit you're reading now is likely to stay just as it is at the time of writing this. I'd love to be proven wrong. (I haven't been yet.)

Since I initially wrote this review we have gotten Seasons 2 and 3, and the Winter update. With the Winter update we saw the inclusion of Forge, the map making tool and gametype Halo has been known for since Halo 3 in 2007. It was embarrassingly late. I would say worth the wait, but I cannot in good faith justify it. Don't get me wrong here. The Forge mode is the best in the series. It's not as accessible as previous iterations but the trade-off is that it provides an incredibly rich map making experience. For those with the time and know-how there is even a front end scripting language. The sky is the limit.

This game is the definition of mediocre. Even after the 300 additional hours I got out of the game since writing my initial review.",1649667836,1683103526,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Halo Infinite, developed by 343 Industries, is a disappointing entry in the iconic Halo franchise. Despite its highly anticipated release, the game fails to deliver on several fronts, leaving fans of the series feeling let down.

One of the major issues with Halo Infinite is its mediocre story. The game's narrative fails to captivate or engage players, with a plot that feels disjointed and poorly executed. The characters lack depth and development, making it difficult for players to feel invested in their journey or the events of the story.

Furthermore, Halo Infinite suffers from technical issues and bugs that detract from the overall experience. The game's graphics, while impressive in some areas, are inconsistent and marred by performance issues. The online multiplayer mode is plagued by connectivity problems, making it difficult for players to enjoy the game with friends.

Moreover, the game's world-building and level design are lackluster. The open-world areas feel empty and lack diversity, and the randomly generated side missions quickly become repetitive and uninteresting.

Overall, Halo Infinite is a disappointing entry in the Halo franchise that fails to live up to expectations. With a mediocre story, technical issues, and lackluster world-building, the game fails to capture the excitement and innovation that made the series a fan favorite. Fans of the franchise may be better off revisiting older entries in the series rather than investing in this lackluster release.",1637088752,1682723402,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Hope to see a turn around.  The spartan cores really contribute more to the stunt of this growth than the microtransactions yourself, think of it as a extra layer of greed.   Desync has been vastly improved since the games launch, however its still a issue here and there, but not as big as it once was.  Lag / server lag seems to be more common than desync now.   

Xbox aim assist and PC is still noticeable and irritating but not game breaking.  Weapon Balance is a lot better than it used to be but still needs worked.  I know I mentioned lag before, but the first few months was really bad but its been mostly cleaned up.   There is now 11 game modes instead of like the original 3 so thats a vast improvement, but classics like Firefight, Infection, and Griffball are still not here if you're looking for those.  

Personal opinion time:  Most of the maps are fine but there is a couple maps i just really hate, the original maps that launched with the game seem better designed but to small for 4v4 as spawning in can be a issue, but for the new maps that released from launch that isn't a issue anymore yet seem to lack good design.  Design being how much cover you can without someone from the other side of the map shooting you / how open you are, to how many paths you can take to get from point a to point b.   Though size isn't an issue anymore as i said before.  

Really hoping for a focus on bettering customization, staying away from spartan cores and bringing cash items into future battlepasses.  Fomo doesn't suit Halo.  Hoping to have the 3 game modes listed above brought in preferably Warzone firefight without the cash aspect of it.  Assassination animations are still missing those were really cool. 

TLDR: Still rating a wouldn't recommend due to previous halo installations have been. This game could be so much better but it isn't.  But if customization, microtransactions, and lack of unique game modes from previous halo game modes don't bother you, than you'll probably enjoy the game.

Secondly, having fiber internet made it a breeze to download it. Now, the story/campaign mode in this game is pretty awesome. The character development is much richer than before; however, I did miss the skulls and other entertaining features from the previous versions/releases. 
As far as the open world play, I would say, it's a unique touch to the game, but does get repetitive over time. The mostly grassy and somewhat wooded, as well as rocky terrain makes navigating the landscape of Halo interesting. It would be even more fun and interesting, if they reintroduced some of the classic terrains from Halo CE, like underground formations, snowy winter scenes, etc.
Other than that, I had a blast blasting the aliens and brutes throughout the game. The boss fights are another cool touch, but could use more strategy. 
In conclusion, if you've played through the previous versions of Halo, then this one will definitely not disappoint. The graphics are quite picturesque and colorful. The sound effects are fresh and crisp. Music and voice-over development has been on point and full of emotion, especially in the campaign mode.

To give 343 credit where it's due, this game blows Halo 4 and 5 out of the water and, despite enhanced movement and other fancy new bells and whistles, really looks and [i]FEELS[/i] more like a traditional Halo game. At launch, I enjoyed it for what it was, and looked forward to the promise of more content to come in the near future with the launch of campaign. Promises of more maps, the addition of missing gamemodes, more cosmetics and F2P ways to earn them, improvements and additions to the sandbox, a progression system, Forge mode, co-op campaign, cross-core cosmetics and armour kit customisation, fixes to broken cosmetics, fixes to desync, more reasonable mtx pricing, a fix to matchmaking for BTB, a better report system, a Theatre mode that isn't completely broken, and working custom games along with a browser, to name some of the things that were actually acknowledged by 343.

However, nearly a year and a half later, I don't believe 343 has satisfactorily delivered on these promises. The new Forge mode seems amazing, and the custom games browser is a big win for 343 (I'd like to see it take off as well as the MCC one did). I think consistent implementation of community maps and gamemodes to the matchmaking pools would add some much needed variety to multiplayer, ESPECIALLY where the community has already perfectly recreated old gamemodes that 343 refuses to hurry up and add to the game until they can tie some boring event to it where you have to buy all of best cosmetics in the shop. Cross-core has not been implemented despite bots having it since Day 1, armour kits can't be customised, micro prices were decreased then re-increased, there is still no progression system, matchmaking and desync issues are still rampant, iconic gamemodes and maps are still missing, splitscreen got axed, and so on. 343 have had ample time to deliver on many of their promises but have failed and continue to fail to do so, which I find troubling given Infinite's long development history and keeping extra time they've had with last year's constant content delays in mind.

The campaign was fun despite no co-op at launch, however the open world was - while sometimes enjoyable - overall dull and lacked variety in biome and activities. The linear missions also lacked variety, but were serviceable in a more low-stakes plot that aimed to erase Halo 5's story set-up from memory. Somehow I still look forward to the continuation of Halo's story be it in another game or a campaign DLC (ignoring the disheartening though understandable lack of any news what with the game struggling to maintain a playerbase!). To address the cost of the campaign at full price in Halo with F2P multiplayer, I don't feel I got my money's worth versus purchasing any of the previous titles where I could just earn multiplayer cosmetics through gameplay rather than paid BPs or store micros. The F2P model is predatory and it sucks!

For Infinite to have any chance of surviving it will need a massive 2.0-style update that overhauls the game from end to end, which I can't see happening soon enough with 343's current lead times. While every recent update seems to be another small step in the right direction, player retention shows it's too little, too late. With rumours of the game being ""abandoned"" to try again with a new Halo in Unreal 5, Infinite's future seems dismal, though I truly hope I can one day return to a feature-complete game to give it a more positive wrap.

During that time I had immense excitement followed by brutal realisation that this game was rushed, unoptimized and bluntly-put; unfinished.

Since then many of the 343i team have left including Bonnie Ross the Head of 343 Industries and the Team has been replaced or bolstered by more in tune developers. I feel now it would be immature of me to continue rousing on their image. As of right now the game is in acceptable state, it is a huge shame that the game couldn't have had this opportunity at the time of it's launch.

We finally have many of the features we were promised and of course there is still plenty they can bring in;

-Career progression- As someone who has completed all 3 seasons & the Winter Update, there is nothing left to progress towards, no high scores to show, no K/D on my profile and outside of a rank emblem there is no way of showing my true skill level, I understand that Teams will have their own skill ratings in the After match Report but other than that there is no record of my achievements that is usually found in every FPS game.

-Less filler in battle passes- So far a lot of awards could be combined into a single reward, for example, Emblem icons for both your spartan & vehicles is just absurd. More over, Weapons have individual skins, ideally they should have all weapon colour combinations of the same type fall into a singular reward. 

-Cross-Core customisation- Offering even cross core between Lore cores like Mark VII, Mark V-B, Rakshasa & Mirage/SPI would be a great move, perhaps even keeping Fracture Cores like Eagle-Strike, Yoroi & Chimera as their own cross-core options. 


-A wider range in the Shop tab- I personally would make many more purchases if things were offered singularly. And no offense to the art team but a lot of the colour palettes and gear are just not aesthetically pleasing to me but I digress.

===Weapons & Abilities===
In any case, these are gripes that i hope are addressed soon but outside of those, the core gameplay is outstanding and I have become VERY creative in how I survive bouts when outnumbered, the abilities and weapons all feel incredible to use and I have fun no matter what weapon i'm dropped with. 

===Vehicles===
I have some gripes with certain vehicles being useless like the Banshee & Gungoose, they often stay exactly where they're dropped, in my BTB games. Some buffs could be used for those two but other vehicles like the Wasp and Scorpion are insanely good. Some of my highest kill games have been in those vehicles. The standard warthog, Ghost & Mongoose are all perfect in their categories honestly.


===Campaign===

Having played the campaign a few times now, I can tell you that upping your shields does reduce the difficulty by a HUGE amount, I played my first playthrough with no shield upgrades on Heroic and it was no trouble at all.

The campaign now has co-op & mission replay but even so the sandbox feels lack luster and I personally would like to find more heavy-weight opponents like Hunters, Warmaster Brutes & Wraiths in the late game sandbox.

Overall the state of the game has improved dramatically however I still feel like they are a long way off from achieving a AAA title standard for the current generation of games. Here's for hoping. I rate it now as a 7/10 experience that needs more work put into creating content for semi-long to long-term players.

Unfortunately, Infinite's incredible gameplay and Forge mode are marred with countless bugs and glitches – a customization system that boasts a wide array of armor yet feels incredibly constrained due to the lack of cross-core customization, a story that falls flat on it's face, and abysmal support for a live service title.

I was one of the people really excited for Halo to make it's return, but alas Infinite could've used another year or two in the oven than launching in the state that it did.

*Update - I finished the campaign, and did enjoy enjoy it a lot. A legendary playthrough is pretty challenging - Especially the ending boss fights. If you love halo as much as I do, the story is good enough to warrant the current price tag. There was a lot of love that went into the campaign and the game's environment is pretty impressive. I just hope they fix multiplayer quick enough that people will still be around to play with.

Multiplayer:
1. Big team battle has not been playable for 3 weeks now
2. Some of the weaponry in multiplayer needs to be rebalanced (Skewer)
3. Multiplayer matchmaking is unbalanced in non-BTB matches

General and single player gameplay:
1. The scorpion tank controls are terrible
2. Legendary AI uses some weapons to 1-shot you from stupid distances which makes you play like a cheeseball to avoid it
3. There is a critical bug where your own weapons and/or new weapons found on racks will not fire at all after respawning - On legendary, it's extremely difficult to overcome this issue

*For the glitched weapon bug, I've found you can keep picking up and dropping different weapons and one will eventually work

Aside from the above (I'll change my review if resolved) - I am having fun for the most part with the campaign on legendary, even when dying a lot in some ""arenas"", and BTB was very fun when it worked. The campaign maps are really awesome to look at and they really captured the feel of how halo should be. The graphics, sound and music are really good. The music could be better (Another Steve Vai composition anyone?), but it's not bad. I think they could have done a lot more to make the music fit what was going on at times. The soundtrack is beautifully composed however. The movement & gunplay is very crisp and satisfying - It very much feels like halo.

If you really want multiplayer more than single, I'd wait on purchasing this game until multiplayer is stable. If you don't care about multiplayer, the single player is good, but replayability is low.",1640638389,1681858469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ""Weapon"" character got a bit annoying at times, so definitely a downgrade from Cortana. The open world map where you could take breaks from the main storyline and go do a side mission, like taking back a FOB or going after a high level target was a nice addition and gave us a break from the tension here and there (plus some very cool unique weapons!).

Graphics, game play and lore all hit it out of the park for me personally. Sadly though... I hate to say it but the multiplayer is mediocre at best. 

The leveling up is wacky and dubious at best. Players seem to be rewarded for participation rather than game play. Which is fine but the rewards you unlock are no better than a prize out of the prize box in kindergarten. If you pay for the ultimate pass you unlock slightly cooler skins and items but then again its all rehashed garbage. If you pay more which at this point you either have the money or live off daddy's money you can get some cool looking items. OK done with that now for what I really hate.

Game modes, de-sync, maps, cheaters and banning. <----- this right here is what ruins the multiplayer to the fullest. The game modes are limited no Juggernaut,  KOTH or infected. The maps are blegh at best. Just a handful of maps that are so-so, could've at least threw in a retro. De-sync is a common complaint in the community, plenty of reviewers have covered it. Oh yes and get ready the players that need that edge are among us. Yes Lag switches, aim bot and the likes it's not as crazy as it use to be but they're in full force and yes is you quit games cause these people ruin the game 343 will ban you. Yes they will ban you for leaving the game early, leaving too late or if your cheating lol. Yeah cheating, sure. I know I can appeal it but for 59.99 this is dumb. I uninstalled today and will not reinstall. Halo infinite is not a successor to 3 but not bad enough for me to not speak of it like 4 and 5.

Don't buy the campaign, Not worth it. Basically Far Cry: Halo and very little in the way of a story.
Multiplayer:
The weapon sandbox is still unbalanced.
At almost any range, the pistol can outclass nearly every weapon.
Bandit was introduced but it's a DMR without a scope and abysmal range. Outclassed by pistol 8/10 times.
BR is good if you can land all headshots and get a perfect. However,  Pistol outclasses it 7/10 times
Sniper fails to register headshots more often than not even after they ""fixed"" the hitbox issue in a former patch.
AR is solid though.
Banished weapons, except the Skewer and hammer/sword, are nearly useless in most cases.
Hammers range seems to be inconsistent for me, enemies can kill from nearly 20 ft away but I have to be within 5 ft.
Shock rifle is OP for controller users due to the aim assist you get and the EMP of it can stall a vehicle indefinitely if you stay on target.
Shotgun and heatwave are underpowered at close range, even though they should shine there.
The spawning system for vehicles is far from balanced... EX: The enemy team gets dropped a scorpion at their spawn and you get a gun goose at yours.
Vehicles are made of paper and get destroyed way too fast especially the banshee.
Wasp is good, but a little slow for a ""fast attack vehicle""
Customization is very limited. unless you buy the battle passes and even with that, most of the armor is meh at best.
Could be fixed with cross-core, or just drop the core system.. since it limits combinations.
Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think armor should be locked behind a paywall. Reach credit system was best.
343 seems to be more interested in dropping new skins for armor/weapons than making the gameplay fun and not glitchy.
This is on full display with the desync issues that at still plaguing this game.
If you like ranked, prepare for unbalanced team matching. You'll routinely be paired with Gold ranks even if you're Plat, Diamond, or Onyx and vice-versa. 
This game does still have potential but 343 is running out of time. The player base continues to drop as they ignore the community and if they persist, it's only a matter of time until Halo is a dead franchise.",1681497405,1681497405,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer progression is getting better, they're slowly fixing playlists finally, but monetization and FOMO paywalled content in the daily/weekly shop for ludicrous prices to get stuff we got for free just for playing the game in previous games is not okay and hopefully they change it. Do not pay for anything in this game until they finally give in and fix the problems.
Otherwise the gameplay is fun. Definitely give it a try and a chance, it'll take a few matches to get into it.]]]

The Story of John and Cortana is so near and dear to my heart guys. I just really love what you have done with the story and all that you are doing with the Halo universe. I enjoyed Halo 5 as well to be clear. I am happy to see the franchise being furthered and cultured. I cried so many times during this campaign; it truly is a great story. 

I write this to be a voice against the masses of naysayers. Please for the love of God do not cater to these heretics. Let your achievement stand and let future works be guided by passion and excellence. Focus on making epic story lines and dramatic circumstances for John and our future Cortana to overcome! 

It truly saddens my heart to see such great franchises and cultivators alike be dwindled by negativity! How truly dreadful for passions to be choked by cynicism and achievement belittled and overlooked by inadequacy. Harden your hearts 343.

It went from good, to bad, to kinda better, to DOG SHIT, to where it should have been at launch. I give it a positive review for now. But 343 Industries should know they are OUT OF CHANCES. Any good grace they had was lost with a 10 month season. Seriously consider: you could have fucked in May, gotten pregnant, and your child would have been born--all in the span of Season 2. NOT. OKAY.

That being said, they've reached seasonality, the biggest speed bumps are gone, and now it should be smooth sailing from here on out. Halo Infinite's sandbox and gameplay loop is 343's best iteration of the Halo we all know and love, absolutely on-par with the Bungie titans of old. The multiplayer story is starting to become interesting. The game is still monetized as shit and I will never forgive 343 for that, but at the very least I understand that they have to make money. They could be less predatory about it, if you ask me, but whatever. The gameplay is where it shines (as it should). Mapmaking could be better, focus on the sweaty competitive scene hurts literally every other aspect of the game, and their microtransactions should definitely be WAY more forgiving (why am I paying you 20 fucking dollars of cash ON TOP of the $60 I paid for the campaign, for armor and colors I owned in previous titles?!).

The multiplayer gameplay is highly enjoyable, and is the redeeming factor of this game for me. The package surrounding the multiplayer is where everything else falls apart. The user interface is cumbersome from equipping cosmetics to easily figuring out how to leave a party/lobby. Cosmetics are expensive, up to $14 for one color palette as an example. It feels like I play on the same two maps repeatedly, and Launch Site is still somehow a 4v4 map (it's too big for 8 players). Having over 100 hours in the game at this point though, I have to recommend it for the multiplayer gameplay. Just know going in the experience is lacking polish.

[h1]Campaign[/h1]
The campaign is OK. It didn't hit me the same as the other Halo campaigns. For starters, too much important story exposition is revealed through collectible audio logs rather than the cutscenes or dialogue occurring through the main gameplay. The open world suffers from what I feel is a ""big for the sake of being big"" map where there isn't enough environment diversity to make the exploration interesting. Despite its flaws, the open world might be my favorite part of the game since it allowed me flexibility in my approach to any conflict or side mission. The Grappleshot is the most exciting way to get around, with a Razorback full of marines with power weapons being a close second.

Generally, I found the story missions to be long and repetitive, reusing gameplay loops within themselves or occurring entirely within same-y Forerunner structures. Replayability and gathering collectibles are hampered by the lack of a mission select system. Bosses were a nice addition.

My co-op experience revealed that it feels tacked onto what was intended as a solo experience. Co-op arrived a year after release, and it doesn't feel like the gameplay was balanced to account for it. Only one waypoint can be set at a time, and players can't ping things like in multiplayer matchmaking, hindering collaboration. The overall game difficulty feels very easy with 3-4 people, even on Legendary, whereas Heroic feels appropriately difficult solo. I think my favorite part of the campaign has to be the

I, like many others, have an issue where the game crashes again and again from time to time, or I get timed out or something else. The game temporary banned me.

When I responded to that email, I just got the same email again, email chain posted below after the review. The support is not actually there to assist the players, and do not seem to want to SUPPORT the game.

The pay to level up system is not great at all, and provides very minimal items and it takes forever to really get enough to customize your Spartan. They make you pay for colors pretty much. You can advance quickly, you just better pay for it. And it appears that they have made it slow on purpose, so that they force you to pay for the progression. I cannot back a company that does tactics like this. This is why I left the battlefront games. If I remember correctly, Reach had a lot of customization and it did not take long to get the items and it was easier to get them.

The game play is good, but if they will do this to the cosmetic items, what to say they wont find a way to do it to something else in the game.

I no longer disconnect from matches like I used to... EXCEPT for custom games. While the breadth of tools they've given creators to create within Infinite is actually quite awesome, the servers cannot keep up. Custom games constantly crash and are buggy as hell. All this and the game has been out for a really long time. I just don't understand why companies don't make games like they used to, like Bungie used to. Just, release a game with all the features you intend for it to have in a working state. All that out of the way, I still stand by the gameplay it is actually quite crisp and enjoyable. And the customs are quite awesome in terms of potential. But like the player count is lower these days because so many people left it due to its issues.

Single player - most people really like it. Good story, fun characters, apparently deep lore that the nerds are into, there's a lot to like. It's open world, which has it's pros and cons. There aren't as many ""set pieces"" as in other Halos (i.e. no driving around scarabs or aircraft levels or gunner parts, take it or leave it really). There's upgrades you can do to your armor, if you think that's cool. Not completely my cup of tea but I can recognize the quality, it's pretty good! 60 bucks is pretty expensive though, I would wait for a sale.

Multi player - a real mixed bag. I'm putting this up as recommended only because the game is free, otherwise it would be the opposite.

Pros: Gameplay wise, really really crisp action. The guns are all mostly interesting, love the new guns (some weapons are ACTUALLY useless, i.e. the plasma pistol and ravager). The gunplay is mostly what keeps me coming back, at least for now, as it's really satisfying in my opinion. Armor abilities add another dimension to MP, it's neat. I like pretty much everything about the gunplay as it is, but I'm merely a casual who enjoys playing for fun so what does my opinion matter.

Meh: Time to kill is a lot shorter than other halos, which is take it or leave it. Vehicles are fun, except for the banshee which dies in 2 hits and deals no damage, and the hornet which is damn OP (if you get in a hornet, expect to get at least 5 kills every time, and more if the map just so happens to randomly not spawn a sniper rifle or other good power weapons, you can very easily get farmed for days if the enemy has both hornets on the map). Warthog is great in this installment, but kinda floaty, same with mongoose. I actually don't mind the tanks being stronger than in other halos. I never thought having them die to just a grenade was very fun, they're a TANK for crying out loud. But your opinion may vary. The graphics are, in my opinion, not next gen level stuff. There's a lot of polish in some areas and I actually really like the art direction. But these graphics are more like 2016 level stuff or earlier, it's not exactly breaking new ground.

God awful: What the hell did 343 try to do with the shop? It's actually terrible. I don't need to tell you about it, go read the other 500 comments talking about it, you probably know. Don't give them money, besides the battle pass thing, that's decent value, at the very least. That said, it's just cosmetics, so I don't care too too much about it - the other problems are bigger. There needs to be way more maps. Why are the BTB maps so small? Why was BTB broken for MONTHS after launch? MONTHS! For a AAA game are you for real? I still disconnect from matches all the time, my ping seems to be alright when I'm in game but getting into a match sometimes, hoo boy. Getting disconnected from games due to the server borking can get you banned meaning you can't even play. Speaking of, the game will crash randomly, expect at least one crash almost every play session. I have a beastly PC too, this is really unacceptable, and definitely ruins a lot of my games and is wicked frustrating. ALSO NO FORGE OR FIREFIGHT straight MISSING mode from other halos. I know they often add this stuff in after a while, but with how this game is faring, expect to wait another year or more before they add new modes like that. Customs seem like they'll be fun, if forge ever gets out. Oh yeah and no infection, boo.",1645494152,1680964233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I can't count the amount of times my hits haven't registered, my spartan gets killed after reaching a corner or cover, the times it seems the enemy one-shots me because his shots don't make any noise on my end, the amount of times it loads me into a game only to keep me on the loading screen and eventually kick me for inactivity, the amount of times it loads me into a match, finishes the countdown, only to promptly crash, and the amount of hours I've had to wait to get into matches themselves. There are days where it seems it wants to shuffle you into the inferior team to artificially lower your winning streak and your kdr. It's just not fun.

The fact that the developers had the audacity to sell the same coating for the different guns and armor for 14, 15, 16 dollar bundles but they won't fix their shitty netcode, their desync issues, and other things that have been brought up countless times by the community only goes to show where the priorities are.

I don't know why they thought adding jackal snipers who can't miss and hunters you can't get behind was a good idea.   Beyond that you have: Elites which you have to waste all your ammo on or spam reachfall to kill.   I despise the fact you have to spam an OP ability to make any real progress in killing enemies in this game.    Another thing is the fact that it just feels like the headshot hitbox for brutes is WAY smaller than their head.   That one could be me but it really does feel like half my shots that hit the ""Head"" ignore it.   Additionally the grunts, they are grunts yes but it's the fact they get the disruptor a damage over time weapon meaning even if you kill EVERYBODY you're still good as dead if they get you low.   The jackals are.. annoying but honestly other than the fast plasma doesn't shred their shields anymore they're quite fine.   Finally the boss fights. Don't even get me started on how badly balanced those are, perfect example is Bassus, the great wall for any players who want progress. They give you a melee boss who can constantly have an insta kill lunge yet don't give you the dodge, okay. So you're saying the best way to deal with that boss is to use it's horrid AI to make it constantly jump and walk around while not being able to lunge, great a bug is the only real way to beat it that's nice.  
   An extra note is this: Enemies do too much damage. Compared to how much damage my guns pump out it feels like the enemy kicks it up a notch with the same gun. I can be running a bulldog or a plasma rifle or any gun the ai commonly use and find it does just about nothing. Then a grunt rolls up with a plasma pistol and shreds half my fully upgraded shield (75% stronger than base) it really feels like no matter how much you upgrade it the enemy damage just scales and so it doesn't matter.",1639193388,1680905654,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of its highlights is how it showcases the more human side of Master Chief, a theme that was touched upon, but not fully explored in Halo 4. It's a refreshing change of pace to see Chief's vulnerabilities and emotions as he navigates his journey. Despite some minor flaws, the Campaign offers a satisfying experience that Halo fans will appreciate & I highly recommend giving it a go on Heroic. 

Halo Infinite is a solid game that offers enjoyable gameplay with some notable improvements from its predecessor, Halo 5, such as mantling. Most of the multiplayer maps (a few UNSC maps excluded as they tend to be very bland) have a similar feel to the classic maps from Halo 3, Reach & often times CE. The art direction is the best it’s been since 343 took over, featuring pleasing visuals that do justice to the Halo universe. The soundtrack is impressive, with a score that adds to the overall experience of the game. Overall, Halo Infinite is a good addition to the series that offers a satisfying gaming experience.

8.5/10 (though I’d wait for the campaign to drop to around $30-40).

I am 6 years old, and my dad is bored out of his mind taking care of me. He wants something we can do together that's fun for both of us. So what does he do? He takes his CD ROM copy of Halo, boots it up into our family computer, and sits me on his lap. It's the first video game I ever played, and it's my favorite to this day. Halo was a heart-pounding battle for the galaxy against impossible odds. Halo Infinite is a virtual chore.

PROS:
Gameplay is stellar.
Gunplay is solid.
Grapple hook is extremely fun.
Master Chief has badass one-liners
Legendary difficulty has actual challenge. The boss fights feel like FPS dark souls.
Good visuals. One of the coolest moments in this game was when I realized the sun ""sets"" when it goes behind the ring
Multiplayer is fun
Enemy dialogue is funny

CONS
Story is a sorry excuse for a halo game. All the exciting things happen before we get to play, and then they get described to us through dialogue. Lame lame lame.
Trash dialogue. The pelican pilot and new Cortana are like cartoon characters. No depth. No nothing.
Open world gets boring fast. It truly was the death of this game. Halo has always flourished being a linear experience in new and fantastic environments. Now, we get the same green landscape and same objectives again and again. Lame lame lame.
Terrible pacing storywise. We are thrown into this mission we know nothing about, and it just feels like an excuse to get us to Zeta Halo.
Greed. We all know Halo Infinite was released so 343 could make big bucks on the multiplayer and its battle pass. It shows.
Cortana wont stop reminding you about your objective during big fights/assaults on bases. This rushes the player and ruins the open-world approach.
The UNSC marines feel like robots, which they are, but it shouldn't show.

Long version:

As a person who grew up playing HALO 1 and HALO 2, I have felt betrayed release after release ever since this 343 got their hands on the franchise. With tens of thousands of hours of multiplayer in previous games, we did not even bother with multiplayer on this one. This review is exclusively going to focus on the 59.99€ campaign.

 I've been playing split-screen/coop with my brother all my life. We bought Infinite hoping to relive old memories. We expected mediocrity, and we received exactly what we expected.
Pros:
- Graphics and engine are beautiful. The only saving grace in 343 is their engine department.
- Grapple hook is the funnest addition to the game. We had fun sling-shoting each other across the map and grappling to unintended areas to cheese some very hard fights in Legendary difficulty.
- The AI is challenging to play against. They don't simply become bullet sponges in harder difficulties. They will ex. hide when you are in line-of-sight with a precision weapon from afar. Some boss fights are creative.
- Grunt voice lines made us crack up a couple times.

Cons:
- With the millions Microsoft has poured into the franchise, I'm surprised 343 can't hire a decent writer. The plot is excruciating cringe at time. The story is spoon-fed to you in cut-scenes and in long walking simulators where data echos display Cortana-Atriox hologram conversation. The last mission is filled with a constant ""Cortana bad"" - ""Cortana not bad"" cycle of backstory exposition. The only saving grace is the character development between Chief and Weapon around mid-campaign when they struggle to trust each other.
- Expect plenty of underachieving nostalgia-baiting quotes.
- We managed to soft-lock ourselves multiple times during main missions. Don't grapple hook upwards when riding elevators or the game might not register the objective and lock doors behind you. Since checkpoints happen so frequently when you're full shield, you will likely have to restart the whole mission. Also, checkpointing can happen mid-fight when you have no ammo, and respawning in coop brings you back with the same weapons and ammo count as when you died.
- There are not epic moments such as the classic warthog run. Every ""cool"" moment will happen in a cut scene. 
- After a bunch of hours of playing, open-world objectives will become repetitive.
- A very common bug will disable swapping your equipment. Only solution is to respawn in coop or to change your controls. Resetting checkpoint will not fix it. Good luck dying on repeat because you can't use grapple hook with brutes chasing you.
- For some reason you can't set equipment to auto-use on click. If you're getting shot at, you have to: swap to your shield -> use the equipment -> swap back to grapple hook -> use equipment. I'd love the possibility to assign hotkeys (without having to use scripts like people recommend online).

Overall, wouldn't recommend buying the game campaign at full price. Even after waiting this long for coop to be added.",1680521610,1680521610,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Halo was probably the very first game I touched that also turned into my childhood. I spent countless hours on Halo: CE on both Xbox and the old PC port. I was not even apart of the lucky few who did LAN parties and had tons of laughs and beautiful memories. I spent most all of my time from Halos 1-3 playing the campaign over and over with the games never faltering to amuse me. I didn't have Xbox Live up until Halo 3 and the little I did play online was fun whilst I was a kid getting called out over voice chat... good times.

A lot of people on here seem to form the popular opinion that 343i has progressively gotten worse with the franchise. In my opinion, they were not nearly great with any of their releases since Bungie left. Halo 4 was not particularly great but I was excited to see a Halo continuation nonetheless. 

Halo 4: 
As a huge fan of the Forge feature, I was ecstatic about the expansions and overhauls Halo 4 brought. The campaign was pretty mediocre in every way. Multiplayer was alright although the progression system was pretty neat. Not Halo: Reach, but different.

Halo 5:
I spent hours having too many laughs with friends with the silly yet harmless glitches Forge had brought. The custom games browser was incredible and helped me re-experience what was like Halo: Reach customs but I did not have to invite 100 previous players to get a lobby going. Warzone introduced higher player lobby population and a new concept I fell in love with, especially the firefight version. Personally, I thought Halo 5 was quite an improvement in many ways.

Halo Wars 2:
It took me a while to adjust to just how different this was from Halo Wars 1. I loved Halo Wars 1 and after some dedicated time, I grew to enjoy HW2. I despised their Blitz game-mode. It did not fit the game at all.

Halo Infinite:
343i wiped the slate clean for the worst. Rather than reach higher and greater than before, they did almost every wrong you could think of. They really messed up with their cross-platform balancing. It was almost pointless including cross-play with how horrifically it was handled. They spent what felt like four times longer on the development on Halo Infinite compared to almost every other Halo combined. I overlooked it as they brought it on a new game engine which I thought was great. The idea of Halo finally getting a brand new engine could mean really good things and open up to so many modern possibilities. Oh... I thought SO wrong. Here's just a list of things they did that no one wanted except for the gullible few..

- Live Service
- Micro-transaction Store
- Super-inflated prices on products
- Scummy premium currency packages when compared to product prices
- Campaign sold separately from multiplayer
- An over-priced ""DLC"" that doesn't meet a $60 price tag
- The company selling out to trashy modern standards and practices
- A battle pass. HOWEVER, they did allow players to complete past seasons at any point... which is how it SHOULD BE in other games. -1 for battle pass, +1 for having a brain. Cancels out... still sucks.
- Premium battle pass
- Removing all user creativity/expression by forcing prefabricated color packages as a method to armor customization.
- Game-play and gun-play that somehow feels as if affected by censorship.

You should also know, fellow reader, that the game is basically cancelled now. Microsoft did a big wave of layoffs that affected further development of Halo Infinite and so now the game has essentially flopped, only sometimes receiving community updates. The custom engine has been taken off the board and further major updates have been terminated. That's right! That cliff hanger you are left on is NO LONGER getting a follow up. You're going to have to wait for the next new release carried by the Unreal Engine.

If you grew up with Halo as I did, I'm sorry that your favorite franchise is going to be only playable through a book at this point. 343i AND Microsoft have really killed off Halo fans. The only people who play now are Battle-pass addicts and people who are spoiled enough to buy everything in the game and refuse to put a foot down against modern day company cretins who are ruining the gaming industry. Enjoy gaming while you still can. Enjoy your favorite titles. Microsoft owns them ALL.

Some of you might be thinking, ""It's just $20 for a battle pass"" or ""the multiplayer is free."" But that's not the point. The equivalent of what we had a few years ago is now $80 plus however many more passes they decide to add. How much longer until they start splitting the campaign into paid DLCs?

Most of the complaints are for multiplayer as it deal with compatibility issues with your hardware and/or OS, online match making and mostly upset players. That being said, the online service could be much better if the game modes were more random than it is now. I don't mind playing capture the flag, domination or any other game mode, but I don't need to play the same match over and over and over...... Except for the rocket launcher and javelin game mode! Dumbest game mode EVER!!!!!!! No ones got time to play 15 minutes of rocket launchers! Be careful about the number of times you rage quit a match too as the game will ban you for too many quits. I've only been banned twice for this. First time was a five minute ban and the second was a 15 minute ban. If you get up to six bans than its 16 hours at which point you'll be either opening up a different game or turning on a movie. The last issue I have is respawn. For some weird reason, you'll respawn right next to an enemy to the point where you have no time to react to whats happening or you die right when you spawn in cause an was right behind you when you spawned back in. (Fun when it happens to someone else but annoying when it happens to you.)

Now for the campaign, some of the enemies/boss fights I feel are harder than they should be even when the game is in normal mode and some of the weapons seem nerfed to the point of asking ""Why didn't that kill him? I was right in his face and unloaded the whole clip?"" (Example: The needler use to do loads of damage when the explode in an enemy. Not anymore, very little damage and no more exploding needles. Whats the point of having this gun in the game if it sucks?) I do enjoy how this game is different from other Halo games as it is open world and skill based as most current games are now like this meaning we get to explore the halo ring more than ever before and make Master Chief more of a boss than he already is.

Only thing I wish is that they decide to bring back dual wielding from Halo 2 and return all of the original weapons from the previous games as most of the weapons they replaced them with in a word, SUCK, but that will never happen as most of the original weapons were developed by Bungie (original Halo developer) and has had nothing to do with Halo since leaving Mircosoft.

Networking issues include but are not limited to rubber banding, jitter, packet loss, a complete disconnect from matches, and being shot through objects/corners.

[h1] The Open World [/h1]

Infinite is the first Halo to feature a fully open world. Previous entries allowed players to explore maps in a linear fashion, with players having the choice to continue the story after completing a mission or to explore the surrounding areas. Halo Infinite's dev team decided to choose an open world that, in some ways, allows Halo Combat Evolved players to be somewhat nostalgic in exploring the ring. The open world, though, isn't really all that exciting as the Halo in Combat Evolved.

For one, there is a lack of variety in terms of NPC interactions, combat, and biomes themselves. Within the game, players can liberate FOBs (Forward Operating Bases), save marines captured or in combat with the Banished, and unlock new weapons and vehicles gradually. There are Fortresses players can choose to destroy as well, but outside of these side quests, there isn't exactly anything memorable or likable about the open world. An unique thing with the previous Halo games was the choice to either move on or explore the maps and learn about the lore.

With Infinite, the intrigue of the lore is replaced by a slog of chores forcing players to move all around a lengthy world that possesses no real unique structures or biomes outside of large mountains and canyons that. It's all the same grassland and mountains. There's no snow, no desert, no lengthy forests or Banished settlements outside of the forts. After the first ten or so hours, everything begins to sorta blur. Running from one FOB to another, saving marines, unlocking a Spartan core. It's all rinse and repeat. It's mind numbing. There needed to be some variety, some unique points in the world or something to allow players a mental break from running around in the same location. Great examples of these would be with the House of Reckoning and the 3 AA guns, with the House of Reckoning's interior being remarkably intriguing with the Banished training grounds against UNSC operatives. 

This is also the first Halo game to feature wildlife, but it would be hard for players to notice the wildlife. It is a purely cosmetic feature in the game that does not impact Halo Infinite whatsoever, and it's a shame. The premise that this Halo is, if not one of, the remaining Halo from the original 12 Halos the Forerunners used to wipe out the galaxy seeded with wildlife that may have gone extinct over the course of millennia passed was not utilized to the fullest extent. All you get instead are the occasional bird flocks and small rabbit-like creatures hopping around in packs, and that's if you even get to see them considering you might be busy scaling up a mountain or riding around to get to another objective.

Infinite's campaign gameplay is just same-y, all it consists of is running through Forerunner or Banished corridors that are not distinguishable from the previous level, die and hear the same Grunt or Jackal taunt you, then kill a boss before leaving. The story is good, the evolution of the Weapon and the Pilot are fun to watch, but then you just face the same level design over and over and over again. 

Halo's 2 and 3 posses maps and levels that are highly fun to play again and again. The missions within those games are iconic, Halo 2 alone had amazingly developed levels and missions, with New Mombossa and stepping in the shoes of the Arbiter. Halo 3's first couple levels in Kenya and High Charity are iconic as well. Personally, I don't really think I felt awe or amazement playing Halo Infinite like with the original Halo trilogy, if anything I just felt bored and slogged, forced to finish the game because I love Halo. 

I like the introduction to armor upgrades, I like the Banished and the Harbinger as antagonists, I like the story, but the open world makes the game suffer. There is no uniqueness or variety, the side-quests are tedious after a couple hours, and the level design just isn't as interesting as previous entries in the series. Underneath the problems is a good game with an unique take on the Halo franchise. If the game possessed varied environments instead of mountains that made the map seem larger than it actually was, and if there was a greater degree of NPC and vehicle interactivity, like calling for backup while in a firefight or having the option to call in a Scorpion or Wasp once in a while, maybe through an armor upgrade or something so the game is more balanced, then it would be a better game. What is even the point of helping marines if you don't get to utilize them? Why implement wildlife if they're just going to be purely cosmetic creatures with no impact on the game? Why create an open world if the world just looks the same with little discernible features? Is it really that hard to implement different biomes like snow, desert, volcanic, or jungle areas? 

I do like Halo Infinite, I do think it is a game worth playing for a Halo fan. It's a good game for casual players who don't care about the story but would rather just rake in kills and chill.

The game had a strong launch with a fun gameplay loop and balanced sandbox to play in

SEASON 2 (Lone Wolves):
A bit of a lack luster update with only little bits of content (Only maps and gamemodes no new weapons) and just felt drawn out because of the length of the season leaving the game at a all time low for players

THE WINTER UPDATE:
This was never a season but it was a ""major"" battlepass so it counts
the Mark V [B] armor pieces we never got in season and were advertised at the games launch were finally given to us for free at least (ex the CQB helmet)

Multiplayer would be nice if this mess of a 'game' wouldn't have had the same bugs for over a year now... or if you didn't have to wait 6 months for minor content updates... or if the very same cosmetics from previous games wouldn't be locked behind a paywall... or if some of the new weapons they added just for the sake of changing old and functioning aspects of the game weren't still hot garbage 1.5 years after release.... or if the system wouldn't prioritize the few new maps 343 managed to make in a extremely short time span of ony 4-6 months, cause you will actually forget the other maps even exist ...

Sometimes rockets will fly through the floor
Sometimes your reload animation won't display 
Sometimes you will melee your opponent and the hit won't count for 3 seconds 
Almost every encounter between 2 melee weapons will end up in either none or both players dying, even if one attacked way earlier 
At least once per day queueing will bug and you have to restart the game


Story mode would suck without the grappling hook, otherwise worse than any Halo title except Halo 4 and 5 which isn't a compliment either ...

Maps and game modes are nice and the vehicles are fun, but the new weapons are pretty boring to use and a lot of classic ones are simply not present or don't feel as satisfying as previous iterations

Infinite's customization is the most expansive Halo has to offer and the passes are worth the investment, but only if you're enjoying the game enough to play it long term. Sucks that premium passes are a thing in the first place considering MCC's progression was near perfect, but at least they don't expire like a lot of other games

Can't say much about the campaign as I'm only on the second mission, but the great core gameplay and mechanics apply to that as well so far.

Playing with a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU and AMD Radeon RX6750 XT on high settings, and with no noteworthy performance issues in the 6 or so hours I've played I can say it runs pretty well

I'd recommend it, but I'd also recommend not spending money on the campaign or any passes until you've at least tried the free multiplayer. As much as I enjoy it, I'm not going to deny that it's completely understandable that Halo fans find the game so divisive

Her decision to usurp the mantle of responsibility and rule in an imperial peace felt as though the franchise had decided more or less on a brilliant and concrete path in which unlikely heroes arose out of interesting circumstances. 

Then, the most interesting part of the game (or one of the most interesting parts i.e., the Created's conquest of the galaxy. An argument can be made that the Gravemind or the Forerunner's give Cortana a run for her money on story/lore interest.) was skipped, scuttled and disregarded. The game instead became a shitty derivative in which 117 just saves the day like an idiot. Running around shooting things. To add insult to injury, already unresolved story lines regarding other Halo antagonists were left still unaddressed. The precursors, the Flood. Where are they? Where did they come from? While the banished are interesting and I like them, the introduction of the Endless felt like the studio just wanted to introduce a new villain because they were too incompetent to resolve story lines they made without the ability to properly end a story arc.

And I'm okay with that, even if only because the original team dipped in favor of Destiny therefore leaving all future Halo titles to be kinda messy at best. I'm okay with that because I was there when Halo 4 and 5 released and tried their damnedest to be CoD clones and butcher the story, while Infinite actively tries to fix what was broken with the previous two games. And it's obviously not a perfect fix either, but it's better than its last 2 predecessors in that regard at the very least.

Most people who play this will mark this as a negative review because they only play matchmaking or spend way too much time or money on mtx when Halo has always been so much more than that. In Halo 4 and 5, matchmaking thrived while everything else suffered, but in Infinite that seems to be the opposite case. Again, not perfectly, but the game doesn't feel like a cheap CoD clone and the tools are good  when they work and there seems to be a few easy ways you can brute force them to work if you need to. The worst-case scenario with most things is ""working well enough you can usually find some way to brute force things into working if they do break (Except maybe theater)"", which let's be honest that's better than not having it work at all.

Some people also complain about the lack of gore or even blood, but quite frankly I've played the old Halo games A LOT and outside of the Flood enemies, those games weren't really super gory. You didn't see intestines and organs fly about as you fought, most of the time it was just a little blood spray from the enemy's body then some decals on the ground. And when you could gib enemies it was usually a giant bug being splattered or a limb being shot off a flood form orsomeone breaking a flood form so it couldn't get back up. There were more gore assets considered to be used in the older games, but for one reason or another they got cut and the games still sold well and are viewed with high respect. So if we're being honest, blood and gore has very little effect on this franchise when you really deep dive into it... well as far as the games go anyway...

The campaign, albeit short, is good. The forge mode, albeit a glorified devkit in this game (Meaning it's not entirely easy to work with this time), is also good. The custom games are often times good, especially since you have the option to host solo games against bots, which is always nice when internet goes out or SBMM tears you one new asshole too many. The matchmaking is like literally the only part of the game that is actually kinda painful to play because it has very few bits of forge content and there's always some chance you'll run into super-sweats or cheaters. I'll probably turn into a pariah for saying this, but would it kill you to actually try something, literally anything other than matchmaking if you're looking to enjoy this game? Like seriously, even if it's just for a break or two...

Pretty much everything that isn't the mtx or matchmaking is why I still have high regards for Infinite. When I see all of it and I look at it holistically then look at Halo 4 or 5, Infinite feels like 343's finally trying to fix what they broke and this is merely the very first baby steps towards that end goal. I'm not a shill for 343, but I want to see this through to the end if the goal is what and where I think it is, and for the first time in 10 years it looks like it is.

I don't think the core gameplay of a Halo game has ever been this fun. The amount of freedom you are provided to go about every mission is a god damn miracle compared to the boring plasma pistol-battle rife combo of other titles. The main drawback of Infinite is the open world. In other Halo's, it is back-to-back action with each single mission, with Infinite, there is a large portion of downtime and travelling before experiencing another mission or outpost. Of course this issue is not exclusive to Infinite, it plagues many open-world titles to this day.

**EDIT**

After the many hours I've put into the game I've come to realize that I was fooling myself into thinking anything but the truth: the game is fucking broken and the devs don't seem to have an interest in fixing what matters.

-STILL no co-op
-Cant assassinate (stupidest fucking decision ever imo)
-The melee and grenade sticks are not consistent at all and the timing is off.
-They RUINED my favorite game mode (BR SWAT aka ""Tactical Slayer"") by making the match start with a random weapon - After 10 matches I'll be lucky to get BR twice.
-No Griffball
-CONSTANT crashes
-Grenades often disappear after you die which prevents getting kills from the grave
-I have literally watched a grenade I stuck a player with disappear on several occasions
-Projectiles will go right through a player and cause no damage. 
-The only way to get decent cosmetics is to spend a dumb amount of actual money on something as simple as the color red.


As much as I WANT to love this game, I'm getting pretty damn close to uninstalling it


*Edit*
With the release of Season 2,  it doesn't look like they've fixed any issues at all, just regurgitated another season of BS that I can finish in 3 weeks yet is available for 6 months.  It makes me sad to be so frustrated with my favorite shooter franchise, but this game is not being executed well imo.

*Edit* 3/22/23 - The only thing 'Infinite' about this game is the amount of issues - No idea why I still play this garbage.   The game crashes over nothing and has the audacity to give me a 25 minute ban when it happens.  - I keep coming back hoping it improves but it seems to be getting worse.   - Store is overpriced - Cosmetics are weird and limited to specific armor sets (cant even equip them without the game crashing anyway) -  The weekly challenges force you to play terrible game modes and leave you with no choice but to play a mode you don't enjoy or else miss out on unlocks. - The only thing good about season 3 is the Bandit Rifle and you cant even use your old colors on it lol!  -    I honestly have grown to hate 343 as a company and wish they would pass the torch to someone, ANYONE, else.",1639698669,1679504230,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's been an influx of new content, but nothing particularly noteworthy. Cross core, a feature the player base has been clamoring for since launch, the same feature the DEVS THEMSELVES PROMISED, is still nowhere to be found and 343 has been totally silent since August 2022, so it's probably not happening now. The store started moving in the right direction with more fair prices, but that didn't last long and now it's back to straight up predatory. FOMO is still going strong. Desync is worse than ever after season 3.

As a hardcore Halo fan since 2009, skip this garbage. Halo is dead and 343 killed it.",1643369478,1679474219,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't recommend this game at all, especially on PC. People will rave about the gun play, but it's really nothing spectacular. The weapon sandbox has become incredibly dull, and the new weapon types they have added and brag about are just anti-vehicle EMP weapons, with the dynamo grenade and disruptor being the only good addition in my opinion. The shock rifle is a discount sniper rifle that can also EMP any vehicle from across the map. Speaking of maps, the selection of maps vary from horrible to alright, and there's so few of them present that it begins to feel repetitive and awful. 

This is not really a game you can enjoy in a more casual setting. You're punished for doing well, courtesy of the SBMM, and on average it doesn't matter how well or poorly I would do. I've had games with 30+ kills including playing the objective and still lose. If you're looking for that social feel, your best bet is to head to MCC, though that is another problem all in itself due to its declining player base.

The additional content they have added is pretty laughable. As of writing this on 03/22/23, we are 1 year and 4 months past Infinite's launch. We are only on Season 3, and 343 has yet to deliver on the 90 day (3 month) seasons that were initially promised.  If 343 had been consistent with their promises (spoiler alert: they rarely are), we would be past Season 5 at this point. In that 1+ year they've only managed to add a single weapon, the M392 Bandit, which just acts similar to the Halo 5 magnums. They cite a whole laundry list of reasons and excuses as for why the content has been lacking, but at the end of the day those reasons and excuses do absolutely nothing to address the issues currently in the game.

While the Forge in this game is fantastic, the custom games browser's UI is horrific. You also can't join custom games as a party, everyone needs to solo queue. 

Forge did NOT save this game as the community thought it would. 

The CGB is deserted and you'll generally find a better selection of games on the MCC CGB including a higher population there as well.

There's still desync and other issues despite what the naysayers might say. Melee not registering, the gravity hammer not working properly, and hitreg being inconsistent are some of the critical issues that still exist as of this time.

The campaign, while expansive, is quite boring. Co-op does little to remedy these issues and adds maybe another playthrough or two worth of fun at the most. The world is boring and repetitive, taking place in one location. The campaign also makes absolutely no sense, as it's another knee-jerk reaction from 343 responding to community backlash, culminating in a trilogy of mainline games that make little sense. This is also currently the only PVE activities in the game, as Firefight or Warzone Firefight have not been added.

Overall, this game looked to be so much better than it was, and 343 dropped the ball completely. Maybe in a few years if they haven't moved on to make a new mainline title (they said this game would be ten years, which also looks doubtful), the game will be in a complete enough state to warrant revisiting.

But as of right now, it is not a good game and you should not waste your time on it when there's better alternatives on the market, including MCC.",1646067607,1679472509,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Multiplayer:
Dear Lord is this the biggest disappointment of the year. The multiplayer gameplay is so good. It's probably third best in the series. The super strong SBMM and PBMM completely fuck you over in this game, all in the name of corporate greed. Everyone gets a gold medal, 1.0KD and an equal chance to get an unfriggenbelievable. It's not a true testament to a player's skill. Everyone gets the same weekly challenges, so when you get a challenge like 'Get 5 kills with the worst weapon in the game' you get two reactions. n00b: ""This seems fun!"" Anyone with a shred of skill: -12 KDA. So you have to progress through the (extremely tedious) battle pass in order to get more challenge swaps so you can get easy challenges to complete so you can upgrade the battle pass more. And if you ever hear some retard defend SBMM, just know their argument is completely invalidated by the fact that a Ranked playlist exists. Literally no point on playing Quick Play when Ranked is less sweaty and cancer-inducing. 'It's to stop you pubstomping n00bs!!!' No, it's to retain newer players by making them think they're good at the game. They don't actually get better, and when they fight people who aren't complete brainlets, they're already too invested by the game and have probably spent money on it. So if you're half decent like me and are in anything above Gold VI, get ready, because in Quick Play you're gonna have to match up against exclusively 4 stack Onyx players where everyone is a cracked psycho enraged by the fact that they haven't snorted their 5th line of cocaine for the day. You are discouraged from doing anything that isn't the meta. What's the point on using the Sentinel Beam if everyone is using a BR? 'If you really just want to chill, then chill. If you play badly then you'll go into easier lobbies.' How am I supposed to chill when I am getting perfected across the map by some kid with a Sidekick, just because I wanted to use the grapplehook in a casual manner? And when I get into easy lobbies, then what? If I play well, because God forbid I can't forget how to aim, then I'm back to playing sweats. This system will be abused by smurfs because the game is F2P. You also can't play with friends who are at a different skill level than you. If you're in Onyx and your friend is in Gold, your friend isn't gonna wanna play with you because he's going 9 and 21 even at his A game. Why can't they just have mixed lobbies with team balancing? Put in persistent lobbies and you've actually got a decent system. It's not always fun to have to sweat your balls off just so you don't get the world's worst KDA seen in a Quick Play match. I don't have fun because every match feels like an MLG tournament. And saying 'just play bad to get a lower MMR' isn't a fix. I shouldn't have to get 0 kills for 10 matches just so I can get into slightly easier lobbies where I will go 30-3 and be pushed back up into the high MMR matches. It's like the people who defend MMR aren't actually good at the game and just like having a 1.0KDR because they know they'll do worse when pitted up against the game's average player. And why do 3 stacks or 4 stacks not have the option for input restriction in Ranked? SBMM isn't a true testament to your skill because you are only going up against clones of yourself. When everyone plays like you do every single match, the game gets boring. It's so much more fun when one of the teams has a Sniper god and he's destroying people with it like he did in Reach, but you don't get that anymore. And when everyone plays against themselves, everyone gets a 1.0KDR. So the game's biggest n00b will have a similar or the same KDR as the game's biggest champion. The XP system sucks because some challenges are locked behind certain game modes and even maps, so bad luck if you're not getting the game modes you want. You don't get any XP based on how you performed, and I've heard the argument 'XP is just an illusion, you're still progressing at the same pace'. No you aren't. If I get a challenge to get 20 kills and I get 19 kills, I get no XP. 'Well get the last kill next match.' So then you get 30 kills in BTB and you get your 200 XPs worth for 20 kills. So that means you aren't rewarded for the extra 29 kills. And what if I get challenges like getting 5 kills with the Disruptor, winning Stockpile matches, capturing 10 flags, and playing Stronghold matches? Like, say I get slayer 7 times in a row? I only get 50XP every match if I've played my first 6 matches of the day. And what if I get a match with Stockpile? I'm not guaranteed to win so I get no challenge XP even if I got 10 Power Seeds secured and a +20KDA with a variety of medals. What if I get a match that doesn't have the Disruptor? Oh well, better luck next time. Then say you get a map that has the POTENTIAL to spawn the Disruptor. For whatever reason, the spawns for some (if not all) of the weapons are completely randomised. So what happens when I don't get the proper map + the proper variant + the proper game mode? Controller is OP for BR BTW, so if you're using MnK you're putting yourself at a HUGE disadvantage due to the strong aim assist. And again, there's no input matchmaking apart from solo/duo Ranked. Melee is completely broken in this game. For some inconceivable reason, meleeing an enemy knocks you back. I've seen myself, teammates and enemies melee someone, make the sound and it just doesn't do any damage. Sometimes I've been on no shields, been meleed by an enemy only to not take any damage. But it also happens in the enemy's favour sometimes. And it's also happened when teammates fight enemies in favour of either or. The servers are completely desynced and if you're wondering how you're getting shot behind walls you can thank the awful server-client relationship. One of the main problems with this game is the body types. They've swapped out male and female for 3 near-identical androgynous body types, labelled 1, 2 and 3. The only difference between them is that there is a minuscule waist size difference. Here's a list of the things we're missing:
- FFA
- Infection
- Grifball
- Juggernaut
- KotH (we got Strongholds which is just a poor man's KotH)
- Snipers
- Shotty Snipers
- Settings-specific playlists (Precision and Auto Slayer are kind of just separated by Ranked and Quick Play)
- Race
- Invasion
- 1v1
- 2v2
- Hardcore gamemodes
- Collision
- Free colour white or pink
- Magnum
- M90 Shotgun
- Firefight
- Co-op Campaign
- Colours
- Forge
- A working Theatre
- Permanent Fiesta
- Mode-specific playlists or MCC matchmaking
- Performance based experience points
- Player levels (like General or Commander from Reach)
- Persistent lobbies
- Veto
- Server browser
- Input restriction apart from solo/duo Ranked
- Playable Elites
- Samurai helmet like from the trailer
- Fun

Campaign:
[spoiler]The story is so meh. By the end of the campaign, I'm left wondering what actually happened and what half of the terminology in the game meant. But the half that I understood was pretty cool. You can't replay missions and people defend it by saying 'well it's hard to implement it in an open world game cause of valour'. First of all, GTA, AC and RDR2 have all done this and valour doesn't even work as a currency and can be adjusted for by allowing only certain things to be called in at an FOB or just let players use everything they've unlocked. Hunters are on steroids again and are still way too hard to fight when you have Thruster and Grapplehook. Seriously, they should not have lock-on, rapid fire, explosive shots. And they aren't afraid to shoot when you're right next to them. Sometimes they rush you only to shoot you instead of melee. Melee on Hunters is too fast, would've been better if they had Reach speed melee to make the Thruster better.[/spoiler]

It's okay because you've been growing and changing too and you realize you cant exactly go do all the same things you used to do. He comes over to hang out wearing SUPREME everything and talks like a generic hype-beast. Instead of talking to you he just speaks of his endeavors to get more followers and clout on Instagram and makes you watch videos about how to raise your k/d in call of duty.

You don't really care and just wanna chill and watch a sci-fi movie with him because you both really enjoyed doing that but instead he talks about his baby momma drama and wants to watch reality tv. It's not going so well but your friendship means a lot so you keep in touch.

He invites you to a party in 2015 and it looks super cool. He says we are going to watch some more Sci-Fi movies like the good ol days and all of our old friends are going to be there and go on an adventure! You get super excited and you even bite the bullet and buy an xbox one for the party. You go to the party and your friend is is now an absolute tweeker. The others at the party aren't even your old friends and they all start doing lines and shoot up drugs in the living room. They all ask for about 2-5 dollars each for ""food"" even though you already brought pizza. You reluctantly pitch in and instantly regret it and leave selling your Halo 5 Guardians Xbox one.

You tell yourself you are never going to speak to him again.

2019 comes and you hear your friend went to rehab and got clean. He looks like his old self and promises he is a changed man. The people you know are hopeful he won't relapse into the money grubbing tweeker he was before. 

2022 he is out of rehab and he looks a lot better and acts like his normal self. You're happy that you two can be friends again and start hanging out on a regular basis. He says you don't even need to bring an xbox anymore or buy a pizza to hang out and its pretty great. You begin to realize that something is off. He looks like his old self and talks like his old self but everything he says is shallow and he just sort of stares off into space sometimes. He dresses normally again but is still unkempt. He's obviously not all there and still has things to work on but you want to be supportive. You keep coming over to hang out but all he ever wants to talk about is his job in Multi-Level Marketing and NFT's. He really wants you to be a part of the Pyramid Scheme and invest in NFT's and it's obvious he doesn't have any real intention of being your friend again, he only wants to milk you for your money. 

He hasn't really done much (for like a year) and just kind of sits on the couch spaced out, barely put together. When he does say something it's about money and how you should spend it on his NFT/MLM stuff.

You really care about him, you really do. You two haven't just grown apart, he's toxic, selfish and lies. He won't work on himself unless he thinks it'll make you spend more money on him.

The campaign is good, worthwhile to play, booth solo and with friends. Nothing spectacular but a nice world to experience and if not for the story, the views and pooping some good old grunts in the head gets me halfway there. 
The multiplier is also fun and satisfying with lots of different game mods, as Halo should be. 

If you just want a casual experience and have fun with friends, booth in campaign and multiplayer. Then I recommend this big time! But this review is not about the casual experience.

Regarding the competitive scene on PC I can not recommend it. I think 343 have made a grave mistake, atleast to capture the PC side of the market, which is showing with its dying player base on Steam. As many probably already figured out, I’m talking about the aim assist and I know, I know, another rant about aim assist being OP but bare with me.

First some small backstory, I'm a big FPS player and have been playing Halo since my childhood. I have thousands of hours on my old xbox 360's (yes, several, went through quite a few of them). In my later years I've moved more to PC gaming due to all my friends switching to PC. I've sunk too many hours to even talk about in FPS's games like CS GO, Hunt showdown, Valorant etc and played in the higher ranks there. My peak in Valorant was around the top 0.01% of players.

It saddens my heart when I started to play ranked duos with my buddy that it feels so unfair to go up against controller players with aim assist so good you don't stand a chance in a close-mid range fight. I really love the feeling of the game and the game mods but I just can't accept that a FPS game should be played on a controller to have a chance of reaching the peak. Peak FPS performance is supposed to be on M&K as the skill ceiling is just that much higher. M&K gives one so much more control, which makes it more enjoyable to play (in my opinion at least). 
The same also applies to the pro scene. It just gets so much more fun to see as the pros are allowed for more rapid moments and more about raw skills and aim then just who sees each other first. The statistics are there, all the top players are controller users and have a higher accuracy then a M&K pro player ever could achieve consistently.

Now, I understand that A LOT of people want to play on controllers and I totally get it. A controller needs aim assist as switching back and forth to track a player is just not possible with a stick as it has a deadcenter in the middle. I know it is really hard to find a good balance between controller and M&K users and will never be perfect. I just think that a pro on a controller should not be able to outcompete a pro on M&K. 

A competitive scene should be on a fair playfield and not punish people using different equipment. I just want to be able to play ranked and know I got outplayed by someone because they're simply better and not just because they play on different equipment. At least let me search for rank queues that would only have M&K or only controllers. I know it might not be feasible with such a low playerbase which is a shame but I think 434 Industry only have themselves to blame.

Even IF split-screen co-operative was available, Halo Infinite does not have much for single-player or co-operative game-play. Sure, they have a full campaign, and it was great to play the first time through. However, as far as I have been able to tell, the campaign has not had any additional content since it was initially published. More over, even though I have no desire to replay the campaign in full, I have not been able to find a way to do so if I were to want to.

They managed to screw up their take on CTF-Face by providing edge cover where there shouldn't be. Similarly, we've always had sanity check on spawns. Why do I spawn between two enemies? Why do I spawn with a crosshair already pointed at me? These are things that should be a staple of the FPS by now, some of which were even pioneered by Halo. Map spawns should be weighted fairly as well. Starting one team on a large map with a Scorpion and the other team without any shock weapons OR a matching strength vehicle just sucks. 

Almost all of the unlockables are gated behind a paywall for the battle pass, and the ones that aren't are usually just there to make it easier to avoid doing challenges you don't like. Pretty lame. No more suiting up and painting your mjolnir how you want. At least not without breaking out the big spender. Basic features have been turned into a monetization model.

Constant issues with crashing, being unable to join matches, randomly hanging at black screens after loading, desync, hit registration. Melee is basically hard coded to trade. You opponent slower by a full two seconds? Sucks for you, both of you are on the ground dead. People are effectively coerced into leaving matches when they are trying to get their daily or weekly challenges done because there is no way to manually select a game type so they'd rather drop and queue again than play a game type that doesn't contribute. Half the time you don't even get backfilled bots, and when you do there's a good chance you'll never backfill with real players and it'll just be a wash. Fiesta has no balance logic to it at all. It's a party! Just kidding, the other team got 3 guys with melee weapons and 2 guys with rockets. You've got a couple of pistols. Good luck. Doesn't seem like it would be too hard to decide on close range/long range and precision/wide as main/off weapon pools and roll in those. 

Zero content additions since launch. Only planned content so far is a BR mode which just sounds like a way to attract the Fortnite/Apex gamer for some more cash grab before abandoning the game because success isn't as high as anticipated.

Map design for multiplayer is pretty mixed and there isn't any ""stand-out"" map. Thematically, the maps are intended as ""training simulator"" maps for spartans. I'm cool with that, lets them be more flexible with what they put on a map and how clean or dirty it looks. Plus it makes the weapon spawners have some ""reason"" for existing. The maps are more or less balanced with team starting - typically the two sides of a map are a mirror of one another. This is good, it ensures no team starts at a significant advantage. All of the indoor maps are sane. Recharge and Hydro are great. Good low/high gameplay and lots of cover in reasonable places and angles everywhere. Bazaar is probably my favorite map in the entire game. The layout is mirrored and power weapon spawns are positioned in a way that you have to choose what you want to go for and going for one doesn't give you an advantage over the other (recharge). Behemoth is probably the worst map in the game. I'm not sure if it was intentional or a design oversight, but there are multiple ""pockets"" around the edge of the map that have nearly 360 degree cover - with the only area out of cover being toward the outer edge of the map. Approaching someone holed in one of these locations not really viable. You basically have to try and bait their ammo out to force them to move. It feels awful.

A wishlist for multiplayer:
-More maps. Since we're ""infinite"" re-release all of the original Halo trilogy multiplayer maps. Don't force us to buy this. I know Bungie and even you used to make a killing on map packs. You've already decided to ruin the title by making everything a ""Game-as-a-Service"" model, don't push it.
-Fix spawns. Nobody like spawning to respawn counter.
-Fix fiesta weapon selection. Weight power/non-power/ranged/close weapons evenly between teams at the very least. Weight vehicle spawns between teams.
-Let us select game modes.
-Better/more free customization options. Everything being gated behind a paywall sucks. Yes, I know, ""ThE mULtiPlAyeR iS FreE"" Cool, lots of us were more than willing to pay $60 or more for a complete product including multiplayer. Some of us still paid that for the campaign. 
-Fix hit registration and desync issues - especially with melee.

TL;DR: Don't grab this for the multiplayer. Not even for free. It's a mess.

I have not finished the campaign so I cannot comment on whether or not the Campaign is worth purchasing as its own standalone product.

Update:

Now we have intermittent lag that causes your inputs to continue well past the time that you stop them and your character as well as others to ""drift"" around the screen and input delay for several seconds at a time. Nearly unplayable in this state.
For reference, I have symmetrical gigabit internet. My latency is typically 1-30ms depending on the location the game is hosted, though international games will be as high as 200ms. Games hosted locally in my area I am general 1-10ms.

Update 2:
I tried to come back again. Still not worth it. I opened the game after updating it, forced to login to Microsoft account again. Logged in. Sat spinning on transitioning indefinitely. Restarted the game. Got to the menu, but couldn't start any content, single player or otherwise. Restarted the game. Got to the menu, was able to start singleplayer stuff but multiplayer was unavailable and stuck ""transitioning"" in the upper right still. Restarted another time and was finally able to join a lobby with my friends. They were able to join the game after matchmaking, which I saw completed, the countdown finished for me and I got a message saying unable to connect to server. I restarted the game one last time and was finally able to get into a match with my friends. The keyboard input drift issue mentioned in my originally post still happens. The grappleshot still randomly will be non-functional when you pick it up so you have to drop it and pick up something else, then pick it back up to get it to work. Desync is still awful.

First of all the multiplayer - not much to say really. Its Halo MP with seasons. Its fine if you like Halo MP, nothing special overall unless Halo MP is ""Your thing"". 

The campaign is more important to me. As we PC players didn't get Infinite's prequel, there's a gap in the story which is hard to close up unless you really focus hard, and even then certain details aren't made clear until the tail end of the game. If you can get past these the story starts brilliantly and finishes fantastically. The middle is a lul if you play it the way I did (map completion) but its a genuinely touching story, and as any good story game should it will invoke strong emotions, including putting tears in my eyes at the end. A fitting instalment in the franchise. 

Overall note:

- Graphics are ""okay"" though the engine is very demanding. You'll need plenty of computing power, CPU and GPU.

- The character animations are truly superb. The cutscenes are phenomenal, facial animations and body animations alike. The voice acting is also excellent. This is how modern cutscenes should be done.

- Audio is sensational, loads of detail, great soundstaging and every explosion and impact can be felt if you've got the audio system to match the recording quality.

After completing the story I feel hooked on the franchise again, and after wiping the story-related tears from my eyes and regaining composure I find myself looking for an excuse to play more Halo.

It has some of the most enjoyable game-play in the entire series, yet it launched too early with numerous content delays and disappointing lack of core series modes and features. This review may seem negative but it's a fun game and this comes from a fan of the franchise.

I'm starting out with a multiplayer review, but a campaign review may come later.

The sandbox (at least the stuff that made it into the game) is pretty well balanced and thoroughly enjoyable to use. The problem is that it's the smallest sandbox in the series (except for maybe combat evolved, the first game from 21 years ago), and the first additional weapon (the bandit a.k.a. the DMR) has launched in an incredibly underwhelming state - 17 months after the game launched.

Searching for multiplayer games is a mixed experience. In my experience, the servers have greatly improved since launch and I rarely encounter any glaring de-sync issues or high ping anymore. The game is missing a match composer like from the master chief collection, and key franchise game modes like firefight or infection (which is rumoured to be dropping this season?) are still missing. The custom game browser surprise dropped last December ahead of its scheduled release in the road map, and custom games are a lot more stable than at launch, but it shouldn't have taken 14 months to release such a key social feature.

Player communication in the game is also strange. For text chat, there is team chat but no all chat (even in customs) and no way to contact enemy players in-game. The game lacks pre/post-game lobbies, so you can't speak to your teammates outside game-play, not that it matters as players who use the in-game voice chat are few and far between, and most of those who do use it have an open mic and just broadcast background noise.

Map-wise. the developer made maps are mostly great, there just aren't enough of them yet. Forge (the series' map editor) launched in beta at the tail end of last year and is a fantastic tool, allowing anyone to make maps and skilled users to make them developer quality. Scripting is impressive and the amount of content in the community file browser is stunning. The devs added a permanent playlist to play selected community made maps which is supposedly going to be updated with new maps.

Customising your multiplayer spartan has been a series staple since 2007 with halo 3, and it's frustrating here. Following industry trends, new armour is gained through a shop and through battle passes. The battle passes in infinite buck the trend of expiring at the end of a season and can be retroactively purchased and completed whenever. From season 2 onward, the passes also provide the player with 1000 credits, the same amount as each pass costs.
However the shop fluctuates in price with every season. 
=> The devs put content in the shop and it's incredibly overpriced
=> The player base calls out 343 for their pricing
=> 343 lowers the prices and promise they've learnt their lesson
=> New season launches and prices are stupid again

The armour core system for customisation is limiting. Different armour pieces (helmets, shoulders, chest-plates etc.) can only be used with other pieces from that core. The most frustrating thing is that colour changes are limited to specific ""coatings"" in this game - dev selected colour combos. These are also locked to a specific core. The developers promised cross-core customisation is in development back at the launch of season 2 in May 2022, and the only progression they've publicly made on that is allowing cross core visors in an update last summer. The armour core system should be scrapped, the coating system is terrible and customisation is severely limited without spending money in the store.

TL:DR, the game is fun to play but new content drops slowly. Customisation is limited by some stupid business decisions and questionable choices by team leaders who jumped ship last year. The current devs have limited resources, but the studio is now headed by the guy who saved halo mcc so the future is hopefully bright for the game",1679065866,1679065866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are clearly things such as the battle pass being the only form of multiplayer progression and the microtransactions that are inside the store. Multiplayer still has many issues affecting everyone, but are worse for those who aren't in North America. Desync is a big issue still.
Multiplayer is more fun than it used to be, however, and is now more viable to play, along with some pretty cool armor that can be gained (unfortunately) through the battle pass.

The campaign has been improved but still has major bugs. There's a big bug in the campaign that doesn't allow the checkpoint system to work correctly, sending the player farther back in the mission and bugging progression, which, as you can imagine, sucks for those playing on harder difficulties who had just beaten a hard firefight.
The campaign has flair of earlier and greater Halo titles through the enemies in the game and through some silliness. However, the open world-ness of the campaign makes it have a low replayability for people who don't speedrun.

Overall, had been an extreme disappointment to those who love Halo and to those who also had some sort of faith in Microsoft. I mean, they made the garbage that is Windows 11, so there's that. Today, Microsoft still shows their shamelessness in many ways. I would recommend checking out Mint Blitz on Youtube, as he uploads videos every day that go over the game's state and features, as well as 343 and what they're doing to fix the game.

I do not recommend Halo Infinite to those who aren't big Halo fans and I hardly recommend it to those who are.

Campaign:
The campaign itself is very fun!   While the story for me was a bit confusing my first play through, revisiting it later on has been rewarded as I spent time doing the side missions.   Very challenging!   I'm a bit disappointed that the entirety of the map looks the same throughout, but it's a solid play nonetheless.

Multiplayer:

I love the mechanics and gameplay, but it is incredibly buggy.   Random disconnects, bodys float after death, it's very odd to see!  Redundant maps and gameplay with limits on how you can interact (MCC is by far the more polished product), I wish some of these things would get addressed but at this point I've lost hope.

The abysmal decisions by 343 and absolute atrocious net code is unfathomable, even with the other games it tries to copy, it completely and utterly fails in trying to replicate that as well. I come back time after time trying to enjoy the game but no matter what I can't find any sort of enjoyment even with friends. 

You want fun? Well this game is the opposite, it's a slog of just playing the same trash modes and maps 343 force on you so you can level up their crappy battle passes which doesn't even include everything for the core armor they advertised the battle pass over. 

Gone are the days of fun party modes like infection and grifball; even Fiesta, a classic, now feels like it's forced to be competitive. I cannot go one match without everyone either focusing on only their challenges or winning and it fucking sucks. It just creates an annoying atmosphere and shows that your teammates will never be reliable. Sure you can use the excuse of ""don't assume that randoms will be gods"" but even back in older shooters like COD or stuff like Gears you can at least know that your team will actually do their part and not just go off like idiots doing useless tasks because they're told to do so to get a shiny thing. They get the shiny thing by just playing.

I don't ever believe this game will be good with the multiplayer only direction they're persistent on keeping. I wanted to like it, and I enjoyed the campaign for the most part; however, the multiplayer and management by 343 just makes me dislike it further and further. It just hurts to see it die like this being a fan since CE's release all the way back in 2001.

Overall, the customization has been downgraded from previous titles in favor of a less unique and more profitable methods. There is no normal armor unlock progression. Instead, all customization unlocks are locked behind either the battlepass or a rotating store. There are some (very minor) customization options that you can unlock via campaign collectibles. 

The most egregious change is the color sets. You can no longer choose your own arrangement of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. These are now restricted to preset arrangements called ""Armor Coatings"" and cannot be altered to give your Spartan their own, unique appearance. 

Edit on 03/12/2023: While we still don't have the ability to fully customize our Spartans with primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, the devs have made visor colors available on all armor cores. I would like to see cross-core armor elements, but I doubt that will happen as each core has its own model and I doubt it's as easy as copy/paste.

I would like to see the ability to add friends directly from the party menu or the scoreboard, the ability to use my Steam name instead of my old Xbox gamertag (Why does that still cost money to change?), cross-core color palettes, cross-core armor elements, more game-mode specific playlists, more free armor customization options, and maybe some PvPvE or co-op PvE outside of the Campaign.

Overall, Halo Infinite's multiplayer experience has improved a lot since launch. There are still some kinks to be ironed out, but they are few, far between, and far from game-breaking. The new Forge mode is vast and full of potential, but could use a simplified control scheme or even a tutorial. My friends and I revisited old custom game modes and we had a blast. Fiesta modes are crazy fun, the new Bandit DMR hits like a truck but stays in its lane as a balanced mid-range weapon. I love the Halo franchise and it looks like 343 is making a good effort to return to the old form that Halo fans know and love while bringing progress and new elements.

The game, is fun! And after several updates that added content, and even with the addition of forge, it no longer feels like an empty game.

Season 3's narrative also, seems interesting! Which is great!

Currently still, gametype options are quite limited. No option for player lives count, random weapons, etc...

Please 343, PLEASE give us an Action Sack playlist!!!!! BEGGING

Sorely missing naturally placed weapons & vehicles on the maps, everything on a rack or ground pad kinda feels.... lame?

The weapon sandbox still feels empty, the new season 3 weapon is cool and all but.. For casual fans, a new competitive weapon doesn't really satiate. Where are all the cool weapons? Fuel rod? Brute shot? Spartan Laser? Who cares if there's overlap, only competitive players care about that, and that can easily be solved but just... Not having all weapons in the same map?

I am playing this game alongside Halo:CE to compare them both together.

I think this is worst Halo I’ve ever play. If you can even called it “Halo”.

It’s more like FPS version of God of Wars 2018 with Ubisoft’s soulless open world. 

Master chief is like Joel/Kratos. He’s old and grumpy and constantly speaking with his more naive and cheerful companion. He is also as braindead as kratos. He made neutral parties that should be able to reason with enemies. Nothing would happened if he just shut his mouth.

And boss fights.. it’s either reskin generic enemy with big health bar or something right out of superhero comics that has no place in hard scifi such as Halo.

The alien are now speaking english! All these ex-zealots somehow speak like batman arkham’s thugs and there’s this harley quin ripoff constantly constantly talking when you’re in an enemy base. And they also take human prisoners even when wiping out humanity is the whole plot of this story… Because how else you’re going to unlock rebel base for fast travel Ubisoft style?

Mission locations are constrained by openworld map and that make it really bland. It’s either surface of halo or generic space ship interior. Many story mission contains repetitive tasks of destroying enemy equipment that may or may be not use as openworld tasks.

And enemy bosses are more cartoonish and childish than titanfalls 2’s Apex Legends.
It worked for titanfalls because they’re generic mercenary fighting against one generic titan pilot with their boss take care of logistics and stuff.

Here, they managed themselves. Somehow able to easily won against humanity. A race that can hold themselves against the covenant that has bigger army, more organized, fanatics, and still has full support of the elites behind them.

They are all about freedom from religion, right? then why did they still has suicide bombers?

spartan suit of this game has special abilities that can be upgrade. The suit upgrade points that are hidden everywhere in shape of loot box with dopamine-inducing gold ray and sound…. Why?

I’ve never play Halo 5 Guardian but i that game is definitely better than this game gameplay wise because that game just like Halo 4, still trying to mimic Battlefield 3/Crysis 2 which have extremely linear and diverse maps. Not as good as old big map from Bungie’s Halos but still better than this.

And xbox account DRM… you needed to log in with microsoft account to play this game.

12 plus years of utter incompetence allowed to fester by zealots of the most intoxicating degree. Back story for context. Halo was my childhood. I absolutely hated most of my child hood. A decent percentage of it was spent not feeling like a person. Halo was my escape from it. Being able to just sit down and play campaign or multiplayer with my family was some of the only fun I had during it. 343 absolutely destroyed what made it special. Everything they have done was the anti thesis of what made halo halo. 4 was a cod ripoff that somehow was worse than reach's game play loop (Fight me reach was bad and is overly praised when it was the worse of the bungie games) 5 was a hyperactive sweat focused gameplay loop with gimmicks that subtracted from the core gameplay loop for both MP and SP. Infinite is a soulless campaign and multiplayer with a game that finally has an ok gunplay loop with one of the most anti consumer forced microtransactions I have ever seen.

 Alright summary over after this is an actually in-depth explanation that attempts to tell you how they messed up and some of the core tenant of halo that I have noticed. 

I want to go more in-depth with my experience of halo because how you encounter something feeds into what you notice about it. I played CE when I was very very young at my dads house and I loved it when I wasn't really scared of the aliens and flood ( I heard an elite talking about eating me and I quit on the second level). Most of my time was spent playing local multiplayer. I stopped playing and didn't even know halo 2 was a thing (I am autistic having friends is forbidden by genetics) also didn't help that at this time was when the whole feeling not like a person was at it's worse. Then on Christmas my uncle got my family a 360 and my brother got halo 3. I still being a stupid child (I still am stupid just not a child anymore) Forgot the number 2 existed and completely accepted the terrifying split lips as being my friends despite them wanting to eat me. The flood still scared me and it took me 3 or so years to complete cortana. most of my time was spent playing multiplayer with my family.  alright back story over.


The most basic and extreme simplification of what halo was is that it's a game with good gunplay good ai and good enviroment and movement. and is what made the (modern) shooter. But that is a gross oversimplification of what made halo halo. The thing that makes a game great are all the small things that add to it's core tenants along side it's sub tenants. Halo's physics and sandbox interaction, which are hard to quantify admittedly, has been completely ignored by 343 and ruined by them when they actually notice them. While guns that are fun to shoot and all are great nothing beats the feeling of killing someone with a barrel due to physics. Being able to move stuff around and manipulate the enviroment while no where near the level of half life should be appreciated more. on tsavo highway after you do the bridge jump you enter a gate the moment you do you notice a tight group of enemies move for cover near some scenery. you throw a grenade and notice how you launched the barrels away completely ruining the cover provided and the enemies flee if you don't kill them all. later in that same level you can ram thru barricades with a wraith and completely demolish the end of the level.  You were able to destroy phantoms and they would leave debris everywhere which completely changes how you could play through a level. Bungie knew this but didn't utilize it well in making it feel natural. source when your on the ark you get a tank and the first phantom you encounter stays a while giving you a long oppurtunity to realize that you can destroy it and it does leave debris around enemy ground troops. I'm going to try and shorten this from now on. you can launch vehicles with stuff easily found in the enviroment. man cannons exist, you can redirect rockets with a gravity hammer, further more the gravity hammer exists, the brute shot in 3 imparts signifigant forces onto vehicles allowing you to launch them very easily, scarabs and phantoms leave permanent debris that you can actually use for cover, there are countless phyiscs objects that you can kill people with, entire gamemodes based on this physics interaction exist like jenga and trash compacter. 

small delve into movement In the og trilogy you could gain momentum from jumping on a slope halo 2 was most famous for sword flying and 3 allowed you to fly by melee glitching drones and portable shield launches. you can also launch yourself on crows nest with a grate and gravity hammer. my familiarity with the movement is not great due to how right it felt. you had a slight float to you that is barely noticeable but it made it feel natural and didn't detract from the game. you didn't stop the moment you stopped pressing forward. you also had grenade jumps weapon physics boosted jumps buddy jumps. you also had grav lift equipment that could be used to move enemy cover and yourself. I am going to ignore sprint because it shouldn't exist in halo. People who say you move to slow in halo don't think end of. You don't need sprint for fast movement. having good map design and flow built around base movement had always done better in halo. halo 4 and five maps compared to 2's and 3 are a good lesson in map design around movement when compared. halo reach, 4, 5, and infinite maps sacrifice flow and uniqueness due to having to compensate for increased player movement. alot of the maps are elongated and trick jumps were severely limited. 

Why 343 ruin this whenever they almost every time they mess with it. gets partially involved with movement but it's really hard if not impossible to seperate the two entirely. Halo infinite is the most egregious because it's entirely 343's fault ( halo 4 sucked but alot of the suck came from refining the bad inside of reach) you can't grenade jump, 343 took away player physics so you can no longer buddy jump or launch. one of the few actually pro movement strats was entirely removed( should leave it as an option that can be toggled) biggest offender is campaign. 343 purposely crippled speedrunning. no longer can you you fusion coil fly or skate. idk if they left it in but all I know that the average person can enjoy is grapple sliding which boosted your speed. the grapple hook is one of the only times 343 has done something smart. It's fun has weird and interesting physics quirk. it was made a main stay in campaign due to this. but in mp you don't have it like sprint. meaning they don't have to design maps around people always having the ability to scale walls and improved movement techs.

gunplay. the og trilogy had guns that had interesting uses besides killing good 343 has somewhat started to do this with infinite but their constant need to change how things work was like shooting yourself in the knee while trying to do squats.
halo has 2 damage types. plasma does more damage to shields. kinetic does more to health. most people know this. halo 1 plasma rifle slowed players down and would stun elites. plasma pistol disabled vehicles and popped shields. brute shop made vehicles do flips backwards. gravity hammer makes rockets go no u. I am not the best at breaking down how the gunplay works and I'm not going to act like I am. 343 idea of making guns have unique roles is a good thing. them insisting on removing core tenants of the sandbox isn't. removing the pump action one shot kill completely broke the energy sword as you can no longer be stopped from up close. going into very deep depth into weapon design and interaction is going to take someone who actually makes games as it's a lot harder than other things because it needs to be tweaked constantly until it feels right and you can still mess up due to bias.

Gun design was cut short due to steam character limit that apparently exists. Also cut ai. map design. mp design. open W failures",1678479494,1678479494,False,18,3,0.583112359046936035,0,True,False,False

Good gameplay, pretty solid, i feel the challenges need a little work but overall they are decent, matchmaking seems all good, would like a save function for battle videos etc.

My negatives about this game is the heavy monetization of a lot of armour related cosmetics, while this does not effect in game performance, (im happy to cop some flack here but it does scream the same monetization structure of games like fortnight, and other battlepass heavy games).

However i have high hopes about this game because 343 unlike other companies will listen to their player base.


Post play:

The campaign is lacking the consistancy that halo had in the past, cannot even splitscreen coop.

With a heavy focus on FOMO and more support for multiplayer than the campaign, I can't bring myself to continue playing this game, it is honestly the first time I have ever burnt out on a game, that isn't really buggy.

Its a grind, and for grinds I'd prefer warframe.

Talk about it negatively in public. As long as people keep playing the game and buying it, it does not matter what 343 or Microsoft does. This forum is FILLED with people who have nothing but bad things to say about Infinite, and rightfully so, but they keep playing the game.

It's not getting better. They are not going to fix it. The same bugs that existed in 2021 are still present. Campaign missions are still bugged. Getting credit for beating certain missions on legendary are literally RNG, sometimes it just takes you to the overworld at the end and forces you to fast travel. The story is worse than Halo 5. The characters are all annoying as shit. There are like 3 multiplayer modes worth playing, when the servers are actually working. Where is infection? Hit detection in multiplayer and campaign are completely broken. The open world campaign turns every mission into running errands, and doesn't even feel like Halo. They might as well have not even put vehicles into the game with all the anti vehicle bullshit. What's the point in using them when you just get merced by shock rifles from further than your computer can render the enemies? Its not like they even tried to make their open world environment vehicle friendly, the warthog flips if you so much as look at a bump in the road. Its literally faster to just grapple along the ground and abuse the momentum it gives you. Not to mention the vehicle health system is moronic. Halo 3 had a better physics engine and better destroyable vehicles ffs. Then there's the fact 343 straight up lied about splitscreen and campaign DLC. I feel like that fact alone should justify steam refunds regardless of playtime or how long it's been since you bought the game.

Remember South Park's take on how Disney was just milking the shit out of Star Wars? 'Member Han Solo? 'Member Chewbacca? Halo Infinite is literally the exact same shit but with Halo. 'Member Cortana? 'Member the second level of Halo CE? 'Member marines? 'Member fighting Elites? How the fuck are you expecting to milk a series for nostalgia when you've had it LONGER THAN THE ORIGINAL DEVS AT THIS POINT. It is absolutely embarrassing that 343 has tried to make every Halo game they have produced a soft/hard reboot of the franchise and promised ""hey, we messed up last time, but THIS ONE is actually good!"" Then, its even worse than the previous game. Every. Single. Time. It's like the entire fanbase has Stockholm syndrome. I genuinely don't know why I thought it would be different this time.

There is honestly so much wrong and broken with this game I do not see how it would be possible for 343 to finish it if they had 100 years, much less 10. There's the obvious stuff that people talk about on a daily basis here, but then there's the millions of little bugs and infuriating changes to the Halo formula that you would have to take a college course on to fully grasp how fucked it is.

I am done. I will not be giving anymore playtime to this bullshit, and neither should anyone who actually cares about halo. None of the stuff I mentioned matters to anyone at 343 and Microsoft, all they care about is active player count and quarterly revenue. Every time you log on, you are telling Microsoft that 343 did a fantastic job.

So its painfully evident now that customization will always suck. We will be forever stuck with the fortnite battlepass. want any colors on your armor besides the default choices? buy them. want any emblems or namecards? buy them. want your spartan to look similar to the way you've been customizing them for years? well actually you can't do that, because you can't mix and match armor pieces. sure you can grind for dozens of hours to get the ugly kneepads for a specific armor core you never use, but why would anybody want to do that? This all leads to incentivizing people to going to the store and spending money to buy glowing, spinning, flashing accessories that make the game look like fortnite. It's only a matter of time until you can buy the goku, naruto, and minecraft steve skins. quit spending money on this scam. seriously. it's the only way to get the devs to make an actual decent system instead of exploiting whales like every other trash game that exists nowadays. 

Edited september 2 2022. RIP to split screen campaign. More delays on core game modes. I haven't picked up the game in 4 months and i feel so let down by the state of things. It was lots of fun at first playthrough, but at this point i feel like the campaign should NOT be a full priced 60$ game. Multiplayer gave me a good time for season 1. I finished the first battlepass without paying real money. I knew guys who paid the real money and boy do they feel silly. Only updates the devs push out are more fortnite battlepasses and skeevy store updates to beg for more money from children and whales. Get outta here with that stuff. Halo as we used to know it is gone and very likely not coming back. I was in denial for so long but I've finally come to accept that fact. Gone are the days of social lobbies and enjoyable casual multiplayer. The matchmaking systems are literally designed to not let you have a fun time.  Devs have stated that halo is ""competitive"" first. After all this time and all these reviews, they are still somehow completely out of touch with the community. Just goes to show that unfortunately they do not have the love for the franchise that the fans did. They have a love for the money. Good thing they haven't completely ruined Master Chief Collection yet. ""Wake me up when you need me"".

--original review--
I've been taking my time on the campaign but i'm having a lot of fun with it. The game launched earlier than it should have i believe though. Many game types are missing from multiplayer that had been staples of halo multiplayer for years, but they are slowly adding things in as time goes on. At the time of this review there still is no forge mode either. Co op campaign hasn't been released yet. There is no experience point based leveling system right now either. The armor customization system seems completely unready however. You cannot mix and match gear pieces. you must pick an armor ""core"" that has very few customization options for each separate ""core"". You can pay real life money to acquire some extra gear pieces or armor cores but as a long time fan of halo, I feel absolutely no reason to spend money on half finished customization. If they had taken the extra time to code the game correctly the first time before release, we likely wouldn't have to deal with what feels like a skeleton of a finished halo game.


All that being said, I still very much like the game. Gunplay and movement systems feel smooth. tactical equipment has a fun variety. Big team Battle mode has seemingly been fixed recently and I've been having a good time in that mode as well. More maps would be nice. fixing the armor customization debacle would be nice. not having a paid premium battlepass would be nice too. And to top it off, there have been a surge of complaints coming from current or past 343 employees about many issues ranging from basic coding issues, to outsourcing and rushing a half finished game.

But they just cashed out and worried about the cosmetic store and providing an ""ongoing service"" (to continue to sell things). They didn't even launch with multiplayer campaign but rest assured they had *months* worth of cosmetics ready to roll out and made the shop page as invasive as possible.

Look at the Steam charts. On Month 2, they lost 50% of their player base. It hasn't hit over 5,000 average players since May 2022 and with yesterday's release of the new season? They gained an average of *95.4* players per day for a total of 3,340.4. For context? Halo 3 in the Master Chief bundle has an average of 2,970.

It's actually impressive how 343 have used the last decade to turn the name of one of gaming's most popular franchises into a series of jokes and failures. I'll still play it now and then because - as I said - the game-play feels fluid. I will just have to queue for 20 minutes and gamble if I get too upset to stick with it before a game pops.

Summary? I'm angry. I'm angry they made a game that's actually fun to play but don't care about anything but cashing out as quickly as they could and then letting it rot.

Update 2: The game is now in a pretty good state. More maps have been added and are quite good, forge and online coop campaign are finally here, and they've added a bunch of social game modes to the game. They've also fixed most of the network issues and stability problems. Progression is MUCH better with battle passes, event passes, and challenges being much easier to complete and usually within whatever mode you want. For most players this is probably way too little too late. The game should've launched like this and added on, not taken almost 2 years to get here. But at least it's finally in a decent state.




Update 1: It's now February and basically nothing has been done to fix any issues in this game. BTB was broken for MONTHS before any fix was even attempted. The challenges were adjusted slightly but are still awful, and you can't make progress in them until they're ""active"", progress on ""upcoming"" challenges means nothing. The store prices were also adjusted slightly but are still ridiculous. No new maps have been added, I believe only one new game mode was introduced but was limited to an event, the events in general are extremely underwhelming and suffer greatly at the hands of the horrible challenge system. Playlists for different slayer-type modes were finally added but nothing for objective-type game modes. 

The biggest issue is the constant netcode issues this game has, like being killed behind corners, hits not registering, and rubberbanding. These issues turn a pretty good game into a basically unplayable one, and are the main reason I stopped playing.

Releasing a ""Live Service"" game and not updating or adding ANYTHING of significance for 4 months is a very bad move, and this game is dying because of it.

The gameplay is absolutely phenomenal and the best in a Halo game since Halo 3. The sandbox is a ton of fun, there's enough maps to keep you busy in both 4v4 and Big Team, and the modes are all very good. They've already said the game will be updated with more maps and modes over time, however it remains to be seen what that includes and when it'll happen. It's also been perfectly stable for me, no crashes, no bugs, no server problems. THIS is how you launch a multiplayer game.

The battlepass/progression system is not good. There's no progression outside of the battlepass, and going through the battlepass is a grind in all the wrong ways, as it's only progressable via challenges, and the challenges are not good at all. These problems are easily fixed of course, but since the game is free-to-play no one knows if it'll actually be fixed as it's probably intended this way to encourage more spending. There is one good thing about the battlepass, that being even when the season is over you can still continue to progress it at your own pace if you've bought the premium pass. The pass has only cosmetic things in it, and although it sucks having basically all customisation locked behind a horrible progression system, it's entirely optional as far as gameplay goes.",1637559908,1678243538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Armor customization seems like it's the most detailed its ever been, when in reality they chose to have a dumb core based armor system. 
If you can even get into a match with the terrible dated servers they run this game on, you get matched with people that are trying to complete arbitrary challenges instead of playing the objective. You can't blame them though because it's the only real way to advance in the game, because of the busted band-aid that they placed on top of XP progression.
I believe that literally any developer under the Xbox Studios umbrella could shit out a better game than what 343 calls Halo nowadays. Honestly it took 10 months to get out a 3rd season and all they have to show for it is a DMR without a scope, a few new maps, and a glorified smoke grenade? 
I just don't understand where this franchise went wrong, it's slowly been turned into the turd that we call it today. Halo 4 wasn't terrible by any means, and Halo 5 had it's issues with loot boxes, but this is just a whole new low. Hardly even able to be called Halo and allowed to share the same name as the games that all brought us so much joy in the past.

I was so hyped for this game.
I'm a halo fan since 360 era and this looked to good to be true.
But tbh. it was a decent game at launch. Yes it didnt offer much and especially menus were buggy but the core game was OK (but not as good as older entries).
Though from season to season the performance worsen every time.
While in public beta the game didnt worked at all because they struggled to make it work with my GPU (980TI) 
Then on release it was OK! 
Somewhat stable 60FPS and few crashes especially in the first few rounds on a day.
But in the end the game bored me and after the half of season 1 I quit and sticked to MCC.
Though I tried the game on Season 2 again - but same result.
Now Season 3 came out and once again I wanted to try it out again - but now? This game doesnt even reach stable 30FPS

Halo's multiplayer sandbox is at full strength in Halo Infinite, with each weapon filling a unique role with minimal overlap. They also feel great to use. Hit indicators and kill confirmation have snappy and satisfying audio feedback that provide a delicious drip of serotonin. TTK is long enough to allow for the opportunity to out maneuver an attacker, but quick enough that players won't eat an entire magazine before going down.

The vehicles feel great to operate and splatter opponents with a satisfying crunch. 343 managed to strike a perfect balance with empowering players behind the wheel without leaving players on foot feeling hopelessly outgunned. This is thanks to the game's incredibly well-balanced sandbox. The charge and hitscan Spartan Laser is gone in lieu of the long range, projectile-based Skewer, which--like every gun in the game--is very satisfying to use.

Movement has also seen an update. Like classic Halos, players move fast and jump high. Crouch jumping onto narrow ledges and grenade jumping over gaps are both completely viable and practically encouraged. Sprinting is back to the dismay of some long-time fans. But its purpose is no longer to traverse large, empty areas as the speed boost it provides is very small. Instead, sprint serves to support Halo Infinite's fluid, advanced movement. Sprinting allows players to slide between cover, lowering their silhouette while maintaining speed. Clambering returns as well, making getting the high ground easier than in previous titles. 

Despite the advanced movement and balanced sandbox, the skill gap is wider than ever. Halo has never been easier to pick up and enjoy, and skillful outplays have never been so impressive. The skill floor has been lowered and the ceiling raised without sacrificing the most important element of a Halo game. Fun.

- Good graphics
- Good campaign
- Fantastic soundtrack

Cons:

- Literally everything else

I wish I was exaggerating. The multiplayer features monetized customization that charges ridiculous sums of money to customize your Spartan, even though almost literally every Halo game previous allowed you to unlock customization through playing the game. There are numerous cheaters, even in social gamemodes, thanks to the absence of an anticheat. Optimzation isn't fantastic, and the game will not run at anything approaching 60 FPS unless you have a very expensive gaming setup. The map design of most of the multiplayer maps isn't great either.

I really wanted to like this game. I have been a fan of the Halo franchise ever since I was a kid. I was sincerely hoping that 343 Industries would do something great with this game. But they haven't--and that's all there is to it. This game has been out since 2021, and in the year and a half since this has been released (even after pushing back the deadline of release, too!), there are still so many issues with it that it still feels like it's in a beta.

I sincerely hope Halo can recover from this; but I must admit my pessimism. 343 has failed to deliver in spectacular fashion, and my faith in them as a developer has completely eroded. Hopefully they will prove me wrong, and make some extremely needed changes that will bring the game back to life.

It's not the worst live service game of the last few years, but there has barely been any content delivered over the course of the first 2 years that the game has been out. Everything that's coming with next season should have been available day 1. I previously gave a positive review because I was hopeful, but the utter lack of interesting content is evident even there- all I had to say was that the game works and it's fun. It is fun, but it gets old very fast and isn't likely to ever be a complete experience.

Second review, after the game stopped crashing multiple times per day:

Missing major components to multi-player as a whole
Ohhhhh, and there was the most unhelpful progression system in multiplayer.
The seasons took forever, and there was minimal content added.... but wait!!!! Buy this armor core for $14.99......

I have no idea what happened and pretty much nothing happened in the entire story.
You're thrown out of the airlock of your ship, picked up by a pilot, you find some dead spartans, your pilot is captured, you rescue him and then you fight the final boss who does nothing except hide behind a shield whilst you attack the minions and then the boss loses it's shield. Rinse and Repeat.

Vehicles are absolutely pointless in this game, You won't drive more than 30 seconds without having to abandon your vehicle due to the god awful open world level design. Imagine the level Halo from Halo where you land on Halo and find out what the Halo in Halo is.  It's like that but instead of gentle slopes it's nothing but cliffs.

You are given a grapple hook and some other equipment to help traverse the world and once you unlock the second upgrade for the grapple hook (when the game actually lets you, I ran into several menu bugs where I couldn't access the upgrade menu, it was a dice role every time I loaded the game as to whether the menu would actually work, then you have to hope the other bug doesn't occur where you can't change your equipment at all) The second upgrade gives you a reduced cooldown on usage which allows you to scale walls infinitely,  making most of the game a case of climbing up a wall and sniping every enemy before moving on.

A new race gets introduced called The Endless and they had about 5 minutes screen time. There are humans on the ring but they don't do anything except sit in the base with their thumbs firmly up their arses.

Every character is 1 dimensional. The Pilot brings up going home every time he opens his mouth, Neo-Cortana doesn't do anything except for say 'this is easy, it'll be done in a second' and then instantly change to 'it's harder than I thought, you're going to need to go push 3 buttons'.

The game ends on a cliffhanger, I think? I honestly couldn't tell.

- a few graphical issues (at least in my experience)
- from what i've HEARD, ranked system sucks ass (i don't play ranked, its just what i've seen people say online)
- a lot, and I mean A LOT, of desync problems. 
- tick rate is pathetically low
- common, gotta buy color palettes??? REALLY??? 10 fucking USD for a color scheme that makes me look like a fucking pepsi mascot. i cant even change my AI color to red... fucking. red.
- customization is supremely mediocre. EVERYTHING, every/any armor you've seen in previous halo games are now behind a fucking paywall, a huge and expensive fucking paywall.
- events are laughable; they provide next to no incentive to complete challenges to obtain event items. The first event gave us the yoroi armor core, which is nice, however every other customization option for that armor core is locked behind expensive pay walls (i'm not sure if they're still available for purchase). the winter contingency event is mediocre, personally speaking, i couldn't care less for ANY of the cosmetics in this event.
- half the weapons can feel useless in multiplayer as they have a higher learning curve, like the ravager, pulse carbine, hydra (due to low tick rate and/or desync issues, at least in my experience), etc. 
- invisible walls between segments of the map, making it a pain to traverse in between them without aerial vehicle or progressing the story. no, not even a fully upgraded grapple shot will get you between segments. 

+ gameplay at its core is great imo.
+ great visuals overall
+ great soundtrack, really takes me back to the old days of halo.
+ i really liked the campaign, however, because this strays, and for the first time, from your usual linear type of game, the open world can feel like ubisoft open world games in terms of repetition and activity variations, however, AI is competent enough to keep you on your toes (i played on heroic an legendary) and dialogue is great, there are quite a few to give you the giggles.
+ characters have good development; not all but at leat the main ones like chief, weapon and echo-216. as for escherum...eeehhh its fine i guess?? escherum wasn't great nor bad imo, if i had to give it a numerical score, he's a 5/10 for me.
+ great voice acting

I finished the campaign in under 10 hours (main missions). And I must admit it was very fun. The sandbox and open world aspect weirdly works along with the story. It took a few hours to get used to, but eventually I fell in love. The lack of biomes is quite disappointing, but the world you are in always offers fantastic views and places to discover for me to complain too much. A few main levels can feel repetitive, but with the open levels and fun sandbox you can easily look past that (also may not help that I played all levels close together in two play sessions). 

4.5/5


Multiplayer: 
Gameplay is really fun and a nice range of weapons. Playing on both keyboard/mouse and controller feels nice, although settings with controller does need to be played around with until comfortable. Can get quite boring after a while, but with these somewhat frequent updates multiplayer is starting to shine.

But I have to give a thumbs down for the moment because the Battlepass is super grindy, customisation is lacking and progression sucks ass because of the lack of Battlepass experience gained from playing, but instead you have to do special tasks in specific game modes, and the game doesn't even have a game mode select! So you frequently get people quitting to try and get the gamemode they need, or we have to use weird ass weapons, and people frequently team kill flag carriers to get the cap (for battle pass progression).

Basically you don't get rewarded for playing to win, only playing to complete specific tasks. Therefore for the moment it's a thumbs down for me.

Gunplay, feel and overall gameplay is f*cking superb tho! Campaign is ok 6/10 the best 343 has done though. Open world sucks ass, feels like a Far Cry reskin but the closed quarter fights like in the space ships and inside the forerunner ruins feel fun. But open world sucks ass.

If you want a relative close Halo like gameplay play Destiny 2, like I am doing (it's made by Bungie and has the Halo spirit) but sadly Halo is dead. Killed by Microsoft's greed and 343's incompetence.",1637510412,1677501649,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Halo Infinite is where Halo finally went to die. This is the end of the line. The series was already on very rocky ground with Guardians and needed a MAJOR comeback to be saved. Halo Infinite was not that comeback. Not by a long shot. It lacked basic staples like forge and coop and it took 343 years to finally make these very basic things happen. It took them a year just to make Big Team Battle function properly. It is almost March of 2023 and the campaign, which was very lacking and quick to finish and clearly lended itself to expansions and DLCs, has still not been added to. 

It was a very poor decision to make Halo Infinite a Far Cry style open world base capture game. That is not something anyone ever asked for in a Halo game. The map itself is puny for what a typical Far Cry style open world base capture game should be. The standard size for a game like this should be a campaign map like the one in Ghost Recon: Wildlands. About a year ago, I calculated the true size of Infinite’s map and compared it to Wildlands' map and Wildlands' is orders of magnitude bigger and also very diverse. Infinite’s map is one big monotonous Alpine Forest with no diversity. 

It took me 55.5 hours to beat Infinite on normal, heroic, and legendary and have what fun I could with multiplayer before it got very boring considering the limited choices and lack of Big Team Battle and not having coop or even custom games (which took them 2 years to put in… another basic staple of the game that did not come with the release). By comparison, the campaign alone for Ghost Recon: Wildlands, doing all the side missions and collecting all the collectibles and just exploring and having fun, took me 105 hours. Even Subnautica 1, a purely environment exploring game, took me 51.6 hours to fully explore and exhaust. It is very, very bad when a game like Subnautica is rivaling your game in terms of content amount and games like Wildlands, which you chose to enter the arena of, is doubling the content volume. 

The fact of the matter is that the Halo series peaked from 2007-2010 with 3, ODST, and Reach. Bungie stepping down has been a disaster for the series and 343 taking the mantle of responsibility was the beginning of the end. 4 was lack luster and aesthetically didn’t even look like a Halo game, Guardians was even worse by a lot, and Infinite is just the final nail in the coffin. It’s over now. RIP the Halo franchise 2001 – 2020.

Personally, I don't care much for multiplayer FPS and especially the greedy ""loot box"" and ""pay to win"" BS that this game (and all multiplayer FPS) of course also has. However, I have loved Halo singleplayer for years, played them all. Not this game though. It's a disappointment and frankly complete trash. Here's why:

----

Too much cheating AI in this game. Enemy weapons don't overheat, infinite ammo for enemies on very limited ammo weapons, Jackel shields randomly invincible whenever your doing too well, magic teleporting enemies that spawn behind your back, I know there's always a little bit of AI cheating for ""challenge"" but 343 took the loser cheating to a new level in this game. Never see it this blatant.

This is the level of cheating:

I encountered an enemy (elite) using the exact same weapon as me (detached plasma turret). We both ran at each other firing at full power. Suddenly my weapon ""overheated"". His didn't. Entire fight my weapon overheated multiple times. His never did once. Blatantly pathetic AI cheating. 

Another section, a room with two hunters. I fired down the hallway at the two hunters. Oh no! That's too far away, the cheating trash loser AI can't actually hit me if I'm too far because I have room to dodge. So the game literally TELEPORTED MY CHARACTER TO RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HUNTERS SO I DIDN'T HAVE ROOM TO DODGE. Not even explained by any game mechanic or story. One second I'm down a hall firing into the room, next second I'm teleported into the room instantly and stuck right in front of the hunters.

Normally Jackal shields can be destroyed by going up to the them and melee slamming them. One hit, shield down. Doing too well? Killing to many Jackals? Game needs them to be more ""challenging"" after teleporting a bunch of them behind you using cheat magic? Suddenly their shields become invincible to melee. Just for 10-20 seconds or so, you won't notice, right? 

343 really took AI cheating to the next level of desperate and pathetic. Losers who can't code challenging enemies so they have the AI cheating everywhere to make it ""more difficult"".

I don't mind challenging games. What I hate is when the AI doesn't have to follow any of the rules the player does, and blatantly cheats everywhere possible for ""lolz"" or for ""cHalLeNgE"". It's like playing chess where one player gets to replace all their pawns with queens when the games starts cause ""AI needs to be challenging hurr durr derp derp"". 

Also, unrelated to AI, but lots of the weapons are completely nerfed and hopelessly underpowered compared to previous games, while newer weapons are the only ones that actually do any damage. Rocket launcher, sniper rifle, needler, most human AR's, they all completely ruined and useless. Like 343 is punishing players for using their old favorites instead of the 'new and fancy' trash they added to this game.

-- SPOILER ALERT --

Finally, I played all 20 hours of the single player campaign (so you don't have to suffer through that trash) and guess what? You NEVER find out who the ""endless"" is. Entire game I was waiting for the cool introduction of a new, crazy powerful enemy like the flood, but nope. Never happened. You get to hear about ""the endless"" the entire time, turns out they are just a garbage plot excuse to make you fight some boring, same-as-always enemies and some weird new floating alien space lady who's backstory is never explained. Honestly, I think the Halo franchise is dead.

Now lets break things down into three categories. First we'll do game play, graphics, sound, side story/open world content, the campaign story and overall score

Game Play: I would give it a solid 8/10. Could have been closer to a 9/10 with a bit more diversity among weapons. But the actual fighting was a ton of fun and truly where the game shines. The FPS is very crisp and the maneuverability abilities you gain really mesh well with the actual FPS

Graphics: So with everything running smoothly on a 3070 TI the game looks fantastic. However and a BIG however is I had to roll my graphics drivers back to Nvidia's 522.25. Any newer drivers and I was experiencing constant crashing.  Graphics I would give a solid 7/10 without crashes but with crashes a 0/10 as was unplayable. So your choice to roll back drivers or risk crashing a lot. However, the game is gorgeous and runs smoothly in the open world

Sound: The music and effects are great. Your pretty standard Halo music which has always been fantastic. Also, you can get a skull that unlocks extra enemy dialogue which can be really funny. This I will give a 8/10

Side story/open world: So this is where the game is great and also not so great. There is a lot to do in the open world and the logs you can pick up tell of individuals from either the Banished or the UNSC side and what took place on the halo ring prior to master chief landing there. A lot of pretty neat mini stories that I honestly enjoyed more than the campaign's story. But the open world gets VERY repetitive. There isn't really any diversity among the different types of open world things you can do. They basically are all the same TBH. Felt a bit lazy but so happens with mediocre open worlds sometimes. Thus I would give this a 8/10 side stories in the logs but 4/10 for so much repeat open world content. Thus we'll call this a 6/10 

The campaign story: So I'll write this without any spoilers and just overall context. The story for me from beginning to end really didn't even feel like a story. Felt more like a pity party for Cortona which is weird considering she was a genocidal maniac who in Halo 5 literally commanded giant mechas that could obliterate worlds (which she did). I guess the attempt was to try to undo the mistakes in the Halo 5 story but all it did was just make it boring. But perhaps they just want to milk it and sell DLC in the future for money. I can't see a sequel coming anytime soon. Thus I would give the campaign's story a 4/10. Keep in mind I didn't like Halo 5's story either. So if you liked Halo 5's story then you may like Halo Infinite's story more. 

Overall Score: 
- Game Play: 8/10
- Graphics 7/10
- Sound : 8/10
- Side Story Content (8/10) + Open World Content(4/10): 6/10
- Campaign Story: 4/10
- Overall Score: Roughly around a 6.5/10. If you are just looking for a fun game to play and don't mind rolling back drivers to Nvidia's 522.25 then you'll have a great time. If you are expecting for a great Halo story back to the old Flood and Covenant days then you will be highly disappointed. If you liked Halo 5 then you'll probably like Halo Infinite main story campaign",1677110324,1677124303,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
