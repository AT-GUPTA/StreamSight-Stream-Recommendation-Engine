Music quality: good
UI: Good
Artwork Quality: Good
Voice acting: Good
Story: Average at best but mostly bad.
Humor: Painful trope/cliché moments.

Against my better judgement and instincts, I went into this VN blind based on the high amount of positive reviews. I almost never go into any game blind let alone a Japanese VN, but thought it would be a nice change of pace this time around. Unfortunately, this VN's story is very boring overall with annoying ecchi/trope ""humor"" moments (which is nothing new to VN's, or Japanese anime, but that doesn't make it any less unfunny, juvenile, perverse and sometimes outright creepy) but when the story is average at best, it makes the experience so much worse than it already had to be. This is a shame, since the initial story premise and some of the lore/plot points were actually kinda interesting, but few and far between, often let down by the rest of the story and average/cliché dialogue. 

As listed above, the positive points about the game are the UI, Music, art, and voice acting which are all needed ingredients to make a VN even better, but sadly cannot make up for a at best average, but mostly garbage trope story. 

I actually played almost all routes all the way through out of genuine spite due to how irritated I was I wasted money and time on this so I could review and rant properly. Never going into a VN blind again.",1618723119,1705706790,False,4,1,0.435887962579727173,0,True,False,False

Yuzusoft definitely nailed this one after Sanoba Witch. Just looking at how happy the main heroines are in their routes just fills me with happiness.

Yoshino and Mako hold special places in my heart.

It might be because of the storyline/ending I ended up getting, which btw I am not exactly sure which choices triggered this one, but here is where some things were imho not contributing to the story and they were also not quite to my liking.

Mind you, I am in no way against romance and NSFW elements in visual novels, I even expect them to be there. 
But the part in the storyline towards the end (or so I thought) where everything was lovey-dovey over the top I love you and can't live without you was (a bit) exaggerated. So much so that I had to contain my urge to speed click through it.

And then I got to the NSFW parts.... yeah, I did speed click through those. I am not really in need of those parts being almost as long as a part of the story, and it does not add anything to the storyline. Nice to see that they are enjoying themselves, but more than 3 minutes in one go, several times throughout the storyline, of said things in a visual novel is a bit too much to my liking. 

Without spoiling too much, I got an overly detailed explanation, several times, of how good it is to make love to the one you love, how horny they are for each other etc etc. So yeah...

Still recommend it though :) The story is good, there are little to no spelling errors, and I might even check out the other storylines if I can figure out how to get to those.",1703939112,1703939112,True,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

So yeah : good graphics, decent music, and I guess that the idea of modyfying the story and plot depending on the romance is good. But the storytelling is terrible to the point I stopped caring. It's a ""visual novel"", but they forgot about the ""novel"" part.

PS : The game is still running while I'm writting this. 2 chapters have passed, nothing has evolved storywise nor i the relationship. I've never been that bored in a VN.

You're looking at 30 to 40 hours to explore all routes, 4 main characters and 2 ""side"" characters. I'd suggest Yoshino first, and Lena last. 

Best story, probably Lena. But the best girl is the ghost girl.

I've seen a lot of comments about whether SB is better or worse than Sabbat of the Witch, and honestly I put them both on par with each other. I think the story is better with Senren Banka (depending on route) while Sabbat of the Witch has better character development overall. I will say the central character (Yoshino) in SB is the weakest main route, while Sabbat of the Witch definitely focused on it's central character, Nene.

Every line has given me a great touch, as each character changes from flat to three-dimensional in their own storyline, and emotions gradually heat up. Perhaps they have only experienced a few hours in reality, but the emotions immersed in them seem like a distant world. That love is profound, pure, and beautiful beyond measure.
The side effect of resonance is the sense of loss that quietly climbs to the heart when End flashes in front of the screen.

There are points I do wish there were some more severe consequences, to make this a bit more dramatic, as you'd sort of expect from this narrative, but overall there is nothing offensive about experiencing this VN, the UI is well put together, the art is gorgeous, and the Characters are genuinely ones you want to root for, you don't feel their character growth isn't a given like a Mary-sue or atypical Shounen (for more relevant context), and they aren't magically close and in a Harem with the MC. Their relationships feel a little more natural than most VN's which was really refreshing to experience. There are some forced jokes in the beginning but overall nothing too weird, just your atypical over the top Japanese anime-comedy.

The art is gorgeous, very vibrant in colors and just pleasant to look at in general plus the little chibi edits in some scenes are cute too!

Music was always fitting for whatever event or situation the characters were in and are nice to listen to.

There are some weaknesses as with most novels but those are easily outweighted by the sheer amount of wholesome, cute and funny scenes this has to offer.

For the ""cultured"" i highly recommend installing the 18+ patch for some juice scenes.

Honestly, as much as this visual novel follows a lot of typical cliches it still finds a way to be unique with its approach, engrossing the player in a wholesome and warm experience, with the occasional fanservice every now and then. Very nice game with  lots of content, the interface and the continually changing expressions as the dialogue is read is also a very nice touch because it makes me feel even more engrossed in the story. I love the effort the developers put into this game and I will definitely be looking to buy the rest of their games haha! The soundtrack and generally written story for this game is absolutely fantastical as you can tell the ost fits the theme of the story. Not only are the chibi (or you could say manjuu) cute like artstyle a nice treat, the humor and general pacing is very nicely done. I actually got a few good chuckles. All in all, I'd very much recommend this game for those who are fine with fan service, and those who are into the premise of spirits and older japan.

I am no stranger to the name [i]Yuzusoft[/i], and certainly, this is not my first review of a game by said company either. However, among all the titles I have previously played, Senren＊Banka is the only romance visual novel that manages to catch the attention of the mainstream.

Question: What makes this game the gateway for many foreign fans to the [i]Yuzusoft[/i] brand? This is a question I aim to answer in this review.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Info[/h2]
Senren＊Banka is the 9th title developed by [i]Yuzusoft[/i] in 2016 and was later brought to Steam by [i]NekoNyan[/i] and [i]HIKARI FIELD[/i] in 2020.

[h2]Production Value[/h2]
[i]Yuzusoft[/i] never disappoints when it comes to presentation. This is especially the case for Senren＊Banka, thanks to its Japanese mythology roots. Hoori is a fictional town that is brimming with cultural integrities. ""Historical"" is the norm: from old architecture to the traditional garments, shamisen strumming in the background. It has a clear distinct identity that stands out from the rest.

Oh my, to my surprise, the music takes a step even further in nailing the theme of the game close to perfection. Words alone simply cannot describe the beauty of Hoori without mentioning the soundtrack. To further illustrate, it is a modern take on traditional Japanese music, and I highly recommend listening to it in lossless format. Of course, voice acting is superb too (if you are wondering).

[h2]Story[/h2]
Two words: poor pacing. Senren＊Banka is a game that is slow to pick up its momentum whenever necessary, fast to end its highlights for no good reason. More often than not, it severely breaks the flow of the storytelling.

For a game about Japanese folklore, the contents on display are often stretched thin to make room for more slice-of-life and comedy elements, resulting in the story lacking any conciseness in its narrative. To be clear, I do not dislike such elements being included in a visual novel (in fact, I am a big fan of it), as it helps to establish the characters, giving readers a reason to care for them. However, there exists a delicate balance in deciding when and how to incorporate these elements into the narrative. Unfortunately, Senren＊Banka struggles to find that middle ground.

On the flip side, you do get a cast of likeable characters that are, of course, carefully written to represent a certain archetype to distinguish themselves. Comedy, for the most part, is entertaining (albeit cliché) and the heroines are even more so lovable. At the very least, it hits all the right checkmarks (as a romance visual novel) with their target audience.

To summarise, if story is the least of your concerns, by all means, just go for it. Otherwise, the issues I mentioned above are carried over to the heroine routes as well. It can, at times, feel like fillers after fillers, with the story moving at a snail's pace.


[u][b]Yoshino:[/b][/u]
I don’t hate it, but I expected more. Especially, after revolving the entire plot around her in the Common route. It is a bit unfortunate that the route ultimately did not provide much closure to the main story itself.

Precisely because the Common route had already reached its conclusion, there isn't much left on the table for content. Still, I would not consider this as a bad route. Underwhelming? Maybe, but not bad. For the most part, the theme of personal growth is the centrepiece of the storytelling. It demands Yoshino to come out of her shell and face her own set of obstacles along the way.

Romance is great. I do enjoy the chemistry between Yoshino and Masaomi. It can be silly at times, due to how socially awkward Yoshino is in expressing herself. It helps to establish that romantic relationship between the two.

Of course, you do get a series of climaxes near the end, in which (finally) the main storyline has once again shown its relevance, tying in with the theme of the route.


[u][b]Murasame:[/b][/u]
One of the things I liked about this route was its heavy involvement with the other cast members. It recaptures the essence of the Common route, as an extension to the main story itself. Displaying the aftermath of the Common route in full.

Simultaneously, it also taps into Murasame's own mental fortitude as the only non-human heroine. A being who has outlived others for many generations is bound to have a backstory to tell and a fair amount of regrets to share.

If I haven't made my point clear by now, protect that smile at all cost! Especially the ending, making it all the more worthwhile. Also yes, Murasame is the best girl.


[u][b]Mako:[/b][/u]
I will say this upfront, it is a mess. Honestly, I lost count of the amount of times I wanted to give up on reading this. ""Why"" you may ask. Same deal as the criticism I mentioned before, but amplified.

Mako's route suffers the most (when compared) in terms of its pacing. Everything just feels unbearably slow, with seemingly nothing in between. Plotwise, it is also barebones at best, with zero urgency throughout.

There were some funny and heartwarming moments, but ""is it justified enough to bear with the cons"" is a question I am constantly asking myself. Just to be clear, Mako is not a bad heroine. But, the way how the game handles her character arc is just outright insulting.


[u][b]Lena:[/b][/u]
First and foremost, the game falls short in introducing Lena to the readers during the Common route. She is consistently neglected as a heroine, maintaining very little presence throughout.

Predictably, based on Steam achievements, not many have cleared her route. I wasn’t even sure what to expect either. However, as I delved deeper, it became evident that this was the spark the story desperately needed.

It offers a whole new dimension of questions to the main plot itself. Creating fresh and new story content that was not possible before. Dare I say, the final missing chapter to conclude the story. Super underrated, in my opinion. Not to mention, it also avoids over-centralising the focus to only Lena, giving others the opportunity to shine as well.

Romance, on the other hand... Masaomi, what happened to you? No matter how assertive Lena is with her approach, my guy is not able to read between the lines. For whatever reason, he became denser than a rock, and I blame the writers for that. It can, at times, feel irritating, to say the least.


[u][b]Koharu & Roka:[/b][/u]
As a side route (dateable supporting characters), the story is self-contained without overstaying its welcome. A short and enjoyable experience. Featuring both Koharu and Roka as heroines also allows for twice the romantic interaction with our main protagonist, as a contest of love.

As expected, the route ends with a choice between the two. Maybe they could, you know, make a third alternate ending... [i]wink[/i]


[h2]Verdict [u](7.5/10)[/u][/h2]
The reasons behind the numerous praises that Senren＊Banka has garnered are evident, thanks to its distinctive setting and remarkably high production value. It is a well-made product that anyone can at least appreciate. Especially when you factor in its low price and frequent discounts. Without a doubt, an easy thumbs up for my recommendation.

Game-play: ★☆☆☆☆ (Minimal)
Aesthetics: ★★★★☆ (Great)
Story: ★★★☆☆ (Decent)
Difficulty: ☆☆☆☆☆ (None)
Length: ★★★★☆ (Long)
Overall: ★★★☆☆ (Neutral)

★★★ Overview ★★★
Senren Banka is an interactive visual novel set in the fictional town of Hoori, Japan. You play as Masaomi, a late teen boy who visits the town to help his grandfather run a busy inn, and ends up getting mixed up in a local folk legend involving a magical katana, cursed spirits, and the Yoshino family's legacy of attempting to dispel the grudge that has haunted the town for hundreds of years. Through the process of dealing with the legend, the main character ends up falling in love with one of 6 different girls. 

The game is essentially broken up into two sections, the common route (chapters 1-3), and then the individual routes (chapters 4-8). The common route mostly deals with the cursed spirits harassing the town and resolving the curse. In each of the individual routes, the feel of the game changes quite a lot from an action-mystery setting, to more of a slice of life dating sim. 

★★★ Rating explanations and personal thoughts ★★★
★ Game-play: Being a visual novel there isn't really much to talk about game-play wise. Some decisions you make can affect the ending you receive, so there is at least some minor engagement, but there wasn't any particular time I felt like I recognized myself having fun. 
★ Aesthetics: The aesthetics were quite good, the art was exceptional, the voice acting was anime quality, and the sound and ambiance were appropriate. There was even a few anime-quality cut-scenes that were fully animated. 
★ Story: The story was pretty ""meh"" overall. Interesting during the common route, but each girls' individual routes were completely hit or miss. There was nothing revolutionary about the story, but it held my attention long enough to want to complete all possible routes. I hated Lena during the common route, but her individual route ended up being my favorite overall. I liked Mako and Murasame in the common route, and then disliked them more in their individual routes. It was somewhat jarring to have my opinion changed on basically every character throughout the full context of the story. 
★ Difficulty: It's a visual novel, there is no difficulty.
★ Length: It took 10 hours to finish the common route, and 10 hours to finish my first ending (Mako), so 20 hours to get to the credits once, it took 70 hours total to finish all endings. 

★ Overall: I think this is probably one of the better visual novels out there. It does everything well, but nothing in particular was mind blowing. Probably a must play for people who enjoy games like this in general, but not something I would just recommend to anyone.

The experience within is well worth the price of admission if you're looking for a good storyline in an interesting setting accented by a beautiful aesthetic, but you're going to be sorely disappointed if you come for the characters or the romance.

The common route of this piece is a full arc in its own right. It follows Arichi Masaomi as he assists the shrine maiden of Hoori, Tomotake Yoshino, and her ninja companion, Hitachi Mako, in solving the mystery of the curse casted upon Hoori and attempting to resolve it. It's a neat storyline that progresses at a good pace, then ends in a good spot before branching off into the various character routes. This part of the story is, for the most part, well done. The setting and the conflict fit together well and it's entirely believable that the solution that is used to resolve it isn't discovered before the time of the main story.

The strength of the story carries on through to the routes. Discounting the sub-routes of Roka and Koharu, the other four routes each carry a significant piece of the puzzle regarding how the curse came about and its full nature. I'm a big fan of this type of storytelling in Visual Novels since it grounds the entire story together to be a compelling whole rather than a jumbled set of individual arcs. My one complaint, which is generally a consistent one across this style, is that there is a near required order to the routes that will lessen the impact of the individual routes if you do not follow it. The generally accepted route order that I usually see is Yoshino -> Mako -> Murasame -> Lena, but I strongly believe that doing Murasame's route last is much better for the overall arc of the story, even if it doesn't have the best climax at the end. It's ultimately whichever you prefer for whichever route order you would enjoy more.

The art and music are definitely above average. The characters and set pieces are vibrant and do a great job of setting the right atmosphere for the entirety of the piece. Murasame in particular has a design that directly shows how much effort went into setting the right atmosphere for the story. The voice acting is consistently high quality as well, even among the side characters. Lena and Genjuurou are the two performances that I was particularly impressed by, since their characters felt like the most difficult to properly pull off for how well the performances were nailed. The music isn't top notch by any means, but it was clear that care went into the composition. These two together would comprise around a 7/10 in my eyes; definitely good enough to be worthy of praise, but not so good as to be memorable for months afterwards.

Finally, let's get to the worse parts of Senren * Banka.

While the setting and the story are quite good, the characters are the most glaring weak link. The main character is a jumbled mess, having a very lackluster backstory that doesn't match his personality or actions throughout the story. Each of the heroines have very generic personalities throughout the common route that range from minimal to decent characterization in their routes. Murasame's route features the most characterization of every route, while the other three primary heroines get essentially generic or minimal changes. The characters simply do not make the routes work the way you would hope in a romance story. As a plus, however, the side characters are quite well characterized, which is bizarre since it's rare for them to have a depth of personality when it doesn't feel like the primary characters do.

Speaking of romance, it's very lackluster. This is likely because the characters involved are so weak, but the romance in every single route (including the sub routes) are essentially retreads of the same thing. You're getting the same flowery generic romance story six different times with the differences coming down to the individual way the overall story affects that particular arc. It feels very forced and that they didn't even want to create a romance story in the first place, or that the developers fleshed out the overall storyline of this piece and just shoved romance in to appeal to the masses on release. 

In conclusion, Senren * Banka joins the extensive list of Visual Novels that had a lot of potential out of the gate, but simply fall short in an important way. I don't regret buying and playing through this game, and its clear that there was a lot of effort put into it, but this is an experience of driving through a beautiful landscape on a terribly maintained road. Enjoy the aesthetic and the story, but keep in mind that there is a price to pay to experience it.

[h1]The actual review[/h1]

Senren * Banka is a simplistic visual novel, with a simplistic storyline, simplistic characters and simplistic decisions. This does not make the game bad but it doesn't make it that special either. Actually, calling this game a visual novel could be misleading, because you really don't have that many options. Yes, you have different endings and routes, but it's not like other heavy visual novel titles in which you need to make a lot of decisions and explore different scenarios until you reach the end.

This could be almost cataloged as a kinetic novel. The choices are straightforward and you can get into the route of the girl you most want without any issues. For me, this is a turnoff. Altought I really hate when novels make stupid requirements for reaching X or Y ending, I also hate when it's so basic that it makes you wonder why they added them in the first place.

This VN has some good ideas like a Flowchart, saving dialogue lines & so on while also not really using them to the fullest potential. Like, why would I need a Flowchart for my decisions if they don't actually matter in the big scheme of things?

Yes, it's hard to make a branching storyline for a game this long but that does not mean you need to bait me like that. I was expecting much more when I saw just how many options you had at your disposal. However this decision makes sense when you see what the team behind Senren * Banka tried to make.

[h1]Story & Characters[/h1]

[u]Might spoil some minor details about the story.[/u]

This game is an eroge. The 'heroines' are basically models with explendid bodies and their personalities are just too pure for this world. [spoiler]All of them are virings who want to experience love, real love, and you are the one to give them that.[/spoiler] You also have your all-time favorite cliches like your childhood friend which you haven't seen for a while, your big sister, your 500 year old loli, the princess that is kind but really cold, the servant of that princess that's wife material but doesn't realize it, and your airheaded friend that just too nice to everyone.

Senren * Banka is not reinventing the wheel. Althought the story is fairly original the characters are not and you have seen someone similar somewhere else, specially if you played a lot of VNs & you consumed a lot of manga/anime. Again, this does not make the story or characters bad, but rather expected. It's not boring but you get what you see. They will fall for you the same way you expect.

Don't forget this is an eroge. The MC will sometimes have the luck of Rito from To LOVE-Ru. All the tropes from that series are going to happen in some way or another. This does not make the game less wholesome tho. Even if characters have sexual desires they are kept in check while somewhat still being wholesome. They tend to find their own sexuality and desires in such a pure way that it seems wrong seeing them do it tbh.

[spoiler]This game has no drama at all, no love-triangles, no actual fights between characters. I was expecting some kind of drama but I did not find it here.[/spoiler]

[h1]Gameplay & Settings[/h1]

As stated before, this game is far closer to a kinetic novel than an actual visual novel with branching stories. You have decision making but its more like ""hey you want to end with girl A or girl B?"". Moreover, I think you have a bigger number of decisions in the H! scenes than the others. Those scenes are kinda pointless and if you don't have the R18 patch I think you can't see them. Yes, the game has a patch but to be completely honest I ended up skipping all those H! scenes because I felt bad watching them. For context, I played ""Monster Girl Club Bifrost"" patched without any issue. The problem for me here is that is like I was watching two lovers have sex, like it's something I shouldn't be seeing.

The game has some nice features. You have a ""panic button"" that changes whatever you are seeing in game for a photo of your liking, for the folks that don't have any privacy. You also have a lot of options in the configuration menu. I'm a fan of configuration options. I like games to be as configurable as possible. Sometimes is hard for developers to implement these kind of features, but that's mainly because of desing and not because they are actually hard to implement.

You can set the voice of all characters, you can hide some UI elements, you can even change the text size, font and color. The only thing really lacking is the auto-mode because it works like ass, maybe because no one uses it (apart from me T . T). The auto-mode will NOT take into consideration long texts so you will eventually need to pause the game and go back.

There aren't that many effects in the game. Other VNs will play a lot more with the text box. Senren * Banka text box in comparison is too simplistic. This is a minor nit-pick but, for VNs, using the text box in creative ways is a plus and it always amazes me when some developer is creative with it. Just think of Doki Doki Literature Club!. Heck, this VN cant even make pauses between the same text box dialogue so you kinda get spoiled on what the character is going to say next.

[h1]Music & Voice Acting[/h1]

Senren * Banka has actual voice acting for all characters except the MC. That's really cool. Sometimes I find myself waiting for the voice line to finish before pressing space, because I actually want to hear the VA say something silly.

And the music is alright. I have the main theme stuck in my head but that's about it. I'll certainly forget it after a few weeks.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Overall[/h1]

This is a nice, wholesome game, at least for Japanese media standards. Yes, there is ecchi and xxx scenes, but it's still between two loving and consenting adults. This is not a porn game or some fap material, it's just a wholesome story. Yes, it has a lot of cliches and thropes, and yes the characters are unrealistic and just too pure, kinda shallow, but that's actually what they were trying to achieve with this.

Sometimes reading a VN like this is just fine. Ofc I would be bored if all VNs were like this, so maybe I won't play anything from this game-studio ever again, but that does not mean this is a bad game.

Just check it out. If you are still bored after the common route is completed (from 4-8 hours) then it's probably not for you.

This game crashed so many times on me, it was always when a video was going to start and i would literally have to spam save all the up to before the video and then just keep reloading the game until it decided to play and not crash, I am talking 5-10 attempts. Multiply this with 6 stories and it was frustrating and took the impact out of the end of the stories when it would fade to credit and then crash to desktop. Nothing in the forums about it so maybe it was just my PC.

 As for the story. It's hit and miss. The common route sets up a excellent story which Murasame's route wraps up great, and just rating the story based off what I considered to be cannon and the story is a solid 9 and should be read for her route alone. 

But the issue is I knew Murasame was the cannon story so I did her route last (As should you.) The other stories I can't be super nice with. Senren Banka is a painfully slow read and when 3 routes are pretty much the same from a different perspective, one route is unique but splits into the worst route, the slow read really shows it's head.  This story just takes it sweet time getting anywhere, so when you're reading a scene that is similar, but different to another route, it's easy to start glazing over. 

I don't want to ruin anything so I am going to just rate each route in the order that I did them.

Mako (7.5) - Started strong with a good personal conflict but it was easily and quickly gotten over and turned into probably the most sexual story? But at the same it's actually pretty funny what goes on in it. The story gives you a follow up to the history. It worked for me as a first route, but it would had been better as a second route since the lore was more about ""motivation,"" while Lena's was about the straight scoop. But Mako was the girl I wanted to date first. Who doesn't want a pervy hot Ninja that reads manga?

Lena (8) - Probably the best route next to Murasame, I liked Lena, she was funny and this route is a huge context dump, it explains the entire history. (I recommend this as the first route) and honestly I felt this had the 2nd best ending behind Murasame.

Roka/Koharu - This is where the slow pacing starts to take it's toll, neither of these girls have shit to do with the main story and were not in the common route very often so this route turns everything into a completely new story. These stories are 100% slice of life and ditches the supernatural element.

Roka (8) - I really enjoyed the change of pace and her story was excellent. Nothing was recycled and it was a nice read. 

Koharu (1) - Why? Why the hell was this a option? Was this a crowdfunding milestone or something? Not only does this route choice happen in the MIDDLE of Roka's story and it ditches it all together. it is the most eye rolling, boring ass story. I almost wrote a negative review after wrapping this route up.  [spoiler] She is the MC cousin, they are having sex and want to date, will the MC's family and friends approve of this? [/spoiler] <--- Yes that one black mark is the entire story, that's how dumb it is. The only saving grace is it's short, because of course it is. Koharu is literally for people who want a loli H-scene.

Yoshino (7.5) Ok we are back to the main story. I was expecting a little more from Yoshino, but since Mako and Lena gives the context dump there isn't much new addition to the lore. But Yoshino is so damn cute so i didn't mind. Her personal story and conflicts felt the most fleshed out, right behind Murasame.

Murasame (9) The cannon story as I mentioned. Also the longest. I won't say anything else.

The music and acting is really good, the backgrounds are nice and the models are a little basic but good enough.

OK, let's talk H-scenes. I actually don't really like H-scenes in these kind of stories, I do add the patch and the entire time a H-scene plays I sit there debating if I should just uninstall it as I put on headphones and try to speed up the conversation while making sure not to miss any important character development. Overall I feel they just threw them in last minute, because it becomes predictable when one was about to happen.  But don't listen to me on H-scenes since I am biased, I feel they cheapen a good romance and it's hard to hear the MC talk all lovey dubby after giving a girl a facial after she performed oral sex in a public space. Don't ask me why I always install the patches, I just do. 

This was story definitely not on the same level a Kinkoi: Golden Loveriche which just had more interesting story routes and much better character art (Subjective) but this story is worth it for Murasame's route alone

I recommend this. But unless you want all the achievements, skip Koharu and expect a super slow read, take breaks. I am a moderate to slow reader that turns auto read to about 45% speed.",1680765108,1680767171,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been trying to expose myself to these titles for quite some time now to understand the appeal behind them since I enjoy exploring various gaming categories. As of the time of this review, I've come to understand a lot more so it's only fitting I place my impression in this review. 

First and foremost, Yuzusoft is amazing and they deserve all the love that they get with their games. I've tried penetrating the VN genre with surface recommendations from web searches and a lot of them are plagued with bad hardware support and modern features that games from other genres have been using for years. 
I'm really impressed at the progress the studio have made with the development of their game engine. The interface is clean, software has zero performance hiccups, key binds are convenient, and accessibility features are there. You can also see them constantly improving the experience with their newer titles. 

On top of that, all of the dialogues are fully voiced and the art is phenomenal in seemingly all of their games. With all that said, the only thing left to discuss is the narrative. 

At first, I thought that the narrative for Senren Banka is a little lackluster. It's not bad but it's also nothing noteworthy. I mostly found the long aimless slice-of-life sections in the game to be boring. I thought it was out of place and wasted a lot of my time. 
However, later I realized that it's a deliberate decision by the writer. The appeal of these games, and why they work, is the parasocial relationship that they provide. They need to prioritize the experience you have with the character you chose in your route. That way, the NSFW sections are more compelling. I used to generalize the VNs in one category but it seems like their lewd/dating iterations should be judged entirely different.

With that in mind, I would say Senren Banka has a very good narrative. I found the legends behind Hoori to be intriguing and I enjoyed all of the little plot points they have made in conjunction to it. While I would've enjoyed it if they had a stronger narrative to surround the world building they have, balancing it alongside the slice-of-life sections would result into a longer game which would not really be ideal.

I highly recommend this game for people getting into the eroges.",1680091192,1680091192,True,3,0,0.565056324005126953,0,True,False,False

[quote][i]I'm not really sure if I should give positive or negative review. There's no option for in-between.[/i][/quote]

Senren Banka is an amazing VN, after playing Sanobawitch a few years ago I instantly bought this on its launch day. And yes, the story is amazing, although at the time I writing this review (2023-03-03) I have only play 3 out of 4 main route (Mako, Murasame & Lena), and side stories haven't been touched.
You know I'm glad the title is translated by NekoNyan instead of SP. But I have set my expectation way too high, while the translation is not as fully cringe as SP, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. I drop this a few times, and then back playing it again, over and over again. I'm not sure if I want to continue the rest of the story because of the translation. It's that kind of feeling where I'm still curious about story and I want to see it more and play it again and then when I see the translation, ugh, I can't, I wish I could forget what I see. Yes I am that kind of guy who picky about translation. There was times when I use Textractor and machine-translate it myself directly from Japanese text, but it's not really convenient and it crash or failed sometimes.

So what make me hate the translation?
[list][*]The first one is, SP style when joke/wordplay ""converted"" (not translated) into western joke. VN are niche game, hardly any normies play this, no need to change Japanese joke or meme into what they think as a western equivalent of the joke, pretty sure majority of the player already understand and familiar with Japanese joke & meme anyway. For example ""Chotto matta!"" translated to ""Stop right there criminal scum!"". That's cringe. Also everyone already know who it is, no one force you to translate ""Roboneko"" as ""Doraemon"". And there are more stuff like that.
[*]And the second one is inconsistency, a lot of it. For example 竹刀 doesn't even have consistent translation as sometimes translated as ""bamboo sword"", ""wooden sword"", and sometimes simply as ""shinai"". And the second one is much more important because it's a character name: 白狛, where in name section it's translated as ""White Komainu"", but in dialogue it's ""Shirokoma"". If you have good memory, actually listen to dialogue and read the text, you will notice more things like this.[/list]

But other than that, there are also good things that I like from NN translation:
[list][*]Original Japanese name order, they are still ""FamilyName GivenName"".
[*]Original honorific included, they still write -chan, -san, etc. at almost all of them.
[*]Using original measurement, they didn't convert it into feet when the dialogue mention it in meter, and also still translating floor originally but with added explanation instead of straight convert it into meter/feet.[/list]
Although I have mixed feeling about their choice to leave the princess title not translated.


So what's my opinion about this game?
Game & story: ★★★★★ (only 3 out 4 routes finished so far)
Translation: ★★☆☆☆

I gotta say that I like the production quality: The UI is great, art is well-made, soundtrack fits well, the voice acting is almost flawless and translation is perfect. It all just looks and feels good. The free and easy to add extra content patch is also nice. At first everything about this VN looks really good.

But there are a few flaws that are worth mentioning. For example, the story. It all seems promising at first. The town of Hoori feels alive and it's traditions play a big part in the story. And up to individual girl paths there isn't a lot to nitpick. However it's only a small part of the story and only makes up like 20% at most and everything after that slowly goes downhill. The first individual route might seem nice, they have a decent plot to them, but every route shares a lot in common. Some events (like canceling an important engagement) definitely happens in at least 4 of the routes, but is only really described in detail in a single one. Not really a bad thing but it is an example of big similarities in the different routes. After some time you start to make connections and after some more time you can kinda guess when major plot twits are gonna happen. And some routes are clearly better. For example Hitachi's route had her own special scenes in the main route and an unexpected story, a big existential struggle, a hobby (something that other girls lacked), an interesting personality, the best h-scenes, and the most interesting story. And it's not a biased opinion, it's fact. Instead like how it is in other story rich VNs, here every ending felt weaker that the previous one. And there wasn't a true ending! I understand that it might be hard to to connect the 7 (or 8) different routes, but not having a final ending just leaves an unpleasant aftertaste you get from the last remaining bad and boring endings. Finishing the last route didn't even give a sense of accomplishment or anything. Oh and the After stories that take place some time after the main story finished. Like 2 or 3 of them really feel needed and in reality all of em are just additional h-scenes. And I gotta say those scenes are kinda lame. Lame as in too vanilla. Out of 20+ scenes that are in the novel, all of it is either a titjob, blowjob or just vanilla action (besides that one foot job with Yoshino). It all is just aimed for the general audience and as a result it's not special. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I had played it as an absolute visual novel beginner.

It suffers from what they all do. Several routes that are all extremely similar, except when it comes to quality. One route clearly shines above all the others and a couple felt very rushed. They should've just stuck to the one well written character route and invested more into it and made that the entire VN. The routes are all full of cliches and tropes. 

The WORST part is how incredibly vanilla the H scenes are. No animations, all oral and standard penetration, and only 2 additions of flavor (golden nectar and an employed foot) in ONE of the character routes. These VNs are written to have mass appeal I guess, but I got bored so I skipped all but a few scenes. Surely anyone could skip something they don't like.

Now why do I recommend it despite my shade? Well the issue is mostly fatigue from several titles. There are many VNs (some without any adult stuff at all) that are truly well written, interesting, funny, niche/fetish, and/or explore something fascinating (STEINS:GATE, Doki Doki Lit. Club, Fata Morgana, Atri, Iwaihime, and even Nekopara, etc.).Senren Banka is not quite their pace or niche, it is mostly normal people doing normal things (with a supernatural twist to give them something to do other than eat pudding).

If this was my first slice of life/action/romcom VN, the tropes/cliches would be more endearing, the vanilla H would be hotter, and the samey routes would feel fresher and more distinct. There is certainly enough humor, quality writing, and art to warrant enjoying.

The setting is comfy, you can fully enjoy the plot only if you complete all the routes, flowchart is something that every single VN should have, along with the option to display both English and Japanese scripts at the same time (useful for those who want to learn japanese or check if the translation is actually accurate), the designs are peak Yuzusoft and just about everything is well made. 
As for the routes, they are all enjoyable, but Murasame is hands down the best route in this game and I dare to even say of all Yuzu games up to that point. And I ain't even a fan of lolis. Sometimes a man doesn't want to be horny, just want to be happy with his cute loli ghost sword.",1675105528,1675105528,True,8,1,0.623931586742401123,0,True,False,False

First of all: General information:

[list] 
[*] I bought this game on sale for 18 Euro
[*] the art gallery appears after finishing the first route.
[*] there are 6 different routes to read
[*] you can save spoken sentences, what i absolutly love
[*] there are alot of shortcuts you can use with your mouse (such as lmb and turn mouse to left and I get directly to the saves)
[*] Patch? [spoiler] There is one. [/spoiler] 
[*] the Common-route was 15hrs long (as a slow reader)
[*] I finished all Routes, if you are interested in the lenght of each Route(as a slow reader): 
Lena: [spoiler] 13hrs long [/spoiler]
Mako: [spoiler] 11hrs long [/spoiler]
Yoshino: [spoiler] 12hrs long [/spoiler]
Murasame: [spoiler] 14hrs long [/spoiler]
Koharu und Roka (both with there ""common route""): [spoiler] 9hrs long [/spoiler]
[/list]



Seccondly: information I just want to share with you: 
[olist] 
[*] there are alot of animations in this game (small ones, like beads of sweat drip down), thanks to that the VN gets more alive 
[*] this game have alot of mimics that are shown on the characters (there was in one sentence five different mimics to give you a feeling for it)
[*] It actually appears, that, if you are in a big bath, the voice gets echo, a nice gimmick
[*] also a nice gimmick is, that, depending on daytime, the Person is brighter or darker
[*] the music was always on top and it never felt off
[*] also, the music have nice little details/the atmosphere is well done, such as bird chirping in the forest 
[/olist]



[b] My personal thoughts (so far) [/b]

Without spoilering the story:

Hoori, where the story takes place, is a tourist-hotspot with his nice Onsens, but it is feared by the villages around it, as it appears, that Hoori got cursed 500yrs ago. Masaomi, who have to help his grandpa with his inn, is going to Hoori and finds out about the curse and as luck have it way, he may is part of the solution to lift this curse. 
Buy this VN to meet Masaomi, Lena, Yoshino, Mako, Murasame, Koharu&Rentarou and Roka, as well as Genjuurou, Yasuharu and Komagawa-sensei.


So I finished all routes and was highly nervous, after reading in some forums, that starting with Lena I spoil all other routes, i nethertheless started with hers. 

My List of order looked like this: Lena, Koharu, Roka, Mako, Yoshino and Murasame. 
I didn't had the feeling I got much spoilers, I would still recommend, because Lena is the closest to the full truth about the curse and the story around it, that you may read her next to last. But you can actually read her whenever you want. Atleast I didn't was spoiled much. The routes i felt was close to each other was Mako and Lena. That was a bit disturbing to read and Lenas route also includes information about Murasames-route. 


Personaly, If you want my recommendation, in which order to read the Visual Novel, I would definitly see Murasames-route as last.
Koharu and Roka are both not part of the story or the curse, so you can read them in between. 
Mako and Yoshino have no overlap. 
In the end just follow the routes, you want them to read. 
I'm happy with mine.


[b][i] So thanks alot, Yuzusoft for the game and Good Job!
The whole cast and staff did a great job with the Characters, Story and Music!
the synchronisation was well done and the translation was very good!
As a non-native-english speaker I could understand all and follow the story.
Thank you for the localisation in english and the publiziation in the western world[/i][/b]

[h1]Story[/h1]
In the deep parts of the mountains lies a small village called [b]Hoori[/b], a remote village with no train stops. Thanks to this isolation, the village has resisted the spread of civilization, giving it a rustic charm, and is also home to hot springs. This has led it to be a very famous tourist destination for people to travel to, but its most famous attraction is the divine blade [b]Murasamemaru[/b]. This blade has been stuck in a stone though and so far, no one has ever been able to pull it out.

[b]Arichi Masaomi[/b] is visiting the village to help his grandfather run a hotel he manages, and he happens to try and pull the blade out, which he successfully does. At the cost of breaking the blade and now, he must make amends for what he has done. How may you ask? Well by marrying the village’s shrine maiden of course. This is only the start for [b]Arichi[/b], as he has to come to terms with everything that is happening at this time, his time at [b]Hoori[/b], will certainly be a wild ride.

Although that is not all that is there in [b]Hoori[/b] village, as on some nights, demons will come out into the forest thanks to the [b]Tomotake[/b] curse. [b]Yoshino Tomotake[/b] and [b]Mako Hitachi[/b] must purify the demons when they come out to subdue the curse as a whole. The two tell [b]Masaomi[/b] to sit it out but he does not want that and decides to help out and get stronger as a whole. Thanks to his grandpa [b]Kurama Genjuurou[/b] running a dojo, he can get stronger and help fight demons with the help of the sword [b]Murasame[/b], who happens to have a green-haired ghost attached to it that is afraid of other ghosts despite being one herself.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]Interesting story with plenty of fun characters
[*]Five different routes with seven unique endings
[*]Wonderful music that is very pleasing to listen to
[*]Beautiful art style that makes each area full of life and shines
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]Masaomi is generic and lacks character development
[*]Some of the fan service content is a little unnecessary
[*]The pace of the story can be a bit slow at times
[/list]

[h1]Characters[/h1]
[b]Senran Banka[/b] has a wonderful cast of characters, and the story is interesting to boot as well. One of my favorite aspects is the whole mythological aspects of the story. I wish it was explored more throughout the story, as I think it would have been a neat idea as a whole to explore. Although when it is talked about, that's when I get very invested in the story, with a unique premise and with it even having its own history felt very [b]Japanese Mythology[/b] like. [b]Senran Banka[/b] is spread apart into two sections for its story, the first one is where you are dealing with and exploring the mythological aspect that it has. The other part is the character development for the route you have chosen to do.

There are a total of five different routes for you to experience, with seven different endings and scenarios. I chose the [b]Mako[/b] route as [b]Mako[/b] was a ninja and ninjas are cool~. I enjoyed her personality the most out of all the characters. She helps the [b]Tomotake[/b] family out with the housework and the hunting of demons on certain nights. The other character that I liked was [b]Roka Maniwa[/b], she runs a sweet shop and I actually think she is the best-designed character besides [b]Mako[/b]. If it were not for [b]Mako[/b], I probably would have chosen [b]Roka's[/b] route, although I do wish she had more screen time as a whole and maybe played a larger role in the story.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2905036817
Just a note, there is also an option for you to date your cousin, but you can easily avoid that route if this sort of thing bothers you.

Now, with all that positivity, comes a few issues that [b]Senran Banka[/b] suffers from, and while it does not hold it back, they are still worth noting. [b]Masaomi[/b] plays out like a typically unlikeable main character with no personality. I do not like him, period, he is bland, boring, and just unlikeable. Since this is a dialog-heavy visual novel, this is a huge problem, as you want to make the main character at least likable as a whole.

The next issue I have is a combination of two issues. The fan service on occasion can be a little unnecessary in the story, even though I understand the use in some situations to better showcase certain aspects of specific characters. Now, this is fine on certain occasions, however, there are ways for you to make a character likable without a fan service scene. I did not like [b]Mako[/b] because of the fan service stuff, I liked [b]Mako[/b] because she was a Ninja and had the most interesting personality out of the bunch.

Since there is a little too much fanservice at times, this also slows the pacing down as well and it can be a bit of a slog to get through. I also hate the stereotype trope of every female character thinking that the MC is a pervert when he is really not. While [b]Senran Banka[/b] does not have all the typical anime tropes that are out there, it does have a few of them, that being, the worst ones imaginable.

[h1]Artstyle/Music[/h1]
The art style used in [b]Senran Banka[/b] is honesty really beautiful and very colorful in its areas shown. Each area is full of life and is very detailed, the character sprites are also very well done and definitely fit the art style that the visual novel was going for. I even like the designs that the demons had as well, they felt very mysterious while having a threatening charm to them that I liked.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2905036875
I'll take a moment to talk a bit about the music, as it’s definitely well done and deserving of its praise. The voice acting has to be another thing worth mentioning as I liked all the voices that the visual novel had to offer, there was never a voice I hated.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
I tested this VN on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I experienced no issues while I was playing, and it should be able to run on any computer.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
All in All, [b]Senran Banka[/b] is a visual novel worth your time and attention if you enjoy the slice-of-life type of stuff. It has a total of 50+ hours in terms of content, so if you are someone who likes to explore all possible situations, then I recommend this visual novel at full price. Although if you only plan to play this visual novel once, then you are better off getting it on sale, as 39.99 is definitely a steep price to pay for a 12-hour experience.

[b]Story[/b]

☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Fair
☐ Nonexistent

For my part, the story is really captivating, we feel well the universe and the Japanese tradition through Senren Banka even if all the elements of the story are fictional as for example the city ""Hoori"". Who says Visual Novel, says multiple possible choices after the common story. In this game, 6 different routes bring us a lot of perceptives on the course of the adventure of our hero. Of course, it is possible to do the routes in the order, it will not change the way you perceive the game, the choice will be made according to your attraction on each heroine of the game. But you have to keep in mind that some roads will seem less interesting than others, despite that, I still advise you to do them all, you will have a global vision of the game! 

A little advice to unlock all the routes, if you are like me who has the laziness to look for them all, a small Google search and hop, it's settled! :)


[b]Audio (OST...)[/b]

☑ Excellent
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Bad
☐ Unpleasant

I was really won over by the opening music, it was this music that drove me to play this Visual Novel. Overall, I thought the OSTs reflected the environment of the story very well. 


[b]Translation[/b]

☐ Not translated *not yet*
☐ Disappointing
☐ Quite a few mistakes
☑ Nickel
☐ Translated into all languages

For French speakers looking for a Visual Novel in French, it's not going to be that easy... On the other hand if you have an intermediate level of English, you can enjoy this game to the fullest, it offers English that is not too difficult to understand! If you know Chinese or Japanese, it's even better! 


[b]Price[/b]

☐ Free
☐ Well worth it
☑ Normal ""quality""/price ratio
☑ To buy on sale
☐ Way too expensive for what it is

Its normal price is 29,99€, I bought it at 19,19€, about 10€ less. I think the normal price is a bit high, that's why I waited for a promotion before enjoying Senren Banka. At the moment, all Yuzusoft's VNs are about this price, it's understandable, since the company buys the license and takes care of the translation and development of the system to implement their translation. 


[b]Lifetime[/b]

☐ Very long (+100h)
☑ Long (40-100h)
☐ Medium (25-40h)
☐ Short (8-25h)
☐ Very short (0-8h)

On my end, I was able to unlock all the routes and achievements in the game for a total of 50h of play. This seems pretty long to me for a Visual Novel, it will depend on how fast you read. 


[b]Audience[/b]

☐ Children
☑ Teenagers
☑ Adults

This game is basically an Eroge, the developers decided to remove the erotic scenes to target a wider audience on Steam, however the +18 version is available for free on the NekoNyan website for those who want the original version of the game.


[b]Config required[/b]

☐ Very low config
☑ Low-end / entry-level mid-range PC
☐ Mid-range PC / high-end entry
☐ High end PC
☐ NASA PC

Almost all Visual Novels do not require a graphics card to run the game, a processor is more than enough, however let's not exaggerate, 2000s PCs are not going to run the game...


[h1][u]Conclusion[/u][/h1]

[h1]Introduction[/h1]

The game starts with a main common route. Once it ends, you can choose to finish the game on the route of one of the four main girls, or Roka/Koharu's common route (locked on first playthrough). If you choose to go down Roka/Koharu's common route, once this ends, you can choose once again to go down Roka or Koharu's specific routes. The length of the main common route is around 10 hours, with each route of the main girl taking another 10 hours. Roka and Koharu's common route takes around 6 hours, and their specific route each take around 3 hours.

[u][h1] General review [/h1][/u]
[h1] Story and script-writing [/h1]

The visual novel intertwines advancing the main storyline whilst promoting the relationship between the MC and the girl. Excellent pacing and content keeps you gripped on the main storyline whilst also keeping your heart throbbing for the interactions between the characters. The script-writing fully captures the charms of the character, and makes each scene feel vibrant and cohesive. It does an especially good job of capturing one of Yuzusoft's best qualities in their VNs: making the girls feel clingy. What I mean by this is that you can really see and feel how the girl falls more and more in love with the MC, with exceptional scenes and scripts along each step of their developing feelings.

[h1]Voice acting[/h1]

The game is fully voice acted save for the MC and narration. I believe this is the best combo as it helps immensely in the world-building whilst also not breaking any immersion. Each character is brought to life by VAs that capture the essence of their character, where emotions are conveyed wholly and impactfully.

[h1]H Content[/h1]

As with most VNs, the quality of the script drops substantially as soon as H content start. Superior to most VNs, despite this fact, it mostly remains a decent quality, with some pleasant surprises with good quality scripting. However, I did find myself fast reading some of the H content. H content is not included on Steam, you can download the patch on Yuzusoft's official website.

[h1]Sprite quality[/h1]

A very high number of poses and facial expressions are used on detailed sprites, which frequently changes during a conversation to keep the characters life-like and natural. Attention to detail is paid in order to get the perfect timing and sprite selection to achievement the aforementioned point, which makes it feel even more fluid than an animation.

[h1]CG quality (non H standpoint)[/h1]

There is a high number of CGs that are vibrant and dynamic. Overall quality is excellent, but it is emphasised by the outstanding timings the CGs are introduced. They serve to enhance the story and moments dramatically, and add to the fact that some details (e.g. facial expressions) can change whilst showing the CG, it serves as a powerful cornerstone for the VN to shine upon.

[h1]CG quality (H standpoint)[/h1]

Due to the nature of a H scene, it may sometimes feel repetitive because ultimately, it is still just one image. The H aspect is mostly decent, but sometimes it fails to successfully capture the balance between the H quality of the girl and the charm of the girl. That said, it still fully inherits all the good points discussed in the non-H standpoint, with the overall quality being better than most other VNs.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

You occasionally make choices that impact what route you end up going into (H-Scene choices have no impact).

[h1]Translation[/h1]

I played the game mostly in English and sometimes with Chinese sub-text. I can't speak for the faithfulness to the original (since I haven't seen the original), but both languages flow naturally and don't detract from the game's charm. There is no element of annoying over-localisation present, allowing you to fully enjoy the story.

[h1]Settings and misc[/h1]

The game excels in this aspect. Settings that are crucial for a VN, settings you may want in a VN, settings you didn't even think you will need in a VN, this has it all. Despite the high customizability, the settings are straight forward to navigate and comprehend, with the default being perfect acceptable as well. A small detail I really appreciate is that almost every navigation or options is accompanied by the voice of one of the girls. The game also features the ability to bookmark favourite voice lines, which is quite wonderful (I don't play a lot of VNs, so I'm not sure if this is a common feature). 

[h1]MC[/h1]

The game's MC does a good job of filling the role of a character in the world, whilst also not making it feel like you are watching a story from the sidelines. There is no eccentric qualities about him, which thankfully also means there are no annoying qualities about him. He is also not an emotionless insert; he is able to express various emotions appropriate for the scenario, so you won't find yourself cringing or raging over the MC's actions.

[u][h1]Routes[/h1][/u]
[u] Disclaimer: [/u] I may discuss what some may consider minor spoilers, but I promise there won't be any details pertaining to what happens. 

[h1]Common[/h1]

The common route is where you are introduced to the main storyline of the curse and the characters, whilst also building up the world of Hoori. The common route intertwines advancing the storyline of solving the curse whilst simultaneously showing off the personality of the characters and the charm of the girls. The former is achieved somewhat dully, with the majority coming from dialogue that feels dragging, but the latter is achieved phenomenally, from enticing dialogue sparkled with colourful CG, to well planned events that serve as a powerful backbone for the script to shine.

The proportion of the main story and dating aspect leans slightly towards the former, so I can't help but think that being a bit more skewed towards the latter, or at least being balanced, would making the common route more enjoyable. However, I'm no scriptwriter and I'm sure the currently balance has been tested and was deemed optimal. This is also more than made up by the fact that during a specific route, the dating aspect (even without considering H), is more pronounced than the main story (or in the case of Roka/Koharu, the main story completely ends).

World-building of Hoori is relatively simple, but that doesn't mean it feels one-dimensional. Details are sprinkled into the story to make the world believable and cohesive, and the balance between subtleness and explicitness leaves no room for confusion, whilst also not overwhelming you with details like a lorebook.

The actual story quality of the main plot (at least in the common route) is detailed, but unexciting. You can clearly see that whilst a detailed storyline is present, the heart of the VN is not here. Whilst you won't be bored or uninterested, you may start feeling indifferent about the events that happen in the main storyline.

The story quality of the dating aspect is where the positives of this VN shine through. You get a taste of each of the girls' charms, with enough details to understand their traits, and sufficient encouragement to select any of their routes. Each scene is carefully crafted to achieve this, with all elements of the VN working in harmony.

(Due to the character limit, I will be discussing each specific routes in the comments.)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Whilst not the first VN I finished, as a relatively new VN player, this showed me the charms and potentials of VN. This VN was a brilliant introduction to the genre for me, and I can easily say its the best out of the limited number of ones I have played. For the current price, it is more than worth it, as the sheer quantity of quality content will easily be proven by the number of willing hours one would inevitably be putting in.",1660801089,1660806128,True,2,0,0.458027690649032593,36,True,False,False

I haven't really played a lot of VNs before if JRPG segments don't count, but I thought I'd give it a try and this was the highest rated one around. I'm not really that into the anime tropes anymore and they're pretty ubiquitous here so that kind of hampered my enjoyment a bit but not to the point where I dropped it early. I'm writing this review after having played every route but Lena's.

[h1]Technical aspects[/h1]
The thing that made me buy this to try it out as opposed to simply pirating it was the options menu, funnily enough. The amount of complex customization you can do, from adjusting voice volume of specific characters to binding specific mouse gestures to customizing the color of already seen text, was honestly crazy to me.

Other than that, the game performed totally fine and I didn't notice any problems when playing outside of one somewhat problematic feature.

The auto mode. This feature is somewhat buggy, if you have the text speed at 100% you'll regularly find some unvoiced lines be skipped after voiced lines because of how this feature works. If you're on an unvoiced line of text when a voiced line stops, the unvoiced text is advanced in auto mode, this means that if the text is on the screen too quickly when the voice is less than a second from being done, that text will be skipped. Annoying. This can be fixed by setting text speed to 95%, it's still fast enough to be near indistinguishable.
The issue described above is a general flaw though, if you skip ahead in text and a voice line ends you'll sometimes skip unvoiced lines accidentally, although maybe I should've just stopped using auto mode at that point.

[h1]Production value[/h1]
This was somewhat saddening to me, after the options menu gave me such a good impression. The character images and backgrounds, as well as the music are all good, great even! But there's so little of it, the majority of the time you'll see the same character image with 2 outfits, about 7 different expressions and around 5 custom CGs (including sex scenes) per route. I had expected a few more custom images and was a little disappointed to find out that this is where they mainly saved on costs. Maybe I'm expecting too much of a 30$ game but then again, VNs don't have to care about gameplay at all, so I expect the funds to be put into things that are basically the ""gameplay"" of VNs.

On the other hand, the voice acting is top-notch and everything but the inner monologue and speech of the protagonist is voiced. No complaints here at all.

[h1]Plot and characters[/h1]
I'll write a bit about the character-specific routes without spoilers below my abstract thoughts on them, which come next.

The plot itself is alright, I was not particularly invested in it, but it didn't bore me to tears and was satisfactorily resolved in the basic route. It's definitely more of a vehicle for character interactions than anything else, outside of the character-specific routes.

The characters are pretty good actually, most of them are decently fleshed out by the time you've played all routes and have multiple motivations for their actions. They're not especially complex or deep, but they have enough going for them that you can emphasize and, in some cases, relate. 
Most of the character development of a character is locked behind a character-specific route though, during the basic route they remain rather static, which is fine because that's where you get to know them in the first place. Although, the relationships between the characters could've been expanded upon, it sometimes feels like characters cease to exist if the protagonist doesn't interact with them.

Two final things to note, despite what the game may say, these characters are not 18+ and certainly don't act anywhere near that age. The main character is a very vexing person in the basic route, and only really seems to grow out of his macho phase once you start the character-specific routes. Outside those moments, he's a very passive and ""nice"" person, probably for ideal self-insertion. Although, he's made dense to the point of self-delusion in some routes.
Furthermore, basically every heroine turns into a blushing innocent lily the moment they're romanced, I suppose this may be a more cultural thing about the Japanese female ideal, but it's noticeable where one second they're confident in themselves and the next they're a blushing stuttering wreck that has never dated anybody. I suppose they didn't want to give an impression of ""used goods"" which in of itself is a pretty toxic view. In one of the routes a heroine mentions that she's happy the protagonist has never dated somebody either because she didn't want to feel like she'd be compared to a prior experience, which is understandable if a rather immature view.

Time for a spoiler free overview of the character-specific routes, I'll mainly split it up between the romance/relationship and the plot of the route. The number next to their name is the age based on maturity I'd assign the heroine and protagonist in this route. The order is the way I played them in.

Murasame(19): The first route I played, with the most involved plot. That kind of was its downfall though, a lot of focus and words was spent on resolving the plot and the payoff/solution was good, but the way to it was a bit of a slog. It definitely dragged in the middle, and I would recommend using the skip button during some scenes. It gave me true-ending vibes with its resolution though.
The relationship with Murasame was expanded upon in this route, and she gets a satisfying character arc and pay-off, although you don't notice that she's supposed to be 500 years old. They didn't really do anything with the concept and she feels more like a somewhat more mature girl in a young body, not an adult though. They could've definitely done a bit more with the well-spring of experiences Murasame has seen over her time, and her relationships with characters she has ostensibly been watching over for their entire lives.

A decent route but the middle part of the plot really dragged it down, I'd say this was thoroughly mediocre. I probably did Murasame a disservice by comparing her to Sothis from Fire Emblem 3 Houses which does a much better job of working with the 1000 year old loli archetype.

Mako(17): This route had a pretty good plot that kept me interested and was the best one in typing together plot and character development for the heroine. Also has one of the most amusing plot lines, sleepless in Hoori had me chuckling.
This route actually let the characters breathe and get to know each other before falling in love and felt a lot more plausible than some of the others. The characters also do a [b]great[/b] job communicating here, something that I was very surprised in an anime-inspired piece of media. Feelings were communicated and explored in a rather mature way. Ended with a very satisfying character-development based pay-off.

My favorite route overall.

Roka(20): Not much to write here, this and Koharu are bother side-character routes and basically just there, so you can romance other notable characters without making them actually plot-relevant. The ending was decent though, the plot while nothing to write home about was well-handled.
The relationship was alright, Roka could've been made a little more mature, but that would've gone against the innocent lily portrayal of all heroines, oh well. 

Koharu(14): Ah, the incest route. I played with the 18+ patch, this was the only route that was actually made worse by it, I feel. Very lame resolution overall and all in all not a great time for me.

Character limit reached, oops. 

Yoshino(16): This route had the best plot, I'd argue. The relationship was also well-explored. Contender for true-ending route.",1660057044,1660115175,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

It was a good chunk into the game, by which I mean somewhere around 2-3 hours probably (it took me ~50h to get through all the content) before something clicked and I started reading up on things and I discovered that I had bought something that was rightfully tagged as NSFW and for which an R18 patch (freely available from publisher website) exists.
Not what I was interested in to be honest, however having been a few hours in and having had a blast at the puns thrown at me, and finding the characters vaguely interesting (really it's the dialogue and not the characters themselves that catch me) I decided ""screw it, I'm doing this"".
However for the sake of not missing out on any content I did proceed *with* the R18 patch, which also kind of explained one of the first puns I was presented with in the game (the lack of a bathtowel did make a lot more sense in that situation).

Yeah, 52.4h of this game and I can say that I do not regret any of my choices that led here, and I don't regret getting other games from the same dev/publisher combo either (however you can feel some.… recycling).

I can't give a very in-deep opinion given my lack of experience and others VNs to compare it with. But overall (completed 3 of the routes so far), I feel all the characters are likeable, the pacing of the story is good (doesn't feel too slow nor rushed), the BGMs are good and the artworks are stunning.

The plot in itself isn't particularly original, it's basically ""average dude moves from city to a small country village, becomes sort of a chosen hero and gets surrounded by cute girls in the process"". The game does a good job at establishing an interesting setting and cast of characters though.

If you are looking for a cool VN to read and relax after a tiresome day, I recommend Senren Banka. I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed this VN, it made me put off other games, anime and books because I just wanted so much to go on with the story.

The protagonist was pretty much the typical bland, dense protagonist that has nothing interesting to his character. At least the other characters are kind of good, exploring their routes was kind of fun, except when the game pulls you out of their side stories and forces you to read the main story. The romance on the other hand had no impact on me, mostly because I found it very lacking.

Most of the story is spent trying to solve the mystery as to why the town is cursed, which boiled down to the protagonist and his friends fighting the evil spirits (multiple times in the same locatiton) and collecting their shards since it served as a key to uncover it, what sucks is that it constantly shows the protagonist having multiple very boring training arcs where he slowly becomes stronger and once they actually beat the spirits they show them going to the towns doctor so she can inspect the pieces, every single time.

The choices are just there so you can get laid by one of the girls (including the protagonist cousin), there's no risk of anything bad happening to you or the characters.

The reason for the main villain to curse the town was just out of some generic vengeance.

Music was mostly not my thing, since most of the music is centralized around the traditional Japanese music genre.

I would only kind of recommend to buy the game on sale for the characters if you are interested in them and not for the main story since I personally found it boring, even though I forced myself to finish the main story and Lena's route (which her route offers the most important parts of the main story). There are way better mystery visual novels out there like Steins Gate and Danganronpa series, and if you want a good romance visual novel then just get Clannad.

I'll admit, I haven't really played any visual novels. So this was my first dedicated sit down and boy, am I glad I chose this one. The soundtrack, art, and characters are absolutely lovely. I found myself getting sad towards the end of my last romance route because I didn't want the story and world to end. Each character path provides a unique experience either into the character relationships or the lore of the country town Hoori that you're in. I felt the game was really well polished, though the only thing I would change was maybe get rid of Koharu's romance. I know there is a disclaimer that everyone is 18 or older, but it is really unsettling that everyone is still in high-school and she is obviously the youngest, and your cousin. I did play this game with the patch installed, so I'm not sure how this plays without it. But given including the patch, there is SO much content to explore. At times I skipped bits, especially when the main character was talking since he didn't have a voice and I read it faster than it would have been said. I'm sure if I let this auto-play, I'd probably have upwards of 40 hours or more on the game. Either way, I highly recommend this game. 

Ratio time! 
My completionist: 32 hours/$34.99
Howlongtobeat completionist: 58.5 hours/$34.99

Is this game worth its money? Yes. I read fast, so I'm sure completing all the routes is likely a higher hourly average time, given the results from howlongtobeat's website. Buying it on sale or not is up to you, but either way, you will get about an hour for every dollar you pay.",1649122450,1649122450,True,5,0,0.577194094657897949,0,True,False,False

tldr - It's not a bad game by any means. But despite the game's beautiful setting and music, I personally don't think Senren Banka meets my expectations enough to recommend it due to its poor character and story immersion.

Yuzusoft usually does great at making cute romantic stories. Senren Banka is no exception to this. However, it's exactly that and not much more despite its amazing potential. In comparison to other Yuzusoft titles, Senren Banka has the most interesting premise in its lore and story, but probably the worse execution in telling it which greatly impacts its ability to immerse its audience.

Instead of using the setting and allowing us to immerse more into its characters and world, the main story feels more like a simple blockade of boring fight scenes and out-of-place fan service that we have to forcibly read through in order to enter each heroine route. Many of the individual routes themselves also come off as questionable. This is because they basically consist of awkward romantic developments in the form of unnaturally horny and cheesy character interactions that further pulls us away from any sort of seriousness in the narrative that was established. Considering how long and slow the main story line is before we even get to the individual character routes, the main story tricks us into thinking there will be some kind of deeper lore to help develop our character relationships, which unfortunately there really isn't. By the time I even finished the common route, I couldn't help but think about how bland and shallow everything was and many times I felt like dropping it. It ultimately lead to me having little to no urge to pursue some individual heroine routes because I didn't find them interesting enough. I suppose this could just be me expecting too much. After all, this is a Yuzusoft game; They aren't particularly well known for creating deep stories.

Senren Banka also suffers from a much poorer cast dynamic in comparison to its other Yuzusoft titles. In terms of the cast, its difficult to pin-point what I felt went wrong. While all heroines and side characters feel great in representing their individual personalities, there seems to be an issue when you put them together. Unlike other Yuzusoft titles, Senren Banka lacks any sort of solid relationship between the heroines and other characters outside of the MC in order to establish a strong and compelling group dynamic. It feels harsh to say, but some characters are just completely irrelevant and meaningless to the overall story due to their relationship and poor screen time with other characters. There's not enough development or meaningful interactions from some characters to justify them being there in the first place and it wouldn't be an oversight to say that some characters, if removed from the story, would have no impact on the main cast or story narrative at all. 

To explain how I feel: Imagine watching your typical anime or show that takes place in a setting with multiple people in the background. You see the main characters having an important discussion, and suddenly one of the background characters walk up and starts talking to the main characters mid-conversation, while contributing nothing to said conversation. You scratch your head confused, wondering why they're even there in the first place and later on you kind of forget they even existed. That's the usual gist of some conversations and it's basically wasted time.

You can argue that this could just be due to the story's setting, as all of our characters aren't naturally forced together; like in a school or a club room. But nevertheless, its kind of a shame, as I feel Yuzusoft games usually excel at character to character dynamics and having them all play a part in the story.

Unfortunately for me, I'd say Senren Banka is on the lower end of Yuzusoft visual novels. I would still recommend this for people who simply want to turn their brain off and enjoy a cute romantic comedy with a rural Japanese setting. For people looking for more or expecting quality similar to other Yuzusoft titles, I personally don't think Senren Banka matches up to them due to the reasons stated above. So, I find it hard to recommend this if you've already read the others.

[hr][/hr]

EDIT (2/12/2022): So, I convinced myself to finish all the routes despite losing interest and dropping the game for a bit. For reference, I had only finished Mako's, Yoshino's, and Murasame's routes when I initially decided to drop and review the game. I have to say, I enjoyed Lena's route quite a bit, as the narrative in her route is far more enjoyable in terms of the story and romantic development. Her route explores and expands much deeper into the plot and also allows us to have the entire cast coming together more often, much to my pleasure, as opposed to the other heroine routes having most of the cast seemingly disappear for the majority of the story.

However, my previous negative points still stand so I won't be changing my mind on keeping this a thumbs down. Roka's and Koharu's routes didn't present anything special to me either, as expected from side characters who rarely had screen time in the common route. Sorry.",1641444491,1649038101,False,42,1,0.762373089790344238,0,True,False,False

Senren＊Banka is no exception and is just another good entry in their catalog. Senren＊Banka compared to the other available Yuzusoft titles on steam leans more into traditional Japanese culture with the protagonist moving to a small village in a rural part of Japan reminiscent of P4 with Inaba if you've played that. Overall I enjoyed all the routes, and each heroine had an interesting enough character arc beyond the common route to read to the end. I think Mako's was my favorite to read, the writers got her gap moe tuned just right especially with her playful personality. I loved the gimmick with the Murasame sword, and the curse of the village this time around. If you have never played a Yuzusoft title they play out somewhat similarly, but they differentiate themselves with varying designs and character traits for the heroines. And then there's always a specific motif, setting, or theme they go with. It's just really all in the small nuanced details that allow individual Yuzusoft titles to stand on their own. 

The artwork is great as always with a signature style that when you see it you know you're reading a Yuzusoft VN. The OST is appropriate for the setting with some fun upbeat tracks thrown in the mix as well. Pacing is also decent, not perfect, but wasn't to the point I felt like things were moving way too slowly or too quickly with not enough narrative development. Also as always vocal performances were great, everyone from main cast to side characters made Hoori feel lively. 

I mean what else can you say, you get quality when you get a Yuzusoft VN, at worst they're alright, and at their best they're comfy and entertaining. Although preference and what you're looking for also plays a part, if you have certain expectations that aren't realistic you will probably find yourself disappointed. But as I stated before Senren＊Banka is another solid title in their catalog, not my personal favorite Yuzusoft title, but is worth a read for Moege enthusiasts.",1648221653,1648951569,True,5,0,0.588080942630767822,0,True,False,False

I'm no VN expert, as I've only ever really delved into the original Fate Stay Night and Katawa Shoujo. That being said, Senren Banka was a pretty decent Visual Novel, with high production value. A few routes are very good, and I found that my favorite was Murasame's route. All of the main routes (Yoshino, Lena, Murasame, Mako) are well fleshed out- some more than others. Roka/Koharu routes are the least involved, and feels like a side story more than anything. 

The H-Scenes- there's plenty of them. I played with the optional uncensored patch. Each route consists of several H-Scenes after the relationships blossom. Personally, I could have done with more character development / character moments than so many H-Scenes, but that's just me! When I say I want more PLOT, I don't mean it ironically. 

The main character is dense as hell, and sometimes annoying. The routes are very lengthy, often without real substance. However, despite the flaws, I found that many of the character moments were well executed. The banter between the characters can be very funny, and many of the more dire moments hit with appropriate impact, with many sad emotional moments. Sometimes the feels are there, and that's a good thing. It means I ended up liking the characters, but as a result, I feel a little underwhelmed they weren't developed further. 

While I may have many negative things to say about Senren Banka, I wouldn't have 100% it if I didn't enjoy it! It was a good time, and I do recommend giving it a look if you like VNs. Murasame's route had lots of laughs and feels, and I loved it. Playing Senren Banka was worth it for that route alone, as it hit on some interesting subject matter which I found particularly interesting and not often explored. Is Senren Banka worth it? Sure! It's not perfect, but there's no denying that it's a well crafted VN.",1647907965,1647907965,True,9,1,0.626116931438446045,0,True,False,False

Yes, it is a classical tropey tale about a Japanese dude who breaks the town’s Excalibur… er, katana in the stone, and now has to live at the shrine where it was kept and marry the shrine maiden. Of course, there are other girls involved in the mix, such as the loyal ninja girl whose family has served the shrine maiden for generations, the scaredy sword spirit of the katana, a gorgeous foreigner exchange student, the mandatory childhood friend and cousin, a curse hanging over the town they have to deal with… you know, the works.
But in true Yuzusoft manner, they quickly make use of the charming personalities and quirks of each girl, to the point that all grow on you by the end of the common route and you are wondering which heroine’s route to start first.

This is because of how skillfully they weave the tale of Hoori’s curse and how it affects our characters, and how each character represents one part of the solution (my recommended order: Yoshino > Roka and Koharu > Mako > Lena > Murasame) to the whole mystery. And it really is one hell of a tale, delightfully intricate and full to the brim with colorful Japanese folklore. Plus the characters themselves are just as fun to watch in Yuzusoft’s classic “Another View”, a feature I love and wish to see appear more often in VNs, where you get to see the perspective of other characters aside from the MC.

That way, you get to see Yoshino’s seriousness as a shrine maiden and funny innocence as a girl (her achievements are SO. DAMN. HILARIOUS.), Mako’s fierce loyalty and girlish femininity, Lena’s charming naivete and unique cultural mishaps (kudos for the translators for succeeding in properly translating her linguistic blunders, that’s no mean feat), Murasame’s regality and childishness, and Roka and Koharu as the ones to show you the less “arcane” side of Hoori, love the cultural bits they provide.
Plus Masaomi himself, as a good Yuzusoft MC, has real charm, and does not feel constrained by his tropes. He really grows during the story, and has some great dynamics with all the characters, making you cheer for him.

All of this, to the beat of some nice, relaxing music, neatly dressed up with some proper classic Japanese musical instruments that truly give of the vibe a town with its haunted mountain should have.

I seriously wish this game got an anime adaptation. Its tale is easier to bring to anime than Sabbat of the Witch’s (less… risqué scenes to worry about). It has all the right pieces, even if they adapt the story to only follow the “true path”. But if they go the Yosuga no Sora route and adapt all the heroine routes in true Vn fashion… THAT would be interesting.
So yeah, I highly recommend it. Does not matter if you are a fan of VNs or not. Good tale. Accessible for everyone.

What’s that? The +18 patch content? Yeah, get it if you want from Nekonyan. Yuzusoft makes those scenes interesting and have relevance in the story when necessary; though IMO, the story is just fine without the extra spice.",1645988035,1645988035,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Senren＊Banka is a regular Gal visual novel game that won't let you down. The plot perfectly interprets what is called a bland but not mediocre daily life, and the music, art, and character design are also quite good, which is unique in similar games.

I think this game can be used as an entry game for many players Galgame. Smooth and comfortable gameplay and just the right length of the game make for a relaxing and enjoyable gaming experience. Although these kinds of games are inevitably clichéd and unreasonable in some plot content, they are still handled very well.

All in all, this game is very suitable for players who have not been exposed to Galgame but want to try it. In terms of the plot, every route of the game is handled very well, and the world view perfectly fits the plot, which is very suitable for leisure and relaxation.

- Kobuichi & Muririn God-tier art
- An actual story that's entertaining (Not the best but it's still good)
- Every dialogue has a voice line (Except for your character)
- Character changes faces while they are talking

It took a looooong time to get interesting - I don't think I was fully engaged by the story or even the characters until after completing a couple of routes (since they reveal more of the story with each route). But in the end it was worthwhile. I just wish they hadn't put so much filler in there that I foolishly read all of thinking there would be important story or character development in it. Maybe it was simply that some of the funny, lighthearted content didn't always land for me. I wish they would have made each route more unique like Sabbat of the Witch. The story just wasn't interesting enough to be broken up like this - it would have been much stronger as a standalone route that fully told the story in one go.

In any case, good artwork, nice VO/audio, decent story if a bit too drawn out, some funny moments, as well. For those seeking the H scenes, there's the standard idiotic mosaic censorship with the patch.",1638595643,1638629877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly i'm very new to visual novels and have never properly played one. That being said from the very get go i was engrossed, from the masterfully executed music and the smart witty banter that had me cracking up multiple times throughout, there was never a dull moment. The in game menu provides a helpful flow chart that lets you see the choices you chose and the part of the story you are at, which lets you jump to any point in the story giving easy access to parts you might want to revisit. The characters in Senren Banka are crafted in a way that really emphasises the big moments in the story, sharing dialogue that feels meaningful only helped by being performed by some amazing voice actors that only enhances your immersion. In total the route i played took around 19 hours to finish which as a new comer was a manageable length never stretching interactions out longer than they need to be while at the same time never rushing important and memorable moments. As this was my first experience into Visual novels I was cautious of starting one as from the outside looking in they can seem intimidating to get into, however after finishing what i have of the story i am only ready to dive into the other routes and start the whole experience all over again. In conclusion Senren Banka is a story you don't want to miss out on and i highly implore you, no matter if your new to visual novels or a veteran to give it a try.",1634324572,1634427887,True,4,2,0.559647738933563232,0,True,False,False

To begin with, i won't really compare these novel but i would said that, Senren is one of my favourite beside Sabbat of The Witch. The character is all cute and the story is pretty good which of course involving miko,spirit,and also KATANA! Yes, I love katana a lot and I can't get enough seeing characters especially the MC. I guess i should try find one visual novel related to katana.. Anyway, as usual, there is 4 main heroine but in addition, there is 2 side which is Koharu and Roka which I haven't went through yet.

If you want to learn the whole story best to play all routes. 

Overall the game is a 7/10 for me.

But for each separate route ill give a score and update routes on completion. in this review.

Mako Route- 8/10 (Favourite Character Route)
Mursame Route- 9/10 (Best Story Route)
Yoshino Route- 6/10 (It's just average idk)
Lena Route- 7/10 (It's not bad, some moments are really nice)
Roka Route- 6/10 Roka and Koharu route are more or less the same and changes are just some things. (Roka H scenes are Fire tho XD).
Koharu Route- 4/10 (Ok look the story is more less the same, but i don't really like that its incest since their cousins and all.) Hence the lowest rating out of them all.

[i]Cutting into the strings of fate.[/i]

[h3]Preclaimer[/h3]
- This is an Adult Visual Novel - one with a free R18 Patch (obtainable at NekoNyan's webshop) at that - designed to be R18, which is why I consider the R18 content part of the whole and will include it in this review. If for whatever reason you are not interested in this content, or aren't legally allowed to play it, you should just skip this review.
- Since many Visual Novels are similar in a bunch of ways, I'm gonna review this one on a few common aspects, including heavy reference to the previous title from YuzuSoft as well as independent explanations.

[hr]
[h3]Graphical & Technical Quality[/h3]
Have you played the previous title, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/0256667/recommended/888790/]Sabbat of the Witch[/url]? If so, this makes it easy. If not - let's just cut it short, you should do so right away. Senren * Banka's story does not require any knowledge from Sanoba Witch, but with it being the next title from the very same developer, it is very similar (and does contain very funny joke references you only understand that way) - and Sanoba Witch is even better.
Anyway, as to be expected from YuzuSoft, Senren * Banka features amazing quality in both graphics and technical features. You get the whole spectrum from Sanoba Witch, alongside some cool newcomers and enhancements.
Such as the KiriKiri engine default features like dozens of saveslots, skipping back and forth throughout the story (as far as you have already seen it once), costumization for menu voices, skip mode behaviour, text colors, fonts and so on.
The cool additions back in Sanoba Witch like saving voicelines to rehear them whenever you wanna hear your favorite ""Baka baaaaka!"" again, mouse gestures, the option to add even more saveslots and so on.
And finally all the cool new gimmicks Senren * Banka brings to the table, like detailed backwards skipping, quick chapter jumping, customizable keyboard shortcuts, a customizable menu bar, being able to jump to the scene of a saved voiceline, a more user friendly savegame manager and finally - the flowchart diagram, the easiest way ever to keep track of every story segment, find out what you're missing and as easy as ever build your new route for a new playthrough.
Also, with the hidden ""Advanced settings"" menu you can now feel like a pro, adjusting stuff like render methods, cache sizes and all that juicy expert stuff.

As with Sanoba Witch there are no character sprite animations (like blinking or moving mouths) but the various character sprites are vividly used and changed mid-sentence to bring the scene to life.

Though, also like with the previous game, Senren * Banka features a few textual errors in the translation here and there, but nothing too disturbing.
And Senren * Banka seems to have some technical hicups too, atleast the reaction of the mouse gestures is far worse.

[hr]
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2034918446[/url]

[hr]
[h3]Content & Runtime[/h3]
Of course not spoiling anything on the actual story, Senren * Banka is much more of a casual, ecchi humor RomCom than it's predecessor focussing more on - stuff that the romance and adult genre entail. So if you are looking for a serious, deep, heartfelt story giving you an emotional journey of your lifetime - I again highly recommend the predecessor, Sabbat of the Witch. Though if you are looking for a good laugh amongst some good looking virtual characters making out, this is one of the best things you could get.

Senren * Banka features the usual 4 main routes (without a real ""main"" route like Sanoba Witch) with an additional bonus route (shorter in comparison) splitting between the two side characters, which gives a total of 7 (""bad"" ending included) endings on 5 routes to enjoy. The Prologue/Common route takes around 10h of time, the main routes around 15h each and the bonus route around 10h whole (as always measured by not rush-skipping standards), totaling to around 80h.
The characters are well developed and distinct, giving lot's of variation to enjoy no matter which route you play, though the male protagonist has been reduced to your everyday anime protagonist again (even though he looks exactly like the one from Sanoba Witch :I).

As this again is a full fledged Visual Novel with multiple routes/endings, you determine your path with the 8(+1) in-dialog-decisions made throughout the story, with some of them having more than the regular 2 options and some of them even leading to different event-paths right on the common route.

If you're not after your personal Waifu I'd recommend playing the routes in the order they are displayed (flowchart menu, shoppage description, ...) for maximum effect.

After clearing your first playthrough you unlock the gallery, where you can enjoy the 93 wallpaper CGs, 30 (somewhat animated) SD Chibi arts, 53 really awesome soundtracks and 7 opening/ending movies (as long as you saw/heared them once before of course), neatly sorted by category and character.
There also are After Stories again, which contain another bonus scene for every character whose route you already cleared.

Upon clearing all routes you unlock the Sprite Viewer too, where you can play around with all the backgrounds and character sprites in all their variations to your heart's content, and even load custom backgrounds for all your photoshop needs.

[hr]
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027016060[/url]

[hr]
[h3]The R18 content[/h3]
Considering the content is for free, you can still expect an experience worthy of any regular full price R18 DLC. Each main character comes with 3+1 hentai scenes, each bonus character with 2+1.
Great voice acting alongside missing weird sound effects (you know, those weird ""break bones"" and ""mix cement"" sounds you often hear) and CG backgrounds with high variety make up for the previously mentioned  lack of animation and the likes.
When it comes to the depictions of bodily fluids and the will and stamina of the participants, it's noteably more than with the predecessor, but nothing out of the ordinary hentai and even varies strongly from route to route.

Senren * Banka does a slight serving on fetish play, with the concept of ""turning into sex crazy monsters"" and that peeing fetish thingie being a thing to look out for.

You get to choose between coming inside or outside in most occasions, with personal preference (aka. auto choice) to be set in the settings.

And again there is your best buddy, the panic button, customizable in function (minimize, placeholder image, custom image).

Also, as is suitable for having a foreign character on board, you even get a free lesson on ""Japanese for Beginners - Hentai Edition"".

[b]As usual (sadly) mosaic censorship on the 'good' bits is in place.[/b]

[hr]
[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Is this game worth it?
Well, if I'd go and rate it on a simplistic scale from 1 to 10, with 12 being where the predecessor managed to land, I'd give Senren * Banka an overall 9/10, depending on personal taste.
If you played and enjoyed the predecessor (or any other VN of the same caliber) for it's rich, deep and serious story, this here might not be the thing for you. If you don't mind or are actively looking for a nice, lighthearted RomCom with adult content, Senren * Banka is well invested money.
Also, if you're still unsure - there will always be a next sale.

Decent story. Many different routes. Biggest issue is that in the all-ages version they still… discuss your relations with any love interests.

meanwhile sabbat of the witch is your typical magic school settings, senren banka does everything differently.

[h1] Story : [/h1]
The formula is new, countryside settings, there's a lot place, everything around it builds up to the story, and there's some plot twist but it doesn't too complicated since this is relaxing VN after all. Clearly better than sabbat of the witch imho, which is only school and go to clubroom.

[h1] Artworks : [/h1]
 yuzusoft is what you call kyoto animation of VN. The world is really vibrant, good looking, and a lot of unique buildings, everything is your candidate as new wallpaper, the mini CGI is good too which is animated when funny things happen. 

[h1] Gameplay :[/h1]
Now you must be confused about why there is a gameplay section in this review which is only click and read.
The flowchart feature is really nice, you don't need to replay everything, just choose the another choice for other girls route, without repeating another 15 hours playthrough. The voice bookmarks are really neat too.

[h1] Characters :[/h1]
There's blue eyes white [strike]dragon[/strike] hair girl, ninja girl, foreigner, and ghost that afraid another ghost heroines. But what i praise the most is the male cast characters they are not only standing there, they are as important as the girls to build up the story. [b] There's lots of expression and every texts the expression changes which makes interaction even better. [/b]
The characters design are moe, good looking, and not bland, the girls personality are overall better than sabbat of the witch.
On my playtime when i write this review i still only got 2 out of 5 routes and i still want to get other girls because believeable characters, and other girls route is as important as the main heroine. Even though i only go for main heroine on sabbat of the witch.

[h1] Music :[/h1]
Lot's traditional and acoustic BGM which is pleasing to ears, and there's so far unique BGM for different girls and the ending.

Setup for Linux Users: https://www.protondb.com/app/1144400#g9XIyrD4fn . For some reason it's the roughest to setup of all the Yuzusoft titles on Steam and Steam Overlay doesn't work half the time for me. YMMV ofc based on your system.

Like the RJ and SW, it has a ""What we want,"" theme to the story and a sub-theme for a specific subject. If RJ was focused on the subject of ""Secrets,"" and SW was focused on ""Communication,"" then SB is ""Family and that is what routes revolve on.

Route order wise, I recommend going Mako > Yoshino > Murasame > Lena. Weirdly Yoshino's route isn't the most wider-plot relevant or even the longest like how Ayase's route has the most plot points in it and Nene's route is worth two routes. I like the treatment of the mini routes here, Koharu and Roka sharing a ""common"" route that diverges based on who you choose so unlike the other Yuzusoft mini routes, it has more meat to it. You can play them as a snack in between the main routes.

Yoshino was OK IMO. Out of the 3 Yuzusoft games I've played, she's the least interesting main heroine. She's the typical Yuzusoft main heroine; most popular girl, has a bit of a chip on her shoulder, has some secrets, and under some stressful circumstances related to the main plot. Her plot has the closest relation to ""family"" - it's okay, not great, not bad.

Mako is the resident lewd girl of the game - she has 6 lewd scenes (though 2 of those are mini ones), two more than the others. Her route is kinda a rehash of Yoshino's and a sneak peak to Lena's route. Pretty much the reason I like her route is because once she became independent and accepted herself, she gets pretty lewd and I like lewd girls.

A version of Murasame's route is implied to happen after all the other routes. Her route is the one with the most feels as it concerns the weight of being a 500 years old ghost that couldn't be touched. I like that she's very proactive about her romantic interest. Outside of that, her non-romantic subplot concerns the future of the village, and I'd assume a version of it always happens in the other routes.

Before I get to Lena, I wanna talk about the other stuff first.

Roka and Koharu was okay. Koharu has a really cute design and mannerism but honestly that's the only thing she had going for her - I'm startig to see a pattern in the type of character that gets the Yuzusoft mini route treatment. Roka though? She makes me want more older ladies heroines - she has a job, she has her own dreams and goals, she has some good conversations and her own insecurities, it's all done pretty well despite how short it was that I wish we could just slash Koharu for more Roka.

Engine is always the industry gold standard - we now have flowchart system and only a few UX thing left to be ironed out. I wish this is the industry standard as this polish is part of why I got so into Yuzusoft stuff recently - it's just the most friction free VN reading I ever had.

Music was okay. I wish they leaned more on the traditional Japan aspect as the most unique BGMs are the ones that leaned more into it. The leitmotif was good thougha and the OP was pretty much the best too - though it's a shame that the 18+ patch doesn't decensor the Steam version's OP.

Art was good and memorable, though the character design was just okay for me. The uniform design was cool though - mustn't have been easy because it was a mix of multi-layer colorful traditional Japanese clothing and what passes as a 'uniform' but I'm glad they leaned into it because it does contributed the aesthetic it has.

The lewds was meh. It was a disappointment coming from SB's which has better interaction that I can get really into it. I think it was still better than most of RJ's lewds and at least it doesn't feel tacked on or get in the way of the plot, but after the first one it does felt like it's just to fill quota.



I think that's all to speak aside for Lena. So, anyway, I think Lena is best girl and my favorite Yuzusoft heroine. And I'm going to explain why in the spoilers.

They really managed to nail the mix of foreign values and her adjusting to the environment she's in, to make a pretty unique character. Yes, there is some foreigner stereotypes put into it as well, but it's fine as it doesn't feel they're going beyond anything that is in good fun.

Oh nevermind that she's not some American or English foreigner - she's a Scandinavian (Finland I think) who went to Japan alone and for a job and exchange program in boonies because of her love for the culture. Her problem with Japanese phrases is understandable in the Japanese version as it was usually just one syllable off from what she meant to say, like ""okotta"" and ""nokotta"", an understandable confusion. At the same time, it doesn't prevent her from expressing herself and she's actually pretty fluent in the language too aside for those understandable contextual issues.

She's pretty much the most expressive character in the entire game - even the main character remarking that watching her watch movies is like watching four people's worth of expressions. At the same time, she's no simple emotional girl - if anything, she has the most sense and sensitivity of the heroines.

[spoiler]Her route is the only one where you didn't win by just fighting. No, she's so sensitive that she could sense the pain behind the cursed spirit's existence, and it allowed her to empathize with it without being swallowed by its taint.

In fact, it's amazing that without even knowing anything about the myths of dreams and food in underworld, she could feel that something was off from the dream she was trapped in. When pointed out as to the danger she could be in, she readily risks herself for her friends, and  when the MC stated that he will take responsibility for her, she remarked that she doesn't like the idea of the MC ""taking responsibility for her"" because it removes her agency to make a choice and bear its results and as they are in a relationship, it should be that they both take responsibility for each others.

She then proceeds to remove the MC's worry by showing him that no matter what happens they are connected under one sky and demonstrate it by having a video call with her family, showing that even if they can feel lonely at times, they will always be connected. It was enough that the MC then take the initiative of talking to his own family.

She managed to solve most of the issues, including the problem with tourism and what the village can do going forward, and IIRC only in her epilogue that it's mentioned that Murasama had her thing happen as well - which implied a lot - and even returned the cursed spirit into a guardian deity that is honored by the family and the village as they find out about the entire history of the curse.

Even the cursed spirit was taken by her as he makes her play the role of its sister, a goddess, as it shows the entire history of the curse which was only teased in Mako's route. Even the antagonist puts her on goddess tier! And she deserves it, not just for her character.[/spoiler]

I'm not usually into big breasts character but that is no mere big breasts - nay, those are embodiment of dreams and hopes on its own. The way it accentuate her plain work clothes, the way it stretches the cute ""Oh, Fujiyama"" print on her casual shirt, how it gets the strap of her bag stuck in the middle in her first appearance, even when it was more covered by the underclothes in her casual kimono the covered side-boobs still attracted attention, the way she had to admit that the cardigan wouldn't fit her breasts, and how it displayed her uniform tie which is stuck in the middle to mounds of hopes and dreams and just catches your attention.

there is no order of route for this game especially for Murasame-chan route but i recommend to read Lena Route after finishing the other two girls.

for each route review im ranking them in this order
1. Lena (Best Route story wise)
2. Mako (Best route char development wise)
3. Murasame (happiest ending)
4. Yoshino(lacking)
5&6. roka-nee and koharu; this two are side story for normal side of the story so and can only be unlocked after playing at least one route. and somehow both are lacking compared to wakana route from Sabbat of The Witch.

my personal best girl ranking order:
1. Mako
2. Lena
3. Roka-nee
4.Murasame
5. Yoshino
6. Koharu

the game came with free R-18 Dlc you can download on nekonyan website and for the Hscene my ranking will be
1. Lena
2. Yoshino (loodest of the bunch)
3. Koharu (suprised with this tbh)
4. Roka-nee (the after story scene is really good but... theres no drunk scene....)
5. Mako
6. Murasame

The music is top tier and fits the story and characters well. Occasionally scenes drag on too long or dialog is clunky but not too often that it ruins the story.

TLDR - Another great story from NekoNyan. Wonderful story with a great set of main and supporting characters. The characters are well done and consistent. The translations are pretty good. The navigation in the game makes it so much fast to replay or jump to a specific scene or choice. If you love a great story or this style of game this is a must own game. 

- -------
Story - Great story and the backstory for the MC does a great job of creating a strong dynamic for the story to keep moving forward while allowing for some pretty funny moments to happen. The characters are consistent throughout and gel well together it really feels like you are joining this community. They did a great job working to get you to care for all the characters. The one thing that I really enjoyed much more than some other games they have done most of the characters routes have a big enough and unique story that make them feel like its not just a side route that means nothing the main plot of the ""cannon"" romance. 
Art - NekoNyan delivers on this area strongly as usual. Great design for the characters and their costumes. A nice blend of japanese traditional and other outfits that fit the story for the characters. The animations in the game do help to further enhance the art and they really do a great job. 
Overall - The quality of the game makes this an easy one to recommend if you have ever played and enjoyed any of their other titles its a must buy game. You will enjoy this one.

The overall story is very good an interesting that it's worth it to finish all of the main routes to see the whole details of the curse. Brushing on the comedy as well, it's funny with actually good lines, not some cheap laughs of cringe or perverted jokes.
Their voice acting is also on point with voices that are pleasant to hear and not overblown so no need to adjust the volume, or at least that was the case for me.
The only thing I would consider as a let down is the length of the routes for each main heroine is a bit different from one another so I can't feel like there's some favoritism during development, but I digress.
All in all, I recommend buying this game, on sale or not, just to experience another good Yuzusoft game.

I can say that I enjoyed the game but also that is the one I liked less of the three Yuzusoft I've played. Which is not meant as a downfall, it just means that the others (sabbat of the which and Riddle Joker) are just gold.

Senren Banka is located in a town that still is attached to the ol' japanese traditions where a city boy ends living because some reasons and it is his mother native place and there still part of the family living there. This boy ends sorrounded by some assorted girls (sorry, no harem here) and also involved in some paranormal activities. The story is light but good, with some very funny moments. The MC is easy to empathise with. And the girls are between the cutest group of all VN. For me, Mako is the best -and decided at first sight and without regrets- but I can understand if any other is chosen by the users as their waifu, 'cos they are all great. Well done characteristic and defined personalities.

If you like h-VN, your are bound to enjoy this one. I think it worths the money. I got it with discount, but even if not, would basically worth what they are asking.

I also like that doing the different routes is easily accessible it has a nice branching system for other routes that I think should be a staple in VisualNovels instead of making you replay the whole thing to do every possible route/ending. There is a small menu in the bottom with some useful features such as quick save,quick load, skip backwards, skip forwards, go back to your last choice, settings, a backlog and more which are very useful in case you mess up and overclick a dialogue text. I only finished 1 route and i'm in the middle of another and it's very entertaining. My favorite character so far is Yoshino. This VN is very charming I find myself laughing at some of the interactions between the characters or their thoughts to themselves. Give it a try if this sounds promising to you!

Edit: I can't stop humming the music from this at work every once in a while it's so catchy.... After going on with Yoshino's route and finishing it, Jesus Christ this gets very lewd with time.

Not once did I get bored while reading this, it's just on a completely different level when it comes to the plot. Since every route reveals different aspects of the backstory within this VN you'll actually feel a lot more motivated to go through all of the routes to learn everything you can. 
As for the length of this VN... It's not really that different in terms of length when compared to Sabbat Of The Witch, however the hours you spend reading this are a lot more evenly distributed across different routes.

The UI has seen a substantial improvement when compared to Sabbat Of The Witch, with it feeling generally a lot more fluid and I actually found myself using gesture controls in this one. Flowchart makes it easier for you to change your choices made during the common route, allowing you to remold the decision path for a different route without the need to start the story from the beginning.

Soundtrack is great and fits the atmosphere really well. Having classic Japanese music with a modern twist to it was certainly a unique experience and just makes me crave for an option to buy the entire soundtrack so much more. 

As for the visuals? Stunning. The art style is the same as before but with another level of detail and deeper, more stunning colours. Also it's all in Full HD and I was comfortable reading this fullscreen on my 27"" 2K monitor without any issues.

Joking. Sorta. That aside, I gave the previous title, Sabbat of the Witch, a barely passing grade. Thus my surprise when this game turned out to be absolutely amazing. The story is great, a touch Higurashi-ish, but I'm not complaining. While the previous was an obvious shallow dating sim that happened to have other elements, this game has a strong focus that also happens to have the dating aspect. The music is solid - very well done, and has a distinct eastern feel to it. The little details such as UI, options, etc., are well polished, and it has a convenient flowchart system. It's also supported in multiple languages and doesn't seem too difficult a read, so I look forward to practicing my chinese and japanese by rereading this.

My only real complaint is that there's no 'true route'. Through the various routes you learn a lot of unique aspects about the main focus of the story, but you never get a chance to put them all together and really solve the issue.

There are six heroines in total, although only three of them are the main heroines, as these three routes include the main conflict of the story (curse) into the plot of their story. Each heroine is unique, however, in their backgrounds and personalities, and their way of dealing with said curse. 

Each main heroine route reveals a different side of the curse, and so by reading all three you can get a better picture of the true nature of the curse and its history. As such, the heroines have different ways to deal with the curse, which matches their own personalities.

The three others deal with a different problem, as they have little to no connection to the curse (except for one, but it doesn't really count as it doesn't really deal with the curse). Because of this, their routes are considerably lighter than the three main ones, with a more slice of life feeling. 

Even so, each route is fun to read, The scenes are heartwarming and the comedy is great.

Pros:
Great production, visuals, voice acting, and character development in general.
H - scenes (can be unlocked by an official patch) are very high-quality.

Cons:
The background story could be better actually. It feels silly and too long at some points.

I'm going to keep this fairly short instead of doing a thorough review, but I've added some thoughts on various aspects of the game below if you want to dive deeper.

I've enjoyed Senren*Banka and highly recommend checking this one out. The overall focus of the game is the curse of the town Hori, with the protagonist being an outsider thrown in and the four main heroines being related to or influenced by the curse in one way or another. 
While romance is a big focus in each of the four main heroine routes, all of them come with actual plot to explore (and extra ""plot"" if you have the patch installed). There are two additional routes (namely Koharu and Roka), but these are just an extra that do not tackle the core plot in any way.

All main heroines are very likable, some especially moreso once you enter their routes. Murasame is best girl tho.

I've clocked in about 50 hours at the time of writing, but considering AFK time, occasional skipping, etc I would guess the actual read time to be at around 40-45ish hours.

Without further ado here are some notes about the game:

[h1]Story, Routes and Recommended Play Order[/h1]

[b]Minor (marked) spoilers in this section![/b]

While the overall route order is not enforced and up for the player to decide, in my opinion some routes are better played before others as you can see below. 
Each route will have its main heroine as a romance focus but also some sort of sub-plot to deal with. Here are some notes about each route:

Yoshino's route explores the curse theme [spoiler]and the situation of the Tomotake family further. [/spoiler] This one feels like a natural continuation of the common route, and should be played first.

Mako's route tackles the curse theme from a different perspective, with more details on it following in Lena's route (Although you shouldn't play Lena's route first, see Lena's section). 
The focus of the route is Mako herself and [spoiler] the problem of falling in and experiencing love. Since the theme doesn't go far beyond romance (which the other routes also have), it's the weakest route in my personal opinion. [/spoiler] 
If you aren't playing Yoshino first, this one works as a first route too.

Lena's route answers a lot of questions that come up in both Mako's and Yoshino's route, [spoiler] while also resolving the curse problem in a manner that feels like a ""true"" ending to the curse itself. [/spoiler] Whether this one or Murasame's is the actual ""true"" route is up for debate.
Since Yoshino, Mako and Lena routes focus heavily on the curse you should do this route after reading the other two.

Murasame's route shifts the focus from cleansing the curse to its aftermath instead, [spoiler]with Murasame herself now being simply a ghost without any duties and the town facing the economical impact of losing one of the main attrations for tourists.[/spoiler]
Similar to Mako's route the focus here is on Murasame herself, with the main difference being Murasame's special circumstances (her being a spiritual being and the caretaker of Murasamemaru and all). This one can be played at any time, although playing it later will probably be more satisfying. 
As I said before either this one or Lena's route can be considered the ""true"" route of the game.

Koharu/Roka duo-route is a bonus route that splits into two mini routes for each sub-heroine towards the end. Both routes are fairly unrelated to the initial common route plot and focus entirely on [spoiler]the cafe and the related girls.[/spoiler]
You can play this route at any point (although you need to clear any main route first in order to unlock it), but if you aren't interested in either of them you can safely skip them.

As such my recommended play order would be Yoshino > Mako > Lena > Murasame, with Koharu and Roka tossed in anywhere inbetween.

[h1] Art and Sound Impressions [/h1]
The game features roughly 10 beautiful event CG with an additional 4 H-Scenes for each heroine. The count is a little on the low side, however there's lots of cute chibi SD art to make up for it.
The liberal use of character sprites during regular scenes also helps to alleviate this issue. It's impressive how lively a character can turn out if you let them change sprites even multiple times during the same voice line, even if there aren't all that many pose and face variants.

The soundtrack is great too, with a theme befitting the village Hori. Each heroine also has their own theme in both a normal and more intimate variation, as well as their own ED song. The regular songs while playing shine the most though.

Overall voice acting is great too with all non-protagonist voice lines fully voiced. 
Some heroines like to get loud as they become flustered though, so an option to limit the discepancy between whispering and shouting would have been nice (to be fair, there is an integrated quick-access sound slider in the chat box to mitigate this). This is only a little gripe though.

[h1] Technical Stuff [/h1]

As mentioned before this version is a porn-free release, with a free patch available from their official website. Installing the patch doesn't break anything on the steam-side of things, so big thumbs up here. 
There are some scenes that will be foggy or censored in other ways to hide naked bodies, but it doesn't affect the overall experience of the core story. Whether you should use the patch or not is entirely up to personal preference.

The game runs in a native 1080p window, but scales just fine up to 1440p when applying fullscreen. The window can be freely resized (while still maintaining aspect ratio), but there is no easy way to reset it to its native 1080p resolution once you do so. Swapping between window mode and fullscreen can be done smoothly on the fly, and thanks to the ""panic button"" minimize feature you can easily mute and pop the game into the background while multitasking. (Even if the feature isn't quite intended that way) 

The ""Flowchart"" feature, combined with a powerful backlog that allows jumping between scenes, voice-lines and even previewing backgrounds while browsing makes it especially easy to navigate to your next route or favourite scene. This is also very handy for completionists. It would be great if this became a standard for visual novels going forward.
There's also a voice-line bookmark feature. This is a niche feature but I found myself using it for funny moments, so I'm glad it was included, but I can't see many players using it.

There's also a lot of customizability in the game's settings menu that I would like to see in many visual novels going forward. Things like your typical text size, speed as well as background and read-text colors, but also other things like auto-skipping, BGM balance split for voice lines and mouse gestures. 
Full customization of the chatbox bar and mouse gestures, as well as a touch-UI option for streaming to a phone makes for a very enjoyable reading experience.

In the game's ""Extra"" section (namely the Gallery) you'll find unlocked CG and music, as well as a Scene select for H-Scenes and a Sprite Mode. The Sprite Mode allows you to put characters in your preffered poses on the background of your choice. Nice feature to have, although I've personally only used it to review character outfits.",1599151143,1606331667,True,50,0,0.817995190620422363,3,True,False,False

Of all Yuzusoft games I played, this one is by far my favorite, for me it deserves being bought at full price, it has a long length for a VN, but that's just my personal opinion. 

Pros:
-Beautiful and relaxing OST.
-Charming characters.
-The girls aren't constantly fighting for the MC. 
-High resolution CG's.
-Panic button (it really saved me).
-Interesting story, and routes
-Easy system to get the route you want.
-Mako
-Murasame singing Kagome Kagome, and Toryanse

Cons:
-It takes some time getting to the H scenes, other than that, I have nothing else to say, I really enjoyed the whole VN


-The OST is perfect for this game, and since I love japanese instruments, I have nothing to complain about. I fell in love in the first couple of minutes

- I have a 1080p monitor, and usually for VN's, if I play in fullscreen, the CG's start getting blurry, and I have to play it windowed in a lower resolution (which I hate). 
 On the other hand, for this VN, you can easily play fullscreen without losing the CG quality.

-The designs are gorgeous and every character is really charming, it's the first time I can say wholeheartedly ""I like every single character"" in a VN. And the best thing about it, is that you have none of that sh*tty rom-com troupe of the girls fighting over the MC.

-It is one of those VN in which the more routes you play, the more you understand about the game, which normally, is kinda of bothersome (if you just play the routes for the girls you like), but on this one, I really enjoyed learning more about the world, and also, there weren't incongruencies you usualy see in VN's build this way

-And if you are interested in the +18 aspect, I will say, the scenes are really good, as for the amount of H scenes with each girl, for the main 4 girls, is 3(with the exception of Mako who has 1 more CG in which she is playing with herself). For the other 2, it's 2. You then have the after story which  adds one more scene to every girl.
 If you are wandering how  long it takes to get to the H scenes, I will say it takes quite some time

Since this game came out a year after Sanoba Witch (both made by Yuzusoft), I expected some slight improvements and thankfully I felt like there were more than enough improvements.

The most notable was how the main story never lost its focus. It either got resolved during the common route or it expanded on certain character routes, this is a huge plus. Speaking of which, each of the main 4 routes (Yoshino, Mako, Murasame, Lena) were super good. All had something different to offer, all of them had some very memorable moments and genuine surprises. Not to say I didn't enjoy the side routes which felt like a seperate common route, splitting into two choices at the end (Roka and Koharu).

Another big thing is, that while the story was set up in a way that Yoshino is definitely the main choice, the game never forced me to actually pick her (like how in Sanoba Witch it kinda didn't really make a lot of sense to pick anyone else than Nene). Every girl had a fairly even chance, I never felt like the game truly ever showed heavy favoritism towards Yoshino. Truly intimate moments with the girls (which actually had any meaning) only show up on their respective routes. I don't know if character favoritism is a thing in previous Yuzusoft games, but even if it isn't, I feel like this is at least somewhat important.

I really liked the character development, especially with Yoshino and Murasame. It was such a heartwarming experience to see them change throughout the story, becoming much more free and open people. It was well written and well acted.

The MC is very likeable and relatable. Sure he's a bit exaggerated, but I think it was the healthiest thing to do in this game's case.

The music was also great, I liked most of the tracks in the game.

Now for the routes:

[b]Yoshino[/b]: When I completed this route, I felt super emotional with my teary eyes and felt like it was one of the most fulfilling story I've ever read. You know the writing is good when all the feels suddenly hit you, and hit you hard. While I felt like some important pieces were missing, the story still felt complete to me.

[b]Mako[/b]: While I think her's was the weakest of the 4 routes, I'd stay it was still ""good"" if not anything else. It was nice to see Mako's viewpoint, her cute quirks and weaknesses and just generally getting to know her better. I think it just simply lacked some of the impact Yoshino's route had if I had to pick on something.

[b]Murasame[/b]: For whatever reason, I didn't have a lot of expectations regarding her route, but I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought I would. Since in her case almost everything was resolved during the common route, it lacked some tension... or at least I first thought. While the outcome became fairly obvious soon and lost that impact quickly, I liked it for what it was. Oh BOY Masaomi was an absolute BADASS in this route. I could feel my beard growing from all that testosterone and manliness.

[b]Lena[/b]: Seriously, was this the canon route or what? We got to know a LOT more... and I mean A LOT more information about the main story (curse, the past, etc.) in this route than in Yoshino's, which hid a lot of the finer details. As far as the routes themselves goes, there is no competition, this one's the best. It involves the other characters a lot more as well, not like in other routes where most of the other characters become more or less side characters. Here, everyone gets together while Lena still remains in the focus, as she should. Someone mentioned here that Lena might be secretly the main girl and I kinda agree.

As for the characters themselves:

[b]Yoshino[/b]: I absolutely loved Yoshino. She goes through the most changes in a positive way, while her charming quirks still remain. Her change felt super genuine and not forced. She was also cute as heck.

[b]Mako[/b]: I didn't feel particularly attached to Mako, but she's a more than fine character nonetheless. Her story was interesting and she showed that she's a lot more vulnerable than she lets on.

[b]Murasame[/b]: I usually don't like the loli archetype, mostly because I find their personalities and voices annoying, not in her case. She was an absolute sweetheart and her VA did an amazing job so that she'd feel genuine instead of being annoying. Very fun personality.

[b]Lena[/b]: Did you say positivity? Again, did I hear you saying POSITIVITY? Sure that's not all there's to it, but I absolutely adored Lena and felt like that she might as well be the main heroine. Of course she wasn't perfect or invulnerable, but she was definitely the most honest and genuine girl out of all of them right from the getgo. She was also the funniest girl, no contest there. I'm pretty sure if you outright hate Lena you're a bad person.

[b]Roka[/b]: Like, holy hell she looks hotter than the hottest sun in the universe. I usually don't talk about how characters look, but damn that's DEFINITELY an attractive 2D character. I don't especially like the ""Onee-san"" archetype, but in this case, it was never overplayed or was overused. Her personality felt unique and very fun, I wish she was one of the main heroines. At least you can romance her so I can't complain too much.

[b]Koharu[/b]: With Mako, I didn't feel very attached to Koharu, but at the same time I had no issues with her. She was really cute, but that's all there's to it in my case.

I had an absolute blast playing this. All of the VAs did a fantastic job in general, especially Yoshino's, Roka's, Murasame's and Lena's. I enjoyed even some of the side characters as well, especially Genjuuro. He's pretty complex for just a side character and also likeable.

A below average VN whose execution is worse than the last title (sabbat) and has a story I don't find enjoyable. Which is ironic as this one hardly touches the school tropes I'm so sick of.

This is my second Yuzusoft VN and next time I won't be so quick to buy another one of their games (afaik there is two and possibly three titles coming). I'm not saying Yuzusoft is bad or anything. I was just hoping for something better and I am cautious now. If I had to choose I'd hope for Dracu-Roit to come out next but I'm not sure the status of that one as the translation exchanged hands iirc.

I found Yoshino's route tiring. Not my fav character to begin with, but grows on you a little. It's mostly the story that turns it into a slog. Nothing all that exciting, no twists I didn't see coming, and ultimately lacking in humor that might make it a bit less wearisome. 

Mako's route... made me sad as she was the character I took a liking to in Yoshino's route, but unfortunately her personality undergoes too much of a change imo. That's not to say it's an unbelievable change, just not one I like.

I have yet to play any of murasame's route but I'm not getting my hopes up from reviews I've read.

No. But I had my own reasons for sticking with it, like practising my Japanese, and an academic interest in Japan in general, and visual novels as a form of Japanese popular culture in particular. Did I like it? On balance, yes, but the same caveat applies, with the addition that some of what I liked probably did not survive the translation. Did I buy the soundtrack? Another yes. But the question is, would I recommend this, and I honestly don't know to whom I would.

If you're new to visual novels, surely there are better and more beginner-friendly options.
If you have a few under your belt, chances are you'll find it mediocre, and who has time for that?
If you're a veteran you've no need of my recommendation, one way or the other.

FWIW, a lot of what I liked -- the soundtrack, art, setting, and world-building -- can be fully experienced in the free trial. If that captivates you, even knowing that it doesn't get better than that, and considerably worse in some aspects, go for it.

The main story was engaging enough, and each character's route diverged quite a bit rather than ""same event but different person.""  The artwork was cute, colorful, and attractive, and although the girls tended toward large chests it wasn't as pronounced as for example Wagamama High Spec.

The voice acting was a delight.  The voices were well-done and expressive.  Each of the characters had unique speech patterns and affectations, from Mako's ""choppiri"" and Murasame's ""wagahai"" to Lena's ""tatami-gami.""  The completely adorable voice failures were superbly bookmark-able as well.

The writing was mostly good.  While there were parts I wish they'd done differently such as the infrequent occasions where main character Masaomi was a jerk, overall it didn't leave much room to gripe.

That leaves the ever-looming elephant in the room, Localization.  The localization was solidly mediocre: I've seen better, I've seen worse, and most of the time it got the job done, but it was also inconsistent, ranging from a faithful re-telling to creative fan-fiction.  The localization lacked the feeling of overall consistency and direction characteristic of a top-tier localization, with the same phrases used in the same contexts localized differently at different times.  Lena's route provides perhaps the best and worst examples of this, where some of her catastrophic Japanese failures are explained clearly while other renderings are completely head-scratching.  In other places the translator didn't even try, for example turning ""It's my first time enveloped in such soft fluffiness"" into ""I'm getting a lap pillow.""

Fortunately, the game engine provides bilingual subs, so when I was dissatisfied I could read the original myself [spoiler]especially in the R-18 scenes unlocked by the publisher patch, which tended into the head-scratching realm[/spoiler].

Senren * Banka is not the deepest or most emotionally moving or twisted or surprising or beautiful or captivating but the content is good and there is a lot of it.  The pacing worked perfectly for shorter reading sessions when I'm home from work or between doing other things.  I see no reason to discourage buying it, and if you have any questions the free demo should let you know if you'd like it or not.

I was looking forward to completing the game so I could move on to others, but the feeling of completion is bitter-sweet:

Still a highschool setting, but the school itself is really on the periphery--the focus is more on the rich lore of the small village our main character finds himself in.  Each route helps build a more complete picture of just what happened in the past of this town, and no one heroine really takes the center stage like Nene in Sabbat did.

What results from this change in focus is that Senren Banka feels a bit more unfocused than Sabbat, with a story that feels fractured between all the routes--there is no ""true"" route that pulls all the elements together into a cohesive whole.  Each route ends with valuable context missing for why things happen.  That said, it's ALSO nice that no heroine feels particularly lesser in importance,  Pick a heroine without fear that she's the one that got added in just to check a box off.

[h1] Overall: 6.5/10 [/h1]

[Senren＊Banka], in my opinion, has its own place right in the middle of VN spectrum: Not too heavy of a story and not too focused on ""special scenes"". A leisure read that does not weight down too much on your conscience, but also does not leave that big of a memorable souvenir in your mind either. It could be judged as something 'too average' and 'too cliche', but we all know that sometimes we just want to blast through a feel-good read and enjoy a heartwarming average story. [Senren＊Banka] scratches that of itch pretty well.

[b] Design: 8/10 [/b]

The strongest part. Nothing much to critique about this, as everything is almost how it should be as Yuzusoft's game. There are some problem with proportion on some of the CGs, but to my non-artistic untrained eyes, I do not see that much of errors. The cast are designed very attractively, as well as the sprites and SD sprites, which constitute the standard charm of most modern VNs. 

[b] Story: 5.0/10 [/b]

In my opinion, the weakest aspect of the whole. I have not read many recent VNs lately, but it seems that the one that I did (post 2015) focused too much on each story segments and neglect to seemlessly connects common route to character routes in a seemless, coherent manner. A lot of stuff happens during the common route and the narrative there is quite enjoyable, while most of the characters' arcs were almost too bland and cliche to the point of being almost a filler. I almost felt like I have finished reading the whole story after the common route ends and there was no need to read any further. There are some routes that are exceptions, in which the narrative from the common route continues to be relevant throughout, but most of them hardly ever answer the questions set in the common route. This really kills the urge to replay the VN after finishing everything.

Another disappointing aspect to the story is that everything feels too ""optimistic"". The situation dealt a god-like hands to our cast almost all the time, and I felt almost no tension from the scenes in which other VNs with tense situation would keep me on edge (I am talking to you, Kara no Shoujo). I felt that the character does not have things 'at stakes' despite the situation portrayed them to do so, and that made the story felt too bland on the serious side despite having serious tone of lore with Japanese mythical curses, gods, and legend.

[spoiler] Story enjoyment: Lena > Murasame >> Mako >>>>>> Yoshino 
- Yes, most of us played the Yoshino arc first, and after finished every arc I was really annoyed by the fact that Yoshino route meagerly, if not least, contributed to the lore of the medium and cursed spirit despite being the priestess route.
- On the other hand, even without a proper elaboration to the curse and the medium, Murasame's arc was the only one who shed light on what eventually happen to Murasame after the end of the curse, while other route completely, or almost completely, forgot about her existence altogether. 
- Lena's arc was the reason I gave story score about 5 (average), as I like the symbolism that played there with ""The local problem of a conservative, traditional community solved by a pair of outsiders who turned to be the one who care the most"". If only there was a ceremony to enshrine Murasamemaru back like in Murasame's arc, Lena's arc would be almost perfect. [/spoiler]

[b] Character & Development: 6/10 [/b]

This pains me the most as there is a lot of potential here, and at one point it almost able to break through the filter of infamous Japanese tropes. What I like about characters in this VNs is that almost all of them started with their own specific archetypes, but later on show several signs that they have other layers in which they could feel like a legit natural character in non-Japanese media. However, those signs quickly dissipates as the common route reaches climax and became almost non-existent during character arcs. Character's portrayal also tends to fluctuate a lot during the latter part, when they either goes in circle or revert back and forth between their developed and undeveloped part. Which makes me grit my teeth in pain for such a missed opportunity to perfection.

All negatives aside, I actually quite enjoyed the (existed) character growth in most of the routes, and the attempt to make several characters cross their archetype, although not 100% succeeded, was charming and refreshing for me. (like in figurative sense, The Coo-dere does not remain only as one, while the annoying small char does not remain annoying or loud throughout.)   

[spoiler] Character enjoyment: Murasame = Yoshino >> Lena > Mako > The Childhood Friends
- Murasame and Yoshino received most of the chances to break through their old archetype to become a well-round attractive character with a sense of their former self left as little spice. Although I would slightly rate Murasame a bit higher as her character arc has a much more fulfilling and fitting closure to the story aspect. 
- Mako was the one who I felt was the biggest missed opportunity I mentioned above[/spoiler]

[b] Music and Voice acting: 7/10 [/b]

Music: Nothing too fancy, nothing horrible. The most proper term I could say here is ""fitting"". Everything goes very well with its rural Japanese aspect of the game.

VA: I was prepared to be annoyed by some of the voices judging from the character design, however, everything turned out to be very pleasing. I was actually shocked how different the voice range of Yoshino were portrayed throughout the game, which kind of strange for her character archetype, but all in all, I enjoyed it quite a lot.

Voice enjoyment: Yoshino >>>> Murasame > Mako > Childhood friends > Lena

[b] Extra scenes: 8/10 [/b]

Yes, we all know why we are here, and I can say with confidence that this is has been done well and upto Yuzusoft's standard. 


[b] Summary [/b]

Despite talking a lot about its flaws. I am by no mean saying that I do not enjoy this VN. Minus all the negative parts, it was a very comforting, leisure read with cute character design and good atmosphere. There are AAA quality visual novels out there, but sometimes, you just need something easy-reading, decent VN to pass the time. This is one of the top-quality of such type.

Now, that I've finished the game I can give a proper opinion - I'm not disappointed. It's your typical release from Yuzuosft, which delivered exactly what I expected from it, and sets the bar up quite high for Riddle Joker.

Good common route as far as moeges are concerned, pretty good individual routes which don't vary in quality that much (unlike in Sanoba Witch), although the transitions to romance could be done a little bit better. Godlike art and soundtrack once again remain the highlight of the VN.

The common route took me about 12 hours to complete, each main character route seems to be about 10 hours ± 2 hours, while the side heroine routes (only did Koharu's so far) took about 4-5 hours. 

So far I am extremely happy with my purchase of this game. The art and character designs are phenomenal in my opinion and the music does a great job of setting the tone of the scene and really drawing you into the atmosphere of the story.

The comedy in the game was a great distraction from my loneliness on Valentines Day and kept me laughing for a large portion of what I read so far. The scenarios were also made very believable by the writing in the story. Though, I am usually a laid back reader, so if something is ""bad writing"" I wouldn't really care or be able to tell unless it really stood out.

The romance in the game was very well done, felt believably, and had really sweet moments too. At the moment, Murasame is best girl for me, but both Yoshino's and Murasame's routes were very good, and handled the drama/struggles aspects well. In Koharu's route, I also liked the [spoiler]love triangle that ensued between her and Roka; I thought it was cool to see the interactions between them.[/spoiler]

Lastly, the technical features of the game are superb, some of the best I have seen in a visual novel, and I have read many. There is a voice bookmark feature which is improved from their previous novel, a customizable menu bar (the bar that is at the bottom of the text box), and bindable keybinds, which is rare (in my experience) to see in a visual novel.

So far this has been a great vn, and I don't regret buying it. I greatly enjoy the characters, story, setting, and fantasy aspect.

The story is very generic with very convenient solutions. This leads to very little or short tension in the story. The common route is like a basic essay assigned to and written by a middle schooler. The branching routes let you explore the heroines and learn more about the curse from different perspectives. The branching routes are different in that they offer more insight into the lore of the legend, which i liked. However, how you ""hook-up"" with each heroine has exactly the same format. Which cheapens the replayability. 

-ART: 10/10 
The characters look great and the facial reactions do a great job portraying their reactions. I'm mostly impressed with the backgrounds. There's so much detail in most scenes that my eyes can help but explore.

-Music: 9/10
The music is very enjoyable and there are a few that I wouldn't mind playing on repeat on my playlist.

TLDR: Game has good art and music. Story is terribly boring and how you get with each girl is exactly the same: spend some time with her, they realize their feeling, confess, then sex in that exact order.",1582277005,1582277005,False,27,6,0.577581644058227539,0,True,False,False

Senren * Banka is a release I've been waiting for quite a while and I haven't been let down in the slightest. I'm disappointed about one or two things but I'm just nitpicking, nothing game-breaking and whatnot.

I did play through the four main routes, though, so after giving it some thought I decided to write a review anyway.

Senren＊Banka is a great game. The art is top-notch (also the first 1080P title by Yuzusoft), the cast beats out just about any other game's in terms of talent and experience, and the tracks include quite a few memorable ones, especially the opening theme song, Koikou Enishi. Each of the four main routes also manages to tell an engaging story, with Lena's route being the closest to the core plot of the game, which comes off as a surprise given her role as a foreign student in the village. On top of all that, Yuzusoft's customized Kirikiri engine famously provides for a highly configurable and enjoyable gaming experience.

In short, this game is well worth its price tag, with or without discount - you won't regret buying it, period. Buying it will also support NekoNyan in their quest to introduce more high quality VNs to the western market - especially given the incredibly exciting news that they have now convinced and partnered with another great VN developer SAGA PLANETS to publish an English version of Kin'iro Loveriche, SAGA PLANETS's 2017 work that was so successful in Japan it prompted them to make their first fan disk in over a decade. I can't wait for the day when all of the great games made by Yuzusoft and SAGA PLANETS receive the renown they deserve by fans all around the world. (Sorry for using this review to blatantly lobby NekoNyan for more SAGA PLANETS titles; as a devout fan of SAGA PLANETS and especially of Karumaruka＊Circle, I couldn't resist. Both Yuzusoft and SAGA PLANETS are located in Osaka, and they often ran joint campaigns to promote each other's works, so hopefully this little bit of digression can be forgiven.)",1581924714,1581926622,True,8,0,0.622425615787506104,0,True,False,False

This game had me laugh my heads off several times 

What great about this VN is, it has choke full of humors. It can be dull at times but it is still a great buy. I love how some of the characters have awkward taste or sang a creepy song at the ""in the best of times: XD. Rolls my head off reading it and listening to the vocals. You can even save the vocal (which I did for the creepy song) at certain situation. 

The other great thing about this VN is if you chose to go to another path in the selection menu, you do no need to start from the very beginning, there is a path tree that can get you back to the path you want to choose so you do not need to start from the very beginning.

Expect a full 80 hours to complete one route. That is depend on your reading speed and etc. The only downside is it is not made using E-mote engine. However, the chibi factor in this game is way over the top, cute and funny at the same time.

Definetly, I am going to look out for the any VN publish by this published in the future.
