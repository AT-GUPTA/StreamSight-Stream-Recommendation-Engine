Features:

MyCareer
Story is meh like pretty much every year. 

So let just go to my rookie season with the Lakers

* Best record in the league (68-14)
* League Assist Leader
* League Steals Leader
* Rookie of the year
* Defensive 1st team
* Broke the record for most steals in a game

Shirt sales: 137th.

What? I did all that and there are 13 complete NBA teams still in front of me with regards to shirt sales?

Other weird things in my team: 
* for some reason my teammates like alley-oops so much that missing one or two each game is acceptable
* players on a fast break suddenly stopping or refusing to run into open space
* players going out of bounds or making 3 second violations in every single game
* my 3-point specialist receives a pass when he's wide open, turns to wave to his girlfriend in the skybox, pump fakes a non-existent defender and instead of making a shot, drives up to the rim to get blocked. This happened a lot.
* defenders, instead of blocking the lane, rolling out the red carpet, a welcome mat and a cold drink so the opposing team can score in complete comfort
* I hate Kuzma (ok that might not be weird)

Weird things with opponents:
* Ridiculous numbers of blocked shots vs fouls
* Ridiculous numbers of steals vs fouls
* Players going unbelievably hot. I don't mind them shooting really well but if in a quarter they start hitting 50/60% green shots even with the defense all over them it becomes a joke. 

Weird things in general
* The rubber banding, especially on higher difficulties, is ridiculous. Teams just hit green shot after green shot, block, steal all the while my players missing even the simplest of layups if it isn't green
* Poked balls bouncing around like we're playing with a giant bouncy ball
* Shooting meter doesn't make any sense. 
* Training is boring as hell and there's no explanation on how the star system works. I had a defense training where I stopped 8 out 10 attempts and had 1 star out of 3.
* Sponsor awards are not tailored to your player at all. It's always nice to be able to choose extra money for the number of blocks I make with my 6'3 point guard

MyTeam is a complete grind where even the number of contracts you can have is limited and player upgrades requirements are just stupid, having to make a dunk with Dwayne Wade while his dunking is set to something like 52 is just meant to be annoying. It has nothing to do with it being challenging. The online part is unplayable due to the high amount of people using hacks.

MyLeague is fun for a while but that's about it. Having Maravich score a 101 points was funny as hell.

I have played MyGM for a little while but not enough to form an opinion on it

2K took away ""myCareer"" from this game when they shut down the servers. This is a single player campaign type mode that, for some reason, is tied to 2K's shuttered servers.

I will NEVER buy any 2K game  that requires the internet to play it. Stay the fuck away from 2K Games that require an internet connection. 

TO VALVE: Please crack down on this type of nonsense and BAN developers or companies that behave this way on Steam. Require single player games to have OFFLINE options so that we can go back and play our game when companies shut down online services.

Here is a review of 2K's NBA 2K20 developed by Visual Concepts

I've been playing this game for 2 weeks. It was a good career experience, enjoyed my time but to be honest it gets boring after about 60 hours. The reason is you are always listening to the same commentary while playing games, it takes a lot of time to start every single game and you aren't able to skip some animations. Also, everything is identical, you see this after your first 20 hours. It's hard to earn VC and you really need it. VC is in-game money by the way and you need it to upgrade your player's overall rating. I've played a few different NBA games than this one and 2k20 is definitely harder than others, it is really hard to green release at the beginning, don't rage when you can't hit threes just get badges and check youtube for some tips. 
There are plenty of game modes to play such as MyTEAM, MyLEAGUE, MyGM, MyCAREER.
I suggest you play offline, there are always cheaters and legends in MyPARK. And you can't win games.
Don't give 60 dollars or 50 euros whatever your currency is just wait for sale it's not worth that much price.
These are what you have to know before the main review, here it comes:

First of all, I want to point out the graphics. They are truly realistic. This doesn't mean good, the game just looks real at all.
I will not be talking about the other game modes but MyCAREER. You start as a college basketball player, then a few things happen (I am not going to spoil) and you go to NBA Drafts. Everything goes step by step. You even choose the song to play when you hit a three if you come to that level. A good story goes slowly, it always continues. I had my own designed shoes too. You basically will enjoy it. But the worst part is the gameplay. Don't expect to hit all of your shots or layups or free throws. This game takes time to improve your build. You will not be able to get an A+ teammate grade every game. About bugs; there are minor bugs that won't annoy you while playing, you won't feel them. You need a pretty good PC to play without lags. 
These are all I can say, a good sports game. Wait for sale as I said before. A tip, get quick draw and range extender badges for shooting. Now I will link some screenshots and a bug from our game. Thanks for reading.

An example of a bug, I had 10 points but there's 8 below

The game itself feels like it has less RNG and provides a more skill based gaming experience (which is very much appreciated honestly).  Overall, pretty good for a NBA2k game.

MyTeams is great to play with any of the NBA players from the current rosters and from earlier years.  Old school players that have long since retired.  They even let you try and recreate their many great games.  You'll definitely invest a lot of hours into the gameplay for sure.

EDIT: So I found out that even if you don't care about the online servers being down; it also locked out even career mode.  Career mode.  The one thing you would assume would be fine so you can still play with your own created player, and play the scripted beginnings.  It doesn't make sense to have it linked solely with the online.  

I can see how it would be locked because they would force your stats to be linked with online play to also get tokens to upgrade your player.  I believe online should be split because of this reason.

- I completely agreed, I just reinstalled this pile of garbage, that's what it is now, that I can not access my career and my team. Uninstalling now. If this is going to happen with each of NBA 2K iteration, I don't want it. Servers down = losing my career mode. Wtf man, the whole point of the game for some players.

The issue is that the MyCareer mode is online only. Which is a stupid anti piracy tactic which punishes paying players. The real problem is they shut down the servers on a 3 year old game that still plays and looks great. Meaning you can't even play MyCareer mode at all anymore.

Just noticed that 2K20's server was shut down, which shut down MC for for no good reason.

It was the player's data, player's money that traded for stats in MC. You just shut it down even without any data migration to future 2Ks?

2K is a crappy company and I saw it coming from their biased politics on BLM. I read that in 2K2022 MC they injected some female player agent, equal right BS again. Could it be that the industry is not biased, but that FEMALE agents don't want to be agent for MALE clients and vice versa? Why broadcast some fake feminism BS while you treat players like sh*?

F**k 2K.

Update: Today NBA 2K dared to force me to watch a 30 seconds BLM political ad when I started a match. Really? 

Who do you think you are? The ad said silence = murder then asked people to vote, obviously for Democrats. What is it? Do you 2K drughead marketing managers know that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer cannot even read George Floyd's name right?

Original Review:

Downtime for George Floyd ONLY, really? Why can't you keep your political message out of video games? Does Mr. Floyd have anything to do with the NBA?

How about you ALSO honor the innocent lives and properties being taken away in the riots?

How about instead of shoveling a political message down the players throat, you actually make the game better? Like a BLM dedicated event is better than this ""memoriam"".

I understand the logistics behind terms and conditions to use a product I buy but to permanently shut down my career and other single-player-related game modes is ridiculous.

NBA 2K is the only video game franchise to permanently shut down single-player servers as well as multiplayer servers.

The reason why they do this every 2 years is most likely due to money (in-game currency).

I never bought in-game currency in any 2K game to boost my character's stats, but I instead put in my time and effort into this game while having as much fun as I could playing it.

I can remember the days of grinding 2K finally paying off in single-player when I first started to drop 30 points in every game like MJ, and now it's all down the drain.

NBA 2K is the same concept every year.

This was my second NBA 2K purchase on PC. NBA 2K16 being my first and NBA 2K21 being my last when I got it.

The story behind NBA 2K16 was memorable. Vic Van Lier was a long-time, best friend of Frequency Vibrations (Freq) and he was with you almost every basketball game sitting court-side until he started getting himself into more trouble time and time again.

Now with NBA 2K20 things are a little more basic as Che stands up for his teammate who was injured and eventually lost his scholarship. After speaking out against the coach, the college, and the system, Che drops out with one semester left, jeopardizing his path to the NBA.

Nowadays with NBA 2K21, we have a regular guy with the name of ""OG"" with no direction or backstory to the NBA.

NBA 2K is losing its roots as a single-player arcade recreational game that was all about basketball.

All that's left of NBA 2K and the future of it in my eyes is in-game currency.

I never paid to have a better advantage, but 2 years is too short for a proper length to be able to enjoy the story of NBA 2K and to finally be one of the greatest of all time.",1647244864,1647244864,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

About as cashgrabby as the sims, only with the sims, at least you aren't forced into a horrible online mode, and the cashgrabbing isn't as pervasive. 

Single player mode is forced online, and everything costs VC which you can buy for real money, or spend several hours of your life trying to earn in order to come close to having a competitive chance. Everything from your character's attributes to the clothes they wear costs this currency and the kicker is they've hidden a lot of the customisation behind the online gameplay, forcing you to grind not only VD but also 'rep' points to unlock things like animations and rides and customisation options for your court. 

Basically all the fun is taken out of Single player mode, and stashed behind a paywall. Want to ride a skateboard around the neighborhood? Not only do you have to unlock it by playing online games until you grind enough rep levels, but you also have to grind about sixty to seventy thousand VC points to buy one. And the VC you get for doing things is abysmal. If you skip the story part you get placed into a team of your choosing but only make 500VC per game, without factoring in any bonuses. Otherwise you might start with something like 750VC per game. Even if you get a thousand per game that's still sixty games worth of VC you're trading in for one skateboard. Clothes cost anywhere between a few hundred to several thousands of VC, and you can't find shoes for less than a few thou. It's done this way to encourage people to pay real $$ of course, but it's infuriating nevertheless. They dangle special events and lottery spinner things in front of you, to keep you thinking and hoping you could get a big pay-out, but the most I ever won was a few hundred VC.

Then there's the team mode, and if you thought the moneygrabbing bull stopped in the career mode, you thought wrong. Instead of just letting you make a team and maybe go through a season, train the players and stuff and sort of play this sports sim, it's basically a card game where you can buy cards with (you guessed it) real money (if you want of course. You can always grind for hours and hours instead). 

There's another mode where you take control of as many teams as you want, in a league, and play up to the championship. This is like the only mode that has no online and nothing you can really buy, It's also the least polished and most time-consuming. Though it's the one that gives you the most freedom, basically. You get to edit players and their attributes and stuff, and teams, from their names to their stadiums. it's really closer to team mode than team mode is. Team mode you draw cards and pick your best ones and hope you get enough contract extensions to cover another game (because each game is a whole contract year basically, and you have each player card for a limited # of games, unless you put an unlimited contract on them, which are rare and expensive af, as you can probably imagine). 

It's not all cons, there's a few pros. The voice acting is great from most of the actors (the basketball players are about as good as you can expect, I suppose). Some characters are better than others (Isa is great. The agent is barf) though. The graphics are good and the visuals are pretty nice for the most part. The story is decent but there's a lot of cringe. Music is meh. Not my type, really, but not really bad either, apart from the odd artist I dislike. 

Overall, it's not a horrible game but it's nowhere near 'good'. The single player mode being online was a huge mistake. The VC system is ridiculous too. Lag is a big issue. But the main problem with the game is that it's just not fun. So much boring, time-consuming grinding. So much is locked away to push the VC-buying through the online stuff, which is dead anyway because of just how horrible it's implemented in the first place. 

You've barely got anybody to play with in my country and those you do find, wont touch you unless you have spent dozens of hours grinding your overall first. So before you can grind online you need to grind offline in other modes unless you want to tank your player's chances in the league for good with your terrible starting stats. It's just ridiculous.

I can't rec this game to anybody. Not even masochists.

Have not bought 2k21 or 2k22 after 2K showed the middle finger to PC, that is not releasing next-gen for PC.   Now that my rant is over. The kicker was I had bought VC for a new build (first time as a post scorer) not realising the servers would be shutdown.",1641196052,1641196052,False,2,0,0.502958595752716064,0,True,False,False

Set difficulty to Hall Of Fame makes it too hard but then tweeking the sliders to make it more balance does not work because this will make it too easy for some reason.

Ive only found 2 bugs, after challenging a foul and overturning it the camera will focus on the bench when it should focus on the jump ball causing a loss possession. The other is when passing in the inbound the ref would bug and just hold the ball, only way to get around this is to save and quit or call a time out. 2k has not fixed issues but they have been adding ridiculous feature which doesn't make the game fun at all.",1636753677,1636753677,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Examples:
For some reason now there is a better chance of shooting an early shot and it going in, then shooting a slightly early just off the green window.
No matter what 2K promises the servers will never be good, because if 2K can manage to save any money for in exchange for in game performance, you'll be safe to bet a billion dollars that they will surrender customer experience for MONEY.
Shot contest is a joke. You can contest a shot / layup and be given 'good shot contest' only for the shot to go in. 

Don't buy the game now. Wait until next year. The game will be much more polished ( hopefully ) and you will have a better experience compared to buying it right now. 

In totality, 2K is so out of touch with their community and game. Simple bugs and glitches aren't even noticed by the dev team, but are noticed within the first 20 minutes of launch by the community. They released another un-finished product per usual.

2K doesnt care theyll just sell the next years game to fools. It wont be this fool. A game they barely change year to year and they still dont fix the glitches and problems that make it so a decent amount of players CANT EVEN PLAY THE DAMN GAME!

And cant get shit help from 2K they dont give a crap. Community advice is the only thing to try and unlucky for me their several fixes have not worked for me. A game that they sell for an arm and a leg should not need the community coming up with all the way to MAKE THE GAME PLAYABLE!

 Extreme Microtransactions. [/b]

[i]2K[/i] has always been my go-to NBA Sim. I’ve always and only bought [i]2K[/i] for casual exhibition games and [i]MyGM[/i] playthroughs and never really dug into [i]MyCareer[/i]. I decided to go and really do it this year. I didn’t really hate the grind that much because I personally enjoy doing so and I thought it was fast enough to at least get to 85~90 without spending a single dime plus getting your badges up and running early is fairly manageable to me. But for most people who can’t spend 100+ hours in games, I can definitely see why it still feels like a legit grind. What I find ridiculous is that it has the greediest microtransaction system in any online game I’ve messed around with and it has been a horrible cycle of deliberate money-grabbing each year! I haven’t even touched [i]MyTeam[/i]. The fact that they always price 2K games at a full AAA tag like they are actual new games, which clearly are not, and still has this much ‘Casino’ inside is just straight up BS. Everything that makes any game enjoyable deserves praise, but this has been a blatant cash grab for multiple years now. I won’t talk about the good stuff and I’m giving it a negative feedback just to be on the player-base’s side who are clearly being milked for a long time already, with zero regard towards its loyalty.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

This game is still bad. A lot of bad glitches that should have been patched. From my understanding, some of them continue to be rereleased in the newest game. This just shows that 2k has not yet learned it's lesson. Honestly, I enjoy playing this game sometimes still, but there's an obvious problem if I'd rather play a game that's out of date than to buy the newer version. There's nothing marketable about their reskins of the same content. Honestly, just buy 2k19, it's the same game as 20 and 21 just without the myPlayer builder, and that's honestly not that much of a loss when you consider the money you can save if you look for a cheap price on something like G2A. 

The new myCareer builder seemed promising, but disappoints. If you don't have internet, by the way, don't bother, cause you can't even play offline anymore. Another bad re-skin of the same only content, released buggy and gross to meet stupid deadlines that no one really cares about except the corporate bums that lose money on them.

It's 2K19 with small changes, some for the better. What I liked the most is that now we have a visual clue when the ball is less protected and we can steal it without fouling. Also, in MyCareer you can choose what badges you'd like to unlock after you've gathered enough points to earn one. 

And there's the addition of the WNBA _ but since I only play MyCareer and MyGM, I probably won't play with/against those teams, so for me it's a useless change, although a welcome one. 

The worst is the lack of good stories in the offline modes. The prelude to MyCareer is short and bland, despite a good performance by Idris Elba; in 2K19, there were more characters and way more drama _ now, we've barely any journey. Also, in 2K19 MyGM had a long and also dramatic story, and now there's none! And we could create a team from scratch (I'll miss the Bronx Hard Ones, with Pickle Rick as logo); now you have to choose from one of the real-world franchises. Boring.  

It's also weird that we get accolades notifications during the games, but they're nowhere to be seen afterwards. 

I only recommend this during this deep sale, if, like me, you don't care about playing online, you're sick of 2K19 and you're not interested in 2K21 (maybe I'll get it a year from now, if it costs the same as a subway round trip; otherwise, I'll have pizza).

[i]Edit:[/i] One month after launch, 2K21 was already at 35% discount, something unheard of. It's almost December 2020 and the Neighborhood in 2K20 is still pretty populated, not that hard to play online matches (it wasn't the case for 2K19 after its sucessor came out). Maybe 2K will have to shake things around for 2K22 _ I hope so. No point in buying almost the same game every year...

[i]Edit 2:[/i] 2K21 was given away by another store and it's not worth it if you already have this one or 2k19 _ it's almost the same game, with less things (this time the Pre-Game Show was dumped) instead of additions (the new Neighborhood is the old one with things moved around, just to make it more confusing).",1598027888,1621955447,True,3,0,0.565443158149719238,0,True,False,False

Controls are easy and work well with both a controller and a keyboard, but if you want to play better and feel more control I would rather pick a controller. Graphics are great and surpass my expectations. The only problem with them is that the models often go through eachother and look fairly confusing.
Other than MyCareer and ""pickup"" games there is a multiplayer, MyLeague - in my opinion this mode is made the best of all of these that 2K20 contains. The game is highly compatible with both new and old computers and even simulating does not limit the computer very much.
If only there were any other up-to-date/new NBA-basketball games we could have a comparison, but right now 2K20 and 2K21 are the best basketball games made so far.

While there are a few head-scratching bugs that should have never made release, I've yet to find any that are game breaking.  It'd be nice if the mentor system actually worked, but you can edit your way around it.  It's a game that has years of refinement and a system that has been quite polished at this point.  I wish there was a way to separate the game from the developer, as 2k has turned into little more than a EA clone when it comes to their sports games.

My Team is the best feature ever seen in a sports game, and it's absolutely, ABSOLUTELY fair based on single player mode, i don't know  how it works in multiplayer and personally i don't care because you have years to spend in single player base and dynamic challenges to fill the album. Great, MASTER work, this and Draft Day Sports Pro (and College) Basketball are what a basketball purist needs for the last days of mankind!!


I recommended  this game after 72 hours of play but I feel the need to update my opinion on it. I think that the company does not respect its customers at all, firstly because it continues to sell it and secondly that it has completely abandoned the existing ones. The best feature of the game, MyTeam is completely broken. No matter how many times you beat your opponents in Domination, the win is not recorded and therefore you can not proceed to complete the challenges and collect the cards. 200 stars of Domintation, remain broken for months. So after a thousand hours of play, 2650 cards that I collected spending a lot of money and endless hours on the auction house, I am forced to stop. They could clearly announce before someone bought it that as soon as the new version of the game comes out, the old one is for throwing away ......

While it will load once in a while (the game on MyCareer) once in a while, it will consistently crash when I try to go to the Practice Facility...it'll let me go 2-3 times, but then sometime whenever the game decides it doesn't feel like starting up under ""MyCareer"" mode, I'll have to sometimes wait WEEKS for it to load again.

I've spent too much time on a build for me not to be able to PLAY it for weeks on end. I've been back and forth with 2k customer support and they want me to go rooting around inside MY machine, digging into the OS, doing this, doing that, none of it ever working...the problem is QUITE obviously on the DEVELOPERS end, as they can't created a consistent interface with the Practice Facility that doesn't keep crashing the game and keeping it crashed for long swaths of time in a row. 

After MONTHS (starting last October continuing until yesterday, when they told me they can't refund VC to try on another build to see if it's the build itself that has some error or not, and I see 2k21's reviews are even worse, so I cannot recommend this game at all. It's VERY frustrating to invest so much time into it not knowing if it's gonna crash, and knowing when it does, it's often weeks before it'll decide to load again.

It is the ONLY game I have such issues with, so I know the trouble isn't on my end, despite what customer service would have me believe. I've spent more time troubleshooting than I have playing! 

So...I'll have to just ignore 2ksports over this franchise at least until such point where others have played a while and aren't getting all these error codes to deal with. It's not fair to us players who put up money in good faith only to be told we wasted it along with our time since they won't transfer what represents a lot of time and effort put into a build that crashes all the time.

Great game concept -- LOUSY execution.

One thing I dislike is that legend is locked behind online play. With how badges work in this game, online seems kind of... not fun. Then you have me as a more casual player not wanting to play against sweaties. I think attributes should be boosted and badges completely negated in online to be fair.

This game it looks so much like FIFA, cause it could be so good and stinks so bad!

The thing I most like about Sport Games it's the carrer mode and the customization. The NBA2K Carrer Mode it's actually pretty good in comparison with FIFA. However, its not even a little noob friendly! I don't really know that much of basketball, but I really like to follow the nba and for me, this carrer mode it so much difficult, I can't make more than 10 points per game and makes me very frustrated. The fact that this mode is also pay to win (abou the VCs) just like the FIFA Ultimate Team, makes my experience much more disappointed.

The graphics and the immerson are such nice features that get lost in such a bad game :/

edit:
All right, as you may seen, when i had only 20 hours played i said that this games stinks, but now that i have more than 500 hours, i would say i recommend this game lol

my first impression of this game was very bad, and the main reason for this is the fact that the grind level on this game is hard man, but when you start getting better skills, you start having a really good time. :)

another thing to know is that, even though this game is not not noob friendly, after having a better notion on the nba rules and the nba2k commands, this game becomes so much better.

I miss having control of the entire team and roster in dynasty.. On this game once you pass the ball you computer does there own thing..

Guess what? You're not, you're hot rhino shit mixed in with a bag of old stale Pringles, yea taste that. How is a player rated 60-63 TEAM CAPTAIN of what I presume is a D1 college basketball program, HOW?! And how is it possible for someone who sucks as much as our starting players able to get drafted? How are you suppose to make any headway at becoming good? Here's how:

BUY VC

That's it. Trade that oh so valuable medium of exchange that can buy you food or ACTUAL entertainment. Now maybe you're asking, if I poured so many hours into this game playing MyCareer, I have to be one of these morons that wasted their money. NOPE, to effectively enjoy myself, I hacked the FUCK out this game. I stay away from multiplayer because that isn't fair, but to have any semblance of fun in NBA2k20, just find a trainer, seriously. 

2k has pushed the fact that they have monopolized the basketball video game industry to this point. You want you're player to play like a competent NBA basketball player? Pay us. You want to customize your suits, and playground gear? Pay us. You want to get some sneakers that maybe individualizes you? Pay us. You want to max out your attributes, set within a category you cannot break free from? Hey, fuck you, you're asking to much. You want to play in the Rec center? Oh did you change your mind, because no one's showing up? Fuck you, you're stuck here until you alt-tab out and quit the window. You want to scan your face into the game? Eh we barely worked on the functionality of it, so good luck trying to get it to work and when you do, don't be surprised when you look like an even more fucked up version of Quasimodo.

Play with NBA players who ALL look like their souls were stolen. Dead eyes and dead faces grimace, scream and smile horrifically. They look nowhere and at the same time look deep within your soul to somehow try and steal yours, I am not kidding here. As good as the players look, every single one of their faces remind me of what a body would look like in a casket on display with their eyes open. Now add to the fact these things move. 

The animations lock you in, there is no finesse in your player. If basketball was ever played like this, you might as well call it American football. You try to run a motion, or a screen you'll find yourself STICKING to players, screaming to remove yourself from their gravitational pull. Every single one of them. The AI can pull off crossovers effortlessly, try to have your 63 rated NBA (NBA is big league if you don't know) player do the same thing, go ahead and try. Loose ball.

Visual Concepts failed completely on the side of function and mechanics in this game. Why aren't our players rated at least 65 in college? How is a NBA draft contender playing worse than a 15 year old? How is it, with a 93 overall rating, my player (without any hacks or cheats enabled) is NOT able to sink an open 3 pointer? 

I'm rambling sorry.

Why is Idris Elba not my coach in the regular season? Where is Rosario Dawson throughout my career, what about Porter, dude never texts me or calls me or hits me up on 2kTwitter. This game tries to build the experience and illusion of you being a NBA player, but fuck me does it fail. You think you're at an oasis ready to drink water and BOOM the mirage disappears and your hand deep in camel shit about to bring it to your mouth to drink. And the voice actor for Che, God have mercy, I see after hiring Idris and Rosario, ya'll hit the bottom on funding and had to pull whoever this dude is. 

Why did I meet Lebron James when I got drafted? I was drafted to the bum ass Knicks and Lebron greets me into the league? What?!

I'm rambling again.

I don't have many days where I can go out and hoop around anymore, wish I could, I thought this would give some sort of semblance of hooping and maybe a taste of what NBA players may go through in their careers. Nah, what we are essentially given is (from the standpoint of playing MyCareer) is a fucking terrible movie and realization you spent money on this.

The passing is so bad that there are no common sense involved. I scored 45 points a game and only got A- whereas a mistake will cost you to downgrade. You dont get grades if you block/rebound as a center, and if you score from the post you dont get any grades too, only vc, which is like 2 coins, I mean if you score, meh, useless, its not important to score, its much more important to fucking do something else but scoring. Absolutely unable to double team or guard the rim without losing points from ""leaving assignment"", I mean seriously, defending the rim is also an assignment and not only guarding your man 1v1.

The pre match shows and animations for free throws takes FUCKING 10 MINUTES. So much errors and illogical nonsense. This game has to be voted one of the worse game ever made ever, absolutely no thought process and effort whatsoever.

But the multiplayer is a disaster, worst i ever see because the Neighbourhood is full of cheaters/hackers destroying game with lags and eye burning animation lags, that only happens by playing with cheaters.
Thats the most enoying part of the game.

POSITIV:
- Fantastik story mode but no variations after playing a while.
- Good my career mode to play alone (best part of the game)
- GFX is good. HD and 4K solution settings are possible. 

NEGATIV:
- moderate basketball move animation and not very smooth animation in motion transitions.
- very CPU intensive stress to system because of bugs and a lot of game crashes. (maybe cheaters action too)
- too much bugs, spezially keybindings, and network. Grafik-bugs, screen-bugs, lot of multiplayer lagging and skipping animation etc.
- keybinding are switching between default settings and own settings from time to time.

Mutiplayer not playable here some examples of a lot others:
- not able to chat or communicate with other players in neighborhood
- VOIP doesnt work properly and cause to game crash often 
- if VOIP works u got probölems in understanding players because of annoying ambiente sound like helicopter.
- forming groups squads cause to game crash very often.
- very often heavy network laggings.
- not able to find matchups in time
- cost to much time finding players of same level to play with.
- no balancing in finding equal players 
- no long time motivation to play.
- unablle skiping Intros/Animation/tvshows and at least after waiten 5 sec to be able to skip it. Annoying and time-consuming waiting espacially in second season after knowing all events/animation/tv-shows
- some bad and wrong implementation of BB Game rules, on fouls and time violations.
And if you know the basketball rules you will fast reconize that a lot of rules are implemented wrong. For example their is no shot clock violation if the ball leaves the shooters hand before times end and of course shot counts. But it does not in this game!!!!

After over 300 hrs playing i have to say ""what a bad game at all"". it makes me angry!
I woulnt buy this game again if i had a choice now. 
I buyed this game to play multiplayer with friends online on free court and all my friends quit playing this game. At the begin we are 11 players - now no one is playing anymore. 
Its such a waste of Time!!!

Lets say it this way -> i want my cash back!!!!

And when playing mycareer it takes ages to level your character's OVR unless you go the route where some players go, which is pay for VC. The prices seems overprice and the game feels incomplete. You'd imagine NBA 2k to be a great game based on its prices but you guess wrong. And the game are sold separately which feels like a scam, and only a couple of new things to the new NBA 2k games. I feel like 2k focuses more on how things looks rather than prioritizing the gameplay. I don't understand why they don't just give the game its own client and just update the game rather than making and selling a new one.

I am 25.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

Also, I've noticed how hard it is to level up your reputation in the mycareer neighborhood not that I don't like challenges but it is usually takes a lot of time to play online with others, the queue time is so long, especially on The Rec. Maybe in the next series 2K could add more ways to level up your reputation. I know that 2K21 is much like this one with few to none improvements so I'am looking forward for this one on the 2K22 and future releases if ever. Also, I like to add that maybe 2K could focus on little things like for example adding the new championship banner above a team arena because I noticed that doesn't add up whenever you win a championship, it is just a small feature but adding it to the game would it make much more interesting and fun, besides it is the little things that counts right? Anyway, I like the other game mode, MyLeague, which I played besides MyCareer and I like the whole GM Mode in the previous series however I noticed that some features of it are now part of the MyLeague that is why I played the latter more. Other than the MyLeague and MyCareer are basically just the same with previous series and I don't play much MyTeam as well in case you're wondering. But, overall I still recommend the game, if and only if, you don't mind playing basically the same game from the previous series and just enjoy playing basketball generally.",1608960605,1608960605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still very grindy and dependent on VC to improve your attributes without spending a lot of your free time. I constantly run into problems with the frame rate dropping or not holding beyond console fps, which is disappointing considering this is a ""PC game."" Also, half the time I can't even get the actual game to start without running into the ""NBA2K20.exe stopped working"" error message which is entirely ridiculous for a game that's been out for awhile. In addition to this I get a bug in MyCareer where the ""sim to next appearance"" either doesn't show up or the game just goes in slow motion without bringing up the option thus ruining my experience. This game is riddled with bugs and is unacceptable by today's standards. Play 2K19 instead, still pretty trash and grindy, but didn't have this many problems.

I'm really enjoying the customization aspect, setting up my own league and teams etc. It's not quite on par with Football Manager or OOTP but it's great fun. Good game despite its annoyances!

Original Review: This game has some minor annoyances, but I play it for the story mode of MyCareer which has been fun. There are times when it seems the difficulty changes based on no discernible event, but I still enjoy the game.

Ilove NBA 2k but this game is full of grinding, you have a lot of time to grind in your career mode, everything should buy with VC(in game money currecy). It is not recommended to the player that wont use alot of kuota because when the game loading it will automaticly start 2ktv and its consume alot of bandwidth. You will start as 60 overall player with unlogically team that very bad at anything. They won't pass to you, and yeah this year 2k remove rookie difficulty, GL with that.
What's good from this game?
The story
The graphic

Conclusion: This game is only recommended for who doesnt have any NBA 2k games as long as discount sale and who has a lot of money and confused how to spend their money. If you already have 2K games do not buy this game, very not recommended


after additional 307h played: This game will death instanly, im sure, they always promote their 2k21 on their 2ktv, also they never update myteam anymore after 2k21 release.

However, if you're not going to engage with the online elements, you just wanna make a character and simulate their career or you just want a game to sit down and match up your favorite teams, then you'll likely enjoy this game. The actual games of basketball are fun, the mechanics deep, and the simulation aspect rides the line between too easy and hard very well. the character creator is robust and expands on the previous NBA and WWE creators, and the photo sharing feature is great. it may take an hour or two  to take all the pictures in good lighting but the result is kinda astounding in its quality. My biggest issues as a single player is the fact that 2K reworked its virtual currency so if you want to get better animations and rituals for your player, you actually have to engage with other players and for the most part, get your ass crushed becuase everyone uses those microtransactions to be way better than you.

A lot of the game feels like it is trying to suck the cash out of your wallet and then some more. 

The 'higher quality visuals' that they constantly promote as an upgrade from the previous title is a lie, some of the characters in the game look nothing like their IRL counterparts, and I imagine there are way more complaints to be made from people who are more well versed in the genre. As a newcomer to Sports Games in general, I can only say that this didn't personally sell me on this series nor did it make me a fan of the genre.

The only saving grace that I can give it is the modding community, which have taken this game and messed with it to absurd levels. They're probably the only reason I have 3 hours in game, so shoutouts to those people.

Anyways, don't get this. Spend your money on something else or buy some of the titles that people like when they go on sale.",1605579032,1605579032,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its pretty ridiculous that I bought this game for myself and my friend and I can't even play with him. It's downright disrespectful for the developers to not offer any assistance to get their faulty game to work. I can guarantee you that I'm never going to buy another 2k game if this is the kind of customer support they're touting.

The gaming itself is not too bad, enjoyed playing on the beginning, but several things are pretty bad and the game rapidly becomes frustrated to play. 
Several annoying things.
I am 3 seconds on the paint, I get the fault. Some of the AI stays there camping more than 5 seconds without happen anything. 
Other, the game the opponents transport themselves in front of us. They are at least 2 meters apart next second in front of you or passing into you like you are a ghost. Almost is not worthy block them. Also, sometimes you are far in front of them and seems you hit a wall!
The game crashes a bit on transition on the menus. Also, lags on several occasions, like in the when you go to the bench or in the Gym. This last one not showing sometimes the bars or the help we need to finish the exercises. Needed to restart it several times.
If you decide not making the Draft and go directly to the NBA, you will struggle a lot to improve your player. I like to play on different positions and need to spend more than 2 hours making the draft for each build. Unacceptable.
One of the worst things of the game is the music. Terrible. Some nice songs in the middle but not playing often. Unfortunately, didn't found a way to cancel the music totally like I can do on the FIFA brand. One way is putting the headphones with zero volume when you walk through the Neighbourhood and go trough the menus. Unfortunately need to listen on other sites.
Annoying 2KTV transitions making a lot of noise about the new NBA2K21. Really annoying.
Other thing I noticed are the subliminal messages on the background and the politicised way of the game. Career story is full of them.Can accept a lot of things but not politics in a sports simulator game. Any kind of political influence.  Noticed this happens on some new games lately. This becoming a bit like braining wash for all king of political sides. It's really shames this happens.
So, even I like a lot basketball side and the gameplay itself is not bad, not buying new versions of this game. Unfortunately, there is no other Basketball option for PC.",1603155845,1604618587,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My previous review was about how good this game is with only major flaw being sheer difficulty. You either pay to win or you grind for hours (like 100+ hours) and then you win.

But now I finally got relatively good at it and started wining, and found out the flaw I can't forgive. It is scripted AF. 

I'm playing with Bucks, season is going well, 52-9. Only now I realize that those 9 loses came from teams that are considered strong stat-wise - Lakers, Clippers, GSW etc. meaning those loses were scripted. I've come to realize it after a loss we just had from Lakers.

We were playing hard and I was working my arse off, but we lost.

I'm having 32 points, 9 assists season on average. 
This game I had A+ rating 61 points and 12 assists. 61-12... I even had 8 rebounds which I simply never do

And we lost 126-159...
Danny Green hit 4 threes in a row only in first quarter
Dwight Howard had 19 point game and he hit ALL his free throws
Antetokounmpo had 20 points... while he averaged 34 in season

And most importantly I'm a 3 point sharpshooter with 99 points in 3-pt stat (I've got 48% 3PT% on average), I have won 3 point contest and this game I hit 9-25 threes and realized that game just won't give them to me, as my team is scripted to lose...

It remains the best basketball PC experience you can get , but 2K shoot themselves in the foot with constantly asking for more money (despite the astronomical price tag to begin with - if you paid full price). A lot of the game was cut and paste of previous years' editions. Park and neighbourhood modes are disappointing. MyGM was also confusing and came up a bit short. With myCareer , it starts well  , but the game play becomes grind-y and the commentary is extremely repetitive. 

Micro-transactions abound (as usual over the last few years' instalments) - it's not even worth arguing the point anymore. The profits outweigh any player concerns so the companies will never listen anyway. 

I especially found the ""2kTV mini-episodes"" unbelievably annoying - it's basically an ad for 2k21 before EVERY game you play with two over-enthusiastic hosts , against whom your rage meter will slowly but surely build up. Saying asinine things like ""2020 had its challenges but thank god for 2k"" .... really? 

After a while (unless you're a purist 2k fan)  you will put the controller down out of sheer annoyance - usually an hour or two in.  However , it is a testament to the quality of offline game play that you go back for second and third servings , knowing that annoyance will return. It 's a form of masochism. All in all the game is fun 

So yes , recommended....kinda.... as long as you play offline and buy it on sale. 
Definitely not worth USD $60 or 50 euros they're charging. I was able to look past many of the flaws because I got the game for $5 on sale. I'm sure if I had paid full price I would have been fuming.",1603542771,1603543475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]▶️Introduction[/h1]
NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]

Release Date : 5th September 2019.
Last known update: 29th May 2020.


[h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]

[b]Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?[/b]

[list] [*] [b]Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:[/b]
Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.

[*] [b]Gamemodes:[/b]
[i][b]Play Now[/b][/i]: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include [b]Play WNBA[/b] that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, [b]NBA Today[/b] that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,[b]Play Now Online[/b] is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly [b]Blacktop[/b] which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to.
[i][b]My Team[/b][/i]: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed.
[i][b]My Career[/b][/i]: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues.
[i][b]My League[/b][/i]: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. [b]My GM[/b] Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.

[h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1]
Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals.

[*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b]
The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well.
[/list]

[h1]🌀Performance:[/h1]
[b][/b]
[*] [b]In Game:[/b]
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S:
I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the cap

Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:
Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.

[*] [b]🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b]
The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues.
[/list]

[h1]💲Price:[/h1]
For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.

[h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1]
NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

[h1]📉Overall rating: 74/ 100 [/h1]

Decent MyCareer story, the options you have to take during interviews/dialogues are either corky or team praising oriented. 

I have mixed feelings about MyCareer mode, it could've been so much better, I'm not asking for a Witcher 3 dialogue menu, but still... the options you're taking doesn't affect your story at all. It's an unrealistic linear story and that's it. 

Also, there is no option to play as a female character in MyCareer mode. They could at least add the option (even without a story) to play as a female. 

Overall it's a decent game and since I paid only 2 euros for it, I had and I'm still having fun.

Sad because I played the very first NBA 2k with Iverson on the cover and at the time, the narrative was that 2k games is the small company compare to EA million-dollar investment. Now they are horrible both the same.

Many functions not working and 2K never bothered to fix any of it. MyLeague, MyCareer (besides the stupid career movie that the dev thinks we want, which is horribly made and wasted so much money hiring the likes of Idris Elba to do a piss poor job in voice acting), Franchise modes all remain the same for at least 4, 5 installments. 

It's a shame that it originally cost $60.

1) The Story in MyPlayer was good, really enjoyed the the character progression and occasional cut scenes when you start playing in the league. No issue on the FaceScan.
2) Shoes in the game really got me like changing all the players in my team so that's win.
3) The Rebounding here is very hard. AI occasionally does like 3-5 Offensive rebound consecutively when they miss and I can't get my team to have a rebounding dominant stats.
4) Shooting in HOF is very hard. Rarely goes in.
5) My team mates who I'm not controlling are dumb. When a opponent cuts through the basket my AI team sometimes take a step in the opposite direction as if they intentionally letting the AI enemy score.
6) The Difficulty level makes no sense, I'm able to outscore a opponent like 30+ points in Superstar(Which makes it boring) but when I go to HOF they outscore me like 30. I was assuming that by going to HOF opponents will be able to play smart(Make Plays more often) but they're still dumb. the only reason they are winning is they can hit the basket even while I'm defending right in front of them and my Shot aren't even though I executed a perfectly good play just to have my 3 pointer get open.

I came back to the series after more than a decade, picking it up while it was on sale. I realy wanted to like this game, but there is a huge downside to wich I will refer later. The game mechanics are fantatsic and once you get the hang of it, the game is realy fun to play. The graphics and player animations are pretty good as well. The possibility to scan your own face via your phone and seeing yourself alongside actors like Idris Alba is kinda weird and utterly mind blowing at the same time! Although the story mode was way to short and did fail on using its full potential, I would not have much to complain, if this game would not turn out to be an outrageous money milking machine. The progression system is so unbelievably slow, that you just notice how the developers have planned to get you to pump more money into the game in order to be able to upgrade your player properly so that the fun doesn't let up. These methods seem almost criminal to me and destroy the gaming experience in the long term. I am downright disgusted by the tenacity of the developers. If I had bought this game at full price, i would have been pissed to the fullest extend. 2K should be ashamed of ripping their customers off in this way!

I thought the MyPlayer story was pretty good, really enjoyed it but problems started coming once you're on an NBA team. I had a bug where the game would not simulate to your next appearance so you're forced to watch the game from the bench in real time. Apparently this problem has existed since release and a year later and they still have not fixed it. Another problem I had with MyPlayer mode is that you can only improve physical stats once per week, and it's not in-game weeks but REAL TIME weeks. Bruh 2K22 would come out by the time my player becomes serviceable.

EDIT: All the glitches were gone and the game became playable so for the sale price I got it for, it was worth it. MyPlayer's physical stats are still a weekly grind but overall, would recommend the game if it's on sale",1598200634,1600709955,True,0,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

This means you cannot control your players or any others. Since this has no fix and 2K doesn't care i and many others cannot play online with anyone including close friends.

Not only that, but the transaction side of things have taken a huge forefront in the game (which i expected but still disheartening). I was never interested in online, just some quick play games or running a season, maybe MyPlayer but even the menus have become cluttered and a catalogue of messiness. The timeouts and halftime performances and halftime shows and yadayadayada all just slow down the game and you can't disable most of it. If you could skip these scenes immediately it might be forgiven but you have to watch at least a few seconds of every once of these scenes and it gets so frustrating when you just want a quick bball game without all the interruptions. Think rocket league how you can jump in play a game and get out just as fast. A NBA 2k game is so bloated with all the simulation extras that it hurts the final product and even when I feel like playing a quick game, I don't since the bloat turns me off from trying. 

I bought it because it was on sale for $5 and that's the only reason. At that price I don't feel bad picking it up just to play a quick game every once in a while, but by the end of a game, even if I had fun there is ALWAYS some things that frustrate me with how this game is currently presented. The game has essentially become a tool to rip-off NBA fans as much as possible and the gaming has taken the backseat to those dolla dolla bills.

Been playing the game for awhile and I'm not having issues with ""crashing"" and I bought my pc at Costco.
I am having issues with the ball bouncing off invisible walls when the cpu gets near the court edges, instead of being called for 'out of bounds'.
I am having issues with players passing through my player on defense as if he was some sort of ghastly apparition.
The CPU tends to ""balance"" out gameplay with these outstanding moves born of supernatural origins.
The inconsistent controls are frustrating.  Especially when you think you are about to make a sweet dunk on the fast break only to bust out with the ever-so-flaccid lay up. 
Overall, My ignorance toward the fundamentals has created a fun learning experience for me....The Post, Lanes, Point Forwards!!!  
Idris Elbow is a weird addition to the game, as I only recall him from a movie where he played a pedophile African rebel warlord.  Why not put Marv Albert in the game attacking female fans in the background?
I do enjoy their take on Hawaii Leonard's disposition and Shaq's incoherent screeds.
Worth the $8, I suppose.

There are some good points, like the graphics are good, the core gameplay is still good and it has updated rosters. But there are a lot of things that really detracts from my experience.

When you're shooting free throws as the away team, the camera shakes. This is a bug that's been in every NBA 2K game I've played since 2K13. I don't why it hasn't been fixed yet.

About every 10 games in MyCareer, the game records all the VC you earn, but don't give them to you. I had  fewer than 100 VC before my most recent MyCareer game, supposedly earned about 1000 VC in MyCareer and went to the progression tab, I hadn't received any VC. I've only played about 30 games on PC, but this also happened to me on PS4.

All the Gatorade gym training mini-games are horrible. Absolutely awful and poorly implemented. I don't like the neighborhood feature in general, but the rest of it is at least tolerable. I do like the new story. I think it's good that they highlight how student athletes are exploited by colleges. I also really like the player creator now, because you can make a really specialized player with a unique set of skills.

Almost all the improvements seem geared toward MyTeam and MyCareer. I don't particularly like MyTeam because it's like a free to play Mobile game stapled onto a trading card game and the only purpose is to drain your wallet. Game modes like MyLeague sees little improvement, which is a shame because I really like MyLeague.

In addition to this, there are a lot of loading screens and a number of bugs. The game crashed on my a couple of times and during the draft combine, I was spawned into a gym with free movement and other NPCs were standing in position waiting for the cut scene(that didn't trigger) to start. This also happened during a NBA game. This is also the first time the MyCareer mode is forced online.

In the last few years NBA 2K has become gradually more focused on MyTeam and the online components of MyCareer (Pro-Am). This isn't something I necessarily have a problem with, but it comes at the detriment of the older features like MyLeague and the some components of MyCareer. I think this product has become gradually more anti-consumer and cynical.

There are skipless animations and visuals, make you stare your screen for nearly 20-30 sec for every foul, timeout, end of period, end of quarter, opening and ending. I just want to play the game. Why do i care rebound leader when im a point guard? Why should i look at James Harden's dropping assist numbers in every Rocket's matchup? I dont care about NBA2K21's demo. Im not interested in Dorris Burke and her speech. I just want to skip them. Ah i forgot the honorable mention, referee. When you get fouled and go to freethrow line for the first time, referee just tells some shit to players for 10 seconds. In total when you play 6 minutes long quarters, you wait about 6-7 minutes to play 18 minutes of real time. 

The AI works at least ""proper enough"" on older games. But in this game, even the simplest screen call breaks the game which causes defender to leave a gap for dodgin screen. That leaves you nearly wide-open or maximum of %10 contested statwise. Instead you dodge defender by just waiting and pressing left bumper and calling screen. Then rain 3s. Even AI abuse this. I see often that Curry call screen, wait for 3 seconds without moving and just take 3s. If you call a simplest gameplan, opposing team struggle to adapt it, causes easy points. Gameplay is really horrible in MyCarrer single player mode. 

There are issues with body colliders. You can use all your stamina to bump some1s leg and cant move an inch.

Difficulty settings are not boosting opposing teams AI but boost their stats, also lower your teams IQ to 0. The most irritating part is in HOF when i miss only 1 shot, my character going cold. Cant hit shots from close range, wide open with 85 close shot rating when i get full white bars. 

Also some animations are better than others (offers better frame windows for making perfect timing for scoring) but it is hidden so you need to constantly search for dataminer pages to get good one, cuz devs constantly patch them.

There are missing shot types and animations when i compare to older versions. There is a dropstep layup and dunk in game (i guess. there is a badge about it lol.) even i tried 2 hours to get a dropstep layup. i cant seem to find. also there is no knowledge about how to dropstep in controls menu. Only you can do is floater and eurostep. Dropstep and runnershots are missing. Fadeaway shots only available in post. There are no fancy dribbling moves. A lot of dunk styles are missing.

i did not play myteam. i dont have word for that.
There is a grind part in this game but i wont b*tch about it, it seems very easy when you can abuse AI.
Multiplayer part is laggy af.
Commentary is very limited opposed to older versions.
Curry special: Can make 3s from halfcourt.

0/10 i wont play again and not recommend
Also sorry for bed Englando xD

I'd avoided the series since then because they ruined MyCareer with the gross nickel-and-diming microtransactions, and the mode itself, if you didn't want to pay-to-win, would take 100 hours or more just to get to ""mediocre, legit rotation bench player on a franchise-mode team"" level of player.

But 2K12 started to feel like a relic after awhile; that was Kobe Bryant's NBA and Dirk Nowitzki's NBA, not Giannis Antetokounmpo's NBA; 2K20 cover athlete Anthony Davis played his one and only college season in 2011-12 and isn't in the old game.

For five bucks, I bought 2K20...and my gods, what an absolute atrocity, a disappointment at any price, a just plain terrible game.

Leave aside the gross pay-to-win multiplayer that combines a full-price retail product (or even one you get for 92% off) with one of the most exploitative microtransaction models in all of AAA gaming. You don't need me to tell you how awful that is.

What really jumps out at me is how genuinely terrible the actual basketball is, even in single-player MyLeague mode where you're not asked to participate in the MyCareer grind or to even look at the VC store.

The AI is straight out of 2K12, but the players' skillset is built for a modern league. The ""pace and space"" offense? Get real. Players with open looks from 3 will dribble into traffic and pull up for a contested midrange jump shot. The switching on defense is so bad that the player will frequently be forced onto a terrible matchup (player-lock yourself to the point guard and see how often you're switched onto the center every time there's a high screen and then bullied at the rim by a much bigger player. Take off the player lock and you can partially fix this but the AI will then just lose track of the guard for an open shot instead.)

Move the sliders to try and force the AI to favor the 3-point shot? Sure, they won't drive into traffic anymore, but then you're exposed to a different problem, namely that nobody short of Dame Lillard can make an open 3, and you'll add in a problem where players with a defender right in their face will shoot a contested shot with no chance of going in.

I have over a thousand hours in 2K12. The AI in 2K20 hasn't changed in eight years as the league has evolved underneath it. So it's not like I don't know how to play video game basketball.

And one other thing worth mentioning? Too often, I'd be guarding the opposing point guard, me just below the arc, the opponent out 30 feet from the basket.

In today's game, if you do that, point guards can drain a 3 from out there and make a defender pay for leaving them wide-open. It's changed the entire way that NBA defense is played and opened up floor spacing in a way that's wildly entertaining.

In NBA 2K20? The point guard will dribble down to 8 seconds on the shot clock, initiate an isolation, and then make one pass or try to drive the lane so predictably that you can take away the lane and force a 16-foot floater that goes in far more often than it ever has in real life...including during the early aughts, when NBA 2K was on the PlayStation 2 and that kind of offense was still common in pro basketball.

Terrible AI, a complete failure on the developers to understand how to simulate the game in 2020, and disgusting pay-to-win multiplayer and even singleplayer modes.

All of this adds up to 98 GB of hard drive space I'm going to use for something else, because this game's getting uninstalled for good after just 17 hours, unthinkable for a sports title.

Don't buy this game at any price. Don't buy any game in this series at any price until 2K fixes this, because right now they're clearly making too much money to care.",1599459734,1599459734,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
NBA 2K20 is a slight upgrade from 2K19, as the graphics, movement and animation selection all seem to be better than before. Also, the story in MyCareer is pretty engaging, but it's still quite similar to those from past games.

Cons:
As a regular 2K player, I was pretty disappointed with NBA 2K20. The improvements were rather limited in my opinion, and the game itself was a disaster after its launch. Endless bugs and glitches plagued every game mode and feature, which actually made me uninstall until the 2K team patched some things up. Even now, though, I notice plenty of issues with game play and scene transitions.

TLDR: Don't buy this game if you're expecting something new/better from 2K. Just like Madden, this is pretty much the same game as it's always been. I'd only recommend buying it if it's on sale for at least 50% off.",1599342954,1599342954,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The single-player and multi-player team basketball game is pretty much exactly the same as it was in 2010, and the new additions have been things like MyCareer. MyCareer is a pay to win MMO basketball lifestyle RPG. The idea of building your own character and having him play for NBA teams is actually a cool idea. It's also cool to have him play online with other player's own characters in park or organized team games. But they have completely polluted it by allowing you to spend in game currency on power, and they have added more pointless shit to spend in game currency on like 300 different types of shoes, temporary consumable bonuses, and an in game casino... It is really disgraceful. If you wanted to play games and team practice to reach a competitive stat level to play against good players online, it would take hundreds of hours... Or you could simply spend $100 on in game currency and shorten that time massively. 

I can say with 100% certainty that the 2016 and 2017 version of this game was much better than all the subsequent games. I feel like the NBA is slapping basketball fans in the face by allowing this awful game studio to make games with their players and teams. Everyone complains about how awful EA is, but compared to this game, FIFA and Madden are incredible.

Even if you just want to pump fake. This extends to the free throws at times which is beyond annoying because you have zero influence on how likely your shot is to go in. On top of that 2k has never had anti-cheat which ruins the game in online the park is full of cheaters it's a shock every time I get a game the doesn't have a hacker. The only other game I've played where cheating is nearly as bad as on this game is gta 5 and rdr2 and both of those games share a parent company with this game in take two interactive. It's extremely buggy with the graphics settings on pc when you turn down some settings there is a bug where the entire neighborhood has the same pitch black texture except for signs and players. The game is just packed full of bugs, such as in mycareer when you are subbed out and there is supposed to be a button to sim until the next appearance which will fail to appear for extreme lengths of time if your game is not capped at 60fps and sometimes crashes due to it making you lose what you've done for that game. The game is capped at 60fps for the online modes which on top of horrendous servers makes the online gameplay run like a handicapped geriatric when compared to the single player and I haven't even mentioned how often you will be disconnected for no reason at all. Another very fun bug is how in online games you sometimes just randomly deal with framerate stutters of dropping from 60 to <10fps which will persist throughout the entire game you play. I really want to recommend this game to friends because I genuinely have a great time playing this game when everything is working. It has so much more potential on pc however, there is no support for voice chat on pc, we don't get the demo for the next game. We get the next gen releases a year late, and despite that we are subject to the same predatory pricing and monetization as the consoles which are supported so much more. The basketball gameplay usually improves year after year but I am disappointed every year due to the utter neglect and silence that 2k treats the PC platform to making version of the game with the most potential into the version of the game with the most headaches and I do not see that ever changing in the foreseeable future.",1599186521,1599186521,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I went through Hell and back, but I was finally able to get this game installed with the multiplayer features in tact. I wrote a rather nasty review, but instead of leaving it, I wanted to put this warning out there and offer a more constructive posting rather than just saying to not buy the game. Given my experience with this one, I am not planning on buying from this developer again.

NOW THE HELP PORTION:

IF you decide to buy this game and install it, when the game launches for the first time, it is going to ask for your date of birth. There is a minimum age requirement to access online game play, HOWEVER, you would think it should be easy to put in your correct birthday. IT IS NOT. The menu has Month, Day, and Year top to bottom. There are hash marks in the fields where the birthday goes and arrows on each side. You can cycle through the months and days with the arrows just fine, BUT BE CAREFUL WITH THE YEAR! If you click the right arrow, the game will stop you right there and give you a message that says you are too young to play online and the online features will be LOCKED!!! USE THE LEFT ARROW TO SELECT THE YEAR OF YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!!!

I've read the game is full of pay to win micro-transactions that give people an advantage with programming mechanics of the game I do not even know of yet, but I don't really care about any of that. Rubbish purchases are just that and are designed to accommodate plebs. People who want shortcuts in life are the problem and they are the reason game companies get by with doing what they do. If you don't enjoy playing with those types of people, I would suggest only playing with friends who you know view games the same as you. Let the rest of the riffraff battle with their wallets.

I ultimately had to make a return to steam and re-purchase the game in order to enter my correct birthday. I spent a lot of time reading forums and trying various other methods in order to remedy the problem, and I even requested help from the Dev, but in the end the return and re-buying seemed my only timely solution. I did manage to pick the game up cheap, but considering how much money I make per hour when I am working, I definitely overpaid.

Buy the game or don't. I just hope this helps at least one person to not make the same mistake. Good luck!",1598926315,1599081408,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like sports games for the career mode building your player from a rookie to a big name. Admittedly I haven't had an nba game in some time, but the mechanic for career mode in this game is ludicrous you get ""vc"" which you use to upgrade your stats, but with the starter stats your player can't hit an open look midrange shot as a point guard if your shot timing is even one iota off of perfect. Luckily you can pay extra money to buy VC to upgrade your player or grind through four or five NBA seasons to get the needed coin to make career mode playable.

Personally, I play on keyboard and can't bother to buy a controller just to play this game.
The game is really fun, however, I feel like the developers should've paid more attention to people playing on keyboard.

Using controller is easy, however, playing on keyboard is probably one of the hardest things you'll do in your life.
Either way, great game.

1. MyCareer
Good god. The story itself is quite good in some spots, but it's ruined by many things, the constant cutscenes which are just needless in some spots. You go from cutscene to cutscene, play 2 mins worth of game and another cutscene. Some parts seem like they were written by a 5 year old, needless cringe jokes and bad puns between characters leave you feeling just plain awkward. When it comes to player improvement, it has never been slower. I saw some post where you have to play for about 120-130 HOURS before you MyPlayer reaches max attributes. It's just one giant push to make you spend more money. 
2. MyTeam
 Yawn, It's still just the same old gamemode that 2k has had for years. I'm not much of a PvP kind of person so I was hoping for at least a little bit of fun against the CPU. Nope, there are hundreds of single-player challenges to choose from, allow me to walk you through them. Step 1. Try and beat team. Step 2. Beat team because the game puts it on Rookie difficulty. Step 3. Repeat Step 1 except the difficulty is one level higher. Oh no, my 30 point win is now only a 25 point win. So much harder. Step 4. Log off after 2 games because you get bored of playing the CPU on Rookie difficulty. That's MyTeam in a nutshell. 
3. MyGM
Eh, It's a GM mode, I like it.

let me tell you why:
- unskippable cutscenes
- game capped at 60 fps
- ads during loading screens
- the grinding is painstakingly bland
- MyCareer is boring to play and grind
- lots of modders ruining online
- MP players play with 7' ungodly creatures with wingspans longer than their lifespan, making them unguardable even by God
- both of my parents were ashamed of me after figuring out that I bought this game with their money
- my father especially hated me for taking his money to buy THIS GAME out of any other steam games
- my mother figured out that I also bought a 2019 Kia Stinger GT alongside the game
- the point above doesn't correlate with this game's review
- they kicked me out of the house so I had to play this game on my PC at the gas station
- I forgot to install any other game besides NBA 2K20 in this PC
- there's no wifi so I couldn't even play MyCareer

I hear people say the modern 2K games are bad, but I always thought that was a bit of an exaggeration. After playing 2K20, I can say that I can see where they are coming from. I feel like the core gameplay is flawed on some key areas. 
I have to say graphically and presentation wise the looks fantastic. But gameplay wise I feel like the game's need to feel realistic takes away a lot of fun. Team AI is atrocious, I feel like you can't rely on your AI teammates to play good defense especially in the paint. Players are too slow to simulate ""realistic"" fatigue, it ends up feeling like your trapped into what 2K wants instead of relying on skill. It makes fast breaks and help defense feel lethargic.
Which bring me to the main point about the core gameplay. I often times felt like I was trapped in animations to ""simulate"" momentum. This makes the game feel kinda like the movement in a GTA game. So like your player is still moving a bit after you've moved the analog stick, which can make for some frustrating defensive one-on-one sequences.
I also need to mention the gambling/microtransactions in the game, which is a whole other issue. I was under the assumption that once you got an player's card for MyTeam, that he was yours to keep. But nope, you have to constantly sign them to 1 or 5 game contracts to play with them. This gets in the way of fun and just another design choice to nudge gamers towards buying the microtransaction currency. 
It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game. I feel like 2K has all the money and talent to make stellar basketball games again. For now I guess I'll stick with the flawed but more fun NBA 2K11 until NBA 2K improves their core gameplay mechanics.",1598687000,1598687000,False,1,0,0.512534797191619873,0,True,False,False

At first I was impressed. I loved the story, and the storytelling through the camera. The animations had improved drastically. The actual game looks pretty good too. 

Everything through that point feels great. The games themselves feel okay, the shooting isn't awful, and you can find yourself doing quite well in the NBA Summer League to finish things off. I think the story is short but sweet. Not worth it on its own, but a really big step up from 2K16 which was the last game I played.

Then you hit the NBA, and the game shows its true colours. It feels just as bad as it did before, except maybe worse. Shot timing in this game specifically is the worst I have experienced. In other games, being slightly late or slightly early meant that an open shot would almost always go in. In this game, anything but an excellent shot will almost always miss. I understand wanting to make controls precise, but this is awful. 

Next, dribbling feels super clumsy for My Player. He isn't decked out on the stats, but as a shooting guard who was a big star through your college years, you should at least expect him to be able to cross over without losing control of the ball, or do a spin dribble with some speed. But the problem is, everything you think you should be able to do, you can't.

I don't want to grind for 100+ hours to deck out my stats just so I can maybe have a little fun with the career games. I don't care for any other aspect of the game, so this was yet again, not worth it. There are minor improvements, and some major setbacks from the last entry I played. With this, and the fact that 2K is as greedy as they are with microtransactions, I don't recommend this game. It's utterly infuriating, and not in a good way. 

This game looks fantastic for a sports game, manages to create a good atmosphere for basketball fans, and has a wide variety of tasks and activities to do, but the core gameplay lacks a lot of the fundamentals of a good video game. This game is not fun unless you really want to dedicate your full time into it or pay into the microtransactions this game is riddled with.",1598525097,1598525097,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

positives:I +like the addition of the WNBA (my main reason for buying this game)
                   +edit and create expansion teams and uniforms,arenas
                  +I like my career mode.(but want to play in the WNBA as well) 
                   + I like my league(but WNBA needs to be fleshed out more)
                   +I like  create a player (but again they need to add WNBA players to it) 
                    + I like the music and presentaition and other audio effects.
 And the negatives -limited WNBA features.
                               -my team seems to be mainly a cash grab.
                              - you do not seem to be able to lock on players in some important modes(practice) and it is hard to learn the game when you can lock players in some modes and not others.
                              -no game manual or in game glossary to help you learn the game 
  ---------Final thoughts--------------------------------------------------------------
This game has a lot of potential and if the make NBA2k21 add full features to the WNBA that are in NBA (create a player ,my league,my carrier ,edit uniforms,hairstyles ,faces ,(voices ?)
able to make expansion teams that you can edit arenas,uniforms ect.

Pros :
1. Updated Roster : Well this is must be the advantage of buying the original version of game than the pirate. The update well i can say that the update is often when the real NBA roster make an Update. For example, when the Player in real NBA was traded, shortly after the trade, the player will be in the new team. For me this is very useful when you playing Quick Play.

2. Easier shot meter. I don't know how the people maybe against this, but for me NBA 2K20 is easier than the NBA 2K series before. Well, I'm mostly played this game for Quick Match and I can say this point is in my pros because I almost used all of the team available (include the WNBA) 

3. The Story in MyCarrer. So in MyCarrer we played as ""Che"" who was a Captain in the Bay City Team. Somehow I love the story. 

4. MyCarrer Stat : OK maybe this is kinda weird BUT you will never increase the meter in Team Takeover while you score the most point. For me, this is very good. You just cannot make point as much as you want but if you get the point from assists or from offensive rebound the takeover meter will increase. The summary is a lot of point is not to important for takeover the team. Team Takeover for me is when you useful for the team not just be the STAT PADDER

5. Updated Team Play : Well lets make a comparison between NBA 2K20 and NBA 2K18 (i dont buy NBA 2K19 because in that time my hardware was not support). I am using Dallas Mavericks NBA roster and have very significantly different in play style (or Team Play or Run Play or whatever it is called). In NBA 2K18 you will run the play mostly in first Option is the PF position. in NBA 2K20, you will run the play more equally (equally in this meaning of all player in the court will have the same proportion of play). 

Cons (Here comes)
1. MICROTRANSACTION : well this is mostly every player will know this game as the HIGH MICROTRANSACTION. You will be know when you go to Park in MyCarrer. Almost every player has 90++ overall rating and I don't know how the hell they can be fast in increasing the overall. Well I played the MyCarrer at least 50 hour and i got 83 rating for PF.

2. NETWORK CONNECTION : oh come on, 2K fix the connection in online session. I never played so smooth in every online session (MyTeam, Park, and anything who need connection with another player). Well in my case is the connection is when I make a Shot. The Shot Meter always delay and i dont know why.

SO LETS  GO TO THE CONCLUSION :
Why you must buy this :
1. Frequent Update Roster
2. Story of MyCarrer will be different every year
3. Gameplay will be different Every Year

Why you not buy this :
1. Played mostly for online play and want to increase the overall fast by MICROTRANSACTION
2. Don't have a stable connection for Online (or at least have bad connection)

Advice
*when you play the MyCarrer, just follow the team play. If you want to be star of the team just follow it at first. Don't be hurry for be a star. Increase the minute playing by obey the team play.

Bought it at 90 something % discount. Still not recommended to purchase. The game is worse than every iteration of the game since my previous purchase (2k17) and that version has been worse that the version before it. 2k is literally the only developer who manages to release a new game every year that is WORSE than the previous year and still manage to sell. 

So what's worse?
-AI is even worse now, half the fucking time when you're driving your moronic AI teamates will.... run up into you, blocking you and bringing a double team. Doesnt matter if you have a full 5-out team, they will INSIST on running into you. Call a pick and they will HEDGE for the opposing team and prevent you from driving. 
-Reverse is true on defense. When opponents do a pick, good luck running through two picks, one of which might be an illegal screen done by your own teammate.
-Everything is worse. Everything is tuned to be more VC focused, and no way to earn VC easily. And even if you earn the VC well enough with enough gameplay, the gameplay itself is still shittier than previous iterations. Mycareer mode limitations prevent you from even creating NBA star level players even if you max everything out. Wont be able to recreate AD, KD, Lebron, or whatever guy you wanna play as in mycareer because ""competitive play"" which doesnt really exist because cheaters/hackers galore. 

TL;DR: bad game even at 9x% discount. Dont even bother spending 5 bucks to buy this game. I spent 5 bucks and 29 hours just so you dont have to and can instead spent it on ice cream, popcorn, or bacon. And you will definitely enjoy any of those stuff more.

So if you're gonna try to play park legit you are gonna have a bad time. I would say 99% of the players on park cheat and modify their stats, badges and rep. Although people do cheat to have max attributes and badges most keep their height and wingspan legit as long as you are a PG, SG, SF and PF. Centers are always 7'3 with speed and handles and if you do not have a center you will lose 95% of the time. You will run into people who modify their wingspan beyond what is possible but it doesn't happen so often and most people get off when they see one of those cheaters.

Now like I mentioned everyone modifies their rep to Legend because it gives you VIP spot if you're not in a squad. That means if you do not modify your rep you will get kicked out of your spot A LOT so be patient in finding a game or get a squad going.

Now the player base. The player is base is freaking garbage 9/10 times the people you play against are just terrible. Squad or no squad. Makes the console noobs look like they are actually decent. Because of all the cheating these trash players think they can play Park like MyCareer and just try to go through you and dunk or just spam dribbles just to miss while you never get the ball. I know it sounds the same like consoles but just imagine it ten times worse.

If your overall is not at least 90 you will get in the way and that's the honest truth maybe if your 3 is high enough to hit consistently you'll be a spot up shooter. Anything else if you don't cheat you better just give up.

If you're gonna play Park legit do yourself a favor and buy the  console version instead if you have one, if not you're not gonna have fun. Also you're gonna hear constant helicopter if you find a game which is also not fun.

Other than that the park runs smooth at 60 FPS and is way superior to consoles obviously even the gameplay.

5/10 because most online players in 2k are so bad that even with cheating they are worse would not recommend. PEOPLE CANNOT AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE IN THIS GAME. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LEARN HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE.

Pros
-It controls very similarly to 2k19(atleast with a controller)
-The customization has increased with the new mybuild system
-It feels like you get more VC in the story( i was on pro and was getting 600-700 vc per story mission)

Neutral
-The myplayer story is very short.(beat it in less than 9 hours)
-The achievements can only be unlocked after beating the story(which isn't so bad i guess due to it being short).

Cons
-The cutscenes so far can be very long(one of the first ones was 12 minutes).
-The potential system or whatever it's called makes it so if you didn't set your potential for certain attributes, then you can't increase them at all
-The graphics really didn't improve much
-It took a while to actually get a decent FPS, i had to switch graphics cards and change my computers mode to high performance to get 60 FPS on ultra(which i dont usually have to do).
-Hacking is very easy to do it seems. I've ran into several people that were hacking(some had stretched bodies which was funny), only experienced this in mypark though.



I'd say the game is worth it for $4.80, considering 2k19 is going to be dead soon. I'll update the review with more once i play the online and league.",1597931633,1598054427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mostly bought it for myCareer, and got about 3-4 hours into my playthrough and was getting decently immersed. and then, all of a sudden, I get drafted by a team and get into the NBA, and the game won't let me simulate when my player isn't on the court. if I want to be able to simulate the game to the point that I can ACTUALLY PLAY IT, I have to tab out of the game 5-6 times and then it will suddenly give me the option. when you start the game, you are just a shitty scrub that sits on the bench because you have like 60 overall rating. so essentially, I spent $4 on a brick because anytime I want to play the myCareer mode, I get to play for about 1-2 minutes before I'm subbed out and have to start trying to force the game to actually work like it should. 

I've tried all of the fixes I've seen online. none of them work, in fact they just tank the game down to about 10 fps.

the devs over at 2K games are actually genius, because I have to spend about 4 hours going through pointless dramatics just to be drafted and actually start getting subbed out. so this issue is not even apparent until after you cannot refund the game. fuck this game, fuck the devs for allowing this to still go unpatched for over a year, and fuck the Lakers. this is what will cause people to start pirating your shitty games.",1598047762,1598047762,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MyPlayer can't hit wide open slightly late/early shots with a 70 overall, but another player with a 60 overall can hit 70% contested shots. I really want to know where is the logic in this game because so far after many attempts i have failed to find it. Every team plays with the ball very selfishly not willing to pass to me while im open in paint. Every time i ask a player to pass the ball to me, i get ignored with no obvious reason behind it. As an examle, Trae Young can hold the ball for 8 seconds with nothing happening and he causes no violation, but if i hold it for 8 seconds, i get 6 different violations and my score goes from C to F+. Hitting a green shot is rarer than your parents buying you a Bugatti for your 16th birthday. Defense of the AI is non-existent. If i go for a layup i get guarded by the whole team like im a national threat with a bomb in my hand meanwhile a SF from the opposite team can score a 3 while being wide open because why not. The AI teammates block you while you are trying to get to the player you are guarding while he is moving at 300 miles per hour and then its your fault and you get a defensive breakdown. Upgrading your player does as much good as drinking acid. The movement is garbage, the animations are trash, and i could very well see why Ronny 2K would sell the game for 4 euros. I am honestly surprised at why would new players buy it. Even 4 euros is expensive for a game thats about as good as a game developed by a rookie programmer. I mean hey there must be a few positives right? Sike you thought. If this game is ""good"" then im also 8 foot 9 irl. I dont know why i thought that it would be a good idea to purchase this game.

Firstly, it's ugly. I mean it's real ugly, I cannot comprehend how a game which only needs to render one room can be this bad visually.
Secondly, animations are not that good either. Movement does not feel fluent, player models going through each other, movements skipping frames, player faces resembling dead fish etc.

Graphics - It is a one year old game which looks okay at ultra. As a PC player expect Console quality graphics.

Music - I am not a fan of these tracks but some of them are decent and none of them are too bad.

Controls - The controls may not be the worst part about this game but they are horrible. I use a wireless Xbox One controller but I've tried wired as well and it will always feel like your playing truck simulator rather than in the NBA. I could understand the tilting and skidding and floating if it was at least realistic. The AI defense simply floats around blocking your every attempt to get in. They have some kind of speed boost making your defending trash against them.

Fun - No this is a nice game that becomes tedious when you realize there is a business model to why your character is so trash.  I recognized it because I've played a lot of MMORPGs so it's familiar. Your character has semi hidden stats that level up over time. You also have the obvious stats that you can pay real money to increase. 

I spent $30 on this game total and got through the my career portion of the game despite some of the retarded work out mini-games.  When you get to the NBA those hidden stats become so damn pronounced with every even Centers running circles around you. What's more the hidden attributes of the AI forces you to miss shots even if they are 6ft away from you because they have intimidater. 

Breaking the AI ankles even with 75 handling, 50 lateral movement and 80 post movement is impossible with the hidden stats being considered. It isn't that the AI is that good, it's just that your character rolls like they had hip replacement surgery this morning.  Couple that with that everyone simply goes faster than you and you have people who are past the half court catching up to you on the paint before you can complete a half roll to lay up.

These hidden stats makes for the experience as a player totally new to NBA 2k completely unfun and more frustrating than anything else. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the obvious buy gold coins options to make your character stronger option at the upgrade screen.

Conclusion - If you are new to 2k like I am I cannot recommend this game even at the 90% off rate. This is not the sport game for you - there is no tutorial mode or any hand holding even on rookie difficulty. If that's your jam then good luck - the reward of winning a game isn't even there because I gain 5% or less xp per game as I can't make 3's, can't make inside shots, can't dribble, can't pass correctly 5v5 (Whole other issue here), can't defend, and can't have fun. 

Perspective - I am coming at this game for the experience of playing a NBA game and being a player - it's more like an RPG for me, what I got is something that takes itself FAR too seriously as a tournament game and is built assuming you mean to play it competitively.  I have no intention of playing online or going against other people. Because of that this game is not for me.",1597959417,1597959417,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I have yet to test the graphical limits of this game because my PC is almost a decade old and itching for an upgrade, but with the right setting tweaks, I can run this on 1080p low shader setting and no special effects at 60fps with minimal stutters due to CPU bottleneck. Also, this game is probably only worth buying if it's on sale (which I did) and you only want to play myleague or mycareer, or on a physical preorder because of the free poster you can get with the Legend edition.

PC UPGRADE UPDATE: I've finally tried the online portion of the game, and it's just terrible. I have a good fiber optic internet connection, but since the servers are not even optimized for my country, it takes probably like 250ms to move my player or do anything.

It's sad to see that the graphics are the only improvements I see that they have made over the past years. Buying an annual sports game release and only seeing better lighting and a roster update is a slap in the face for the fans. 

Gameplay is horrendous. At moments shooting is smooth but then at other times shooting almost a perfect shot would miss no matter how close you are, whether or not you are being covered by an opponent. Passing the ball as well can be confusing at times as well. I'll try to pass to my teammates and it'll either pass to someone that i don't want to have the ball, or they just straight up don't pass. Defense although just as terrible, I don't have much of a problem with because it's at the very least somewhat consistent. 

Besides exhibition games and occasional multiplayer against friends, the only other mode I tried getting into was MyCareer. 

MyCareer in my eyes is a failed attempt at trying to be something they aren't. I get that they want to make it seem more personal, and although I haven't seen or played past MyCareer modes, they have to trash the story aspect. It's so awkward to make a player that looks like you, give them a name, then be thrown into some god awful story plot that came from High School Musical with the dude that physically looks like the player you made, but now they gave him a voice that makes me sound like I'm 20 skin tones darker (I'm a vary pale man), the announcers don't even say the name I gave my player and default to the story name, and now the personality your ""new"" player has doesn't even match what you were going for. And if they want to stay on this route, can the voice actor playing us not be awful? In fact, a lot of the voice actors are pretty bad. It would be so much tolerable to play if they had a good story and better actors and writers.

I have done my best to avoid multiplayer (MyTeam) due to all of the push back it got from fans and critics. If you want to see what multiplayer is like then just search it up.

2K use to be a well respected company and people are willing to give them a chance to regain that respect but their greed is what moves the company now. The fact that they still are selling 2K17 for $60 tells you enough about what they care for more. I only bought this game for $8 on sale and I'm still unsure of whether I made the right choice to buy this. In conclusion, look for alternatives before you consider buying another 2K game.",1597167436,1597167927,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

MC you cannot simulate to next appearance.
Turn the frame rate over 60 the game itself starts to slow down, so 1 second takes about 5 seconds.
Loading screens just frozen end game till it loads to the next area.
Lag out during practice. I'm the only human in the game world how am I timing out?
The story is over in about 3 hours only about 5 games, compared to last year 7-8 hour and whole campain with g-leage team. (the intro/outro and credits were about the same as the whole story)

MyCareer and MyTeam are littered with microtransactions that make the game pay to win, so it's no wonder people hack to make their guys have slenderman arms and 1 inch tall. Advertisements are plastered all over the game, whether it's in MyCareer or even in the loading screens. MyTeam by around January and Feburary becomes stale when they start pumping out Galaxy Opal players like it's candy. 

HOWEVER, there's something to be said about the presentation and the best game mode in the NBA 2K series, MyLeague. When 2K tries, it can produce amazing results. There are locker room cutscenes, interviews with players and coaches and our favorite broadcasters Shaq, Kenny and Ernie. MyCareer has hours of brilliantly animated cutscenes and voice acting, which is definitely an improvement from the atrocious voice lines from NBA 2K15 that sounded like they were reading a book out loud in English class. The cyberfaces, while not the best on some players like 2010's Kobe and rookie LeBron, are very accurate and detailed. There's tons of replayability in MyLeague. Take someone from the 90's and see how they would play in the modern NBA, remove everyone who makes the All-NBA each season and see how terrible the league gets, put in your 99 overall created player and watch him break all of the records, whatever. There's so many possibilities in MyLeague and tons of outcomes for you to observe. Plus the simulation speed is way faster than on console. Player and team's stats are in-depth and advanced, which is a refresher from most sports games like modern Madden games who have basic stats. You have to think about what kind of impact each move makes, from releasing a player to signing a team owner.

NBA 2K20 isn't really a game for your casual NBA fan and more suited to hardcore NBA fans (or kids who wanna flex on the park with the VC they bought from their mom's credit card)",1596574950,1596574950,True,12,6,0.501010715961456299,0,True,False,False

An enjoyable, almost thrilling MyCareer story, which feels more progressive than the earlier approaches to MyPlayer. Some games will make you actually watch the AI and skip hitting the skip button -- if you're into it.

But it feels clunky. Animations are long and will prevent you from performing your ideas on court. At the beginning of your career, your Turnover PG will be an abomination to look at and you won't understand why your character is not jumping to block the shots, properly. That's supposed to be the sense of progression. So, you're an NBA player with no know-how to block a shot or steal a ball, but your stat increases will magically grant you that intuition. Rebounds... oh, that's a long topic, but let's say if you want a challenge and you choose Hall of Fame difficulty, and you also play anything else than a 4 or a 5, you will have games with 0 rebounds with maximum effort.

You find your character committing court violation, while you were pulling the analog ""away"" from the line. You see your teammate leading the fast break, followed by your lob, only to see the ball flying through his hands, into an innocent bystanders head (which aren't very animate anyway). You see your 7'1"" #5 not being able to box out the opposing #1 or protect the rim, while if he's a star player he'll usually grab ORBDs and dunk it.

I got drafted by Bulls in my first MyCareer attempt and thought it was the team. So, I traded. Still the same issues. The problem is, as you raise the AI difficulty, that doesn't affect your teammates. And it creates some disgusting scenes. They will still fail to find the open man, or grab boards, sometimes even nail open shots.

The progression system feels like an endless grind and you do not dare start a new career, unless you're a vivid NBA 2K player. The badge system sounds amazing but you find yourself spending copper badges on half of them, because they sound like the stuff to make a solid NBA player, but it poorly reflects the game and feels very algorithmy.

I hope to see the KB24 covered NBA 2K21 to be better than this, as I've been playing this series for many years now and would be thrilled to see it flourish and improve.

- I'm the only starter playing in garbage time along with my team's 3rd string. Currently, I'm playing more than teammates and I'm the star player of my team. So it does not make sense that coach keep me in the game at garbage time.
- My stamina is drained, I'm exhausted and I can barely walk in the game but coach still does not sub me out. I'm like ""Dude I'm dying here"", but coach does not care eventhough we have 20 point lead.
- After subbing out, ""quick simulation"" is not that quick. Everyone moves with slowmotion, time speed goes slower and slower, after that simulation is completed.
- MyNeighbourhood is full of cheaters. Some players builds characters that has arms longer than their body. Their elbows are touching the ground and it is stupid as hell.
- Story was really good and I liked it so much. Making decisions, writhing to get drafted... It ended really quick and it really bothered me. I expected a story that keeps going on my NBA season too. For NBA 2K21, please write longer story.

Its a very fun game and I buy it almost every year. The game isn't without its faults, however innovation wise NBA2k and visual concepts used to be at the forefront of sports based games but due to the current change with in the industry regarding the growing needs to further extort the players for even more money, they have been rather lacklustre in their attempts to keep doing so . To finish this rant, if you want to pick up this game at a sale, go for it but just try and avoid picking it up at full price. Also be warned, the game does and will do after the future release hound you with aggressive micro-transactions and slight limitations with gameplay that can affect the way you play.",1596025331,1596025331,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: I have played over 1,000 more hours of 2k and because of this Steam wants me to revise my review. The shooting I have grown accustom to, in this 2k you will miss many more shots than the previous 20 entries, this can be extremely frustrating. MyCareer is the best it's been in this game, unfortunely, by month 3 the park was overrun by hackers, sitting at 95 overall and with slenderman arms. This is achieved using ""Cheat Engine"", a program I personally haven't used since 2010 when I was hacking Wizard101. Explain to me why this same exploit works in NBA 2K20, a less than a year old triple A title. MyTeam is by far the best gamemode this year, cards like GOAT Kobe, Steph Curry, and Larry Bird add a lot of time-killing grinding, and are likely why I have 1k hours on this game. These cards are outclassed, naturally, by the GOAT cards in packs that you can pay real money for for a chance at them. Packs this year are more expensive than they have ever been, and the odds seem worse than previous entries. MyLeague/GM is a joke, it has been the exact same game mode for 4 years in a row.

I don't know if I'm the minority here, but I don't want to grind a ridiculous amount of hours to pull my player out of the depths of mediocrity. 

I then play through the entire playoffs and carried the Blazers to a title while averaging 50+ points through the playoffs (my highest scoring game being an 88 point tripple double). Did I get any extra VC for this at any time? Lol naahhhhhh. Instead I got a sound bug that made it so I couldn't even half enjoy the awkward ass cut scenes after winning the finals. Oh that reminds me, I L O V E all of awkward silences in every cut scene, not to mention the post game show interviews are cringey as fuck. 

At the end of all this I just wanted to do what I've always done: go to the past champions page and see my team named as the champions for the 2019-2020 season and my name for the finals MVP next to it...but of course they...removed it???? Honestly it seems like the devs are so out of touch. Everything feels so half assed and they've actually removed a ton of single player features from previous games. Of course, it seems like they are more focused on the furthering the competitive multiplayer scene, which I can understand at this point. But at the same time they seem to have no problem with blatantly neglecting the players who only want a single player experience out of this game. 

This will be the last 2k I purchase. Time to go back to the good ol days of 2k10 when I could make my player a 7'10 freak of nature through hex edit and just have fun without being spammed by 2k2v and ads every other step I reluctantly take through the neighborhood that I'm forced to be in.

On the Gameplay my ULTRA Settings runs are 60 fps with 4k. But Everything else in the game is 30 fps? WTF

They have some troubles programing but you didnt notice if you dont press attention. 

Sometimes the gameplay get bored when u have to make shots alone only to make them or with distance from another player. If someone is guarding you, you have 5% to make that shot! That Cut the emotion of do shots when someone is guarding you. (Im not talking shots from the pain)

YOU MUST BE ONLINE TO PLAY MY CAREER This is really bad.

POSITIVES
Better Than NBA 2k19 at least the career mode. 
Better Graffics too.  
Better Gameplay. 

At least they upgrade a lil the crowd, Now you can see them sometimes leaving the seat. For 2020 they should do more things.

Game really wants your money for so much in-game and it shows

I was lucky enough to not have to pay full price for this. While i usually only play these yearly releases for the single player MYCareer, ever since they added the neighborhood i loved playing that as well, but this game RUINED it by allowing people to pop up with 10 foot wingspans and arms that literally go through the floor, making it a joke to play against them. Items in the store are ridiculously priced. A pair of shorts can run you as much as 15,000 VC. 15,0000!!!!!!! A skateboard or any mode of transportation to get around the neighborhood faster than the regular speed of molasses going uphill? Oh thats not too expensive, just a cool 30,000 VC or more.

If you do play it, check out the WNBA part, it actually is pretty cool, and check out one of their games on TV or in person its become a pretty exciting league. 

Game feels a lot like a slow progression over the last few years, I usually play these on console, but the PC ports are getting better and better (except for cheaters are more common on PC but that is every game right?). I think its the best version yet, the story not so much, its unique and interesting but eh... what do you expect right? so its ok. The game play though I think is getting better, I felt the shooting is getting better, the movements feel better then previous years(once you learn them). While trying to get better the game does make things worse; stats/badges are more important then ever, height is more important(physics of game blocking and covering %), learning plays, animations can make things impossible to counter or stop. You just have to except the limitations of the game and what they are, and that is where at times it becomes thrustrating, how many players know they can turn off the shot meter and release it based on the animation and get a increase to the shot %? Because the game is RNG and everything is % based, which means yes the perfect shot can miss, the worst can go in... playing better and having better cards just increases those %. 

The microtransactions? yeah its in your face... spending money will make it easier, but you can easily play without spending a dime again, it can all be earned slowly, but still sucks. The less offline stuff you do the less its a issue, multiplayer obviously is impacted a lot by $$$$... so it is what it is. I don't think its the worst game out there in that regard, but it is pretty bad, I think madden and some of MMO titles out there are worse. That said it doesnt bother me in this one. 

Anyway core game is a small but nice step over previous years, lot of things to do, huge game, lot of challenges, but in the end plagued with predatory microtransactions, so your mileage may vary, but you can indeed play single player without it impacting you much at all.",1595699516,1595699516,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Why a business tactic that is designed to hurt the consumer works, I don't know, but what I do know is that this game, and this franchise as of late, is not good at all. Sure, it can be fun, especially when you're playing with someone else, but that's primarily because you're playing the game because you like basketball and there aren't other NBA basketball competitors out there. With that being said, that is why I continue to play - there aren't any other basketball/NBA games with a community this size, and because during a time with no basketball or other sports, it fills a void, and thus, I am addicted to even the slightest drip of NBA content. Although MyTeam is no longer fun to me, and MyCareer is exciting only half of the time, the game can keep you interested with MyLeague - the only reason I really still play. And, if you want to pay that price tag for BasketballGM with better graphics, go for it. But even MyLeague is annoying. This may be a jumbled mess of my ramblings, but overall, I would say you're better off not buying this game and supporting this company. If you do, don't buy it from an official retailer. For now, I cannot recommend this game, and hopefully, that'll change with other entries, but I don't think it will.

TL;DR: Constant crashes, horrible AI, bad animations (everything movement in the game is animation based, and of course, every animation is too long and not user friendly), bad Virtual Currency system (game is near unplayable for your MyCareer character if you don't buy VC for him), and even more.

It took the focus off of becoming the best all around player you were capable of creating and investing time into and turned it into a game of numbers, numbers that had to be balanced because 2K's focus for not only MyCAREER but for every game mode is the online play. They have to 'balance' the players you'll be matching up against in the park so you can't just play by yourself and have a guy who can hit threes and take it to the rack. Even though these players exist and have existed in the NBA since time immemorial, it's now almost an impossibility due to the allotment of attributes.

Not only will your team mates NOT pass you the ball when you call for it, the game will actually penalize you for asking for the ball....in a game where the grind to improve your character is Korean MMO levels of stupid.

Klunky, sloppy, pigs on ice handling, and riddled with horrible design choices.

You come out of college as a first round draft pick.....who's stats are all 40 points lower than anyone you'll be playing!!!!!  Thanks for putting me up against that shooting guard, with 91 speed, and then taking points AWAY from me because I couldn't cover him.  It's just beyond stupid game design, to the point of infuriating.

To add insult to injury, in no particular order:

Career mode:  Doing pretty well?  Time to end that.  There is a script in place for career mode, and you WILL follow it.  Doing too well?  Time to make you suck for a few games.  Yah, the Lakers shot 36%, and James missed 4 free throws in a row down the stretch.  Your usual 35 points a game ya...well...you got 9 this time, sorry.

Being benched when winning:  Same as above...doing too well?   You clawed your way back to a 4 point lead?....time to sit on the bench, when you come back, there will be 4 seconds left, and you're down by 20.

Predatory gaming at it's worst:  The INSANE badge and exp grind is such an obvious pay to play grab, in a full priced game, it's beyond shameful.  This pay to win is worse than most F2P games I've played.

I put some time into this game, because I missed my refund window, covid, and because there are parts of the game that are great.  The character creation and development COULD be amazing, if it wasn't tied to such a horrible and infuriating mess of a money grab, coupled with heavy handed AI and scripted outcomes.

This game would be so much fun if it encouraged rerolling and playing different characters, and if the players actions actually mattered in the outcome of anything.  As it stands, it's one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.  The idea of playing multiple builds with the level of grind it takes for a character is just.....beyond bad game design.  They have missed every single good point about this game, and actively destroyed them along the way to money grab heaven.

AI is completely braindead.
Your all star teammates cant hit a shot, I play on the warriors, like 30 games into a season, Curry is barely shooting  30% from 3, I have gold dimer, give him an open look and he FADES on wide open shots instead of setting his feet. Same goes for Klay. They instantly get the ball and toss up some bullshit that will never go in. There is this dumbass animation this year where ball goes in almost down to the net and then rims out. It happens like 10 times a game. I tried playing on HoF, Superstar, Allstar. The same shit.

Enemy CANT PROTECT THE PAINT AT ALL. I can have 100% FG. They dont protect the paint at all, but trying to get a 3 is insanely hard, they protect it like their life depends on it, speedboosting doing glitchy animations just to stick to you.

Also the game has CONSTANT Crash To Desktop for example when viewing roster in My League.

I only paid 7eur for this shit and I feel like I got scammed. 2k19 is a better game IN EVERY WAY. Dont waste your time on this and play 2k19 or 2k17 instead.",1595358722,1595358722,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was really weary about buying this because all of the negative comments in here, but, as a newcomer to the series and a BIG RPG fan, I'm quite enjoying the ""MyCareer"" mode. I actually cared about what happens with the characters and felt quite connected to the team. Still getting used to the controls (only 5 hours in at the time of this posting), but playing the Career mode is actually teaching me how to play properly and went from a D- player to a B+ by the end of the draft (remember, I'm a newcomer so go easy on me).

I was also weary on buying because many people talked about it being glitchy, but I haven't found any so far and have always had a steady frame rate.

TLDR: If you're like me and this is your first NBA2K game, go for it, (wait for a sale if you want) just remember that most of the reviews are from people that have bought past titles and are comparing them (not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that it's not relevant to someone who hasn't played the other ones)",1595083265,1595083265,True,1,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

- MyCareer mode is still ok, but the story is not interesting nor decent, like every single edition.
- Parks and other Online game modes have lag, delay, server connection problems, overall the online experience is bad, the community is toxic, so those game modes have no purpose if you don't have a squad.
- Ultimate Team is solid, challenges are good, not too deversified but I guess 2K couldn't think out of the box for this one.

The main problems with this game in my opinion are the AI and the animations. Team mates don't execute plays, centers with no 3pt shot stay in corners, others are missing a lot of WIDE open shots. Screens don't trigger / animate like they should, opponents go through the screen as soon as it is set. And i'm not even bringing up the times the ball goes through hands, arms, heads, with no change in trajectory, the times you dive for a loose ball, grab the ball and then slide out of bounds, the reach-ins that either immediatly fouls the opponent or just does nothing to bother him. The times you have a clear path to the hoop on a fast break or penetration and your player just trigers a pullup in the paint instead of a lay up or dunk.

A lot of small glitches and bugs that could improve the game drasticly in my opinion. It's in the quality of the details that you can really see how good something is. NBA 2K20 is not one of those things, especially if you consider it's basicly the same game every years sinds new gen consoles.

Good overall game but way too overpriced for what it actually is. 2K has been recycling their game for over 3-4 years now, so there is no way this should be 60-70 bucks each year.


Ps: BTW, fuck 2K for always giving no shits about the PC community and always giving us a worse version of the game compared to consoles. Fuck them and Ronny for false advertising the park and other features of their game. I paid 13 bucks for this game and won't ever pay more than 15 bucks for a game that is filled with micro-transactions, pay-to-win mentality, bad servers, no fucks given about the feedback of 2k players / community.",1594889943,1594889943,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now lets get into the juicy stuff here:

Horrible Moderation: You have some of the most lazy Moderators in the world, working for this company, they simply will give you a macro or ignore you, basically it.

Crazy amount of hackers: Each year no matter what, theres going to be hackers, they do nothing at all about them and infact your most likely more often then not going to get warned or banned yourself for trying to report these hackers, its insane.

Censorship: Almost anything you say bad about the company or moderation staff will be censored near instantly, they don't want future new players or players coming from consoles to learn the terrible secrets that NBA 2K series is completely ruined by the amount of cheating, hacking and exploiting on PC, the moment you point something out like this anywhere else, you will be censored and most likely warned. Sad but true and the funny thing is, they protect the hackers like no tomorrow. 

Overall I would say do not invest money into NBA 2K or any of their PC games, even investing it into console enables them to keep printing the same game each year with zero anti-cheat and the worst support possible, the real only way to make a change is to do what? Protest their horrible services and treatment of customers. 

But everyone can do as they please, take this however you want but this review should be a pretty clear warning that they do not care and will not change. Also you can find many hacking threads and guides on Steam, apparently they're allowed but reporting cheaters and showing evidence on steam, even to have a laugh at the 1,000 foot ""Honey I blew up the kids"" will result in you being censored, warned or banned.",1569741737,1594849719,False,4,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

Don't buy this game. 

This game is beyond grindy and controls feel like there's a significant input lag when pressing buttons on my controller connected via usb. online requires me to unplug my mouse, keyboard, and keypad because there's no option in the game to switch inputs on the fly leading to a loss because I cannot move my MC on the court in neighborhood. Regarding the grind, it is insane how tedious it is to earn VC. It would've been fine if VC was used for cosmetics and the gambling aspects of the game, however it is also tied into character progression leaving you with a tough decision whether you want your character to ""git gud"" or not look broke as hell with the default clothes or even paying for the gambling to get better cards for myteam. The game constantly nudges you to pay for more VC which they constantly add the button to purchase VC when you're using VC to buy stuff. 

One of the most egregious moves 2K has implemented is to move MyCareer to online only, and it wasn't an accident. 2k knew the best way to entice players to pay for microtransactions is to make it online and have other players show off the cool and expensive items they've bought for their characters. You're not just worrying about how your character performs now, you're worried how your character looks to other players. For evidence, look no further than the 2k Neighborhood, where all the shops, gym, and training center are. In order to utilize those amenities, you must navigate yourself through the neighborhood, and walk by other players who look better than you in order to reach which ever facility you intend to visit. Sure you can try to avoid the neighborhood, however it is near impossible since you need to visit the shoe store for some shoe deals in mycareer, as well as the training facility where you can boost your stats by playing a couple of bad mini games.

So, let's talk about in game advertisements. Product placements are everywhere in this game, and when I say ""everywhere"" I really mean EVERYWHERE to the point where in a cutscene in mycareer you meet a representative for beats to which he asks the player to plug in beats in an interview. 2K was not subtle on the beats plug in, this game just advertised to me about certain beats headphones with active noise cancelling, to which I argue that my Sony WH-1000XM2s are just good enough for me with their amazing active noise cancelling which helps get me through this game, plus the Sony WH-1000XM2s has an ambient noise option which allows sounds from outside the headphones to pass through so you can hear and pay attention to your surroundings.(now wasn't that a good product placement? lol) This game is just a gargantuan advertisement that YOU PAY FOR. 

You are paying to get served advertisements, period.",1594706227,1594706227,False,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is my second 2k and it shows how little they care about the game. First of all this isn't nba 2k20 it's nba 2k19.2. Everything is basically  the same as 2k19. Mycarrer: The storyline is far less cringe than 2k19 and the new way to build your myplayer was a good new edit and that's pretty much the positiv. The negative on the other hand god damn.. The first seasone is just a long seasone of 2k trying to get you to buy VC. It's absolutely ridiculous how a player that's drafted into the best league on the planet and he can't shoot, dribble, shoot or even get a simple layup with just the smallest contact. The first 20-30 games is just absolute boredom of just grinding your player so he's at least decent. The nthe all star comes and it's pretty funny and the second half of the seasone is pretty fun. The playoffs is near and so is the awards. After the first seasone the mode becomes really boring. It's not even hard scoring 120 points. The AI is too bad and the pass the ball then run left and cut is absolutely game breaking. You need no iq and no skill to be good at myCareer you just need to grind for 2 weeks. The park is boring and the Rec center is pretty fun if you are 5 friends playing otherwise you'll just get a team of ball hogs. myTeam is what it is either you grind and will still be at a disadvantage after 100 of hours grinding. The mode basically begs you to pump in money into it. The cards are just too good and it takes out all the skill. They are also really unrealistic (like dribbling 3pt shooter shaq) The gameplay is nothing like basketball in myTeam. people just run around 6 feet outside the 3pt line and the shoots a deep three and ofcourse it hits because the cards are to op. I don't really play myLeague so i don't have a opinion i do play myGM tho. My experince of myGM was positiv i found it really fun but i haven't played any other myGM so i can't really compare it. Overall the game is pretty bad and the rec center (with friends), the first my carrer season (after 52 games) and playing against your friends with nba rosters is the only fun part about the game. 2k do better ffs",1594565757,1594565757,True,1,0,0.51776653528213501,1,True,False,False

Almost any action or aspect of the game (mycareer) will need you to either grind for hours for just a small improvement or pay up for VC to actually play the game. As well this game may only have servers up for 2 years, so any of the effort may actually be for nothing. Also MyTeam is just about the same. Random RNG to see if you might get something useful, but in reality you just won't get jack.
MYCareer is also a heap of trash. The ""story"" is just a giant cringe. Playing is a chore. It really is just something to kill time with, with no real reward after even 10+ hours.
The AI is terrible. Even a ported Garry's Mod NPC could probably do better, EX: 90's level players brick layup after layup. A player known for inside play and grabbing boards will grab a rebound, dribble out to the three point line then hold the ball forever till lobbing it to a guard or forward to brick a 2-person covered three. It's as if 2K has never actually watched or played a game of basketball in their life. 
Also, while some people think that the shotstick is a skill-base thing, it's absolute BS. No matter how well you hold it or release it it's pretty much just RNG if you get lucky enough to get a green shot. (Also even with a ""badge"" to make the consequences of poorly timed shotstick usage minimal, you still brick shots randomly.) Seriously it's easier just to run around the AI on defense and hope you get a lucky layup to not be missed. 
Also, one final sidenote if you hate ads. you will certainly hate this game. It's one walking ad. No matter what you do all you see is ads for gatorade, shoes, or some other random thing.

There was a time when I was running the fastbreak in a 2v1 situation and the AI ran straight out of bounds as I was passing the ball, costing me a turnover. Another one was when I passed the ball to the Anthony Davis inside who was wide open, but still did a pump fake which eventually lead to his actual shot attempt getting blocked. The animations and gameplay are simply very buggy. It just screws up MyCareer and gets really annoying. The game also tends to crash sometimes for reasons unknown.

Then once in MyPlayer mode, there are like a hundred cut-scenes in the first moments of that play mode. I'm not joking.  Just scene after scene after scene after scene after scene after scene....I played maybe 5 minutes of actual basketball and spent another 15 skipping through scenes.  It'd take an hour to actually watch 'em.  What a joke.

There's camera wonkiness as well.  Want to play every game mode with the same general side-view camera?  Nope.  The black-top and myPlayer modes (and maybe others) force you to play from a different camera angle, never really letting you get comfortable with one view.  Then in myPlayer mode, your defender will run off the side of the screen, so you run back to try to cover him, but good luck as you're both out of view.  Then the AI will pass to your opponent and he'll score. You'll get dinged points because of a defensive breakdown, but you couldn't even see what the hell was going on.  Fantastic work, 2K.

The overall gameplay mechanics are pretty frustrating as well.  Everything is delayed, slow, restrictive.  It feels like you're moving through butter.  Everything requires a length animation, so timing things like rebounding, blocks, and steals are just plain stupid and lame.  Sometimes you get lucky, but most of the time you are just off away from the play jumping by yourself, looking and feeling like an idiot.  I read a review that this game was less about pre-recorded animations, but yeah..that guy was full of it. This game is nothing be pre-recorded animations.  It's so boring and doesn't feel at all like I'm in real control.

2K really do suck at this.  It's a shame.  They spent all this time making cut-scenes with Idris Elba, and that squirrelly dude, Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley.  If you just want a solid gameplay experience and don't want to pay to watch a crapload of cut-scenes, look elsewhere.  Such a disappointment.  I'd love to sit down with the development team and look them square in the eyes and just say a ton of hurttful things to them.  They deserve it for this shameless money-grab.

Even then if you read the reviews there are numerous problems. I only bought this when it was on sale for $5 and I play it because I love basketball too much to not be playing an NBA video game.  
MyCareer is a ridiculous grind that is constantly trying to get you to spend more money, you cannot turn off 2KTV at all anymore (minor issue but it drives me nuts), and the feel of game 40 in the regular season against a team with a 11-29 record feels the exact same as a Game 7 in the NBA Finals all in MyCareer, MyGM, and MyLeague. They tried to switch up MyGM and I personally don't know what they were going for but it's not fun. MyLeague is fun but you have to manually change everything constantly to get it to feel real. Teams never change their lineups (even in the playoffs they'll go 10 deep in their rotations) unless there are injuries and they don't adapt well in-game. In a tie game late in the 4th quarter you can run pick-n-rolls all day and the most the AI will do is double team. With how much we are able to change in regards to defensive schemes I would like to see the AI be more adaptive. 
If you are a singleplayer 2K gamer DO NOT BUY UNLESS IT IS ON SALE. I mean AT LEAST 50% OFF. They're going to try to squeeze you for money non-stop after you buy it and it's not even a game worth $30.

I and several others who have purchased this game have been experiencing random crashes every 10-20 minutes of playing with no error pop-up. I have contacted 2K with no response. I have gone through multiple threads of attempting to fix the issue, ranging from updating graphics drivers to verifying game file integrity. Nothing has worked. Speaking with others on threads experiencing the same issues, it seems to affect users with Nvidia graphics cards. 2K probably will never fix this issue since they will be solely focused on making 2k21.
