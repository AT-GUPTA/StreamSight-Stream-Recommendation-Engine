The story wasn't super gripping (entertaining for sure, just not quite my speed) and, while I loved Crane Style, Tiger Style didn't feel very good to use in my opinion, so the combat didn't have quite as much variety as I was hoping for

That being said, THIS is one of the best RGG games without a doubt! The story is absolutely incredible with great pacing from start to end, the characters are deep and impactful, and every single combat style is so much fun - Tiger Style was actually my favourite in this one!!

I also found myself really enjoying the School Stories side content. Each minigame was a lot of fun (except for the early stages of the Robotics minigame, but once you get the speed upgrades it starts to feel a lot nicer to control)

I even ended up really enjoying the Kaito Files side-story. It was nothing life-changing, just a very engaging story with some really touching emotional beats. I've always really enjoyed Kaito's character so seeing his story explored in a bit more depth was very interesting to me

The combat is tight and exciting. The characters are well-developed (many thanks to the previous title, although even the new characters are very well made), and the action is intense. Unlike a lot of the Yakuza titles, the plot makes sense and is relatively easy to follow, even down to the minor details.
In plot context, this takes place following the events of Yakuza 7/Like a Dragon and Judgement, so the former to avoid spoiling that game, and the latter to properly appreciate this one.

Something to consider - but between the both of you... is there really a right answer?[/i]

The game is set in the Yakuza franchise, but it is more or less a soft reboot. There are slight callbacks to earlier games in the franchise, but you don't need to have played all the Yakuza games or even the first Judgment to enjoy and understand Lost Judgment.

[h1]Lost Judgment, shortly[/h1]
Lost Judgment is, not in particular contrast to other Yakuza games, a beat em up, but this time with detective elements such as tailing and observation to pick out as evidence later on.

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]

[b]Pros[/b]
-Excellent soundtrack. It feels modern and fitting to the game's period.
-Graphics. The Dragon engine looks good, even if combat physics might leave a bit to be desired. However, performance might be an issue even on lower settings due to how demanding the game is.
-Recycled as Kamurocho may be, it is still well updated.
-New bigger city to roam around in. However, at times it might feel empty or less alive than Kamurocho. Still refreshing, especially having played through all mainline Yakuza games.
-Combat is refreshingly done and felt nice, especially after the heavier combat of the earlier games. Way faster and encourages style-switch comboing.
-The story is actually relatable, yet still manages to even at times feel like well-written horror.
-Characters in the story feel like real characters. A clear antagonist who is obviously a sociopath and almost clearly in the wrong, can still feel like he has ground to stand on to justify his actions and as if he has a heart, haunted by his past who still owns up to his mistakes.
>Two characters simply talking to eachother in a room could never have been better.
-Availability and amount of side content.

[b]Cons[/b]
-May be a bit long-winded if you're not feeling patient. The game takes its' time with introductions to side content.
-The detective-spot portions want you to spot everything. Boring and annoying.
-Difficulty spikes at random. Some enemies do ridiculous damage - more damage than the level's actual boss.
-Unlike previous Yakuza games, dying twice and lowering difficulty is [i]permanent[/i] for your savefile.
-Clich√©s and tropes as with previous Yakuza games.
-At times plain unrealistic, taking leaps of faith (and logic) for the story to proceed as planned. I was purposefully picking the wrong, outlandish or otherwise stupid options in the ""present your evidence"" sections, and I accidentally picked the correct option. It's... a strange twist, to say the least.
-AI allies, which you actually have in this game as opposed to every Yakuza game, are downright useless.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Hand-to-hand combat based with detective aspects. Leveling system grants points per mobs killed / bosses beaten. However, you get barely anything unless you farm mobs or otherwise grind harder stuff for skill points.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Very power-consuming and can make your computer a space heater if tuned too high. Far more realistic graphics with more detailing.
Animations or poses can be clunky, though.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
One of the best I've heard in a game.
It is grandstanding, but it succeeds at it.
The game's main villain has, at first, a dark synth-esque fight track that lets you know there's something more lurking underneath, and the finale track for him is... something you should play the game for.
Bosses in general have fitting tracks. A knife psycho has a track with Psycho (1960) callbacks and an elegant piano to fit his personality. A scrappy brawn-based boss has a suiting electronic track to go along with a Scarface-like personality and upbringing.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Lost Judgment is a wonderful game and an excellent step away from the heavy-to-fill shoes of Yakuza's earlier protagonists. Despite it's story and gameplay shortcomings, it remains a very enjoyable experience you'll want to see through to the end and to see it's contributions to important societal questions as much as be able to do ridiculous heat actions on random Kamurocho inhabitants.",1708628724,1708628724,True,3,0,0.53063887357711792,0,True,False,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------

PROS
- 4 Different types of Martial arts ( including one from School Side Quest )
- School Stories (Different From Side Quests) around 8 different to Master and will provide the best type of fun Challenge such as the best imho :- 
Boxing ( its like a totally awesome game of its own where you can spar to upgrade boxing stats to take up like 15 different class of challengers , learn moves from your boxing coach and even can used to apply to one of your fighting style outside the boxing ring) this is much more interesting compared to yakuza series underground fight.

Dancing - Rhythm game but its not as easy at it sounds compared to yakuza karaoke series. you need master the game in order to help your students win national championship.

Racing - again like crash bandicoot where you enter the underground street racing world where you take on around 12 different racing crews while they use weapons like molotov cocktails like fireworks, weapons and such in the same time need to keep up to speed to race the boss

Skateboarding - kinda mini tony pro skater type of game, easier but equally challenging in later levels

Photography - this is kinda lame but whatever

Robot Fighting - kinda like nintendo japanese robot fighting game, while you control robots along with two AI controlled allies battle with other schools in order get more parts to build stronger robots to further advance to harder robots

Drinking - this one is kinda lame unless you like dating sim conversation mini games where you answer bar girls question while getting drunker and drunker and your English have to be at least decent to score. 
------------------------------
- Mahjong - is much easier compared to among 5-6 different yakuza games i played.. you tend you draw better tiles in my honest opinion. definitely easiest way to earn money if you are well versed with the rules. 

- Stories & Side quests - Totally made more sense and interesting storylines and cases compared to like a dragon series mini games. Yakuza series have some good ones but plenty of bad ones like chasing a person in order to get back a toy for a kid. Some of the side quests in Lost judgement are so smartly crafted that you kinda learn something in real life that you can brag with your non gaming friends such as the quest ( mask of the Chaos author)

- Story is even darker than Yakuza series ( meaning you might even see innocent NPCs you cared for DIE ) compared to Yakuza series where you know that guy should die, he dies, or even when you think he should die but never dies no matter how many times you think he is going to die. Making it even more important to invest in the game to bring justice to bad guys.

- traveling is awesome as you can unlock the fastest skateboard to glide around town in a very fast fashion.

CONS
- stealth quests are kinda lame and one sided sometimes it made no sense. definitely the main factor making the game looks dumb.

- moves have no to very few explanation, such as EX surrender, when you upgrade skills you sometimes don't know what they do because they are meant to enhance a skill that you don't even know how to do at the first place.

- No karaoke, no Pool table

- No load game function, need to go return to title if you wanted to load ( they fixed this in Like a Dragon:Infinite Wealth )

- No fast travel system like Like a Dragon:Infinite Wealth

- No weapon customization ",1708366797,1708367371,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Honestly, this was my first venture into a proper JRPG since Final Fantasy 7 in my teens‚Ä¶I‚Äôm 36 now and had hit an age where I was finding it hard to get anywhere near the levels of immersion from games as I did as a child. 

My God this game had me as immersed as I possibly could be. 

Every night once the wife and I put our kid down to sleep, I got to go and live my life as Tak in this game. I wasn't a dad in my mid thirties anymore, I was a lean, mean crime fighting machine with former triads as friends and such combat ability I feel like I could kick Donnie Yen's ass.

I wanted to take part in every school club, complete every side quest, and explore every inch of the city and then there‚Äôs the combat. 

Holy hell it‚Äôs the most satisfying combat system I‚Äôve ever come across. The graphics, the realism, in some cases the difficulty - it‚Äôs SO satisfying. 

But most of all, this game had me feeling like I was the living character in one of the all time great films - the storyline, the character progression, the surprised, the intelligence in the script and crime solving side, the gang vibes - this finally gave me the feeling I‚Äôd longed for, for a long time. 

That feeling when as you play, in the moment, almost from the get go, you tell yourself ‚Äúthis is one of those experiences that once I‚Äôve completed it I wish I could erase my memory and do it again, so I‚Äôm going to make the most of this and savour every second‚Äù. And boy did I. 

And yes, you will too. I cannot think of a single flaw in this game, I got to enjoy - 

Skateboarding. 

Building and fighting robots. 

Detective/mystery club. 

Dance club (yup, even this had me completely hooked) 

Motorcycle racing 

Drone racing 

And so much more. 

I have this game right up with the heaviest of my nostalgia rankings - 

FF7, Mass Effect Trilogy, Red Dead 2, Skyrim, Fallout 3/New Vegas, Half Life 2 when it first came out. 

Don‚Äôt live your life counting yourself as any sort of gamer, until you‚Äôve played this, at least try it, you won't regret it!

Pros:
visually stunning
voice acting is really good
dogs and cats
characters

cons:
the parkour in this game is so shit and janky
The bosses are shit compared to judgement
half of the fighting style is the same as judgment and reused animation when pressing triangle/Y
npcs repeat the same recorded voice lines as in judgment
they give you a skateboard so that you can use it in the new and empty area ,but you cant use it in the sidewalks WHY?????? it is so stupid this is a game not reality
if you have arthritis in your thumb ,well don't worry you will after this game in-order to speed up the skateboard you have to smash the X/A button repeatedly.
If i hear yagami SAY SAWA- SENSEI ONE MORE TIME I SWEAR
TRANSLATION IS SHIT in a story driven game
detective mode, you have to point exactly at the spot the game wants you to even though you know what you are supposed to do 
the equipment system felt pointless in normal difficulty

I often put up with rough mechanics to watch an interesting story, or allow fun combat to carry me through a plodding arc, but Lost Judgment is the first of these games to just feel clumsy on all counts, and I hope it is not indicative of the direction of future games.  

Compared to the games on either side of this one, Judgment and Like a Dragon: Ishin!, both of which I enjoyed, this one feels like a misstep,  Certainly, Like a Dragon: Gaiden is incredible, so hopefully they bring those developments to bear on the Judgment series as well.

The story requires suspension of disbelief at essentially every turn.  I felt the same way about Judgment, but I chalked that up to my experience with the pharmaceutical industry, which most people wouldn't be expected to share.  That's fair.

By comparison, I'm not an expert on Japanese jurisprudence -- maybe they really don't have clear laws against overt contempt of court or blatant criminal conspiracy in Japan -- but I found Lost Judgment's insistence upon the untouchability of its linchpin antagonist very hard to swallow.  

Every chapter makes at least one substantial leap of logic, sometimes even contradicting an assumption that needed to be true for a previous leap to be accepted.

It's also depressing.  Making a video game about bullying is a tough sell to begin with, but when your ethical dilemma is whether or not it is acceptable to /torture and murder/ bullies who drive others to suicide, you have to be real careful that your protagonists don't lose sight of the fact that IT IS NOT OKAY, and start treating the villains like they are worthy of admiration, which totally happens here.  By the end of this thing, I didn't want to be on /anybody's/ side.

The combat just feels... incomplete.  They introduce the new Snake stance very early as a way to engage high school delinquents without injuring them, but it quickly becomes apparent that it is far superior to either Tiger or Crane stance in the vast majority of circumstances, at least without upgrades.  It deflects attacks from behind, disarms basic combatants with a free QTE, and turns enemies into projectile weapons at the end of almost every combo.  

It is GREAT FUN, but it is so effective that I finished 90% of the game on Normal or Hard without ever spending a single point on a skill.  Eventually, I was getting one-shotted often enough by bosses that some health upgrades were a must.

Street combat is always trivial, even on Hard, but boss combat is dangerously unpredictable on Easy, full of staggering interrupts, unblockable stun combos, and even instant-kill QTEs.  You can have a boss down to their magic pixel after a long fight, only for them to lock you into an unblockable that eats half your health and downs you, starting you over.  This happened to me often enough that I started to use extracts (magic potions) to cheese my way through boss fights on the second attempt, simply because I wasn't willing to put in the time again.

You encounter bosses with four and five health bars quite early on.  It feels like the combat engine designers took this one off, and their B team throws the kitchen sink at you to keep you from realizing.  None of the big fights in this game feel challenging, they are just over-long and full of cheats and damage sponges.  The game pulls shenanigans like three back-to-back corridor fights against a boss with a hard counter against frontal assault, not to mention his regenerating entourage.  It just feels like punishment.

The game also misuses its detective game mechanics; instead of having you find one thing in a room or choose one piece of evidence to reveal, on a number of occasions the game forces you to find all six elements of a parkour course in first-person before you can attempt it, or forces you to cycle through eight of the ten articles of evidence in your possession to have the plot re-explained to you so you can progress, but still laughs at you if you choose one of the remaining two equally irrelevant pieces of evidence.

At one point, the game takes away your smartphone, and when combat starts you realize it really has, removing your character's ability to access your inventory, equipment, crafting, and settings menus.  That's not clever design, it's desperation.  To add insult to injury, pausing the game in this circumstance informs you, ""You don't have a smartphone right now!"" and upon unpausing, your character does a little pocket-patting dance that causes him to drop anything in his hands and become uncontrollable. 

Even considering all of this, there is still a fun game in Lost Judgment, but the one thing I really can't forgive is how often the game goes back to the well of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory -- on many, many occasions, you spend a ton of time and effort defeating a boss only for them to win anyway.  

I understand that sometimes it is necessary to have an incomplete victory to progress the plot, but I mean, these are literal cases of the boss you just brought to zero health sucker punching you in a cutscene, and then utilizing that advantage to get one over on you, whether that means stealing a plot device, hurting you, or hurting someone you care about.  There are better ways to handle this.  I've played ten RGG games that handle it better.

If the player wins, let them win.  If you can't afford to let the player win, don't let them fight.

On a final point, I really enjoyed the high school framing of the major minigames and subplots, but choosing to organize it as an unlocking progress tree was a mistake.  You can still make progress on the side story if you are not good at the minigames, but man is it slow, and if you don't like one of the minigames, you're forced to do it over and over again anyway to get to the next one, which might also suck.

The dance club rhythm game is fun.  Virtua Fighter 5 is Virtua Fighter 5.  The robotics club... 1990s edutainment... thing... is unthinkably terrible, in a game that also includes drone customization and real live third-person camera drone racing.

Contrast Like a Dragon: Gaiden's Akame Network, which is there when you want it and completely unobtrusive otherwise.  I understand folks thinking that was too simplistic -- it probably was -- but I appreciated being able to do substories on my time and at my speed.

A lot of development resources went into Seiryo High School, to the point that it is almost a third city destination, and I think I would have rathered a less anemic Kamurocho or Ijincho, both of which feel empty in comparison to earlier games.

Bleh, I dunno.  It's fine, honestly; I was just led to expect better by this studio's track record.",1706574559,1706809266,True,2,0,0.508770525455474854,0,True,False,False

It's also the first RGG game using the Dragon Engine that has combat I'd actually consider as well made and fun as Y0's combat. 4 Stances (plus 2 for Kaito in the DLC) if you include the secret stance from the side content, and they're all much improved from the original Judgment (which I enjoyed, but not nearly as much as Lost Judgment)

Also, Yagami is great and has really come into his own as a character here. That boy just don't quit, and he's got a great squad with him. Reminds me of Kiryu's glory days in Yakuza 4 with the boys.

If you liked the previous game, or Ryu Ga Gotoku studio (RGG) games in general this is not a miss.

To speak in broad terms, this game, much like its predecessor is RGG's attempt at making a detective protagonist.
Keyword is attempt, as at the end of the day this is still an RGG game, and as with all RGG games, the protagonist defeats a small army by the end of it.
Final chapter in particular has him (along with 3 basically useless AIs) going against around 100 enemies + 2 tanky bosses.
That's not to say that the story sucks, there is no mystery, or there is no sleuthing taking place.
All of that is definitely present, and is at a more than acceptable level.
There is a well-presented mystery, and what I found an interesting story.
What I am trying to complain about is that this is not so much a ""detective"" game as it is an action brawler.
At the end of the day, it is not the evidence you gather that brings you closer to the truth, but rather beating basically everyone into submission.
It works as far as RGG games go, but if you are looking for a more ""mystery solving"" game, this is not it.

I would say that I liked the story of this game more than its predecessor.
As with previous title, I think that the protagonist does not deliver his point across strongly enough.
Once again, I find that the antagonist is very relatable, even more so than Yagami (the protagonist) himself.
Antagonist makes a clear point as to why he does what he does, and why he sees it as necessary.
He has collaborators who agree with him, and the antagonist does his damn hardest to not compromise them.
This is to the point where he stays steadfast in his conviction to not harm his (in his opinion most important) collaborator after being betrayed by them, and even crying when they decide to take Yagami's side and give themselves to the police.
Meanwhile, Yagami's main argument seemed to have revolved around one bystander dying, which kinda begs the question if that's the only problem he had with the antagonist's actions.

I do not have much to say about graphics and gameplay of this title.
It runs on the modern RGG engine, and has gotten the same treatment as all RGG games.
There are a lot of side activities to be had, definitely more than is necessary.
Graphics look nice, game runs smoothly (even on linux).
Compared to previous game, I would say there have been massive improvements.
Combat got better compared to previous title.
There is a new style (technically two), and it is an absolute pleasure to use.
For once, I start to feel that the combat is not just a DPS race slugfest, but actually skill based.
There were still a few annoyances that left it feeling like the dumb slugfest, but overall, an improvement.
SP is much easier to procure in this game, I felt like there was barely enough for anything in previous game, whereas in this one I was swimming in it, and got basically all upgrades I wanted half-way in (though I did grind for a few hours out of personal volition).
This entry also does away with the annoying ""mortal wounds"" mechanic of the previous game, there is no longer a need to deal with annoying health limitations.
This is also probably the first game since Yakuza 0 that actually got me somewhat interested in its side content.
""School stories"" is an interesting take, but ultimately I gave up because I could not be bothered to go through the dancing segments that you are forced to take.

To summarize, this is a solid entry in RGG's lineup.
People who are familiar with RGG's games can expect more of the same goodness.

Playtime: 68 hours (61H main game + 7H DLC)

Synopsis:
Maingame - When a convicted police officer discloses the murder of the student teacher who bullied his son to suicide, the dark secrets of a Yokohama high school rise to the surface. Fight for the truth as detective Takayuki Yagami and go undercover at a prestigious high school to solve a string of twisted bullying cases. But as victims pile up, caught in a cycle of bullying and revenge, will the scales of justice tip in favor of defending the law or enacting vengeance? Crack skulls to crack the case in this action-packed legal thriller.

DLC - Following the events of Lost Judgment, Kaito starts a lucrative case while Yagami is out of town, that unexpectedly has him searching for his old flame, Mikiko. Along the way, Kaito encounters a teenager claiming to be their son and team up to uncover the truth behind Mikiko's disappearance.

Now Kaito stands at the crossroads of past and present while up against a syndicate tied to Kamurocho‚Äôs criminal underbelly. But why did Kaito and Mikiko split up, and what does this dark fraternity have to do with her?

Plus:
+The gameplay is much better than judgement with now yagami have snake style and boxing as DLC style
+The Battle music and Boss music is banger
+2 Maps to explore is kamurocho and ichinjo
+The story is more tight so the pacing is not so bad like judgement
+School Stories is makin major of the substories/cases
+Kaito Files DLC is a great 10 hour-ish story for him to develop as a character with simple yet robust fighting style
+More easy to collect material and minigame
+The gauntlet is more fun than climax battle 

Minus:
-Lost judgement ""villian"" character is comically evil to extent  and include Kaito Files DLC main antagonist
-SP skill got inflated because is more easy to grind SP
-Hug bomb item got nerf hard 
-Some skill book and item got lock in the gauntlet
-Stealth section is wonky
-Tailing mission is got nerf so much that only use 3-4 times only..

Mixed:
=The story main focus is kinda got blurry in middle because a certain character death 
=a certain character become so much a crutch that the character talk is makin so much passive aggressive remarks
=Parkour mechanic is just a gimmick
=you cannot use disguise in main game, only in Kaito Files DLC
= some character like hoshino and sugiura have little influence on the main story

the theme about bullying is great problem to tackle, but the later is much more focus on injustice of law, but at least they got the message 

with that, only LAD8, LAD gaiden, and LAD Ishin is the game that i not played yet..

[b]SPOILER FREE[/b]

[b]plot:[/b] never have i been so captivated with an rgg game‚Äôs plot, so much so that i kept creating theories on how every plot line somehow weaved together, even in my free time when i definitely should‚Äôve been not thinking about this goddamn game ‚Äî truly one of the most refreshing, complex and nuanced takes on the grey zones that arise from the law, and the differences between justice vs punishment. the mystery surrounding the story is easy to grasp and so fun to try to make of every clue that pops up. at times, i felt there were some sequences that felt a little out of place or not necessary to the plot at large, but i ended up having a blast going through the motions with them anyways, regardless of their purpose. i also (as always) really appreciate how rgg tackles grey issues, and how the solution is never just black or white. this game explicitly touched on that sentiment and it was executed so well that even i felt myself switching sides every other chapter and rooting for characters i didn‚Äôt think i should‚Äôve been rooting for. the ending left me with a truly hollowed, empty gut feeling that i haven‚Äôt experienced since i finished yakuza: like a dragon, and i wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world. i‚Äôm so glad this game exists. [b]9.8/10[/b]

[b]characters:[/b] i mean cmon what‚Äôs not to love?!? i admit i might be a little biased with my love of the found family trope but this ragtag team of losers won over my heart last game, but this just solidified it tenfold. the characters introduced this game were absolutely fascinating to watch whether they were a poor school teacher or an absolute terrifying almost psychopath seeking what he thinks is justice. each character was given time to be explored (except maybe koda, sadly) and their motivations, feelings, and actions all made sense in their own contexts. this game introduces my favorite yakuza antagonist of all time, and some of my favorite protagonists too. yagami is never not a joy to play and his crew is just so heartwarming to watch pal around. i need a beach filler episode. [b]10/10[/b]

[b]side content:[/b] oh jesus christ where do i even start man‚Ä¶ there is SO much side content. so much. i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as much as other yakuza games but my god it feels like a dauntingly large amount of side content to get through, especially the school stories. not that it‚Äôs necessarily a bad thing, i‚Äôve had so much fun with every minigame this game has thrown at me with it seemingly getting more goofy as time goes on. i imagine when i go on to 100% this eventually i‚Äôll grow tired of filling squares with robots or boxing the shit out of people but for now i‚Äôm having a blast. seriously, there has to be at least one minigame in this game that you‚Äôll become obsessed with and complete the kamurogo in one sitting. OH YEAH SUBSTORIES ‚Äî they introduced a new way of finding side cases through chatter, where you then find the source of the sub story by either observing, sound amping, dog smelling, or frequency detecting. this has been such a fun mechanic to play around with and hasn‚Äôt felt tedious at all as of typing this (could change at the drop of a hat who knows). yagami is so funny in his straight man humor that each side case is a blast to play through. [b]9.8/10[/b]

[b]voice acting (jp):[/b] fucking. incredible. not a moment went by where i felt taken out of the moment by distracting voice acting and everybody just knocks it out of the park. we got TWO!!! screams this game and both were heart breaking in their raw emotion and delivery that i had to pause and take it in. each voice perfectly fits the character and it‚Äôs just such a treat to listen to. [b]10/10[/b]

[b]ost:[/b] just listen to viper brah. dig in your heels. unwavering belief. there wasn‚Äôt a single track that i wasn‚Äôt bopping my head to. even the substory chase music (as goofy as it is) was so endearingly stupid that i swung back around to loving it. the jazz mixed with techno works surprisingly well and perfectly encapsulates how this game feels. will be listening to the ost on repeat until the end of time. [b]10/10[/b]

[b]gameplay:[/b] okay i don‚Äôt think anybody likes the tailing missions i‚Äôll be honest BUT they majorly improved how shitty it was from judgment. they even introduced a stealth mechanic which i honestly felt was coming down the pipe at some point and i‚Äôm so glad they implemented it. yagami is such an athletic person that the parkour mechanic was so in character i barely even blinked twice, plus it's so fun to climb buildings to find vantage points on your foes and stuff. i didn‚Äôt have any massive complaints about the gameplay, except maybe how frequently they make you go back and forth to sleep at the office and take a taxi and shit when they could just let me get on with the story, although i understand why they implemented that. ALSO SKATEBOARDING HELLO??? [b]9/10[/b]

[b]combat:[/b] the best i‚Äôve played from any rgg game, beating out ishin. it just felt so fluid, and we get four styles. each punch and kick had an impact and the sound design associated with each style is so mesmerizingly unique and a treat to my ears and eyes. i couldn‚Äôt even express to you how much i‚Äôve happy laughed at some EX moves, with how stupidly cool they look and how much pain i‚Äôd be in if i were on the other end of yagami‚Äôs shoe. tag team moves were a pleasure to watch as always!!! one thing they changed (at least in hard mode?? i think) was adding more difficult qtes and i fucking love it. the stakes have never been higher in these fights cause if you mess up some of these qtes, you either insta die or have to redo the qte while your foe reheals. it‚Äôs just such a nice change of pace from other rgg games where i felt the qtes were almost too easy and i never felt challenged enough in boss fights. speaking of boss fights oh my god these dynamic intros are hands down the best i‚Äôve seen period. like we‚Äôve peaked here i don‚Äôt need to see any more it‚Äôs truly insane.

Lost Judgment is a game full of varied content to do and it is what this game suffers from the most. It is obvious that this is the product of cultivation of both years of preceding RGG games and a great effort. There are more than 30 minigames in this game and tons of other things to do. 
So, what is the problem then?

1- Minigames are hardly play-tested or ever balanced. In any minigame with AI opponents, from classics like Mahjong or Poker to new minigames like drone racing or motorcycle races, AI will cheat %100 of the time and you have to use specific anti-AI tactics to win. It does not matter how good you play the minigames, if you don't specifically play around AI's cheats, you are going to lose.

2- Even if you don't wish to complete everything and it's just that you want to see every cutscene instead, you are going to play a good chunk of those 30 minigames. Now, look, let's say that they were all perfectly made minigames (They are not); no one is going to like every single one of them. If you lock certain content behind those minigames, you have to make sure that every single one of them are as enjoyable as rest of the game. Unfortunately, they are not and although there were some of them I liked to play as much as the base game, there were an equal amount of, perhaps even more, minigames I absolutely detested playing. And that will be the case for a lot of people. You can't expect people to like all of those minigames.

3- After all those complaining about abundance of minigames, this might sound ironic but: Lost Judgment needed another minigame, or I should say, a content where you actually can play the game's brilliantly made fun combat system. RGG studios, in their infinite wisdom, decided to remove Arena from Judgment series albeit it was present in its predecessors. Hell, Like a Dragon: Gaiden has just came out and Arena plays a major role in that game. Why wouldn't they just let us play the game in an environment tailored to test our skills? Currently, if you wish to play the game itself after finishing the main story, there are only 2 options: You either have to go around streets, beating up laughably weak punks or you have to go into Gauntlet mode from main menu, in which you are limited in all aspects (Which items you may use, which combat styles you may use etc.). Ironically, in this game that is full of content to do, there is no content to fight against strong enemies, using everything we have farmed for so far.

I know the first 2 points are present in all RGG studios' games but I have not written a review for them so I'm mentioning them here, since they also apply to Lost Judgment. As for third point, it's truly unfortunate that they withhold such content from us in the game that's considered to have the best combat of the entire series by majority of the RGG fanbase. And rightfully so, Lost Judgment has 4 vastly differing combat styles, all fleshed out and fun-to-play with. Although they could have done a better job with style-switching buttons. It was far better in Yakuza 0 whereas styles were assigned to all different buttons rather than a single button to switch to them in-order, one-by-one.

That all being said, I wrote all these because I truly like this game and I would have loved it if they had added the missing pieces because all the potential was there. Lost Judgment is a great game and worth both your time and money. In case you may want to skip all the side content, you still have 35 hours of main story to play to your heart's content.",1704930533,1704930533,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game is pretty much Kiwami 2 in the sense that literally everything in the story is there to make the main antagonist a better character, only that this game manages to do it better than k2. I feel like i should mention the school stories in this because it took me the same time it took me to beat the main story to get all those school stories done so TL;DR is it's a bit hit or miss, some stories (boxing gym) can be absolute gold while others (take your pick) are just there, but overall I liked the story, grinding them was ass tho but I can't complain about that too much since it is optional. Lastly The Kaito Files was basically what the Majima Saga in K2 should've been, an actually interesting story. I really enjoyed the story and the combat was also really fun, so good to see Brawler and Beast being brought back again. This game showcases the godlike writing RGG is capable of and I really hope the next games in the franchise are as good as this one.

The first game compared to the other Yakuza games within the new flashy dragon engine (Kiwami 2, and Yakuza 6) looked like a tech demo compared to Judgment. But I am shocked and astonished to admit that the sequel not only expands on the gameplay in the first game but also makes Judgment look like a demo.

Gameplay - Even without the new and technique heavy snake style which straight up slaps, the two previous styles have been massively fine tuned. Tiger is still bursty as ever, and crane is no longer complete garbage. They gave crane that juicy attack speed buff when you evade that the whole style desperately needed, along with a new mechanic called ""Crane Dance"" which flips Yagami in the air to either evade or pull off special combos or EX actions. Where in the previous game I would be permanently in tiger style, here you really do have to switch to crane at least once in a fight to get some nice damage in. But onto the snake style, just whoever came up with the combos, and system for snake holy shit i love them. If you time your guard just right you can just completely parry an enemies attacks and fear them into a 1 shot EX action just like that. Hell, they even re-did previous reused EX actions in the last game and gave it a brand new fresh coat of paint and im all for it, helps keeps things exciting! Im happy to also see that toned down trailing missions which really wore their welcome in the previous game after the first few, but also reworked it a bit to where you can now hide just about anywhere and you dont have to go to scripted areas to shelter yourself from the enemies site. They also added two new sections you can run into being stealth and parkour. Now stealth is an amazing idea for Yagami on paper. It makes more sense for a detective to sneak around enemy locations than the typical long fight brawl and bashing your way into enemy territory like a yakuza. Dont get me wrong the long fights are still spectacular, but from a logic standpoint its like the fuck. But actually doing stealth is really janky, sometimes enemies just decide they have a sixth sense and can look behind them at random while you're crossing from them and when they spot you, thats it you're toast, and sometimes there are just kill barriers that instantly get you spotted whenever going to a specific spot, and its just overall janky. The parkour segments on the other hand, are handled quite nicely and have different mechanics like wall running and pipe swinging to keep things spiced up. Overall, great gameplay switch ups aside from a few hickups.

Setting - You travel between two cities in this game, Kamurocho which was the main location of the last game, and Isezaki Ijincho of Yokohama! Its great to see the funny rpg game map from Yakuza: Like a Dragon shown to us in real time combat, and im also happy to see both cities get equal enough game time to keep you entertained. Isezaki Ijincho was a little weird tho, with some places like the bottom half of the redlight district, and commercial district being cut off by objects and sometimes invisible walls that was accessible in Yakuza: Like a dragon, but in turn adding a brand new area being the Seriyo School acting as a sort of hub for a bit of the side content of the game.

Mini games - I am was anticipating this game's side content quite a bit because i've heard that there were quite a bit of different things to do within Yokohama, but wow I was just blown away at how much that was just thrown at me. Not talking about the elephant in the room being the ""Side Content"" which ill explain below this point, the normal mini games we have are still quite a blast. VR paradise and drone racing return from Judgment with a new fresh coat of paint with new coarses or a complete new overhaul to how the game works. Arcelios is brand new and is found within the VR paradise location where you blast different enemy types as fast as you can while surviving with different abilities, and wow was it surprisingly addicting, I swear its always the mini games that im least excited for that catch me off guard and gets me wanting more.

Side Content - Usually these games give you a side content story cultivating with usually a big mini game, like business mini game in Yakuza 7, and 0, or cabaret mini game in Yakuza Kiwami 2, and 0, but this game really took it to the next level and gave us a whole bunch of mini games connected to each other through a story that progresses the more and more you complete different mini games. Going back to the Seriyo School hub that they added to the game, reason I said hub is because this is where most of the mini games to this side story take place, if not start here. Mini games ranging from different school activities like robotics (which was super addicting customizing a robot team and then heading into pve combat arenas) or dance club (with a complete banger ost and dancing combos that hit you with straight dopamine), or to boxing (which the more you progress through the boxing story and more skills you learn within the boxing mini game, the more those moves can be applied into outdoors combat in a whole new 4th style just called ""boxer""), and thats just half of it. None of the different mini games within the side story felt like filler or bloat, I found everything enjoyable whether it was instantly or took some growing on to.

Extras - Im happy to see the return of the proving grounds or ultimate battles renamed as ""The Gauntlet"" in the brand new dragon engine and yep its def. a challenge giving you spins on fights, focusing on a specific technique, or showing off a gameplay switchup like that 10 minute stealth section that can go fuck itself. A new cool thing with the gauntlet is that you can get items from first time completions like either extraction potions to help buff you, gear, or completely cosmetically items, and collectibles such as records. Honestly was just really cool to look forward to after completing a chapter, and acted as a sort of break from the story and tear fest.

The combat is undoubtedly one of the best RGGS has to offer, but as fan of yakuza/judgment stories which IMO is still so much more important I have to say Lost Judgment's story is the absolute weakest I've experienced so far. 
Whereas in the first game Judgment it was incredibly interesting to learn about the ""fallen"" lawyer Yagami, his backstory and motivation, and experience his character growth, 
the sequel offers nowhere near as much character development time: Yagami stays the same from beginning to the end, his character story incredibly bland, frustratingly boring to watch.
There are some major moments, where the game could have used them to make him more interesting, but no, after some tiny emotional outbursts or occasional brain fogs he returns back to the same old calm, wise character.
The school setting of the main story is refreshing, the horrible problems of school bullying are handled well (shout out to Sawa-Sensei) but it just doesn't help when the protagonist remains so bland for the majority of the game.
So what about the other returning characters? 

I liked... Kaito and Shirosaki, I guess, but what about the rest?
You could delete Sugiura and replace his tiny parts with Kaito, absolutely nothing of value would be lost.
Tsukumo aka ""Hackerman"", the typical boring plot device, to make some occasional discoveries.
Hoshino? Laughable, I don't even want to talk about him.
What they did to Genda hurt me, I liked the old mentor in judgment who never gave up on Yagami, influencing his character growth. Here? Nearly invisible. 
Mafuyu, fan favorite, the same treatment.
Lost Judgment massacred so many cool characters from the first game, that I wonder if the writers were suffering from burnouts or were just simply replaced by worse ones.

Oh, and don't get me started with the antagonists.
There are so many repetitive, redundant moments in the story where Yagami and one of the main antagonists meet up, bicker about their motives, over and over again. 
Maybe trying to overcompensate for the lack of depths of the other antagonists?

So what about the side stories?
Oh boy. Ignoring the disgusting fact that SEGA or RGGS hid some of the better ones behind locked DLCs, the majority of the stories are a boring mess. 
I just finished the game, and for the love of God, I seriously can't remember most of them (besides the school side stuff) because how utterly bland they were.
I liked the mystery club, boxing, and some others, one of the highlights of the side stories. But when you compare them to the rest, it's just... sad. 

Ryu Ga Gotoku can do so much better, they showed it over and over again.

I was bullied during my school years a lot and it let me a lot of scars and trauma for me to battle them. That aspect of the game was done wonderfully and accurately. I believe that in the rest of the game that it lacks good writing (or at least on-par with the first one).
Gameplay-wise, this is really incredible. Very few slow tailing missions, almost none lockpicking (which is made easier) and more gadgets to play with. The combat is a big step up from Judgement. On the final chapters, when I unlocked many of his abilities, Yagami feels really good to control to. He may not be as powerful as Kiryu or Saejima, but I think he reached the level of fun that Akiyama had in Y4. I really liked how they nerfed Tiger and buffed Crane, as well as the new style Turtle. This is the only game in the whole Yakuza/LAD franchise that I used every style the same and I didn't prefer one.  
Story-wise, in the early chapters and the school stories are really good. I didn't really like any of the side-cases, which is a bummer because I play this games to have some laugh with the sub-stories as much as to get sad with the main story. The latter chapters have a lot of bad pacing and a lot of stuff are repeated. I think I read the same dialogue up to five times in one hour. Some story-bits are even taken directly from the first game like [spoiler] Saori infiltrating the cabaret club  [/spoiler]. Some characters from the first game that returned didn't have the same charm they had, like Siguira and even Yagami. Yagami's whole character arc from the first game is almost forgotten in this one.
That being said, I really enjoyed my time and I may have said that it's the series best brawler if I hadn't played The Man Who Erased His Name mid-way through my play through of this one. I haven't played Kaito's File as of the time of writing this review, but I will write a separate review there.",1703897266,1703897461,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your role is detective and former Lawyer Takayuki Yagami. Called to Ijincho to investigate a suicide at Seijo High School your case quickly begins to tangle itself with a few other plotlines which I won;t talk about for spoilers.

Lost Judgment is an absolutely gorgeous game. I don't know how RGG does it but they are on top of it in the graphics department. It's easy to see the beautifully crafted world around you but small details such as pants wrinkling as you move creates a highly detailed world.

The combat is excellent and fluid. You are given 2 fighting styles and unlock 2 more for a total of 4 fighting styles. Crane and Tiger return giving hefty upgrades and REAL utility to the crane style while nerfing Tiger so it's not busted easy to beat foes (seriously, that 1-inch punch-like move made the game a cake walk). Snake is a style that has you focusing only effectively catching attacks and and swiftly striking back although most of this is done through heat button prompts. Boxing is a style borrowing moves from the later unlockable boxing side quest. The fact that you can juggle most bosses makes this style head and shoulders above the rest. All are fun to play and have their utility throughout the game.

I won't talk a lot about the story but it's well crafted, detailed and puts you through a rollercoaster of emotions.

As of now I have not completed Kaito Files, will update my review when completed.

This is genuinely one of the best games I've played. Sale or full price, with all of the typical RGG filler of side quests, stories and mini games, or just breezing through the 25 hour story (you'll find at least 1 side activity you'll end up enjoying, trust me), this is another RGG game that offers so much bang for your buck with all the high quality of a Japanese AAA game.",1703885310,1703885414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

We can acttualy become a real hero, who stand for people by law instead of a scary looking but suprisingly kind man go aroud to help people but after all, they are some kind of criminal.  I just love this",1703481369,1703481369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat wise, it was welcoming to see a new snake style being incorporated as well as reworking crane style to be a more effective way for crowd control.  It was also interesting to see more varied gameplay elements such as the stealth and parkour missions being mixed in to add flavor.

Another aspect that I thoroughly enjoyed was the school stories which had a nice plot (twist) that tied everything together as well as brought back the prior side content villains from previous game to evoke some recognition and nostalgia.

In addition, the Kaito files expansion was also an interesting extension as you get to play Kaito as the main character and experience his unique fighting styles as well as learn more about his past background.  Really delighted to see that they gave him a happy ending for this expansion as well.

Overall, Lost Judgment has been such a fun game to play and I really enjoyed exploring/skating around the new backdrop of Ijincho to solve all the cases.  Very much looking forward to the next Yagami installment when it is released.",1703115811,1703116323,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been a fan of RGG's work ever since I played Yakuza 0 back in 2021, which prompted me to chew through the remainder of the Yakuza series over the months thereafter. I had always heard about the Judgment games, being as much of a fan as I am, but I hadn't been able to get at them for a while, being a PC-only gamer. Having them come to Steam some time ago was really exciting, and I picked them up immediately. Both of these games are worthwhile for any Yakuza fan, and I'd really recommend them to just about anyone. They do the beat 'em up style combat better than most of the entries in the Yakuza franchise and with the series being so new, there isn't a lot of games to chew through, making the barrier of entry much lower. This is the second game of the series, and is seriously worth every penny. The story is immaculate, the combat is some of the best I've experienced in a game (aside from my precious Sekiro), and there is just so much to do in this game, as well as all the Yakuza games. I first beat this game some time ago. But recently I decided to take it upon myself to get this game to 100% completion, both for in-game and for Steam. This was the first time I had ever done this for a Yakuza game (aside from Gaiden, which was fairly easy, and I did most of Yakuza 7's trophies; but I had never done a 100% of the in-game completion list before). Safe to say, this is probably the last time I will ever do that. It took me almost 100 hours to get the job done. Going through the main story again, through the entirety of the school stories, the side cases, some of the gauntlets, and all of the different minigames as well as the challenges set forth in the TownGo completion list. All of it. I did all of it. Was it worth it? Yeah, kinda. But I will never do that again. The sheer agony of having to do the school stories (I'm looking at you, biker gang) for twelve hours back-to-back was a pain I never thought I'd experience. Having to learn koi-koi, mahjong, and all the arcade games I suck at was absolute miserable (except koi-koi, that was really fun). This game truly is a gem, alongside all the rest of RGG's games. Please, play this game's predecessor first then come back to this one, even if you've never played Yakuza. It really is that good. But, I will warn you now: only dare to 100% a Yakuza game if you have days upon days of disposable time on your hands. Only dare to do it if you are prepared to do all the worst challenges and minigames in these games because, I promise you, you will have to do them. It is a challenge not for the greatest of gamers, but for the most dedicated of them. That is my warning to you.
9/10. One of RGG's best works, and I really hope they can settle their legal issues with the IP and make a third someday.",1702875020,1702875020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay wise it's mostly upgraded compared to Judgment, a lot less following random people around which I'm pretty happy about. The parkour and stealth mechanics feel a bit forced but I don't mind it that much since it's not too frequent. I won't comment too much on the combat system because I'm pretty bad at it but I think it's good enough.

The story is also intriguing. I think it dragged a little bit here and there, and some arguments between characters feel like they are repeating themselves way too much. If I'm being honest I think the previous game had a better story arc. However, I think the villains / antagonists in this one are very well established, probably the best in the entire series imo.

The story was interesting. It certainly was the main reason to keep playing, even if it were just the first half (after which I thought the game was over but it just kept going forever). 
Another good thing is that something about the environment, the atmosphere or whatever it was had some sort of appeal, which had me launch the game time after time despite the many times I got annoyed. 

Now, one of the main reasons I didn't like the game: The constant combat encounters. You know in Pokemon, how, when you walk through bushes, there is a good chance you encounter a pokemon? 
Often you don't want to fight, but it just keeps happening. Luckily, you can avoid these bushes and walk out. 

Well. Here it is kinda like that except you can't leave these bushes. There is encounter after encounter after encounter. You wanna go to building X? Oh, here is a random group of thugs. What, you dealt with them? Well here you go, a bunch of aggressive high schoolers. Done? Well there ya go, the next group is coming your way. 

It really was a choir for me. I just wanted to see the story and move through the main missions, but these constant fights forced me to use the taxi to go everywhere. Which is quite expensive, and still had you move to locations. 

Another really bothersome thing was the lack of a challenge. The game held your hand all the way til the very end. Combat was so simple, on the highest difficulty I couldn't be bothered trying to understand it remotely. You have different buttons, combos, stances... well I don't know what the stances were for, what they did, how to get them. I just mashed buttons and I won everything easily. There are many ways to grow stronger... well. I left that all aside. Button mashing and done. 

It wasn't just combat. You are a detective. Except you, as a player, do none of that. There is no thinking involved. Trying to find evidence just meant clicking on stuff in a room. A stealth mission was literally: Walk to a square, get a pop up with the button to press, press it, wait, and then walk to the next square. It felt insulting. 

The main reason why I wouldn't recommend the game: So the button mashing thing in combat was something I did in the first four hours or so. At that point, I finally encountered an opponent where I'd have to try a little. I died. And then I died again. So, I was like... okay. Not bad, I may have to try to understand the game a little now. And then came the pop up 'do you want to change the difficulty to normal'? 

Every time I'd die, the game would ask me that. I got annoyed so much that I just accepted in hopes it'd stop, but no. It did not. It'd then ask to change to simple and during simple it still asks that....",1702319537,1702319537,False,1,4,0.397489547729492188,0,True,False,False

[B]Lost Judgment[/B]
Played the game on my PS5 when it originally released, so I was looking forward to playing it again on my PC. In addition, it was a great way for me to finally try out the Kaito Files DLC.  The overall gameplay of this game was superb, with incredible combat that's probably the best in the entire series. It has an amazing story, great characters and story themes, as well as amazing battle music. Throughout this game, I was always on the edge of my seat.

[B]Kaito Files[/B]
The Kaito DLC is a short but sweet ride focusing on our side character Kaito, who has been with us since the first game. His fighting style is impressive, and he's an incredible force to be reckoned with. It was great to learn more about Kaito and his past through the story. It has one of the best endings in the franchise. Overall, it was definitely worth picking up with the PC port.

I definitely recommend people to pick up this PC port since it's well made. This game is definitely worth checking out, but you'd probably enjoy it even more if you played the first game in the series, AKA Judgment, which is on Steam as well.",1701052751,1701052751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It at least makes since to be in this game playing as a Detective, you kinda have to do shit like that and be in the shadows, at least it's not like GTA or Assassins Creed where it would just be more simpler to just kill someone, Judgment and Lost Judgment have reasons to include them in the game, Not to mention the chases can actually be fun. The fighting, the side quest, a buncha minigames to play, the only real downside i have with this game and Judgment, is that there is no Karaoke minigame.

[h3] The Combat [/h3]

Lost Judgement's combat is godly. They improved many things, like the combat, from the Judgement series. Yagami has 4 styles now, and they are the: Tiger, Crane (These 2 are in the original judgement), and the new Snake, and Boxer Style. Tiger style is still an extremely good style against a foe; however, they nerfed flux fissure obviously. Crane style got an extremely helpful buff from Judgement since every style has their own ""skill chart"", making the once rather universal crane (Most of the skills are universal skills), to a better crane with actual style specific moves. Crane also had received the holy power to juggle enemies by countering, and getting a very BIG speed boost (This speed boost is needed for combos) if you perfect dodge. The Newest Style, Snake Style, is a defensive style focusing on grabbing, disarming, and agony. The other new style is Boxer, and Boxer is obtained by uhh the Boxing Minigame in Lost Judgement. I do not use boxer that much; however, its an actual balanced style. These styles symbolically go along with Chinese Shao-Lin Kung fu, Crane, Tiger, Snake, Leopard (probably boxing), and Dragon (Kiryu). Now for the actual combat, Yagami has the ability to do a [b] Tekken [/b] on enemies and [b] Juggle [/b] them. Juggling is VERY easy in Lost Judgement, and because of that the RGG devs have added a damage resistance mechanic the longer you juggle them making you do less damage. The particle effects are very exaggerated; however, it looks so look good. Overall, Lost Judgement's Combat is an absolute masterpiece

[h3] The Prologue (Spoiler-Free, until the last paragraph) [/h3]

My personal opinion on Lost Judgement's Story is that it is less good compared to Judgement, but then again Lost Judgement has a giant web. The game starts off with a standard scam case that Yagami, and his partner, Kaito, are working on. The prologue just introduces you to mechanics that are like ditched right afterwards. Yagami tails a man named Kosuke, who is the person who is scamming your cilent, and this Tailing mission is like the only tailing mission in the main story. During the tailing of Kosuke, Yagami gets caught up in trouble by some gangster, and has to fight them in which Yagami wins but loses sight of Kosuke. Yagami does eventually find Kosuke, and tails him into a convenience store where you take your first and only photo ops mission. Afterwards, Kosuke goes into a building with many guards, so Yagami has to do parkour in order to get in the building without being detected. After Yagami gets into the building, he must sneak around avoiding guards, introducing the stealth mechanic to some main story missions. Eventually Yagami reaches the top floor where Kosuke is located, and turns out he was gambling away the Cilent's money. Yagami waits for Kosuke to leave to have a chat with him, which quickly turns into an altercation with Kosuke using Mine's moveset from Yakuza 3... Yagami beats Kosuke up, and Kosuke runs away introducing the chasing mechanic. Eventually Yagami catches Kosuke, and they go meet the boss of Kosuke where they don't have a civil discussion. Once Yagami beats up the crooks, and finishes the scam case the actual story of this game picks up. 

Yagami is soon brought back to the dangerous cases, and he is embroiled with a case with so many strands that it had created a web. [spoiler] Kuwana, a former teacher turned handyman, [/spoiler] had created this convoluted spider's web, and his story is one of vengeance against [spoiler] the Japanese Justice System [/spoiler] since they had [spoiler] let bullies walk free after they pushed student's to suicide [/spoiler]. Yagami, and [spoiler] Kuwana [/spoiler] are basically like mirrors of each other, one of them seeks justice through the means of the justice system; whilst, the other seeks their own justice through murder. They both rival each other's power with their own techniques. The spider of the web, [spoiler] Kuwana [/spoiler], had entrapped many former [spoiler] bullies [/spoiler] to helping him commit murder as a twisted view of revenge... Lost Judgement has one of the best stories in the Yakuza series; however, I still prefer the mysteries, red herrings, and the gruesome case of the Mole in Judgement.

Lost Judgement is seriously one of the best games that RGG had made, and I cant wait to see more of the Dragon Engine combat in Like A Dragon: Gaiden. The story is very good; however, I still do prefer Judgement's story over it since its more life threatening to Yagami though Lost Judgement's story is still really good compared to all the other RGG Games.",1699242392,1699242392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Combat feels good and gets more fluent as you unlock moves. Couple more styles this time around, but I just stuck with crane and tiger. 
-Interesting story, but not quite as good as Judgement. At times somewhat predictable.
-Again alot of side content. Thankfully side cases aren't locked behind community level this time.
-No more mortal wound system. Gun users are still there, but atleast they can't cheap shot your max hp down.
-Looks great.

Cons
-""Real detectives use a gamepad"" they say, I think ""real devs make DS4 work wireless"". Being stuck with dualshock 4 wired with it's microusb connection is pain cause it can disconnects so easily. Other games can handle it wirelessly, why can't this?
-Game looks great, except for the conversations where busts of characters are shown. I guess they opted for this kind of conversations to save time on directing, but the quality of the models is just really really bad.
-Chase sequences are still a snore, luckily there seems to be little less of them this time around.
-School stories clubs are stuck behind other clubs' events. There might be some interesting minigames, but I really got enough of dancing already in Yakuza 5.",1699011548,1699011548,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Story? Dark. Darker than the first? Personal opinion. This game though shows corpses (game literally opens with a decomposing one) a lot, constant references to bullying and suicide. So if any of these topics trigger you, be warned. But the story is good. Like other titles it starts rather slow but speeds up about halfway (around chapter 7) The antagonist I think is the best the series got to offer so far. Final battle - epic, and with that music..
The music is too one the top in the series. Like no joke - in a series well known for it's bangers.
My complaints with the first game was the attrocious tailing and the Keihin Gang being a pain in the ass. Lost Judgment fixes those issues. The tailing is now more engaging, maybe it's not the best but it definetely is a step up from previous title. Keihin Gang is now a major part for a School Stories - a completly optional giant side quest that could be a standalone game in all fairness. It involves several minigames(they might get grindy a bit but nothing serious) and could get a good chunk of your playtime. 
The combat and gameplay is perfected in this game. We got 2 new styles - Snake and Boxer(i believe Boxer was a part of DLC earlier but we got it for free in PC version) Each of the four is reliable and you can mix them up for nice combos. 
The graphics is still the good old Dragon Engine. Yeah, it's been 7 years since Yakuza 6 and it's debut. The game looks okay, but I think it's finally time to give up on it. 
I didn't noticed any major bugs and the game is fairly stable, it ran well too on my not-so-great PC.
Overall I place Lost Judgment in the same place as Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 0, being now my third contender to claim my personal TOP 1 in the series.

It's the absolute pinnacle of brawler combat, the story is unbelievably engaging, the side content is deep, varied, and almost always incredibly fun, and the total package the game offers is basically unparalleled by anything else the studio has ever made. It's good.

The combat is probably the biggest, brightest selling point - Yagami's three base styles mesh together extremely well, and you can find situations to maximize them all throughout the game. Tiger is as good as ever with the addition of charged moves, Crane is actually very useful now in its intended crowd setting, and Snake is maybe the most satisfying combat style RGG has ever put together. Even with Tiger and Crane being great, I had to force myself to use them from time to time and not just sit in Snake from the moment I unlocked it. The flow of it is just amazing, and you're given fantastic combat situations throughout, too - powerful, tricky bosses that make you feel accomplished for figuring out how to get around them, while you can simply smoke regular encounters on demand, and with mortal wounds gone (thank God), you don't have to worry about putting the game on hold to go restore your full health bar after getting randomly shot by some asshole on the street. Perfect!

The story...easily one of the best, of course, with a great deal of nuance and grey areas for the player to mull over as the story progresses. I'd say it's not quite as satisfying or viscerally gripping as Judgment's, but it's hard to live up to the strongest, most focused story RGG Studio's ever made, and even then, Lost Judgment does an admirable job in keeping me engaged. The returning characters develop, the new characters fascinate, and there are plenty of amazing twists and moments of absolute satisfaction that kept me locked in for hours and hours. The primary antagonist has a ton of layers, and the supplementary antagonists all spiral outwards from them in myriad ways that conveyed a strong, clear message about the story RGG Studio was telling here. Even if I personally find the antagonist a lot more reprehensible than others do, they were written astoundingly well, and the game hinges on that success.

I LOVE the side content this time around - most of it is centered on the School Stories, which basically functions as a second campaign meant to be played through alongside the main story. Amasawa is such a sweet girl, and the stories told through each of the clubs you explore tie pretty well into the game's core themes of the price of bullying and who gets to pass judgment on wrongdoers. Each club has its own minigame associated with it, and while most of these are fun and well-developed, a couple of them were significantly more frustrating and needed better balance. This is about the Robotics Club. It should have been deleted. There's no salvaging it. The rest of the clubs, though? Great. Skateboarding, love it. Boxing, AMAZING. Dancing that's mechanically similar to Haruka's idol minigame? Fantastic. Cooking the CPU in Virtua Fighter? Perfect.

Honestly, there's just SO MUCH to love about Lost Judgment, and its highs are so high that I can barely even remember the lows. I think the way Yagami is written can get a little one-note sometimes, especially in comparison to the antagonist, and as previously mentioned there are minigames necessary for School Stories progression that are absolute torture to get through. Stealth missions suck ass, the parkour segments are interesting but ultimately tedious, tailing is still horrendous even though it was downplayed significantly, and, frustratingly, the female characters get pigeonholed into passive roles more than I'd like (as usual). Even with all that, though? Lost Judgment is one of the best games I've ever played. No qualifiers. Play it.",1697683429,1697683429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It also feels as though this series suffers from a lower budget and expectations.

Lost Judgment starts off with a strong story that quickly becomes predictable and boring, and loses its edge due to RGG's ever-present desire to keep everything tethered to the Yakuza story experience. The supporting cast that helps in Yagami's journey barely develop at all as characters and feel hollow and incomplete in the presence of the main character's bland and neutral existence, especially in the presence of Kaito.

So far I'm on Chapter 3, I've forgotten what I'm meant to be investigating, my life is skate boarding now... There's a rhythm game, a boxing game, a fighting game, darts... drunken brawls... this game has everything. 

As ever with RGG you will expect wonderful graphics, a great soundtrack, absolutely awesome choreography in the fight scenes (albeit OTT) and the writing! Good lord the writing in these games I've yet to find one release by this company that made me go ""Huh... really?"" or cause my interest to wane, and if you ever DO get fed up faffing about doing nothing you CAN draw yourself back in with the main story.

Also I'm not very good at ""Action Combat"" type games but it's accessible and forgiving enough so don't let that be a barrier for you. The story, side quests alone make up for that.

I loved it, I still cried and I would play the whole game again just to experience the characters and story again. Brilliant game. RGG are just brilliant.

Now, let's talk about our main man, Yagami. This dude's got more personality switches than a light bulb factory. Sometimes he's channeling Batman, all dark and broody, and then, out of nowhere, he's as Zen as Buddha under the Bodhi tree. I mean, seriously, at times, it feels like as if he's on the verge of imparting profound wisdom to the adversaries he faces.

But hold on to your gaming chairs, 'cause the combat in this game is smoother than a gravure idol's bottom. It's like they took the combat from the last game and gave it a steroid injection.

(Okay, fine, they might have borrowed a page -or the whole map- from Yakuza: Like a Dragon, but hey, why reinvent the wheel, right?)

In summary, Lost Judgment is not just a game; it's an immersive journey that transcends the realm of pixels and screens.

Still, the game still really likes to switch to having you just look at things, follow targets, walk a dog, hide from enemies. Basically, things that retract from the amazing core gameplay and story. Yet, it does it to a MUCH lesser extent than the previous game in the series, so it's a minor issue. Much of the side stories and minigames are also moved to a separate linear minigame-plot, meaning that the side-content is more of a grind than a natural distraction. This story is interesting, but there is a lot of build-up that not many have the patience for, especially if there is a certain mini-game you don't like.

What this game has on it's predecessor is a solid amount of implementation that increase the choice to focus on gaining all the extra stuff through doing all the side quest and school stories but what it lacks is the lack of motivation to do it because of how freaking strong you are.

The Extract recipe is more numerous and they are god damn OP!
The early fights are extremely easy to the point that if you grind your SP skill then grind SP you'll unlock with ease all (95%) of your skills. 

Honestly some chapters are cut scene heavy and that's perfect but it makes the action part a bit easy and underwhelming. The Final chapter doesn't disappoint in that regard. It's some 100 vs 4 type deal and it's super fun, action pact, and the ending, while extremely predictable by then end of chapter 6, is very solid. The MQS is way too fast versus the grinding around it. You can finish the game with 30h at most with all the skill grinded, almost no side quest done and only the important stuff.

While I really liked Judgement, Lost Judgement blows it out of the water in nearly every way. The graphics and presentation are improved, the combat is the best it has ever been in the series, the side content is engrossing and could qualify as a standalone game, the soundtrack is chill-inducing, the story is bold and thought-provoking, and the characters are iconic. Lost Judgment is up there with the best in the series and gives me a lot of hope for the future of the franchise. 

COMBAT

Lost Judgement‚Äôs combat is better paced and more liberating than Judgement‚Äôs. Yagami has three combat styles now, Tiger, Crane, and Snake. Unlike Judgement, these styles don‚Äôt overshadow each other. They all have a near-equal amount of utility. Switching between them is near instantaneous, encouraging constant style switching to meld style-specific buffs together. With all three of these buffs activated, Yagami is fast, strong, and unable to be knocked down, making him incredibly satisfying to play as. The EX actions in this game are better than ever. They are brutal, mesmerizing, hilarious, and sometimes all three. Overall, the combat in Lost Judgement is a massive improvement over its predecessor and it's some of the best I‚Äôve seen from the series.

SCHOOL STORIES

The side content in Lost Judgement is among the best I‚Äôve seen from an RGG game. Most of the side content can be found in the school stories where Yagami works as a school counselor to solve a string of crimes caused by students in order to find the mastermind behind it all. Nearly all of the school stories are fun and rewarding. The dance club was a hilarious rhythm game where Yagami did a bunch of crazy dance moves to catchy music. The robotics club was the most complicated and frustrating to me but that made it the most satisfying to complete. The boxing gym has a very fleshed-out boxing minigame which has a decent amount of depth and challenge to it. The motorcycle gang was my favorite for being the most funny, endearing, yet intense out of all of the school stories. The skateboarding minigame was very satisfying and addicting to play. Skateboarding is one of the most important additions to this game, and possibly to the series because it is a faster and more fun way of exploration throughout Yokohama. The rest of the school stories are a lot less remarkable. However, they all are worth playing because the final sequence that reveals the person behind it all is a great experience. What‚Äôs better is that everyone from all of the school stories come together and help you close the case. Most of the school stories have great character work attached to them and seeing their arcs climax in the finale is incredibly satisfying. Despite their flaws, the school stories might just be the best side content RGG has ever made and it gives me hope they can do even better in the future. 

SIDE CASES

Because of how much time the school stories take up, there aren‚Äôt nearly as many side cases as there were in Judgement, nor were they as long, but I see that as a good thing. The game also vastly improved its tailing sequences by making them less linear. I am going to name some of my favorite side cases. Dueling Dojos, The Body Model Walks At Night, and My First Errand were hilarious and sit alongside the best side content in the series. At this point, it is tradition for me to do all of the side cases (or substories) in every RGG game so I can face Amon. I‚Äôm normally pretty satisfied by the Amon fights in the series, but despite Lost Judgement's amazing combat, its Amon fight rubbed me the wrong way.

SOUNDTRACK

I think the most iconic part of Lost Judgment is its soundtrack. I initially bought Judgement and Lost Judgement because of Lost Judgement's music alone. I‚Äôm going to list my favorite tracks, starting with Lost In The Rain, the music that plays on the title screen, which is one of my favorite title screens because of its dour mood being flushed away by an optimistic white kitten. Some other great tracks are Vorarephilia, Fog, K.O.G., ÊÅ©Âøµ, Viper, Final Destination, GIRLS, and the two songs that deserve credit for putting Lost Judgement on the map, Dig In Your Heels and Unwavering Belief. Dig In Your Heels is perfect workout music that sounds like the world is at stake, despite the setting it‚Äôs played in. While Dig In Your Heels came out of nowhere, Unwavering Belief perfectly portrays the rising tension up to the beginning of the final fight and it feels as though the song represents a clashing of ideals. 

STORY

Finally, we can talk about this game‚Äôs story. I‚Äôm just going to talk about my favorite parts of the story instead of summarizing the whole thing. In comparison with Judgement, Lost Judgement‚Äôs detective story feels like I can actually follow along and make theories instead of just waiting for a twist that explains everything. It feels like a natural progression of RGG‚Äôs story structure. I really appreciate how this game went out of its way to criticize Japanese law through the lens of bullying. I‚Äôve never seen another game jab at its government‚Äôs weaknesses while treating it with respect at the same time. That brings me to my favorite part of Lost Judgement‚Äôs story, the dynamic between Yagami and Kuwana. I can‚Äôt think of another piece of media whose protagonist and antagonist were equally wrong and right. Kuwana‚Äôs pessimistic outlook on justice proclaims that since the justice system is broken, he has to punish those who are deserving, no matter the damage it causes to innocent bystanders. As a lawyer, Yagami‚Äôs optimistic view of the law makes him believe no form of self-served justice should take precedence over the law, especially if it affects innocent people. He can only hope that the law can get better if enough trust and care are put into it. RGG took a big risk in making Yagami‚Äôs character seem rationally flawed because of his morals, but I think it pays off beautifully. No one has the right answer here and I love that. In the end, it‚Äôs about actions, not just ideals, and Kuwana did some horrible things to achieve his version of justice. Yagami just wants the world to be propelled by the truth, which is the fairest thing someone in his position can do. The only loose end is how the law will enact justice based on the truth, still giving strength to Kuwana‚Äôs argument against Japan‚Äôs imbalanced justice system. I find it pretty bold that Kuwana is let go in the end. Sure, there is no proof to stick him to his crimes, but it also leaves a major crack in Yagami‚Äôs optimism for the justice system. If a guilty man can never be punished for his crimes in a legal manner, then would self-imposed justice be the next best thing? Kuwana is easily the best antagonist in the Yakuza series. As an antagonist, he asks more out of the protagonist and the player than any other villain has and it‚Äôs difficult not to root for him despite his actions. I really appreciate Lost Judgement‚Äôs story. The characters were easy to love or hate, the discussions about bullying and the justice system were fascinating, and it felt like a real detective story by breaking away from the usual Yakuza story structure. It doesn‚Äôt have nearly as much emotional weight as Judgement had, but it traded that for being a lot more thought-provoking to the point of being divisive, which only the best stories can accomplish.

CONCLUSION

Lost Judgement is a fantastic sequel to its predecessor. The combat is at its peak in the series, the side content is the most fleshed out it has ever been, the soundtrack is more iconic than the game itself, and its incredibly unique story boasts some of the best characters and themes in the series. This is one of the few games I will definitely come back to. I would love to see Yagami in a future release, but I would also find it fitting for this to be his last hurrah.",1694397459,1694397459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have your run-of-the-mill Like a Dragon character-driven criminal conspiracy in which nothing is as it seems. I loved the courtroom sequences in the first Judgment as they really ground a story which (in all RGG games) can get a bit out of hand. As expected, some great story twists and a great cast and even greater 'villain'. 

Sub Stories in this game are a blast and the basically second game they call School Stories is a bit to get through but if you can commit they're great.

Combat has been drastically improved and makes for what I believe to be the best combat in the whole series. Each of the 4 styles have something unique and useful so they don't overshadow one another. Tiger has fantastic offensive 1-on-1 capabilities. Crane makes for a fantastic crowd control method. Snake creates great openings to counterattack (also the parry is straight OP). And Boxer has the easiest juggle initiator, also with some great counterattack potential. Overall, combat just feels so much smoother than its predecessor, quicker style changes being the  stand out change.

If anything were to be improved it would be the stealth and parkour sections. Difficult to control and overall unnecessary. Still a fantastic game. Really feels like RGG have nailed the use of the Dragon Engine. 9/10",1672975307,1694350383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game's Amon fight was more funny than he was difficult. He is not the easiest Amon fight, that honor goes to Ishin, but I did beat him in the Gauntlet on my first try. Also, lately, I've been playing on hard mode.

Speaking of, I think the gauntlet in this game is my favorite it's ever been throughout the series and I don't say that lightly. It was adequately challenging and fun without leaving me thinking ""oh please, you shouldn't have"" at the prospect of the ""challenge"" it presented. For example, in Yakuza 4, one ""challenge"" was to beat someone without hitting them with Tanimura, so you needed to put your back to a wall, parry them into the wall so they take damage and spend the next 5 minutes repeating that bored bored bored bored bored until you win. This was as stupid and as boring as it sounds. Also, the difficulty in the gauntlet seems to be averaged for ""normal"" difficulty, so playing on hard mode made the gauntlet easier to complete even with the constraints.

As for the combat, massive improvements from Judgement. In Judgement, Crane was kinda there. All the upgrades were for Tiger and Tiger did tons of damage and did enough of a job to dominate the entire game. Amon in Judgement was supposed to remind me that Crane exists with his gimmick but I beat him without it anyway because Crane is... just kinda there. 
So what does Lost Judgement do? It adds a third combat style and boy howdy how did they do it, I don't know but now we got an amazing balance where each fighting style specializes in something different. It reminds me of Yakuza 0 and it is great all for it. Also, the SP system, which is perhaps the best it has ever been, rewards you for varying your fighting style. 
Note: it's a shame that the fourth fighting style does NOT have any unique SP awards so I ended up disabling it until late game (which is also fitting as upgrading it requires you do a side-quest thing). Sure, it was a DLC thing (that comes with the base purchase of this game, I don't own the Kaito Files DLC but I still had it) but come on! Put some SP awards for it!

Late game, I ran around fighting random dudes on the street for around 3,000 SP per fight (around 1,400 from SP gained via the reward system and 1,600 SP for winning the fight. It is incredibly easy and not very grindy to get all skills before you beat the game. Though, if you taxi all over town instead of running around town, then you're probably not the target audience for this game, and also you will feel the grind to get all the skills.

Sure, each style has its unique attacks, finishers, tiger drops, heat actions, and even dodging, but in my opinion, one of the biggest accomplishments is the ""secret"" of each style. Dodging with Crane increases movement speed while parrying with Snake prevents you from being knocked down (from attacks) and landing a charged finisher (has to be charged despite the game not specifying, I checked) with Tiger increases your damage. All these effects are temporary and until you get an upgrade for each style, they go away if you style switch. When you unlocked these skills to keep the style switch, not only do you get to keep it, but activating the ""secret"" on another style resets the timer for the secret(s) from the previous style(s) so if you play well, you can be a faster-attacking, stronger-hitting and un-knock-down-able Yagami that tears through the enemies. 
Boxing style has this too where if you land a counter hit (like Tiger drop, which I think is a mistake because you may as well Tiger drop late game), the secret ability is your EX gain is increased (more counters = even faster charging). 

Even with all this, Tiger is still obscenely strong, so the strongest thing you can do is get crane and snake secrets, swap to tiger, EX Boost and just go ham. My personal favorite is two squares into fully charged triangle attacks. Also, they got rid of the ""strong hits break max HP"" gimmick from Judgement, that good too. If I have a complaint, it would be why do we swap between the styles with one button instead of using the full D-Pad like in Yakuza 0? Shortcut? I'm aware but I'd delete the thing while delegating the healing to the pause menu, like it has always been and everyone continues to do, and just let us enjoy Y0's style swapping. Someone made a mod for that please and thank you.

While the combat is the center, take a look aside for the side stuff... which I had finished the lion's share of all the side stuff by chapter 4. Every possible thing I could do at that point, I did until it was completed or locked. This is how I enjoy these games and make sure I fight Amon. Arriving to the start of the final chapter, I only had one last side quest to do and Amon. Overall, the humor I like is when funny things happen to characters and they play along. Something that I really do not like it is when these characters, that we've learned about and grown to like, suddenly start acting as if there's a gas leak in the room. Thankfully, the instance where this does happen is fairly brief and works as a contrast to how heavy the plot gets when you first access this side quest, so I'll let it slide.

With characters mentioned, Yagami is better fleshed out compared to how he was in Judgement. Then again, I used to be a teacher so putting him in that context and not screwing up went a long way to making me like him. Still... I'm quite mehhhhhhh on him but what I did early on was mod Mine (read: Mi-Ne, not ""mine"") from Yakuza 3 via Nexus to replace Yagami and that somehow made me enjoy the game quite a lot more. The only flaw with the mod occurs in Chapter 7 but not in any meaningful way. Also, no ""in school shoes"" texture of sorts, so invisible feet when in school... which is funny but not impactful.
Trying to avoid any spoilers (except for Amon), I'll just say that the other characters also have their time in the spotlight adequately that I overall enjoyed the story. Watching them play rock paper scissors while the credits rolled was amusing.

Finally, the extract system... It's there and I seldom remember its existence. I imagine it would've made any particular combat section a cake walk, based on the effects I read; like ""get the ability to shoot energy balls"" or ""get a thunder sword that you can use to smite your foes"" or whatever; and also the ""DLC"" that automatically comes with the game gives you a sample to use (a free one for most of them) but still... I never really used them. Even in the gauntlets, I only used one where it is *required* to win. 

Overall, amazing entry by RGG that I recommend. I sure hope they don't only make turn-based combat games now and I also hope they never use the Unreal Engine like Ishin. Cheers.",1694131692,1694131692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Better more fluid and faster combat compared to most game made by RGG studios, but the game suffers from too much of a focus on quantity instead of quality, with a story that has terrible pacing and an unsatisfying ending.

Upgrading skills:

1. Too big and drawn out, forcing you to grind a lot to become stronger and to unlock quality of life features.

Combat problems:

1. Getting stunned and knocked to the ground takes the player to gain control.
2. Grabbing an enemy while they're attacking makes it so your grab goes through them. A problem that happened in Yakuza 3 and Yakuza 4.
3. Hitboxes of enemies sometimes would hit you from far away, even hitting you when you're behind them.
4. Badly balanced fighting styles, with Crane being very overpowered, Tiger being pretty good, Snake being alright and Boxing being pretty bad.
5. They literally locked a fighting style (Boxing) behind a DLC.

Characters:

1. Yagami felt more of a stereotypical detective thant an actual character with depth to him like in Judgment.
2. Most of the characters too me felt too uninteresting and bland.
3. They ramble on for too long before finally mentioning information relevant to the story. They also love to bring back past events from the same game or from Judgment multiple times.

Story:

1. Too much expository dialogue.
2. Pacing was too slow, a lot of the interesting parts of the story where just spoon fed to you via dialogue making the whole waiting unrewarding.
3. The main mystery of the story was too obvious.
4. A lot of the reveals revolve around someone giving you paragraphs of them admitting to the truth, while not showing you what happened through the use of cutscenes or flashbacks.
5. Plot and conflict drags on for too long.
6. Constantly being forced to go from point A to point B to progress the story and substories. A lot of the time it just revolves around talking to someone in person instead of through the phone, just to be forced to travel to another location again.

Sub stories:

1. Too serious and it has less of that iconic silly humor.

Mechanics from Judgment:

1. They brought back those unfun and extremely tedious mechanics, like lockpicking, chase, trailing missions, finding clues in first person (Revolves around moving your camera around until you spot something), 
parkour (Where it sends you back to the beginning EVERY time you fall, and it's very difficult to not accidentally fall off) 
and sneaking where the AI is either too stupid and slow, or they can spot you while having their backs to you.

Robotics:

1. It's just a rat race to on who can connect and place their blocks on the opponent's territory first.
2. Being forced to grind to obtain materials that can only be obtained by specific levels from the robotics minigame.
3. A lot of unskippable cutscenes. Building ONE part? unskippable cutscene. Starting the same level for the 10th+ time to obtain materials? unskippable cutscene.
4. It mostly revolves around building your way as fast as you can into the opponent's territory, which get stale after doing the same thing more than 20 times.
5. Near the end you start running out of funds to upgrade since it only gives you 30k yen every 5 games, which forces you to play the same levesl over and over just so you can finally upgrade after also grinding to obtain the materials.
6. In the final fight, the game forces you to use a robot that is inferior to the ones you can build at that point of the game.
7. Whenever you're tackled by a fortress robot you literally can't do anything until it stops pushing you.

Dancing:

1. More difficult thant Haruka's dance mini game in Yakuza 5, but has less depth and less fun overall.

Boxing:

1. Locks moves from a DLC fighting style behind it's tedious progress system.
2. Annoying stamina system that constantly slows down the fights or makes it very difficult to win unless you grind the same opponents over and over.

Mini-games:

1. Even though there's a lot of minigames, most of them barely have any substance, it's more about quantity instead of quality.

School stories mini-games:

1. To unlock more you have to play the horrible ones like Robotics and Boxing.
2. The game constantly interrupts your progress by forcing you go from point A to point B and back to talk to some random person.
3. You also get interrupted because of the game forcing you to level up a specific stat from the ""Yagami's leadership"" stat pool which also forces you to play minigames you don't care about to be able to progress the ones you want.
4. 

Dating:

1. The dating aspect of the game has improved a little bit, but it's still very bland and it's now locked behind a pay wall (DLC), which is pretty greedy in my opinion since it was free in other games like Judgment and Like a Dragon.",1693865843,1693865843,False,0,0,0.449567735195159912,0,True,False,False

Kaito Files is pretty good too, but getting it for $30 is a bit of a stretch. It's about 8 hours long if you plan on doing everything. Even shorter if you only do main story. Especially since there are no substories here.

Other than having a story that is slightly better paced, there is nothing JE does that LJ doesn't do a 100x better.

The biggest improvement, by far, is the combat system. After years of playing through the Yakuza series, I can finally say there is a Yakuza game whose combat system has surpassed Yakuza 0's. So much more fluid, so many options, no more mortal blows, the returning styles got major tweaks and the new styles are fantastic in their own rights, and being able to mix them up and juggle enemies like it was Tekken is exhilarating. From this point forward, every beat-em-up style Yakuza title should strive to reach this level. If you can't juggle enemies in newer titles, it's immediately inferior to this game.

The story is also fantastic, and while it's not quite as compelling as JE's story was, LJ more than makes up for it with who is probably the best antagonist in the entire series. Yakuza games have always had a tendency to adopt a very black and white moral view throughout their storyline, and this is the first time we've gotten such a morally gray character and dilemma in the series, I loved it. All the new characters and antagonists introduced are so memorable.

Technical aspects are also vastly improved. This is, without question, the best looking any game in the Yakuza series has ever been. The Dragon Engine has been perfected so that the prerendered cutscenes look worse than actual in-game cutscenes, and the lighting has also been improved drastically (especially from Y7's awful lighting). The soundtrack is great, and the new QOL improvements are welcome. I can't believe it took this long to be able to fast travel from anywhere.

If I had to point out some flaws in the game though, it would definitely be the school subplot with the MRC, because some of the minigames are definitely better than others. Boxing, robot club, dancing, girl's bar, they were fun and interesting. The others, not so much, and some of them, especially the biker race, just got really repetitive and frustrating. The substories were also pretty lacking for the most part although there were still some wacky and hilarious ones. However, I'm really glad they removed the text messages about the Neo Keihin Gang, that was one of the worst parts of the original JE because it was so annoying. 

The flaws overall are minor however, and this is easily one of the best games that RGG has ever put out, and I genuinely hope a third game is in the works somewhere down the line. Powerful story, memorable and interesting characters, a fantastic antagonist that acts as a dark mirror to the protagonist, an extremely fluid combat system that makes me want to engage in random battles instead of running away, and some great minigames, this game has almost everything I could ever want in an RGG title.",1693671224,1693671224,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They improved the game's combat by reworking the Crane style and refining the juggling system from the first Judgment game and in addition with the two new styles: Snake and Boxer. Boxer is more of an optional style since it's part of the School Stories Expansion DLC and it's toggleable in the options. Nevertheless, it's still a pretty good style for initiating juggle combos.

Compared to Judgment the game is way larger, it has a new city region Ijincho, a separate side story named ""School Stories"" which consists 10 different clubs with each having their own unique story. The lowlights for School Stories are Biker Gang and Photography Club. Completing Photography Club forces you to be Stealth mode to get to the designated destination before taking a photo and it's not a one time occurrence. Biker Gang takes too much time to complete it and the camera placement in the minigame is such a weird choice. 
Speaking of minigames, there are plenty of them that you can do here and it's much easier to get cheat items while completing achievements.

The story overall is not as great as Judgment's but it's still decent compared to other Yakuza games' [spoiler] looking at you 2, 4 and 5 [/spoiler]. As mentioned previously, the stealth sections ruin the flow progressing through the story and you can still fail them pretty easily. The boss fights and long battles here are awesome with the game's improved combat. On top of that, dynamic intros and themes for selected fights are memorable and phenomenal.

First I am so happy to see the Dragon Engine finally deliver : the game is really beautiful and the fights finally both enjoyable and fair (Y3 to Kiwami system was enjoyable only but broken).
Activities are generally of good quality and I appreciate the gameplay additions to make the game more modern and less clunky (the parkour for instance...yes it feels dated compared to real action/adventure games but this is a step in the right direction).  

As always, you need like 2-4 hours to be drawn in the game and after that you cannot stop playing until the end. The story is a bit weak if you look at it coldly (as many Yakuza games to be fair), but they half succeeded to deliver their message with strong characters and emotionnal momentum. I cannot spoil but I would rate this part B, A being the best stories in the series. I cannot put the finger on the reason behind this feeling, maybe because Yagami looped over one event and used it every time in his discussions so that he locked the game instead of developping the numerous interesting characters and leads (the school for instance is abandoned quickly by the plot). To sum up, maybe Yagami and his single argument were too dominating in the plot (compared to other characters, story branches, etc.) and that is why the Kaito files DLC felt like a deliverance.

Aside from that, the game has a huge content, to the point that in almost 40 hours I have never ecountered some. This is certainly here of the best points : we cannot feel bored in this game and the step in modernity for all these old minigames feels good even if the side quests by themselves are not really memorable.

Now I have a huge gripe with this port and I'm tormented to leave a negative review for this alone : the DLC button in the smartophone makes you leave the game (as intended) and then, when you come back to it, the game is FROZEN. So if you did not save, you can lose a lot of playtime. This is even more frustrating when you have already purchased the DLC, so the button is absolutely useless. 

Considering the content for the price, the usual free additions and the quality, I will keep my positive review but I hoped that this matter would be fixed.

========

KAITO FILES DLC

My man, this has a bit of drama within but the story was satisfying as hell. It reminded me a bit of Y1 strings+grittiness mixed with the nostalgic/emotionnal vibe of Y3. Again, if I examine it coldly, there are many flaws in the plot but the stream of emotions and the main line are so strong that they are forgotten. In a way, this DLC had the (genuine) humanity lacking in main game which felt colder (despite the forced scenes, because the game was too centered around Yagami and his view). 

This is unfortunately not something that memorable because this is a DLC and not a full game but this was a welcomed addition. Mikiko was also one of the first female characters (if not the only one) that feel (and look) like a belivable mature woman and not the ""cute/pure/cheesy"" girl to protect. I'm not especially feminist but a real woman is a lot more charming (hell she is) and interesting. Plus 30-40 women in the other games acting like 18 princess from movies was a bit frustrating.",1691918297,1691918601,True,1,0,0.502304136753082275,0,True,False,False

The previous one and this game were able to make me lose interest in the game and the story. 
I also feel like the story wasn't completely finished. 

It also felt like the motive for truth was focused on one person, while I think that with the topic bullying and murder, more people are affected than was shown in the game (but maybe than it would have been too much... I don't know).

The game had deff an improvement in comparison to Judgement, but the same repetitive fight sequences were implamented. Which made it repetitive and boring for me.
I felt myself rushing towards the ending.

And honestly I don't feel satisfied, but I think the game simply isn't for me.
Even though there were multiple funny sidequests, in the end I dind't feel for the characters and the story.

Overall I wanna say the combat is great, definitely a step up from the previous title, however a little bit bummed out that we had to wait till the end of the game to get some real combat in. The reason I am giving this game a negative review it is just because of the fuckin story. I am so glad they toned down the pursuits and everything else in this entry vs the first but man this story sucks.

Yagami is guilt ridden over the fact that he got that innocent dude free'd from that murder charge which ultimately resulted in that dude's GF dying. He feels as if he had somehow either let that innocent dude rot in prison or perhaps if he had found the real culprit he would be a better person. This ties directly into the story which is where I get really annoyed. Sawa this sawa that. She died and apparently if anyone farted in her general direction they had a hand in killing her and are therefore worse than a guy who kills for fun. Yagami's purpose in life at least in this game is to make sure relatively innocent people serve time and get punished for honestly completely justifiable actions. Remember kids what is the difference between a man who kills 1 person in vengeance and one who kills a thousand for pleasure? Nothing apparently. 

On a much more minor point man these characters really don't know when to shut the fuck up. It seems like everything is in the bag and everything is gonna work and then nearly completely unprovoked they go confessing. I'm like dude you just had to keep your mouth shut for literally less than 3 more seconds and you'd have won. Why are you now giving an essay?

Also I fucking hate the cutscenes in this game. Specifically when it is recapping. It goes something like this.
Yagami: I believe this happened!
Others: What is your proof?
Yagami: Here is my proof!
Others: I believe you!
Yagami: I believe me too!
Others: We both believe you then!
Yagami: So to recap we both believe in the same thing!
Others: We both believe in the same thing!
Cutscene that restates that entire scene but more cinematic
Another series of dialogues
Cutscene to restate that
Then EnD oF cHaPtEr ReCaP!

Jesus fuck you don't have to baby feed me all the details.

Listen we all know you're gonna play this fucking game. The fact is you probably already played Judgement, Yakuza 0-6, and Like a dragon. You're already gonna buy this game. Just if I had to rank this it'd be dead last or close to it in the history of this series.

The stories are interesting and varied and the side missions are as goofy as ever. Seeing Yagami and the gang take on more serious and constantly escalating situations is thrilling in a way the other yakuza games arent especially considering your playing on the side of the law and not against it.

Theres so much to do as well, the side missions in the school are plentiful to a point where its almost a problem (I spent a whole two to three hours doing nothing but side quest specifically at the school (that wasnt even ten percent of what the game offers regarding side missions) This brings up one of my major issues with the game in which a whole fighting style is locked behind a few hours worth of side missions which the side missions themselves arent available till you get a hour or two into the game. This means you have to wait after a hour or two to get to the side missions to even get to start to unlock all the combat this game has to offer. It seems rather unnecessary and could've just had the ability to go to the gym to learn these techniques available from the start instead of winding it so tightly around side missions which some players might not even bother with at all to begin with.

Other then that the character of Yagami himself is a good blend between Ichibans sheer optimism/positivity and Kiryus sterness and and bluntness, the side characters are also something truly great (Kaito in particular is a goofy but loyal partner and brings his own charm and flair while still standing on his own as a great character)

All in all this game is a solid 9/10 from what ive played

The game is a bit step down from it's predecessor in terms of Music, Mobile UI flexibility, Combat and Street ambience.
Now when talk about Combat particularly there are new sets of extra Martial Arts but they feel sloppy and unresponsive at times. There is a possible input lag.
The game has an optimisation issues as well, there's a noticeable frame drops which occurs at 1440p resolutions and at 1080p too. While the first game didn't have any.

The story however is equally good. If coming from the first/legacy Judgement the story will hook you up this time too. If you're playing this one prior to the first game, then you should check the Legacy Judgement first.

ong best real time action combat among all yakuza and its spinoff titles. Tiger and Crane were very unique styles in the first game, but they somehow lacked effectiveness severely against bosses to the fact you kinda had to stick to Tiger (which was the intended way ig, still sucks). They completely overhauled combat with two more styles to the list, and Crane might be my favorite style now lmao, followed by Boxer, Tiger and Snake
Story Rating: I honestly loved the first Judgment's setting and suspense more than this one. Lost Judgment lacks a bit compared to the first for that. Can forgive it a bit tho thanks to the antagonist
Side content: Might be the best part about this game. First game had pretty well side cases, but the Keihin gang 'side story' was extremely lackluster (basically those colored gangs from yakuza 4). School Story is perhaps one of the most diverse bunch of side content rgg ever made. From dancing to skateboard races, robot tetris to biker gang and ofc the boxing club were all extremely enjoyable. Ig some of the 'club' stories ended too fast tbh but half of them took decent amount of time. Tho thanks to school stories ig, most side cases didn't feel that great

But getting into the bread and butter of this series: The story, compared to the previous Judgment installment, it doesn't hit the spot: Questionable choices (not going in depth because spoilers), some shaky conceptual/moral basis which i personally don't agree, which is higly subjetive i know, characters from the previous game being sideline and wasted, new characters that having 0 CHARISMA; and worst of all: My personal desire of wanting to punch Yagami's face out of his high horse, Ryu ga gotoku can be melodramatic and sometimes omega preachy, but this one is a bit too much, when it wants to preach some ideals about justice, when Japan is the last place i would think these things (take this statement anyway you want).

And my favorite part of this series, the soundtrack, sadly, it doesn't hit as hard, but it does have some bangers.

Not the gameplay, not the fighting or cinematics. The dubbing. I am glad they are working to dub their games again. It pains me to have to actually say this and to not recommend this game. I will be doing it to many others. 

But honestly when it comes to anime and JRPGs I am real sick of the same group of voice actors being in every product. The production company needs to stop being so damn lazy and finding more of a variety of talent. It ruins entire projects because of it as well. 

As well in line with this need. Try to search out some more diverse Asian ancestral talent. In this case Japanese Americans, Canadians or just plain ole Japanese people who know English. The film and tv industries have learned and accepted that their voice actors should match the ethnicity of the person they are portaying to avoid a variety of issues. How are all of these games still trying to pull it off.

The combat is seriously up there with Yakuza 5 and 0/Kiwami. Maybe even better than them. If you get this game try incorporating all the styles when you fight. It's so much fun. A more varied approach to fighting awards more sp after battles so you may as well try.

Compared to the previous games, I found only one place that this game regresses significantly: they lock off a lot of incidental places, shortcuts, and back alleys from the over-world maps. Some areas, like in the pre-dragon engine games, have even been blocked off with invisible walls and waist-high obstacles. Stumbling into these pointless places in dragon engine games breathed much life into Kamurocho and Ijincho, so it's sad to see many of them go.

The amount of love and attention this game has is paralleled by none (save Yakuza 0).
The combat and fluidity RGG has strived to achieve in their dragon engine for so long comes to a staggering peak in this entry. It does everything right. It makes everything feel so nice, so powerful - so fluid. 

The main story in and of itself is very thrilling. I fell for the story hook, line and sinker.
But in my honest opinion, the best aspect about this game besides the combat is the school stories. They did extremely well to flesh Yagami out in this game independent from the main story. Yagami tackles so much more than just gloomy detective work, he engages with Ijincho's youth, and cultivates many everlasting relationships with them, but I digress.

Bullying as a backdrop and motivation point for the story just makes me roll my eyes. It's far less interesting than what we got in Judgment. But it still has great characters, a hallmark of RGG. I liked [spoiler] Soma [/spoiler] in particular as a villain. Really creepy with a cool soundtrack for your fights with him. There were some other standout music pieces here (love the Snake Style battle music); RGG has really stepped it up in that department in their recent games!

My biggest complaint is that this game feels bloated in a bad way. RGG games give you a lot to do if you wish, but here a lot of it feels like a slog. Most of that slog comes from the School Stories. Ugh. They tried to do too many mini games at once; RGG should have cut out half of that ""content"".

This is like Season 2 of a TV Show when they get a higher budget and everything is more polished all around. Sure, you can technically start here but Season 1 was also really good and some of the improvements added to this sequel blow the original out of the water in gameplay. 

The combat in this game is fantastic with 5 different fighting styles to master that you can switch to on the fly, the main story is an exceptional drama/mystery, but... my favorite part of this game has to be the side quests. I have never played a game with a single side quest that is just as long and good in terms of narrative as the main story but this game has done exactly that. I seriously spent over 30 hours of gameplay on a single side quest alone.

- More styles - Snake and Boxer Snake is a counter focused playstyle while boxer feels sort of like Rush style

- Parkour sections - I love these so far and its one of the reasons why I got Judgement Initally thinking there was parkour (but it was actually the chase sequences which were fun too)

- The Dance minigame (OH MY GOD YAGAMI IS CRANKIN 90'S SHEESH)

- NO HARD DAMAGE/MORTAL WOUNDS (THANK FUCKING GOD MED KITS IN THE FIRST GAME FUCKING DRAINED MY WALLET FASTER THAN ME BEING WITH AMANE FOR 2 SECONDS AND I DONT HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THE TOP LEFT OF THE MAP TO BUY MEDKITS AND HEAL) FYI: I Max out on medkits because I know hard damage gets really annoying if you're a casual player and don't skill up

-Instead of certain hiding spots in the tailing sequences You have the idle which I like a lot more.

- Sp system - definitely a lot easier to grind SP to max out yagami, they have the style stuff. No more Omega sparks which also drained my wallet faster than how Amame drains me

But there are also aspects of the game that I feel a bit iffy about

- Stealth sections - They fit with the game but They just feel really weird currently, they kind of feel like the old tailing sections but a lot finickier

- Not being able to skateboard on the sidewalk - just a nitpick because usually I skateboard on the sidewalk when I touch grass every once in a while

- Money - I like Money, Needs more ways to get money (I saw some DiCe game passives, I love DiCE game, hated grinding the play passes and have yet to get that super pass in Judgement)

This game is fun. The gameplay, combat especially, is more refined than before. Beating enemies in the city never felt better. The past game, Judgment, felt sluggish now because of this game. The combat here is more balanced and fun, rather than just using Tiger Style only in Judgment since Crane Style felt useless. Other than Tiger Style and Crane Style being more balanced and just fun, theres Snake Style that is a much more defensive that is also just fun to use. Changing styles during combo is the bread and butter of combat. Thats my earlier impressions of this game since I'm not really going into this game for the story.

Lost Judgment is kinda spin-off of the Yakuza games but kinda not since the world of Yakuza, which is Kamurocho, always plays a role in the story. But it is a spinoff seeing how the story tells a different group of people rather than criminals, or ex-criminals that is usually in the Yakuza games. The first game, Judgment, have kind off a simple detective story with some Yakuza usual flair. Although I enjoyed it, I'll admit the antagonist kinda didn't do it for me. In Lost Judgment, I really like the story, the events that happen, and also the main villain.

Warning: This story is VERY DARK, dealing with bullying and suicide. Its not a one line or one event kinda thing. This dark element is the problem the game wants to deal with, exploring its issues and even exploring its consequences. I don't want to spoil too much but if you are open to the idea the game wants to discuss, I believe this game handled it very well and in a compelling way. Giving some of the better stories and also villains in a Yakuza game. 

As per Yakuza game, the main story, is only 26% of the whole game, atleast for me after reaching the credits. Sidecontent is half of the game and is one of the main reasons why the Yakuza are its own genre. There are loads of minigames you can play, each in a building that are unique and very fun. This also gives an immersive feel to the open world, where even with its small size, the things you can do, and the substories you encounter, gives the world more life than an average Ubisoft open world game. (Ahem, AC Odyssey, ahem)

Soundtrack is the firiest of fire I have ever fire. 

Overall, one of the best Yakuza game I've ever played.

Play the first and then the second and absolutely The Kaito Files. What an experience that will stick with me for a long time. I really really hope they do a sequel. Enjoy! and gg",1684020170,1684020170,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am consistently impressed with each newer title in this franchise (counting the Yakuza games obviously) by the audacity to keep pushing for quality and quantity at the same time. Part of what makes these games so special is the constant yearning for improvement from title to title, which is why I can‚Äôt help but wonder how someone without prior history playing these games would feel if they jumped into Lost Judgment without knowing sheer volume of details preserved and evolved since the first Yakuza and its nine-games series, discounting spin-offs.

I felt the need to bring this up, because if you are a reader who has not experienced these games, you [i]can[/i] start with Lost Judgment, but I feel like you will appreciate it more by experiencing Judgment, first. You will also likely have an emotional jaw-drop if you have also played the Yakuza games beforehand, because what causes me to nearly go off-tangent spewing paragraphs of metaphorical love-making for these games has been seeing just how far RGG has come in terms of honing and perfecting their art. 

Lost Judgment‚Äôs story revolves around modern-day bullying in Japan, and while I am not going to analyze the depth of this (as I am not well-versed in the history of this issue in that country), I will focus on the quality of how this story is presented. The characters introduced are strong and believable, and the journey Takayuki Yagami endures is one of extreme highs and lows, and while the highs are joyous, cathartic moments of glory, the lows in particular show a new display of bravery from a writer‚Äôs standpoint. Without spoiling details, I will say that the ending took a lot of balls, and I imagine opinions will be divided regarding the hero and antihero dilemma this story leaves you pondering; this is possibly the most bitter-sweet ending since Majima‚Äôs conclusion in Yakuza 0, and I feel that the antagonists of Lost Judgment might have been the best of this series as a result. No one was allowed to be one-dimensional, here, which is a fantastic achievement.

The title of the game ended up being the two defining words I thought of when the credits were rolling. That earns chef‚Äôs kisses, aplenty, for that.

Before I write about gameplay, I‚Äôd just like to make a special highlight for the heavy-hitter side-story saga, the School Stories. I always make it my priority to play the saga-driven side-stories in all these games, and this one is the best, in my opinion. There is a massive cast of memorable characters, and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like some personal wish-fulfillment was unfolding for me, personally. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the 90s anime Great Teacher Onizuka (particularly the heart of it, despite the humor), and if you‚Äôve ever wanted to enjoy the feeling of playing that series‚Äô most rewarding moments, this saga will be a special treat for you. 

The gameplay improvements (mainly combat) are taken to a phenomenal extreme, here. I mentioned in my Judgment review that we had finally reached the best of both worlds, since I always felt that the newer-engine games lost that charm of combat-depth that 0 had achieved before the engine-shift. Well Lost Judgment took a look at what Judgment accomplished and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just getting started.‚Äù Something in particular I really enjoy is how Yagami feels strong, right out of the gate. In Judgment, it felt like we were developing a low-level combatant into a street-demon. Here, despite having to rebuild upgrades again, he doesn‚Äôt feel weaker at the start. My memory could be fuzzy, here, but I honestly felt like, despite stat reductions, his actual move-set mostly [i]felt[/i] like it was where we left-off at the end of Judgment, which makes his subsequent increases feel marvelously satisfying. I always disliked having to rebuild Kiryu‚Äôs kit from game to game (with the exception being 6, since I felt his slowness added charm to the aged-theme of that game), but it doesn‚Äôt feel like you are rebuilding Yagami as much as you are just improving him.

Beyond combat, gameplay is serviceable, and that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôve seen complaints that the detective mechanics, stealth, tailing, lockpicking, and climbing are all lacking depth, but the way I see it: These mechanics served to sell me on the context of the character we were playing, and that‚Äôs all they needed to do to engage me. If I want an in-depth exploration of these mechanics, there are plenty of immersive sims to pick and play. Here, these mechanics are little sprinkles to break up the combat sections, and they never really overstay their welcome. If anything, they tend to be fun little pauses, which then leads to the inevitable hyped showdowns to be, well? HYPED!

Some little details: I felt that Judgment had a superior mood, giving strong noir vibes to it, which is sadly toned down in Lost Judgment. While I would have enjoyed more of that dripping atmosphere in the sequel, it was great to revisit Yokohama, post-Yakuza: Like a Dragon. Fans of that game will be pleased to see plenty of nostalgia-references slipped in with subtlety (shout-out to spotting Ichiban Confections!) without taking away from Lost Judgment‚Äôs focus. The soundtrack was excellent, and the mini-games introduced were superb (the best of which came from the School Stories).

Overall, it goes without saying that you deserve to experience Lost Judgment if you have made it this far in these games. If you are a potential player who has not experienced these games, while you are free to start here, I truly feel you will get more out of the experience if you have, at the very least, played Judgment. It‚Äôs unrealistic for me to advise you to play 9 [i]long[/i] games, back-to-back, just to enjoy the world-building and evolutions of the setting in this one, but I also feel that I don‚Äôt think I would feel as attached to these games without the build-up. The world of these games is so consistent that revisiting locations like Kamurocho and Yokohama always fills me with memories, like revisiting an old neighborhood where you grew-up. It‚Äôs special, and I can‚Äôt think of another franchise that puts me in that mindset like this one.

- Now has 4 fighting styles instead of 2 and they're all fun and situationally well balanced.

The story is complex and interesting, if a little sappy or preachy sometimes.

Where the previous Judgement game (JUDGE EYES) is THE Yagami's case, this game is more of ONE of Yagami cases. The story in this game introduces a lot of moral grey areas, and the oversights of the law. Where the previous game is a victory lap to finish what's been started, this game is a grim, dark, and quiet affair. The ""villain"" of the story is insanely well-crafted and can be deeply empathised with. At the end of the game, I was sitting back in my chair going "".....dude this is so f*cked up man..."". If you've been bullied before, this game will hit you. HARD.

The beat-em-up combat system in this game is the BEST out of ALL the Ryu Ga Gotoku studios games, period (and I've played them all). It's not even a contest. The different stances all complement each other, encouraging a lot of stance switching during combat. The heat moves are rewarding, flashy, and effective. Combat upgrades feel impactful, and actually upgrades gameplay. The upgrade points (SP) are given generously, but not too much to be considered ""OP"". The boss fights are seriously really well made. I haven't had this much fun in boss battles since Yakuza Kiwami 1. I played on Hard difficulty and was sweating so damn much in the final few boss fight scenes, but they feel very rewarding.

The sheer number of new mechanics and mini-games introduced in this game is also downright ridiculous. They expanded on the detective aspect of this game a LOT, and also the number of fun minigames are GREATLY increased. In the previous games, the extent of being a detective was quite limited. Tailing missions were done so much it kind of got boring. However, this game actually makes you feel like a PROPER detective. There's parkour, noise amplifiers, radio waves reader, using a dog to sniff out scents, etc. Some minigames they introduced are dancing (not the Yakuza 5 one, this one is better by a long shot), boxing, skateboarding, photography, and so so so many more I can't even name them. This game seriously feels like a damn theme park, I can't play them all!

Finally, the new characters in this game is very well done and well fleshed out. At first, some side characters rubbed me the wrong way, but character development kicked me in the heart, and I love them all. One very minor gripe is that I don't see one of the characters more [spoiler](Tesso)[/spoiler], I wish they could've expanded a little more on him. Hopefully we get to see him in the next Judgement game. 

I haven't played the Kaito Files DLC yet, but I've heard good things about it and I'm planning to play it soon. Overall, while the plot is slightly weaker compared to the previous game (but still great overall), the other aspects of the game are 10/10.

While not as annoying to do as a Yakuza 5 this game was tedious in many completion regards like the 50 hour professor side case lmao. Anyway this review will be about the game itself and not as a completionist.

 Spoilers below

First of all, the story. 
- While not my favourite game due to repetitive tasks, this is my favourite plot line in the yakuza series so far, beating like a dragon, 0 and 2 for me. The continuous theme of bullying and suicide is something that yakuza usually doesn't tackle as its main focus is usually on bizarre evil yakuza plot twists or corrupted police. This game also has my new favourite yakuza villain in Kuwana as he is genuinely the most grey shaded antagonists in terms of motives and desires. The line of good and evil is so blurred that your main bro Kaito even says he doesn't know who is right at the start of the final battle and he leaves you to it. Not to mention that masterpiece of a tear jerker send off where everything he tried to protect falls apart and the characters around him apologise for making him keep such a dark secret for 13 years. Him crying out is heartwrenching as he just balls with tears post Yagami fight.
- Yagami is also here but his character development is not as deep as the previous title and kaito takes much more of a backseat as well, but i think this is what makes Kuwana shine the most. Another massive positive is how they dont do the bad guy turns good then dies trope at the end, bro doesnt even get arrested, he just walks off into the shadows, i loved it.
- Literal Only complaint with the story is how Soma has Yagami and Kaito dead as shit in the bar but he just leaves after the bar owner calls and there is just no good defence for that (yes i know its Kuwana dad).
- Also Soma goes on a mad killing spree. Gotta be the most deaths in any yakuza game including the Kaito files. I like it, feels like they took Saejimas advice to Kido from 4 and got their balls out

Content/Gameplay:
- While there is no karoke there are plenty of activities for you to partake in with yagami. A lot of the dumb detective trailing stuff is back but it was toned down from the first game. Some of the questionable observation gimmicks return like ""turn on the lights"" lol. In my opinion the school professor storyline, while fun, was not worth taking up 40ish hours as it ate up side quests. Of the 42 side quests 13 have to do with one illegal detective agency as well which was very boring. Some quests ended after literally 1 minute, no joke. School def ate development here. While i sound harsh here its because this is all my complaints, i got nothing else besides some of the tedious side content as a completionist and some boring side cases.
- Also, Snake style is the best style in the series, holy shit. so cool.

Kaito Files:
- Idk how much this dlc cost on release but for the sale bundle i got it was worth it as i enjoyed it more than the yakuza 2 majima story dlc. Nice to see old fighting styles return with kaito and i love how on stealth missions you can get caught and still knock the guy out unlike yamagi because you are a brute. Also, instead of running around crowds kaito pushed them away in chase missions XD. Made me laugh

Conclusion/Summary
- Game is excellent, my fav yakuza story and second fav overall yakuza game after 0. While not my top 3 protagonist, Yagami has the best side cast in the series hands down. I hope they will release a third game down the road or have these characters make a return in a mainline game. If you like judgement 1 this is a must buy since it has improved the formula in every regard.",1682652786,1682653346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, the story and characters. The story in Judgment was extremely interesting, revolving around government conspiracies and medical trials. Lost Judgment definitely does not disappoint in that aspect, and revolves around the murders of former high school bullies. The best part about Lost Judgment is that, as the tagline says, nothing is black and white. Every character in the story has understandable motivations and goals, and no one is just evil for the sake of being evil. In addition to the story, you have the main cast of characters. Most of which return from the previous game. All of the main cast have amazing chemistry and they're all likable, (or hateable for some of the villains) at some points making you feel like you're a part of Yagami Detective Agency/Yokohama 99. 

Secondly, the setting and side content. The first Judgment was set exclusively in Kamurocho, the city which has been a part of the Yakuza series since its debut on the PS2 in 2005. That's not inherently a bad thing, however, but it definitely made the game feel a bit stale if you played through it after playing through Yakuza games where you've explored the ins and outs of Kamurocho already. Lost Judgment expands this to Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama, which was introduced in Yakuza: Like a Dragon. Ijincho is roughly three times the size of Kamurocho, which gives more opportunities for interesting side cases story beats. Speaking of side cases, the side content in this game is insane. Not only do you have the side cases (or substories as they're referred to in Yakuza) and regular minigames we're used to in the Yakuza/Judgment series, you also have the school stories, which are a set of brand new minigames each with their own storyline attached to them, with an overarching story relating to the Mystery Research Club. 

Finally, the combat. I'll start off by saying Lost Judgment has the best combat seen in the Yakuza/Judgment series ever. I can't begin to describe how fluid and fun everything feels but it's definitely the best. Lost Judgment includes 3 main fighting styles, Crane, Tiger, and Snake, with a fourth boxing style which can be progressed through one of the school stories. Crane and Tiger return from Judgment, and they feel so much better in this game. In Judgment, the only upgradable style was Tiger, with any upgrades that weren't explicitly for Tiger applying to both styles. In Lost Judgment each style has its own skill tree and pros and cons for each situation. While you can just use one style for the whole game, the game encourages you to switch it up, with the Hidden Arts buffs and SP bonuses. The Hidden Arts buffs essentially encourage you to use every style in your battle, as they give you specific benefits when you perform specific actions in a style. For example, if you successfully evade your enemy's attack while in Crane style, and have a fully upgraded Hidden Arts skill, you can boost your attack speed for 12 seconds. This might not sound like a huge improvement, but if you switch styles and activate the Hidden Arts for that style, it resets that timer, plus giving you an extra buff. This is extremely helpful, especially in boss fights, and encourages you to switch up your playstyle. Also included are SP bonuses, which return from Yakuza 0, which were money bonuses. They essentially work the same way as they did in that game, giving you SP for performing specific actions in a battle, one of which being to defeat an enemy in each of the three styles, so to level up faster, you'll need to incorporate all 3 main styles into your playstyle.


Overall, Lost Judgment is without a doubt my favourite game in the Like a Dragon series, and I encourage anyone who is on the fence to check it out, as it is an amazing experience throughout the whole game.",1682115605,1682115605,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Lost Judgment is the sequel to Judgment, and like that game is a Yakuza series spinoff focused on the private detective work of Yagami and friends. It primarily uses the same Ijincho map as Like a Dragon, but don't expect much in the way of references to that game. Outside of a very subtle cameo and a few nods to reused locations, there's almost nothing shared between the games and you can definitely get by here having only played Judgment. Almost all of the major characters are returning faces from that game, and while you might still be able to have a good time if you started here, you'd be missing out on both a great game and a ton of background. 

So, assuming you're already familiar with Judgment, what's different here? Far and away the biggest change, at least outside of the new map, is the focus on Seiryo High School. After a series of contrived and deeply awkward shenanigans a few hours into the game, Yagami ends up as a counselor at the school and will work with almost a dozen different clubs over the rest of the game if you want to complete the main side quest. Each club has its own minigame, which range wildly in content, depth, and quality. The eSports club is merely yet another way to access Virtua Fighter 5, for example, and the robotics club only looks deep until you realize how bad the AI is at it, but the boxing gym is a brand new 1v1 fighter with loads of different opponents and special moves. The good news is that the best of these are quite fun and most of the clubs have entertaining stories to go with the minigames. The bad news is that several of the clubs easily take 4-5 hours to complete and there's no choice but to do them unless you would rather give up on seeing the end of the entire school side story. It would've benefited greatly from having fewer minigames that got more dev time each, or from making the clubs just take less time. 

Speaking of systems that needed more time in the oven, the worst offender by far is the stealth. I am someone who loves stealth games and regularly plays them on the hardest settings, but the stealth in this game is so indefensibly awful that I started dropping the difficulty to ""simple"" every time it came up instead of bothering to engage with it. It's completely linear and provides zero player choice, so there's no satisfaction to overcoming a section, and worse than that it's insta-fail if you're ever spotted. Nevermind that the goons you're sneaking around can hardly scratch you in a normal fight, once you start sneaking they're suddenly capable of one hit KOs. These sections are at least only used a handful of times in a 60 hour game, but they are truly offensively bad. 

My other big problem is more subjective. Judgment mostly had you dealing with yakuza bosses and corrupt officials, so you never felt too bad about harassing them for your investigation. This time around, Yagami spends a lot of time being annoyingly persistent with teachers, teenagers, and other civilians who are a lot more sympathetic when they just want to be left alone. It can get uncomfortable. On top of that, while the story does end up somewhere satisfying, it suffers from some pacing issues in the middle and relies on one specific incident for Yagami's motivation so heavily and constantly that it starts to feel silly. This would've been on the edge of not earning a recommendation if it hadn't recovered in the last couple of chapters. 

All that out of the way, what you're left with is a lot of the same strengths as other games in this series. Combat is generally very satisfying, although it feels like the new Viper style completely outclasses the existing Tiger and Crane styles against a lot of the hardest enemies. It's full of quirky characters and silly moments that'll usually earn a laugh. The main antagonists, once you finally know who they are, create some great setpiece boss fights. The one strong point that's less familiar is the school stories, which mostly offer refreshingly lower stakes and more wholesome content than what you're probably used to. It's good to take a break from all the murders and conspiracies to just go coach a dance team for a bit.

One thing that really stood out to me were the phenomenal performances of Takuya Kimura (Takayuki Yagami) and Koji Yamamoto (Jin Kuwana). I'm a longtime fan of Kimura-san, from SMAP to his record-breaking dramas, and I'm glad that he's very enthusiastic about continuing in the role of Yagami. RGG Studio really gave him a lot more to work with in this title, especially in regards to both the fully-voiced main story and the humorous side-cases. 

Koji Yamamoto also has the honor of portraying the best written antagonist in a RGG title. Kuwana is a deeply complex character that serves as an excellent foil to Yagami, and it's so fun to see these two go head-to-head with eachother. Also helps that he has a sick-ass theme.

While certain aspects like the reworked Detective Mode and Parkour could be improved, Lost Judgment has the best combat in any RGG title ever released, surpassing Yakuza Zero. Combat is fast, flashy, and fluid ‚Äì with Yagami's expanded moveset making the high encounter rate a joy to contend with.

If you‚Äôre a fan of thrilling adventures filled with dynamic twists and turns  ‚Äì look no further than picking up this game right away. Highly recommended for anyone ready for a great time.

(Played through Lost Judgment when it was released on PS5, replaying on Steam Deck. Performance on Deck is great.)",1681701997,1681701997,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The combat has become better, more fluid and more styles added, they hardly removed anything from Judgment's combat but definitely added more.
2. The soundtrack is on par for sure, but in my opinion Judgment's soundtrack is better (by a bit so this game still got banger music).
3. The plot of this game is also top tier but again, Judgment's story for me was better than this (I feel like I keep comparing it to its prequel because Judgment gave me very high expectations for its sequel so I keep it as a base to compare).
4. The message of this game is really great and I loved it.
5. Graphics has surely improved and shit ton of side missions are there (some i don't even feel are needed here). 
6. Map has increased and that's good coz in Judgment, after some time of playing, Kamurocho started to feel small since we can just reach anywhere by just running but this game fixed it by adding one more location which is even bigger than Kamurocho.

Overall this and its prequel are in my top 5 video games now simply due to its plot and combat itself. This game is a serious recommendation from my side and a big YES if you are thinking of buying it. IMO this game's worth it.

PS:- If you have a steam deck, I recommend playing there. I completed it on Steam deck and it was a wonderful experience.",1681140139,1681140139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the school stories where each one was a fun side activity that didn't feel like it ever over stayed its welcome in fact some where a little to short. The boss fights where each one never felt to unfair and the set pieces that go with them where always great just like the first. The sound track was extremely well they can really capture sorrow in those dark moments where Yagmi is breaking down, then the fighting style music are just a masterclass in themselves they're the perfect amount of hype but it isn't taken to the extreme of being annoying to hear repeatedly.

+ Continuing from the first game, the story remains excellent. It once again revolves around detective work, complex mysteries, and lots of action...
+ ...But this time, the story deserves extra credit for how unique it is. Much of the game takes place at a school, which comes with all sorts of interesting and HEAVY plot developments that you aren't likely to see in any other game...Even if you've played Bully, from Rockstar Games.
+ Also returning from the first game is its amazing cast of characters, including some new faces I would love to see more of in the future.
+ Many direct improvements upon the first game. Better combat, more fighting styles, a second map, less filler, etc.
+ Tailing missions, which were previously my biggest complaint, are largely removed from the game. They have been replaced with chase, stealth, and climbing sections, which are all a LOT more tolerable.[/quote]

Speaking of the DLC, I enjoyed the story it told, but the memory system for unlocking certain abilities to buy with XP wasn't very fun. I probably ran up and down every street in Kamurocho each chapter to search for them. A couple I had to look up a guide for because they were up high, not on the ground.

The narrative in Lost Judgment is, in my opinion, much better than Judgment 1 because it doesn't try to make its stakes world-ending. Yes, there are high-level officials involved in Lost Judgment's plot, sure, but it starts off very grounded and generally stays that way. Yagami's story is very much Yagami's story and everything that he's involved in carries personal stakes first. And I am very much into that kind of story.

The combat is stellar too, basically improving on Judgment 1's in every measurable way. Now having three styles a la Like a Dragon instead of two does wonders for how you like to play. Likewise, the expanded ""detective"" segments serve the game well, with a lot of what would have been tailing and chase segments from Judgment 1 being replaced with stealth and Parkour segments.

But there are flaws, and they're pretty huge.

The first and most egregious of these is the locking of the main side story, the School Stories, behind minigame completion. To complete the School Stories investigations, you have to fully complete each of their respective minigames to their ends. This isn't too much of a problem with something like the Dance minigame, but it's insanely frustrating for the Robotics minigame. When I discovered I had to fully complete the minigames, I just gave up on the School Stories entirely.

Another flaw appears once the RK gang shows up. With every plot point that involves RK, the only fights you ever see are against hordes of RK members, that's it. The only two important characters within RK are the leaders, so there really isn't any variety in antagonists beyond those two and one other individual. One fight with RK in the middle of the game has you fighting the same RK leader boss three times in a row. Deplete their health bar, fight again. And then when you infiltrate a warehouse with them, you likely fight a hundred enemies in total over the course of the infiltration. It becomes incredibly boring.

Finally, the game does not play nice with automatic cutscene triggers. I ran into this at the very end, when the game explicitly told me to prepare before leaving. I set a waypoint for the item shop and proceeded to run there, only to realize that getting close to the cutscene trigger would, with no warning, send me into the final battle arc.

I still like Lost Judgment, and I'll be playing the Kaito Files at a later date. But I find Judgment 1 superior, mainly because it's less annoying.",1679075866,1679075866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I already thought the Judgment combat was insanely good, but this took it to another new whole level. I would go out of my way to avoid enemies in the first game, but I looked forward to kicking some ass here. Plus, the minigames! I spent so much time on the minigames alone! The robotics was so fun, including the motorcycle one and the rhythm game. Best minigames ever, man. I also ended up learning how to play Mahjong for the first time and I spent nearly one night just playing it.

While the first game was a pure crime thriller, this one's story is a lot more relatable and personal with some important social commentary about the pressures of growing up and dealing with bullying. This game also has  one of the best antagonists I've ever seen. I won't name him to avoid spoilers, but he was a complex character I've come to love and sympathize with.

If you played a previous game from this studio you probably know what to expect. This is a massive improvement on the previous games‚Äô gameplay wise. 4 different fighting styles make a return, and you can switch between them on the fly. I would get into random battles on purpose just to test out new things. 

The game feels like it is 90 percent sidequests since there are A LOT. I recommend taking a break and checking them out. Especially the boxing game and the dancing. The choreography and motion capture for the dancing is on point. An issue is accidentally triggering story when doing sidequests.

Skateboard / hoverboard is a good addition for getting around town. Should have been in the first game.
Tailing missions are slightly better and there are less of them.

The Kaito files is REALLY REALLY GOOD. Strongly recommend this DLC. Very few sidequests. About 8 hours of pure story missions.

One issue I have is that stealth sections are just badly thought out. They mess up the pacing plus the main characters can just beat up thousands of guys.

Well optimized too runs Great even on a 1060.

Currently almost 100 completed the main game and DLC. I only have the ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù missions left which is honestly kind of a drag. 

My time including DLC is 82 hours. I may have the game 100 percent done in about 85+ hours. Note this is with me playing on normal and using a guide. I have not touched new game plus. You get your money‚Äôs worth.

I would give this a 90/100.

Pros:
+ Lot of QoL improvements, compared to previous part (more exp, path to target on minimap, conversation log, etc.)
+ Story is more like detective, than yakuza tragedy
+ Teamwork - you have to relay on teammates, instead of working alone
+ School Stories - best side activity in whole series
+ Snake style - nice addition to Tiger and Crane styles
+ Ijincho
Cons:
- Lack of characters - you have to fight same bosses multiple times, even within one chapter.
- No-name bosses - some bosses added just to make battle harder, without any affect to story.
- Pointless battles - some battles you'll lose by script after defeating a boss, which makes no sense.
- Teammates are useless in battle - they just move around, occasionally hitting own target, unlike enemies, who focuses on you ignoring your friends completely.

[h1]introduction[/h1]
[b]Judgment[/b] left a big impression on me with everything that it presented to me. It had a fantastic story, awesome characters, stellar gameplay, lots of side content, and a great soundtrack to add to it all. [b]Lost Judgment[/b] improves on some of these aspects and is definitely a game that I heavily enjoyed.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]The story is really well done with great characters
[*]Fun and enjoyable gameplay, with improved combat
[*]Four combat styles to utilize
[*]Lots of sub-cases and mini-games to play
[*]Fantastic soundtrack that is amazing to listen to
[*]Beautiful graphics that make you immersed into Yokohama
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The side-cases were not entertaining
[/list]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story starts out with [b]Saori Shirosaki[/b] and [b]Issei Hoshino[/b] who are defending a man by the name of [b]Akikhiro Ehara[/b] that was charged with indecently touching someone. [b]Takayuki Yagami[/b] and [b]Masaharu Kaito[/b] were called by [b]Fumiya Sugiura[/b] and [b]Makoto Tsukumo[/b] to help with [b]Seiryo High School‚Äôs[/b] bullying problem. However, [b]Shirosaki[/b] calls [b]Yagami[/b] and tells him that the case with [b]Ehara[/b] and [b]Seiryo High[/b], are somehow connected to each other. [b]Yagami[/b] has to figure out what is going on and get to the bottom of this case, while the secrets of the high school bleed out from underneath.

The story for [b]Lost Judgment[/b] may not be as good as the previous game's story but it was still an enjoyable experience overall. The characters are still likable and some of the plot twists were very well done overall. All of my favorite characters are back, and they are just as loveable as they were in the first game.

I don‚Äôt want to go too much into [b]Lost Judgment‚Äôs[/b] story as it‚Äôs really good and is one of the game's highlights in my opinion.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]Lost Judgment[/b] makes a huge improvement over the first game's gameplay, combat is vastly improved and feels more fluid. The [b]Dragon Engine[/b] once again makes its return in this game and still feels very nice. Combat does feel a bit different but that‚Äôs a good thing as it feels fresh, while still having some of the old mechanics to it. [b]Yagami[/b] does have his [b]Crane/Tiger Style[/b] available to him, but [b]Yagami[/b] does also have two new styles for him to utilize now, that being [b]Snake[/b] and [b]Boxing Style[/b].
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941060835
[list]
[*][b]Crane Style[/b] allows [b]Yagami[/b] to deal with groups of enemies and is perfect for taking out weaker enemies when fighting bosses. [b]Crane Style[/b] is not really effective against bosses so it‚Äôs best to switch to [b]Tiger Style[/b] when dealing with them.

[*][b]Tiger Style[/b] has been nerfed a bit but is still my favorite style to use overall, you do have to finish enemies off with a charge attack, but it can break blocking. [b]Tiger Style[/b] is of course perfect for taking out bosses and is very useful in that regard.

[*][b]Snake Style[/b] is a new fighting style that [b]Yagami[/b] has access to that allows him to help deal with enemies that have weapons on them. [b]Yagami[/b] can counterattack and redirect them at foes, this style is more focused on countering than direct damage like the other two styles. When he is in [b]EX Boost Mode[/b], instead of knocking out scared enemies he will make them faint instead. Also, [b]Snake Style[/b] has a unique grab animation where [b]Yagami[/b] will put his opponent in an arm lock.

This fighting style is kind of similar to [b]Tanimura‚Äôs[/b] fighting style in [b]Yakuza 4[/b] but it does not require parrying to be the main feature.

[*][b]Boxing Style[/b] is a DLC-based fighting style and is also a unique style in that it‚Äôs the only one that does not have a grab-based attack. Rather, he will perform a hook attack, and holding the grab button will make him do a charged hook. To get upgrades for [b]Boxing Style[/b] you have to play to the [b]Boxing side case[/b] to unlock them, then you can buy them for 100 SP each.
[/list]
After each battle, you will be awarded [b]Special Points (SP)[/b] which you can use on your fighting styles to get extra moves, EX attacks, health, damage, etc. You can also get [b]SP[/b] by doing side-cases and doing objectives at the same time.

There is a lot to do in [b]Kamurocho[/b] and [b]Yokohama[/b], [b]Lost Judgment[/b] mainly takes place in [b]Yokohama[/b] but you can freely travel in both areas at any time if you so wish. You can do side-cases, play games like batting at the batting cages, card games, or play arcade games like [b]Sonic the Fighters[/b].

If you want some more of my thoughts and other stuff related to [b]Lost Judgment[/b], then I recommend watching my video on both games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj850F5rX60&t=396s

Although despite there being a bunch of additional content in [b]Lost Judgment[/b], I personally did not find it interesting and worthwhile to do. I tried some of it but did not find any enjoyment as I did in the previous game. Some people did enjoy it so more power to them, there are some fun ones like teaching this dance club how to dance and such. So, they are not completely bare bones for all of them.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
The soundtrack for [b]Lost Judgement[/b] is fantastic, every song that was shown was definitely worth listening to. My favorite one has to be [b]Green Vibes[/b] and [b]Hydra[/b], [b]Green Vibes[/b] is [b]Snake‚Äôs Styly‚Äôs[/b] theme and [b]Hydra[/b] really catches off an intense moment.

[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]
The graphics for [b]Lost Judgment[/b] are really beautiful, the world you are in feels like a natural city that you would explore with people chatting, cars moving, and more. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I did come across a few low-frame drops but I fixed them in the weirdest way possible and the game ran fine.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941060945
[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]Lost Judgement[/b] is a fantastic game that's, in my opinion, worth the full price. I recommend you get this game bundled with the first game as it comes with [b]The Kaito Files[/b] as well. While some things in [b]Lost Judgement[/b] were not as fantastic as in the previous one, it still holds up for a worthwhile purchase and is definitely a game worthy of praise by fans of the previous game.

In comparison to Judgment Remaster this game truly feels like a next-gen title and not just another ""cross-gen"" title to me.

Only big problem as of now that ""visual novel"" scenes (there is a lot of these in this game) look very bad on ""lower"" resolutions as 1080p or when DLSS/FSR upscaling is enabled and I'm hoping for a fix.

Music in Lost Judgment is of my favorite OSTs in whole Yakuza series, probably among the best RGG Studio ever done.

Cons:
Levelling up now feels too grindy compared to first game, good thing that combat is very enjoyable.
Also it's got TOO MUCH side-content, it might be as well a plus to you if you have time and patience to complete it all. I felt some minigames like robot battles or motorcycle ""bosozoku"" racing game wasn't as enjoyable as other side-content in the game and they took a good chunk of my time compared to others on my first playtrough on PS4.


I hope RGG Studio continues to make more great beat-em up games like Lost Judgment and not commit wholly to new JRPG direction they took, for me personally both Judgment games were way more enjoyable than Yakuza 7's clunky and slow turn-based combat.

This is a must buy if you liked Yakuza games prior to Y7's genre change, Lost Judgment is Yakuza brawler combat at it's peak. But, I highly suggest playing the first game before jumping in LJ to get to know the main returning characters and their story. Without the first game, despite what marketing said at the release, it won't feel right and you probably wouldn't understand much of the references.

I'll try to compare both game and mention my biggest gripe, will also avoid talking about major spoilers for this game but I might spoil a little bit of the prequel (if that's a problem, you shouldn't be here anyway. Go buy/finish the first game).

Story:
Since we've learned everything there is to Yagami in the first game, the sequel brings another character that is the polar opposite of Yagami.
The story is not as grand as the first game and halfway point it feels forced because Yagami keep mentioning the part where the antagonist done again and again. It's not a bad story per se, but compared to Judgement the quality went down.

The actual story length:
In Judgement there's a perfect balance between the story and exploring (side cases, mini games, GF, etc), whenever I'm doing a story it feels like the game would indirectly give me a brief time to stop so I could explore the world. The story isn't too long but not too short-- rather each chapter you progress it feels like the story is getting longer.
In Lost Judgement there's barely a stopping point. Like I said, the story is not bad so it's easy to get hooked but the problem is each chapter is too short. I was at chapter 7 when I started to worry if the story is gonna spike up soon and starts bringing the main dish because I barely did anything and was already halfway through the game. 
There's also barely a stopping point unlike in the first game so I was blasting through the story quite fast. Well you think it's my fault for not exploring on my own right? Well I did that and guess what? The side cases you did is mostly going to be from school club activity which I'm unsatisfied with (more down below).
It's fine if you think this kinda game is meant to be enjoyed by exploring stuff, do mini games, side cases, etc, you can trust me on this, I am not exaggerating when I said it's really short.

Also side note, this game barely have the option to sleep on sofa which I sometimes need since some GF cases unlocks on certain time.

Side Case:
In the previous game you mostly get Side Cases from the board in your office (and some of them from world encounter). But in this game the side cases came mostly from the school activity club and there's barely cases sent to the detective agency.
I'm not saying that these cases are bad or anything, most of them are great story wise (while some of them I think it's there just because?) but there is no variety in terms of story, the quest you do, the people you met, etc like in Judgement where almost every cases is different / a follow up from the case you've done.

This isn't all of them but it is my biggest gripe, but nonetheless I still really enjoyed it. Also buy the DLC as it's a step up from the base game IMO.",1677244219,1677245721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I felt like GTO Onizuka for a part of it, this was so good, i wished Ryu Ga Gotoku woud make such a game where the High school part is the main focus.    
---- 

Lost Judgment does everything better than Judgment. Right from the beginning , fighting feels faster and more responsive, and the change of scenery for Yokohama is more than welcome.   No more being stuck in the tiny and oppressive Kamurocho. 
Secondly, the game is split between the main story and the optional School story, so there's a good deal of content if you don't skip it.  

Before writing about the story, i want to mention some of the other changes, improvements and new things that have been added.  
_An entirely optional Story tied to the School that takes a bit of grinding 
_Plenty of new side quests, and several new gadget that are needed for them, like a signal detector.
_2 new fighting style, Snake and Boxing (included DLC ); Snake being so strong that i almost only used it past a certain point. 
_Lots of new minigames related to the School, some of them being good, some of them very tedious.
_Drone racing has been improved. The drone on the other hand has barely any use during the main story.
_Yokohama being much larger than Kamurocho, you can use a Skateboard to move around faster, with the ability to do some tricks.
_The Keyholder has been completely removed, and one the lockpiciking minigame too.
_There is humor from time to time, but this is still far from Yakuza.
_The events of Judgment are barely mentioned,  making it a lot more optional to play it prior.
_There's tons of minigames like in every other games from the same studio that are completely optional !

About the high school/main story ; 

_Despite being a bit grindy and tedious, the High School part of the game is what i liked the most ! Some of the clubs were engaging, some of the mini games where actually quite fun, some not and the whole plot surrounding this was enjoyable. I felt very attached to the students near the end, and the last part , to unravel the mystery was very heartwarming !

_The main story is better, but also has a pacing problem. Unlike in Judgment though, here, things are going too fast. Probably not to make a game too long i think, but i felt most of the chapters were very short !

From the beginning, with the informations you are given, you can very quickly find what the end goal for the whole situation is, so it is more about finding all the steps and means that served to create such situation, and there was some good surprises here, which is something the first game is missing a lot.

Near the end, the focus is once more about questioning the player about their perception of Justice.  This time though, several events in the game pushes you very hard on one side, which i found a bit disappointing.

The characters implicated in the events felt much move likable and relatable too.


Conclusion : I liked this game to the point i would recommend it without having played Judgment. The story is nice, a bit on the short side, but it is compensated by the optional storyline tied to the High School. Some clutter has been removed, some added, tons of side content and minigames, all that bundled in the quality that this studio is known for. A very good game !",1677110689,1677158991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, going into LJ, my expectations were really high. And while I can't say the game met those expectations, it wasn't bad by any stretch.

‚óò A lot of people herald it as having the best combat in the series, but my core gripe with that statement is the difficulty. Yes, the combat is deep, and cool, and flashy, and Yagami has a lot of tools to play with and it's very skill expressive. There's nothing in the game that can stand up to getting the Crane Hidden Art attack speed, and just spamming Tiger charged attacks, or going into Boxer EX Boost. Every enemy in the game except Amon just folds in the face of Yagami's most basic combat options, let alone the laundry list of more obscure mechanics he has as you delve deeper into the combat. Judgment on Legend was WAY harder T_T than Lost Judgment on the same difficulty. And to me, that's a huge disappointment.

‚óò In terms of the story, I struggle to articulate exactly how I'd compare the two, but at current the way I'll put it is something to the tune of; Judgment's story is more ""solid"", generally being higher quality from start to finish and being a great crime thriller, while Lost Judgment's story is more emotional, more compelling, and has a better villain/core ideological struggle. I wouldn't definitively say one is better than the other.

One of my bigger gripes with Lost Judgment outside of the combat is the side content. Some of the side content is really, really good, like the Boxing‚òª and Biking questlines (good but get to repetitive IMO). And some of it is really, really shit, like how 10 of the game's 42 Substories are devoted to the completely shit ""Dastardly Detective"" plotline. Actually deplorable that so many Substory slots are taken up by that. I haven't gone back and reviewed all of them to properly form a final opinion, but currently I think the Substory content in the game is very poor, while the School Story content ranged from excellent to okay-ish, depending on the club.

2. Wave combat that feels like a way to waste your time.

Lost Judgement has the best combat in the Yakuza series as a result of its clever, artistic and fun styles.
Along with a heart-wrenching soundtrack, Lost Judgement's dynamic between Yagami and the antagonist is engaging, philosophical, serious and makes you think about a few problems in today's world.

 changed my review to negative after one moment in the game when I finally fought that certain cop ""boss battle"" that was when i realized this game kinda sucks. Remember in 0 when there were so many fights and the coolest bosses and Kuze was like 10 boss fights...yeah right? Not here. 

 40 hours in this game and I only remember 2 boss fights and both were a pain in the *** because of the stupid button prompt. I play on hard and always wear the binding and training inners which puts my attack down -45% I think but I get an SP gain and it makes every fight require a little skill. Well I'm in a groove then the button prompt shows up and I fail every time because why tf is this here? I was fighting so well wtf. then the game locks difficulty on easy and I always fail that stupid part and game over. They added so many things to the game which is cool but took away from the fighting... why? School Stories are just minigames and where tf are the boss fights? 

And an issue I have with this game is all the dialogue. In Shenmue and Yakuza 0, you were always moving and story was a quick cutscene most of the time. I hate mashing the A button because I am not here to read. That reminds me that for a detective game, there isn't much detective work on your end. You just look around and observe nodes which is so lame. And the need for them to explain every little detail and hold your hand. Honestly, why am I still learning tutorials this far in? tf

 Also, the squirrel thing was annoying because in Shenmue and Yakuza 0 I could physically train to get all my stats up quick instead of an egg hunt and after we all looked up a guide online and finally get the last squirrel what do we get... a ******* acorn?! In Yakuza 0 I could steal everyone's money and throw it in the air...that was how you obtained everything and it was awesome. We all loved fighting cool bosses but you can't say this is a different game than Yakuza because it's really not. 

It was always annoying in the Yakuza stories that the character always had to be the good guy when they call the game yakuza but it was fun. This game is not fun. find me in the arcade playing Virtua Fighter because f it atleast I get to fight.",1675812755,1676001692,False,0,0,0.410433322191238403,1,True,False,False

Gameplay: Easily the best in the entire series. Lost Judgment's combat makes the rest of the series look like a goddamn tech demo. Each of Yagami's main 3 styles has more depth than any style in the series prior, and Boxer style is an awesome addition on top of them. On top of that, any enemy who has a presence in the story has a unique moveset this time around, unlike the first Judgment which suffered from a lot of copied movesets. The detective-esque minigames from the prior Judgment have also been improved as well, with tailing being actually somewhat enjoyable. The only part of the gameplay I don't like is the stealth missions. Fuck the stealth missions.

Plot: Without saying anything spoilery, the plot is bold. It focuses on actual issues in the real world and handles them with maturity. The characters are also all written extremely well and seem like actual people you could meet or hear about in the news.

Music and Sound: It's a Sega game. The soundtrack is not only phenomenal, but also extremely varied and has something for everyone. The sounds themselves are also great, with big hits having big impacts and small hits not deafening you. In addition, the English dub is incredibly well done and probably the best in the series as of now (though there's only 2 others to really compete with for now). I'd even say I prefer a good chunk of the English voices to the Japanese voices.

Side Content: Being a game in the Yakuza series, of course the game is loaded with tons of enjoyable side content. Though there are only 42 side cases listed in the completion list, this is only because there are 10 whole storylines through the introduction of School Stories, where Yagami becomes an advisor for clubs in the school and tries to solve the mystery of an anonymous individual called ""the professor"" who has been causing huge amounts of delinquency in Yokohama. Definitely some of the best side content I've ever played in a game, and probably the best in the Yakuza series.

The Kaito Files: An additional paid DLC that takes place after the main game, focusing mainly on Kaito and his past life. Even though it is much less serious and significantly shorter than the main story, it is still a very nice epilogue-esque addition to the game. His combat features two upgraded versions of Kiryu's Brawler and Beast styles that are both very fun to use. Though the DLC only adds 6 new tracks, each of them is just as good as any of the main game's music, if not even better. There is almost no side content with the Kaito Files outside of a superboss and some nice references. Also, Kaito's stealth is actually pretty okay. Still not that good, but it's not bad.

Final review:
Lost Judgment (Base game): 9.5/10, definitely worth the $60 if you're a fan of the Yakuza series. (Although you should play 7/Like a Dragon before this one, because Lost Judgment's plot has a lot to do with a significant event that occurs in it.)

Kaito Files DLC: 8/10, if you really liked the base game and don't want to wait for a sale, it's worth the full $30. However, for anyone else who just plays casually, I'd say wait for at least a 30% sale so you can get it for around $20 or less.",1675905281,1675905281,True,3,0,0.527897000312805176,0,True,False,False

But if you're stubborn like I am, keep reading! If you've played any of the previous Yakuza games, you'll like this one. It's among my favourites already! If you haven't played the others, I'd still recommend it. Depends on how cautious you want to be regarding certain changes in the lore of the Yakuza series. Anyways, be warned of general side content spoilers, as well as an extremely vague overview of the story (no details whatsoever). 

Firstly, this game is awesome! Everything about it. If the first Judgment was the Dragon Engine's Kiwami, then in the reverse order of things; this is Dragon Engine's 0. In almost every way possible. From the four fighting styles, to the absurd amount of deep mini-games, to the endlessly entertaining side cases; this game has it all. Great graphics, beautiful music, an amazing presentation overall. You won't want to stop playing!

Secondly, it's a huge game. I have 107 hours at the time of this review. I've only completed around 60% of the game. That's including the main story and all the side cases, some general stuff too. There's so much more to do if you want to be a completionist. It's an addictive game! You can join a robotics club, a biker gang, a boxing gym, a dancing club, etc. There's photography, arcade games in arcades and at home, skateboarding, gambling, darts, batting, VR games, etc. You can even get four different girlfriends! In the game, probably not for real! My favourites are the side cases, dancing, boxing, and robotics. The side cases are a lot of fun. Hilarious, and almost always bigger than they initially seem. A lot of them are interconnected with each other, and are related to the various mini games. That's a trademark of this series, how everything you do is made bigger through the characters you play, and the ones you encounter. 

So let's talk of these characters. Overall, a similar cast. But with some remarkable additions that make the story more engaging. Yagami is cool as always, tries to be sensible, he's fairly believable though naive at times in terms of his beliefs. Kaito is hilarious, clumsy, and awesome. Made even better with his own story, the Kaito files were epic! Sugiura is still a nuisance, but he's part of the team. Tsukumo is the ultimate problem solver. Genda law office people are still there, and oh man Saori-san! The antagonists of the game will be made well known to you, and they're among the most memorable ones in the series. You'll just have to see for yourself.

The story itself covers a wide range of sensitive topics in a fair and balanced way. Those being sexual harassment, bullying, suicide, murder, justice, corruption, etc. They give way for nuance rather than sticking to stereotypes, which is what makes the story interesting. How they managed to connect so many different facets of life together in a believable and well put manner is beyond me. Some moments have becomes memes, however serious they may have been intended to be initially. The death of the author, look it up! 

How about the main gameplay loop? It's a bit different to the first game. The first one really hammered in the detective side of things, and that was something I enjoyed a lot. But in this game, it's more varied.

As usual, the game weaves together the gameplay with the main story, linking it to side content when it can. Tailing has improved, being much more free flow than it was in the first game. Which makes it more believable. Inspection mode has also been improved thanks to the new gadgets that add more layers to the experience. Makes a lot of sense for a modern detective!

Fighting is contender for the best in the series so far, rivalling 0 easily. Four fighting styles that are all distinct but can be switched between at will, leading to endless creative options for you to explore, with the most insane juggles the games have seen so far. It's ridiculous, in a good way. 

The best thing that they did here is they've made Crane useful! Man, it was a meme in the first game. Now it's actually insanely good! Mainly due to its own counter that allows you to combo the opponent. Each style has its own purpose, which I like. Snake allows you to parry everything and forever. Get those weapons outta here! But you can't move for shit. Tiger has tiger drop, of course. Flux tissure is tough, but still super good. Boxing allows for so many counters, charge moves, launching attacks, stun links, and the ability to sway in and out. Though it's fairly limited in terms of EX moves, and its movement is not as good as Crane or Tiger.

They've also added stealth and parkour, which feel like mechanics that could/should have been here before. Rather basic, but they do the job. A problem is how they're only used when they game wants you to use them, you have no choice of doing them freely. I'd prefer that they weren't so basic, since they appear more often than lockpicking does. Which has also been simplified, no more thumb turn bypasses. No lockpicking jobs either. A little strange.

Contender for best soundtrack. From the songs in each fighting style, to the main menu theme and how dynamic it is, to the boss themes, even the old substory music we've grown to love since ancient times. Man, the boss themes are epic. Viper, Unwavering Belief, Liumang's Chant, K.O.G, even the generic boss theme Vorarephilia is sick! Of course, the Kaito files has awesome stuff too! The Crimson Devil, A Duel for Love, epic stuff! Special mention to Amon's theme Lineage of Clan.

RGG know what they're doing. They know what we want, and they keep giving it to us. Is it perfect? No. But is it as close to that as they can do in almost every game? Pretty much. Still some work to be done to flesh out certain things that are too basic or simply outdated. Some of that is part of the charm, while the rest is a bit annoying. Overall, it's incredible how they managed to make so many good games in this series. And how this spin off feels right at home. As if this is the 10th Judgment game, and not the second one. Fantastic achievement on their part! I hope that there are no more problems, and that they can go ahead and make another one!

My feelings towards Lost Judgment are so thoroughly entwined with adoration that this is the best I can come up with:

Lost Judgment isn't just RGG's finest game, or a landmark title for the genre, but a work of emotional maturity so engrossing that I would eagerly recommend it to anyone that plays video games.

There are your hallmarks for a RGG game- ridiculous side quests, an abundance of minigames, and a definite appreciate for tongue-in-cheek humor at the best of times- but the main story readily surpasses any and all praise I could heap upon those aspects, individual or collective. I won't act as though it's a high point for literature, but as far as video games go, there are few that hit me with such an emotional weight while still remaining thoroughly grounded in reality. 

Lost Judgment looks at the bitter and cruel side of humanity. It takes our aptitude for social violence and radical justification and drags it out into the spotlight, contrasting it harshly with a real commitment to truth, both arbitrary and otherwise, and weaves a beautifully dark story with those themes. I really liked Yagami in his debut game, but Lost Judgment made me love him, and I can say the same for pretty much every last character in this game, but none more so than the antagonist, who did absolutely not a single thing wrong. 

Though I skimmed over it earlier, Lost Judgment's main host of side content is tied into a school setting, with Yagami placed in a variety of clubs under the guise of a counselor; this partially acts as a reasoning for you to get involved with minigames, and partially as an umbrella under which many distinct substories are joined together in pursuit of a single culprit causing problems for the school and its students. I absolutely loved this design decision; as a Persona fan, it really scratched a similar itch that series managed to reach.

The combat, too, is RGG's absolute best to date. Taking four individual combat styles and allowing them to be swapped between with ease mid-combo takes things one step above Yakuza 0, and hit way closer to a real character action game than I ever could have expected. I do feel that the third, original new style, is a touch underpowered in comparison to the two from the first game and the DLC style, but I had similar gripes with the former in Judgment, and they've been tweaked to perfection here. 

I always try to remain balanced and fair in my reviews, but when I look back at my 130 hours in this game, I can't think of a single lasting fault. A few underbaked mechanics, an underwhelming side story here and there, but nothing that amounted to anything truly detrimental. 

I adored Yakuza 7, and to this day consider it to be one of my all-time favorite games. 

I'm shocked how much Lost Judgment blew it out of the water.

I've played all the Yakuza games avaialble on pc, so my review is compared to those
Negatives:
The main story is kinda meh, the plot is stupid in a boring way.

The side cases (not 2nd story) are bad aswell, they are too serious and not fun as in previous games, also there is barely any, most of the side stories are related to secondary content like gfs or detective work. There was even 10 out of 54 side cases being about the same subject!! and then a few is just a bad sequel side story from the first game.

Yagami speaks SOOOO slow, at least that's my experience in the japanese version. I can't tell if the game is long or it's just because the conversation is so slow paced. Maybe i've watched too much anime, but i don't recall it being this bad in previous games. With the story also being mediocre it was a real pain in the end to not press the skip button, as conversations are slow paced as well. (They talk a lot and take time to get to the point)

The judgment series mechanics are poor, stealth is unnessarcy to avoid 1-2 guards, beating them up would be quicker. Tailing someone is boring and slow. The parkour thing was cool, but it feels overused and sometimes you're just like, just use the door maan.

The last sidecase is just a boss fight, however this boss is straight out of darksouls and puts the final bosses in the main story to absolute shame. I gave up on fighting it, as i'm not that interrested in learning all the patterns and mechanics just for an achivement.

The game is expensive, it's an old game and a spinoff. It dosen't bring much new compared to the main series, so not worth the price imo.

In general just too many tedious tasks and also feels like they lost the humor from the previous games. I also feel like despite being a spinoff, the only relevance was the world. The yakuza and story of the cities was pointless or non-existstent.
Positives: 
Skateboard - The skateboard was awesome, quick to get through the map.
Taxi - The taxi are perfectly placed on yokohama, you can get where you need instantly.
4 Different fighting styles was nice too
Secondary story (School story) was a nice idea, the minigames weren't the best but i liked there was so much different.

I would probably give this 3/5, but when comparing to the other games i cannot recommend it.

I have yet to play the DLC, but not into paying 21$ for only 5 chapters and nothing else.

The story and themes about bullying, the flaw in legal system and the act of vengeance when you take justice into your own hands are done expertly in Lost Judgment. You end up understanding and even rooting for the antagonist due to how believable their beliefs and motives. While the original Judgment is much more focused on neo-noir crime action drama, resulting in big climatic battle about what it actually means to sacrifice something for the greater good of society and a tale of redemption, Lost Judgment takes a different approach. It is much more grounded and arguably more low stakes than its predecessor, but it also strikes much more deeper in what it says about society, especially concerning bullying and legal system. This results in a much more emotionally-driven battles of ideologies where neither sides are fully in the right and wrong. Long after the credit rolls, Lost Judgment manages to make me think longer about its themes. Overall, great story told in a beautiful way with some of the best written characters RGG has ever made.

Combat is improved so much to the point that I can safely say that this is RGG's best brawler-type combat. The 4 fighting styles are all unique and balanced. You are encouraged to utilize all the styles' strengths in different scenarios therefore making the combat varied and always exciting to do. The bosses are all great, especially the major boss like Soma or Akutsu or Kuwana. These 3 are top-tier bosses with stellar dynamic intros and soundtrack themes. In short, Lost Judgment perfected Dragon Engine real time combat.

The environment, now the majority of time taking place in Ijincho from Yakuza 7/Like A Dragon, still looks beautiful as ever. With the added skateboard for traversal, making running from one side of the city to the other a breeze and enjoyable. Plus Yagami has a detective dog now which you can use to wander around town collecting items and even skillbooks scattered throughout the city. Activities in Ijincho also can be expanded further through the School Stories side story, ranging from Skateboard minigame, Biker, Casino, and the greatest new addition of all, The Seiryo High School. Built in such detail with every classes, club rooms, gymnasium, etc. Seiryo school is one of the best location RGG has made and it offers a variety of side cases and club activities. Kamurocho is also back, looking great as ever but due to the fewer side cases/things to do in Kamurocho, it ends up not comparable to how much Ijincho offers in terms of things to do. 

School Story is a major addition to Lost Judgment, tasking Yagami into Mystery Research Club in Seiryo High School. 10 school clubs, each with different minigames, most of them are addicting and really fun to do. The highlights are the Dance Club, Biker Gang, Skateboard and Boxing Gym. All of them have extensive stories with well-written characters in each of them. Stories about standing up to yourself, friendship, romance are all in School Story, making the lives of many Seiryo students so much more relatable. There are some frustrating moments, though, like in Robotics Club where the RNG in certain match is really bad, but it's just a small annoying thing in a sea of other great activities. Aside from this, side cases this time around have more recurring-type of cases where one cases lead to another, resulting in a series of cases about a certain individuals. I found this to be good and bad. The good part is that it sells the idea that it takes quite a bit of time to solve cases, and it has much more room to build up certain situations or relationship about certain NPC, the bad part is that it lacks variety in the overall side cases. But overall, the side cases are still as great as the previous entries, with some of the most hilarious, wholesome and exciting in the series. Plus some characters from the original Judgment makes comebacks in some of the side cases, and even The School Story which is always a great thing.

That said, there are some questionable changes and just downright worse changes in Lost Judgment over its predecessor. The item shortcut now only has 1 slot. There's only 1 button to change fighting styles even though Yagami has 4 styles to choose. Mortal Wounds are gone now (which is a good thing actually) but it does remove the danger of Mortal Attacks from bosses. The eating animation is gone and replaced by just text pop up and bust image. The friend system is gone, even though it makes the city much more lively with different vendor npc and their short stories. The side cases tied to Girlfriends are awful, the stories and characters in those side cases are actually good but the fact that you need to essentially do the Girlfriend activity to complete the side cases (plus with the added DLC, meaning you ""have"" to cheat multiple girlfriends) is worse compared to how Girlfriends worked in the original Judgment. You can't reject girlfriends' love confessions is just awful and really weird, considering you can in original Judgment. The message function in Yagami's phone is not used enough for the other activities, this also applies to some of the detective segments that are not used enough in the main story and side cases, like the lockpicking, tailing (though it is improved a lot better now), disguise and drone. In fact, there is no single moment where you need to use drone in any of the main story or side cases which is baffling, considering that drone played quite a big part in some missions in the original Judgment.

Overall though, these blemishes are nothing major. Lost Judgment is still one of the best RGG games to date. An improvement over its predecessor with a much more grounded story and much more grey area the theme goes to explore.

Music : PERFECT ! Dig in Your Heels, Hydra is my favorite. Every style battles has its own music
4 combat styles = more fun in combat
School stories is the best with me : Those minigames boxing, biker gangs, dancing, robotic clubs, photography club, skating. Every minigames is so interest and easy to complete. To the final we find out who is truly a Professor.
+ Main story : Amazing story, i'm not sure but i prefer Judgment story more than Lost judgment but still Lost Judgment has best story so far.
Graphic improved a lot than previous game. Beautiful Yokohama
+ Drone race : Easier at race, find materials than Judgment
+ Paradise VR : Harder because we VS AI. 1 goals before win and then suddenly AI cast 3X skill and you lost( But its so fun when we can challenge AI)
+ Sadly no find cat while in investigating but Kaito Files DLC,  we can find cats hehe
+ Girlfriends : 4 girls is so beautiful and cute in their way. TSUKINO-CHAN IS BEST GIRL. JUDGMENT AND LOST JUDGMENT, SHE IS STILL MY FAVORITE GIRL
Once again: I didnt think this game will come to STEAM but thanks to SEGA and dev RGG. I can enjoy the game very satifying and i'm so happy when buy combo The Judgment Collection.

Good port - stellar performance with a good amount of options and proper button prompts (unlike Yakuza 0, for example).

Despite a lot of cringe, cliches, corny action scenes, plot conveniences and completely pointless actions that add up to pointless plot points, the story's engaging enough to keep playing, even when it gets real bad.

The combat is pretty bad; mostly just button mashing with some easy combos where the enemies are either dummies or have bullshit moves.

EDIT- Editing my review after completing the main story and about 60% of the side content done. No, did not reach the infamous AMON but yeah. If you feel that the story is slow and its just dragging on and on then you will probably not reach the end. But if you take your time and understand the stakes and situations of the characters that are involved YOU WILL be rewarded soo much as you will literally have a sense of accomplishment that you have done what you set out to do in the beginning, not all stories have happy endings but in the end truth and justice shall prevail. The last four chapters will literally turn your world upside down if you follow the story properly and keep all the dots connected. The final chapter has such sweet battles with so amazing soundtracks you will literally forget about your health while fighting cuz you will be grooving with the music and the combat, trust me the music and combat flow soo smoothly you will forget the objectives. Also yes Yagami keeps saying Sawa-sensei too much, if that annoys you then boy you have not played Judgment, play that and you will know the reason for it its just too personal for Yagami. 
So all in all I stand by my first iteration of the review JUST BUY THE DAMN GAME!

Also this is for Sega and RGG incase this review reaches their eyes and ears, if you are aiming to make Judgment 3 and are confused about the protagonist given the rumors regarding the current situation of Takuya Kimura's talent agency and your firm, just MAKE J3 with an epic sendoff to Yagami as he hands his reigns to Kuwana you have such a beautiful opportunity to make a sequel with Kuwana I wanna play as him as a detective/handyman who is struggling to uphold justice in the right way of the law given his past was so violent, make a redemption arc of Kuwana.

I played it first when it launched in 2021 and actually finished it in one sitting (17 hours) and I wasn't a fan of it then. When the game finally released on PC I thought to myself let's give it another shot and see how I feel. Once again, I felt the same but let me make it clear, there's only one reason I disliked LJ and that is it's writing.

Judgment (LJ's predecessor) was a masterpiece in it's writing, combat, incredible environments and movie-like cinematics. Pretty much just like any Yakuza/RGG game you've played. LJ on the other hand felt like such a huge downgrade in terms of it's writing and story. See I was prepared to accept the fact LJ wasn't going to top JE in it's writing due to how high of a bar the first game set, it was impossible to top it. I knew that, but I expected far better in LJ which to be honest, it wasn't. There was a lot going on, so much that at one point you don't understand what your main goal is, what your actually trying to achieve. It felt overbearing and just added specific parts into the game just for the shock factor. It feels much like Yakuza 5 where you have separate stories happening at one time and when you conjoin them it just feels messy and all over the place. Not to mention how some of the beloved characters from the first game barely get more than 10 minutes of screentime in this one which is such a shame.

I will praise the game for its biggest highlight for me and that is it's combat. Absolute peak combat that the series has seen, so fleshed out and hugely improved on from it's predecessor and not to forget the new styles added are amazing. Style switching is faster, more smooth and solid. It's perfection and it's one of the main reasons why I kept going the first time round and the same again. I really tried my hardest to like this game, to give it a fair second chance but alas my mind has not changed.",1672878269,1672878296,False,9,2,0.462123602628707886,0,True,False,False

IT'S EVEN BETTER, THERE IS TOO MUCH CONTENT

+ Honestly pretty much everything is there, but better : 4 fighting style (vs 2 on the first game), A New city to explore alongside Kamurocho, a LOT of minigames and side activities,...
+ The story is great, even if I like more the story from the first game, but this one about school harrassement is really interesting.
+ Music is cool, as always with SEGA
+ This PC version works well, no problems or anything with my high end PC
+ Gameplay is fun and varied : classic Yakuza beat'em up style combat and a LOT of minigames, with some of them that suffise themselve honestly

Maybe the only things I'll say against this sequel is :
- The girlfriend system, less engaging than the first game
- There is a lot of gimmicks having barely any usage (exemple : You don't need to use the drone many time for quests or events)
- Sometimes, and mostly on some activities, the game is too simple (I played on Hard)

Though those lows are nothing really, I'm just quibbling.

Ah and most importantly...
[spoiler]YOU CAN BEAT UP SCHOOL BULLIES IN THIS GAME.[/spoiler]

If you're a fan of Yakuza, just go it's one of the best games of the serie (and spin-offs like here)
If not, I recommend the first 'Judgment' before doing this one because both games are great and making it in order is more satisfying since 'Lost Judgment' is kind of a big upgrade to the first one.",1664326459,1672779629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have to say the making and the sequence of the story is just very new and unique to me, it is so deep, realistic and yet very fantastic, the ending felt very real and done so well, things got wrapped up pretty neatly which really happens only in few games these days. Story 10/10 no doubt !
Developers:
The way you implemented ""skip"" and log reading and so many save slots made this seriously very easy to play and encouraged me to do many things like review some cinematics and important scenes with my wife and she got totally hooked up! The fact that you can skip through almost any scene so I could navigate through events in a flash is a huge bonus.
Gameplay:
Story of side quests was mostly irrelevant, and dialogues were too long, I had to skip through most once I realized they don't related to the main story in any way.
Skill set was very fun, but some skills were hard to use especially ones that needed stun and agony effects, actually I never inflicted a stun during the whole game, but that didn't bother me.
The climax battles in the end were frantic I loved them thanks !
The rewards of minigames didn't encourage me to play most of them, but surely having alot of cash from VR Paradise made it my favorite side activity.

Thanks alot for this game I enjoyed every minute, it did feel like a detective game (Actually felt alot like death note) the mystery was thrilling during the first half of the game, I enjoyed every minute!

Ps: The fact that I could play this without feeling I missed out because of not playing the earlier release ""Judgement"" is a big bonus!

Every time I finish one, I tell myself, ""that's it, there's no way they can make the next game as good as this."" With the way most studios end up burning their own beloved IP into the ground, you would expect it to happen for the Yakuza universe too. 

However, instead of becoming an abject failure of a studio like some, RGG somehow manages to publish yet another amazing game in Lost Judgement. A few impressions for those who have yet to invest:


Mechanics: the brawls are as chaotic and showy as ever, retaining and building on the highly enjoyable combat of previous titles. The mini games are more addicting than hard drugs. The character banter is witty, and the amount of explorable space and things to do is truly remarkable. I was just expecting Kamurocho plus maybe a small district to travel to, but they went all out and made it a lot of total playable space without running out of amusements and side tasks to fill it out. 


Story: the plot hits all the classic Yakuzaverse high notes--a strong protagonist with deep convictions about justice, and the importance in standing up for your personal code of honor. There's a lot of short, funny moments, juxtaposed against larger story themes that examine some of the really messed up shit in society. Without spoiling anything, one example that really got me was a depiction of some sociopathic kids that made a habit out of bullying someone. They didn't pull any punches in showing how life-ruining it can be to find yourself trapped in that situation with no one to turn to for help. The writers don't shy away from the harsh reality of it, which makes the story surprisingly emotional. 


General Vibe: One last thing I really enjoy--much as mainline Yakuza titles have overtones of the crime film genre, Lost Judgement is likewise wrapped in a veneer of film noir and classic detective movies. It gives the series its own distinct place in the RGG ecosystem and I like the alternate approaches both types of protagonists take to get to the same end result. 

Performance: For reference I'm using an RTX3070--at the launch of Yakuza: Like a Dragon it took a while to get the game playing smoothly on my setup  The team has really improved the games on PC--not sure about Lost Judgement at launch, but currently it runs flawlessly on my PC at 1440p. Have settings maxed, DLSS running and never see frame drops below 60FPS which is a big improvement over the somewhat variable performance I expected.

Get it now while it's on sale, it's worth every dime in my book.

I have not played it's prequel Judgment but I have played Yakuza 0, Kiwami, Kiwami 2, and Like a Dragon. Overall, the game is okay. As for the story, usual Yakuza stuff where it just escalates into higher ups and police and top gangs and what not. Compared to other Yakuza stories, it was pretty low-tier. Maybe it was because Sawa-sensei was getting a shit ton of attention and focus despite being such a bitch.
 It was weird how some cutscenes allowed you to skip dialogue and some didn't, also it would bug out where you actually had to let them say a couple of words otherwise you don't get to skip the next line of dialogue. I think it was me but when the game introduces the character for the first time, it lasts for 20 seconds for me.

For most of the game, I played on Hard difficulty but the combat was still quite easy. I switched between Simple and Hard and the difference was that enemies had less health, hits you with a feather, and the AI uses combat moves for you such as activating skills and switching between stances. The extracts that you get are extremely overpowered but fits well for how difficult and annoying they are to acquire and store, I never had to use these extracts until the last couple of fights and legit swept them. The EX skills were quite annoying as they take a long time to finish animating. Combat is easily the strong point of this game and carries it pretty hard. The few side missions that I have done were interesting but nothing note-worthy in my opinion, they were better in Yakuza.

The annoying parts of the game:

The fucking school stories, I swear this section took up at least a third of my play time. It was extremely annoying just navigating through the school because you would do a mission for a club and then you have to return to the MCR to talk to the wanna-be detective hoe.

The Dance Club was actually pretty fun because it was just stepmania.

The Robotics Club was interesting but a fucking time sink if you actually play this above Simple difficulty because the enemy AI are nuts and you actually need to have materials to upgrade your robot parts so you have to play practice matches as well as buy mats at other places to win.

The Boxing Gym was cool but repetitive and also hard as fuck on Hard difficulty. I managed to get through most of the opponents on Hard by just spamming buttons but fucking Kenya is a beast who parries and blocks 95% of your shit and I had to tone it down to Simple.

The Biker Gang is probably the one I hate the most because it doesn't even feel like a race. You have to drive into and hit 10-20 other bikers before you actually get to race and when you're finally racing with the last guy, you can't outpace him, no matter what, he's a set distance away from you so if you happen to make a couple of mistakes at the end, you're done for. So you have around 4 boss races that you have to win and each boss has 3 lackies so you have to race for around 16 times to complete this garbage.

The Photography Club, you just take pictures.

The eSports Club, spam buttons in street fighter, win.

The Casino, you don't actually get to play for real, you auto lose and then auto win.

The Girls' Bar is another grind. You have to drink and talk to 4 girls and complete their side missions in order to complete this section. If you don't have the drunkenness limit, it'll take a long time since the only way to quickly get rid of being drunk is to go into a fight and use the EX drunk skill with 6+ drunk and get rid of the whole meter or drink a bunch of liquids.

That's all for the school stories which is a huge part of this game. I dislike the stealth, climbing, and chasing mechanics because it just feels like they waste time. There's no real skill, it's a pretty linear path for the direction that you're going in, all it does is waste your time. 
Because of the physics of this game, you would sometimes just fall off when you're in a climbing section and you also have to investigate the route that you have to take before you start climbing which is just a HUGE waste of time. I don't know if it was buggy or what but several times during chase scenes, I would miss the grab at the end even though I was spamming the button and time was slowing down but the button prompt wouldn't show up at all.

A lot of the previous minigames are still here such as the batting center and darts. They have added a new VR minigame which you can get a bunch of money from and it's basically mario party with more mini games inside.

The investigation tools that you get also feel like a waste of time. You get a sound amplifier, an emp detector, a drone, and a detective dog. I don't think I have ever used the drone and the detective dog was part of a story. They give you these so you can go off and do your side missions which you have to first find based off of another mechanic: buzzwords.
Buzzwords shows you a bunch of tweets around the map and you basically have to run to each relevant tweet and listen to start the quest and you don't know which tweet is relevant until you're there and have listened to their conversation.

The game looks fine, doesn't pop out or anything but runs well. 

I only like this game because its reminiscent of Yakuza and I severely disliked Like a Dragon because it was a turn-based game.

The sequel to Judgment is just as entertaining and fascinating as the first, and if you love Yakuza games, this is another one to add to your collection. As in the Yakuza games, the main protagonist is Takayuki Yagami, a former lawyer turned freelance detective who now finds himself in another job assignment that goes far deeper than he first thought and brings him closer to some people in the government than he suspected. The game encourages and rewards exploration, and while it is not an entirely open world, there is enough exploration in the city and beyond to keep you entertained. Along the way, you can do side missions for clients or help people in the City, as well as play a few side games ranging from Dancing, Boxing, and Drone Racing  

The school stories are a lot of fun, with interesting stories and characters, and I've found myself paying more attention to them than the main story, which isn't to say the main story is bad. The main plot is amazing. Once again, I found myself emotionally attached to the characters and eager to find out what happens next. There are parts that are shocking and parts that make me laugh. Overall, it's a Masterpiece game.

===== 2nd RUN on Legend Difficulty =====
I just wanted to let people know that the Legend difficulty now has full access to the checkpoints that other difficulties get, so you don't have to reload your save if you die or fail a section. The game is fairly easy if you play it on Normal Difficultly, thus I quite like this change. NO more Tiger Style Ex/ Crane Style EX and smashing the Y button on your controller. 

I'm focused on the main story on this run so I understand better what's happening there are parts that I get more and still mind-blown by the twist in the parts of some chapters, well gonna say it's still one of the best stories in single-player games that I play. Still a Masterpiece for me.

The first half is better and closer to what I expected with the detective aspects and discovering all the elements surrounding the main case. I feel the mystery here is good and on par with the first game.

The latter half feels less natural, as if redeveloped afterwards where they couldn't figure out how to take the story further to make something longer and more climactic. There's some good stuff here, but my biggest issue with it is that it adds little new and very slowly compared to the first half. You're constantly location hopping just to hear the same conversations and names drop in attempts to get slightly new information. The mystery and detective elements feel dead where you're instead either beating around the bush or just pressuring others until someone finally gives you something new or some new event occurs.

Other stuff:
The evidence selection and questioning this time around feels more tacked on than something where you're needing to make meaningful, thought out choices. For me it tended to usually be either completely obvious what to pick where it's  the latest piece of evidence you just obtained moments ago (why is there even a choice here?), or sometimes confusingly ambiguous (many of these could technically apply).

The trailing, sneaking, and photography were minimally used as gameplay elements. The climbing stuff which I believe is new felt unwelcome a lot of times since they were long and slowed down the pacing.

The school setting was something new and neat, but I was disappointed with [spoiler]how little it's actually used overall in the main story.[/spoiler] 

The school stories, which is sort of a primary sidequest not connected to the main story, is way too long, unbalanced in how time is divided between the clubs, heavily padded with repetitive minigame requirements, and does not fit at all chronologically when doing them in the middle of the main story (where some of the activities are likely taking place over at least several weeks). Some of the minigames are pretty fun and had a lot of development put into them, but I was exhausted at the end due to how many times they make you do them to progress.

The game is, for me at least, unwelcomely more violent. Despite being rated M, Judgment and the Yakuza games (though I've only played 2 of all of them) were comparatively tame. It was something I appreciated going into any of them since I knew I'd get some good mature drama and action without anything too unsettling. Overall this was [spoiler]thankfully nearly at the same level, but there is a pretty graphic murder scene and a one time mild threat of sexual assault on a story character.[/spoiler]",1672138906,1672138906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So easy-to-view template out of the way, I never understood the idea of wanting to replay a game for the first time...until this game. I've been obsessed with RGG's work for many years and always wanted to learn more and more about each game so I never felt that even for the rest of the games. I remember watching Cohh play the game on early access and fell in love. But what I wasn't aware of is how different it is when playing. 
I fell in love with so many new characters and the writing for each of them is phenomenal. From the antagonists to even the school story students, they all were so compelling. 
Speaking of the school subplot, the mini-games were amazing. Even one I had difficulty with for a little while such as the robotics club, once I figured out a proper build for myself, it was incredibly fun. I wanted to complete even the last one and it was so worth it. I love the students like they were my own kids. I went through the boxing mini-game straight through in one night, it is THAT fun. My carpal tunnel issues did not give me any mercy when I went to bed at 3am right after.
The Kaito files were also a joy, with many more well-written characters. 
Also, may make some people completely ignore all my other opinions but, play dubs. Just do it. For many games I prefer sub of course but the English VAs really understood how to match the energy that the story provides. 
Only gripe is I don't get all the cats to put in the agencies like I did in Judgment. Finally enough space for them but nope, Sad.",1672100325,1672101756,True,1,0,0.511033058166503906,0,True,False,False

LJ improves on the previous game in almost every way, since there are few tailing missions (though the cover system for it has been greatly improved) and the combat styles feel much more fluid and the new styles are really distinct and enjoyable. I found the chase sections tedious since the person you are chasing often gets an arbitrary boost of speed just to run around the same city block until their health bar drains. 

Otherwise, there is very little negative to say about this game. I really like the new ""School Stories"" where each club has their own minigame to master.

While investigating accusations of student bullying at a high school, player character Takayuki Yagami is asked to look into a murder case which might also have links to the school.

[h1]Familiar gameplay[/h1]

‚Ä¢	Lost Judgment mostly takes place in the Ijincho area of Yokohama, which was the setting for the Like A Dragon game starring Ichiban Kasuga, but you‚Äôll get to spend some time back in Kamurocho as well.

‚Ä¢	Like the previous game, the third person melee combat is played in real time. There are now four different fighting styles (tiger, crane, snake and boxer), which are intended to be used in different situations, but honestly I just stuck with snake for most of the game, while playing on the hard difficulty. It feels kinda similar to the Arkham games, where pressing block at the correct time leaves enemies vulnerable to a counter attack. There‚Äôs also a very useful move where you can grab enemies who are wielding weapons to disarm them. And some special moves can be triggered on enemies who are scared of you, which causes Yagami to punch or kick the air beside their head to make them faint in terror, which looks really funny.

‚Ä¢	Main story, which focuses on bullying and flaws in the legal system, is well written, fully voiced, and voice acting is excellent. Yagami continues to be a very likeable protagonist, while his allies who return from the first game are also interesting characters.

‚Ä¢	In addition to the main story, there are lots of substories featuring PI cases and wacky situations, some of which involve hour long investigations, or have multiple parts.

‚Ä¢	Many of the entertainment minigames seen previously in the Yakuza series are included again such as golf, baseball, darts, VR dice game, House of the Dead style shooter, and various Sega arcade games. Plus there‚Äôs a new Geometry Wars style twin stick shooter, and Yagami has a Master System console in his office in Kamurocho where you can play 10+ old games.

‚Ä¢	I didn‚Äôt have any problems with bugs, crashes or framerate, and the controls work well most of the time on my xbox 360 gamepad.

[h1]School stories[/h1]

‚Ä¢	Lost Judgment also features a lot of content related to a secondary investigation, where Yagami is asked to join 10 different clubs that all have a connection to school students, and a criminal mastermind called the Professor. These clubs all have their own lengthy storylines and contain unique minigames.

‚Ä¢	This secondary storyline is significantly longer than the main story, but this isn‚Äôt necessarily a good thing. Most clubs take around 4-5 hours each to complete, which eventually made the game feel bloated, while also hurting the flow of the main story. In total it took me 83 hours to finish the game, and I haven‚Äôt started the Kaito Files DLC yet. 

‚Ä¢	For example, to complete the boxing club storyline you need to defeat more than 20 opponents. To complete the motorcycle club storyline you need to win 16 races. The dance, robotics and skateboard clubs all require you to do multiple practice matches before each round of their tournaments. In robotics you can customise your robots with various parts and you‚Äôll probably need to grind a few more practice matches to earn crafting components. Its really excessive and feels repetitive.

‚Ä¢	Some of the minigames are quite easy. Dance is a rhythm game similar to Haruka‚Äôs in Yakuza 5. In skateboarding you have to ride around a skate park and perform tricks to earn points. In Esports you‚Äôll play the Sega arcades version of Virtua Fighter 5 Showdown. Boxing (more challenging but thankfully I did win every fight on my first attempt) is like a 3D Street Fighter.

‚Ä¢	However, the robotics and motorcycle clubs both have poorly designed control schemes and feature difficult opponents. Robotics is a 3v3 battle where you have to collect and place tetris blocks to capture territory on a grid, and motorcycle involves death races where you have to knock several other riders off their bikes while they attack you with molotovs, baseball bats, etc, and then race a boss to the finish line. Any time I lost a match more than once I quickly started to feel frustrated, knowing that I was still quite far from completing the game.

‚Ä¢	Meanwhile, these school club storylines feature a lot of dialogue related to unnecessary subplots. Every club has multiple members, there‚Äôs usually a rival club which also has multiple members, every one of these characters has a tragic backstory, or an issue with a family member or a romantic interest or an internal club conflict, and in between every round of the minigames, yet another of these dozens of minor characters wants to spend several minutes discussing their feelings with you. I value story more than many gamers, but even for me these storylines started to lose my interest because of how much they dragged on with pointless conversations that didn‚Äôt connect in any way to my actual investigation of the Professor.
 
[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Lost Judgment does have some good moments and I still recommend playing it if you‚Äôre a fan of the series, but if I had to rank all the Yakuza and Judgment games, I‚Äôd put Lost Judgment near the bottom of the list.

While the combat is fun and the variety of different activities is interesting for a while, the number of times you need to play and win each minigame eventually feels repetitive and grindy, while the number of hours it takes to do so has a negative impact on the pacing of the main story, which is usually a key strength of this franchise.",1671665166,1671665184,True,23,3,0.748498737812042236,0,True,False,False

From gameplay to story everything was perfect. Its good to know that great games are still coming out while the big AAA studios still release their poo recycled games (tho worth mentioning that RGG also recycles a lot of their old animations but with the amount of games they had its kinda expected). Lost Judgment polished some things that were not perfect in the previous game, while adding some new fun mechanics. All of the four fighting styles were great, didnt feel like one was stronger than all the others. Story as expected from RGG is top notch, hands down.

Combat system is really good, maybe only second to Kiwami 1 and that's up to debate. As an action game enjoyer (DmC, MGR, Bayonetta, God of War, Monster Hunter, etc) I never got bored of it.
Music wise, there are some bangers like Green vibes, Blue stompin', Unwavering belief and so many more ...
The story is excellent if you are into detective stuff. If you aren't some aspects might get annoying but it's not that big of a deal, the characters are endearing and it's fun seeing them interact with each other.
So all around, pretty much a perfect game, only second to the legendary Yakuza 0, simply because Yakuza 0 will never be surpassed. It's the best modern Yakuza experience you can get right now though that's for sure, better than Yakuza 7 to me personally (I don't enjoy turn based combat) but I understand some people might disagree with me on this and it's ok.

I completed the Kaito files too of course, and honestly from a customer point of view this is not worth it, it costs 30‚Ç¨ where I live and it only lasts a few hours. You could just watch the cinematics on youtube and save your money if you aren't a fan of Yakuza games in the first place.

On top of the electrifying combat and improved styles from the base game, this installment brings not one, but TWO (if you bought it with DLC like any normal person should) new styles that drastically switch up the gameplay in more ways than I can describe. This game's ludicrous amount of fighting styles is reminiscent of Yakuza 0, and it possesses the same versatility in combat with the added touch of Judgment's many trademark moves (the counterattacks are SOOOO AWESOME!!!). Maybe it's just that LAD left me craving the olden days of Yakuza combat, but this was certainly something I was missing for a long while. Years, probably.

But there's more to love! And, surprisingly, it's the game's story! Having played through a total of 9 RGG titles with the same general setting, tone, and conspiracy plot, it's hard not to get a little disillusioned with every twist and turn they throw our way with every passing installment. I think the peak of my annoyance with the franchise's winding plots was Yakuza 4 (you all know what twist I mean), but the series gradually found ways to keep it fresh as it entered Ichiban's journey in Y7. Upon playing Judgment, a game lauded for its superior story to its sister franchise, I was a little unimpressed with its structure, finding it to have a pace comparable to that of a TV show, not a game. I went into Lost Judgment with lower expectations, considering how more people seemed to dislike this one's plot than the first. 

And yet, this game managed to blow those expectations away. A more focused narrative than the first, with every aspect of the main story mattering in uncovering a puzzle that's less concerned with the well-treaded ground of organized crime syndicates like the Yakuza, Jingweon, or Triads and more concerned with a simple, unifying topic: Bullying.

It seems a little stupid, at first. Yagami and the gang solve bullying! But, oddly enough, this game takes no hard stances and throws no softballs dealing with the subject, as well as the nature of culpability, guilt, and (obviously) justice. In many ways, that makes this game's main idea seem more thematically relevant than its predecessor, with a complex issue in the case of right or wrong that can't be watered down to a simple conclusion. Characters on both sides of this debate are sympathetic, and don't (SPOILERS FOR JUDGMENT 1) have their character motivations chalked up to desiring power or fame in the final stretch of the story. Essentially, it's almost groundbreaking how mature this game handles its subject matter, especially considering how childish RGG can seem with some other installments and their quandaries of philosophy and morality.

This game runs great on a LAPTOP too. What's not to love? I'll update my thoughts after finishing, but I have to say this is definitely up there.

The only sad part is that fromout Chapter 6, i started to get crashes left and right.
But i kept on playing anyway, since i was just addicted to this game.
I have sadly lost around 6 solid hours of gameplay, just to redo stuff.
Frustrating, but still kept playing since the game is just extremely good.

(I couldnt find a fix for the crashes, so if someone has a fix please DM me, i want to put it here for everyone who has the same problem)

Anyway, to kick off this comment with a positive note.
This is the first judgement/yakuza game i am wanting to 100% despite the crashes.
Oh and when you play the game, please say hi to kaito for me <3",1670575668,1670575668,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Purely cause of this one.

The story is one of the best in the Yakuza series (Even though it's a spin off) purely cause it's grounded and tackles a problem that relates to many common folk.

The combat is also the absolute best in the entire series.

There are 3 styles in total (4 with a DLC, but that seems to be automatically given when you buy the game)
Each of which are extremely useful in almost every situation (Compared to Judgment where Crane becomes obsolete halfway through the game).

Crane: centered towards evasion and crowd control, but it's speed allows it to even be useful against bosses.

Tiger: all about damage and heavy hitting strikes, nuff said.

Snake: Perfect for when you're surrounded or up against enemies with weapons, useful against bosses as well.

Boxer: The ""DLC"" style, think of it as a fleshed out far more unique and far more fun Rush style that Kiryu had.

All of these are always usable from the very start till the credits roll and combined with juggling and fast style switching allows you to pull off stylish combos and decimate foes.

It's clear that RGG saw what was popular and what was despised in Judgment, and decided to fix everything and all that was popular was doped up on enough cocaine to even make your average Miami citizen overdose.

Here's hoping RGG implement this amount of options in combat and uniqueness in their other games that follow the usual real time combat. And here's hoping Like A Dragon 8 turn based combat follows in the footsteps of the Judgment series, 7 being the seed, and 8 being grown to such a degree that even people that don't like such combat in games are able to like it.",1664831590,1670463355,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

My review is basically the same as the Judgment one, however this would have to be an 9, the story is really amazing however it lacks a good villain. 

Two things that makes Lost Judgment better is the combat and the side-content.

The combat now gives you way more freedom to do more stuff and introduces more combat styles, personally I thought this made for way more satisfying gameplay, however, even on the highest difficulty, Yagami is just way too OP. Most enemies are just way too easy, ESPECIALLY bosses when you're using the DLC combat style. That thing is just busted to hell.

Side content now introduces way more interesting stories and I honestly believe it was almost at par with the main story. Without spoiling much I will simply say that there's a lot of side content that all wraps up nicely in one big thing, it almost brought tears to my eyes (it did actually.)

Amazing game with good plots and twists with a quite original story, combat is very good but a lot of it is too easy.

The physics is still awkward but not as awkward as Kiwami 2. Enemy no longer fly to the moon after defeated.

Graphic wise, it has AMD's FSR. Something like Nvidia's DLSS. Means it will not run like üí© like Yakuza 8 in Ultra preset. I get 120fps most of the time on Ryzen 9 & RTX 2080 with FSR enabled.

I just wish there's mod to remove the BUY DLC button in menu & enable the player to run in 1st person view without any UI.

Whole lot more content cause Yokohama. Story still great. I beat legend with health upgrade to level 3 only. It's fun and challenging.

Do buy the Judgement Full Collection, you get the Kaito DLC almost free.

Nah for real though, the combat in this game is faster and more fluid than it was in Judgment 2018 in a few areas, and the characters, such as Jin, Soma, and Akutsu, are the most intriguing than the previous characters in the first game. I can only presume the game has a ton of side material to do, but given how bad my attention span is, I doubt I'll complete that. Regardless, after beating the story, I've concluded that LJ has one of the goofiest stories out there, but you're bound to love it at the end of the day because it has the most perfect balance of everything, goofy drama, cinematic fights, emotional crying moments. we truly NEED Bad Judgement

================================

Story
-----
Unfortunately, the story is not as good as before. Even though, the theme is great, there are some twist, but the way it unfold is not as compelling as the first Judgment.

Gameplay
--------
This is the strongest poin of this game. 
(+) It has the best hand to hand combat with different styles, even better than Yakuza 0.
(+) So much thing to do in the game. You can play school activity with its own stories and mini-games, playing retro console games, playing arcade games, etc. And one mini-game also contributes into one of the combat style.
(+) This game also fixes many annoyances in the first Judgment, like better mechanism in tailing mission.

Music
-----
The soundtrack is great. From opening music, to the battle music, every music is very good and make the game more engaging. It enhance the situation greatly.

Graphic
-------

A lot of things are fantastic with this game and I believe this is my favorite game that I've played in years. The story all the way through was a suspenseful iceberg that kept uncovering more and more pieces until it eventually turned the original plot on it's head. The gameplay was tight and highly responsive, especially compared to it's predecessor game while simultaneously introducing new styles and movesets to keep things fresh. The characters were developed very well and felt genuine with their beliefs and actions, especially the main antagonist who was a perfect capstone/key player to the story since you as the player can sympathize with their choices even if they aren't the most ethical. The music was downright full of bangers which made encounters more enjoyable and made the settings more ambient assuming you're into EDM. The side content is plentiful and mostly optional though some of it hits while other parts miss in terms of enjoyment.

+ Great graphics
+ Fantastic new characters
+ Great story
+ Incredible combat; IMO the best in the series
+ 3 (+1 DLC) polished styles of combat; massive improvement from its predecessor
+ Say goodbye to the tedium of running; you can now call taxis from your smartphone and skateboard around town
+ Side/school stories are phenomenal
+ Wide array of side activities; robot wars, boxing, burnout bike racing, skateboarding, dancing, on top of the usual RGG ones
+ You get a [b]Detective Dog[/b]

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
+/- Great direction towards parkour and stealth mechanics, but said mechanics are somewhat unpolished and occasionally buggy
+/- Lack of upgradeable storage space; makes things more challenging, but also requires more trips to shops
+/- Dialogue gets a little tiresome at times. Take a drink every time Yagami mentions ""Sawa""

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Drone racing and VR Dice & Cube are downgrades from the previous game
- Ingredients for extracts are a tad tedious to farm

[h1]Review[/h1]
Lost Judgment is phenomenal and an upgrade from its predecessor in virtually every aspect. 

The combat system is exciting and buttery smooth. Dragon Engine combat was kinda rough in Y6 and YK2, with Judgment being a little boring. But combat in Lost Judgment hits all the sweet spots. You get 4 types of combat styles, and switching between them is seamless. While Crane Style was pretty bad in Judgment, this game makes it fantastic for dealing with crowds.

Story-wise, this game impressed me with how it managed to develop a quality story around school bullying. Some parts of the story are also considerably darker than the RGG norm, which was definitely an interesting change. Most say that Judgment's story is superior, but I actually prefer this one for tackling real world issues and the subject of morality.

But IMO, the best aspect of this game by far are the school stories. Yagami should give up being a detective and become a school guidance counselor instead. There are 10 different school stories (quest chains) in this, and a number of them have fantastic character development. I never thought I'd be so committed to overseeing the championship victory of a school's robotics club.
School stories also introduces a real star in Amasawa Kyoko, and I would be [b]really[/b] disappointed if she didn't return in a potential third game.

Performance-wise, the game ran perfectly and not once crashed in my entire playthrough.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
I loved every moment of this game. Easily one of the best games in the RGG franchise, and I doubt anyone would leave feeling disappointed.",1665594562,1669253295,True,8,0,0.57705080509185791,0,True,False,False

 - Action - your favourite yakuza action is back! combat is better and has been smoothed out!

cons:
- story is blah. School arc is boring AF, the only good one is the boxing one. i gave up half way. It's way too tedious. From gathering parts to go on a bot battle to fighting again 7vs 1 on a motorcycle battle. 
- Main story kinda meh - It's boring an uninteresting. sure there are murder and stuff... but the reason for murder is so stupid. It's like watching a really bad japanese tv show.
-kaito got stabbed again, and he forgot he was stabbed in judgement :(

i still do like this game for the combat, but dang the story went downhill BAD. judgement was rough in the corners sometimes, but the story was top notch. This however is meh at best.

In my opinion, the setting of the story in this Lost Judgement was good. It was too good that I feared the next stories could not keep up with the quality of the current ones.
About battle/fighting in Judgement series, especially in Lost judgement, the development team had brought back the multiple battle styles which only existed in Yakuza 0 and 1 (and missed in sequence Yakuza series). Some might argue or prefer that the development team should focus only 1 style only (like Yakuza 2 onward), but for me it made the battle in the game boring, and not much of the thrill in style switching (which also made me hesitated to continue playing the Yakuza 4. 5, 6, and just go with Judgement).

The game starts off pretty slow, just to get you familiar with the game's mechanic first ig, but as someone who literally just played its prequel, it's slow as hell. Now, when the it reaches the main plot though, things got very interesting and I couldn't stop playing. But it also repeats one of the point the story is trying to make too many times in the dialogues between Yagami and one of the main character imo.

The chemistry in Yagami's group works a lot better in this game imo, maybe it's because the previous game set it up already. One of the main antagonists are a lot better fleshed out than other games, and the other ones are very charismatic and fun to watch.

The combat gameplay got even better.  There are 4 styles, all of them are fun to play (except the DLC one if you don't do side story), there are so many Ex-actions and all are really cool to watch. Dynamic intros and action sequences are arguably the best in the series, the buildup, the music, it's all perfect.

The OSTs are very memorable, especially Viper and the last boss's theme. Most tracks are great, from the menu screen music to minigames ost. 

So if you like Judgment, you don't even have to think once, just get this game.

Negatives:
-The detective aspect to the game is still lacking. Thankfully there are less tailing missions but the few that are still on here aren't very much fun. The investigations are pretty cookie cutter and have no real depth to them. Parkour was a new feature for this game but similar to everything else listed on here its pretty shallow. 

Overall 9/10

Actual Review:
So continuing from the first game Judgment (Judge Eyes), they decided to absolutely hit the ball out of the park with Lost Judgment, with a location change from Kamurocho to Ijincho from Yakuza: Like A Dragon (Yakuza 7) as well!

Getting into gameplay, the Crane and Tiger Styles return from the first game, with some new improvements, Crane has gotten buffed to the point that it's actually now really good, and it actually has upgrades instead of being left out because of the other upgrades going to Tiger in the first game. Tiger also gets improved with some new skills and charged attacks being apart of the base style instead of a separate skill like the first game, however flux fissure isn't as broken as it was in the first game but still pretty good. The Snake Style is one of the new styles being added to the mix, which is basically Tanimura's style from Yakuza 4 but improved upon and more focused on parrying and the opening you can make with that, you can also disarm opponents that have weapons (unless they're a boss enemy) but sometimes I wished that if you failed it, you just grab them instead. The Boxer Style that was originally DLC in the Console Release is now an actual style that comes with the game, and it's really good for stunning your opponents and just laying waste on to them. but you can turn it off in the settings if you like having 3 styles instead. Each style has their own Secrets and Counters which is pretty nice, Crane has a counter that launches enemies into the air opening a juggle combo, and the secret allows you to dodge an attack and gain temporary boost in combo speed, Tiger has Crushing Tiger Fist which is definitely not Tiger Drop renamed and reanimated, and the secret allows you to do extra damage after a charged hit, Snake has the worst counter as you can only use it when your EX is empty, the secret makes you immune to being knockdowned after a parry, Boxer has THREE counters for jabs, hooks, and straights, which they all do their own ailments as well, the secret makes it so your EX meter charges more faster after a counter, oh and btw each secret can be used outside their styles, so you can use crane to dodge an attack then switch to tiger and do a charge attack and vice versa.

The story of Lost Judgment is fantastic, while most people will definitely enjoy Judgment's story more than this game's, this story shouldn't be slept on since its one of RGG's best stories out there at the moment, the school is interesting part of the story (you also get to beat up high school children) and yeah there is some pacing issues in the middle, and a certain someone getting mentioned by Yagami every 15 seconds in the finale, but the villains of the story are incredible, and the final boss goes REALLY HARD in terms of both characters, atmosphere, moral, and it's music.

The Side Content of Lost Judgment is definitely some of the best Side Content we have gotten as well, while there isn't as much Side Cases in Kamurocho since the game takes place mostly in Ijincho, the School Stories are a great addition to the bunch. Each School Story has it's own minigame that you can play to progress through them, and they all have their own respective characters as well, it's a really fun time, my favorite being the Boxing Story, and my least favorite being Robotics Story (i hate it alot). There are 42 Side Cases in Base Lost Judgment, but since the PC release includes all of the DLC (except Kaito Files) it goes up to 54, but you only need to do the base Side Cases and all School Stories to fight this game's secret boss, as the other 12 cases from the DLC are connected to Girlfriends.

So talking about detective stuff, they pretty much took out half of the gimmicks from Judgment, no more rotating lockpicking, there's only one Tailing Segment in the story, Active Search Mode is a lot more better, Chasing is more like Yakuza 4 and 5, with the draining health bar and comically large Staminan X on the streets. Overall most of the detective stuff has been improved in this game, and they also dialed down them in the main story, even improving Tailing Segments to have a nice new Act Natural button that you can hold, but they also made it so you can't make that many mistakes anymore, and then they pretty much threw every single one they made into the Side Content.

Now talking about the PC Port as I played this game on PS4 and then PS5, basically you get all of the DLC except kaito files, so you're getting the best experience of the game with no extra cost, and just like Judgment you also have pretty good optimization.

Overall, for those who have never played a yakuza game and returning fans of the series, I would 100% recommend this, however I recommend also to play Judgment first so you have a better understanding of the characters. also soundtrack is a banger",1663293543,1667875258,True,3,0,0.526183605194091797,0,True,False,False

Lost Judgment is an incredible sequel, improving upon almost everything the first game already did well. It is also, in my opinion, the best RGGS game to date, the Yakuza ones included. The story is amazing, the variety of minigames and side activities that feel compelling to do is astounding, the action-oriented combat is a lot of fun, and the soundtrack is also great.

Even though the price for this game is very high in my region, I feel like it was worth it. I'm not in the mood to elaborate further about the game's details, but it is truly a masterpiece. it has some flaws, but overall, I'm very glad I got to play this. It's almost a crime that it was console-only until recently.

If I had to rate Lost Judgment, it would be a 10/10. This game is truly something else. If you're not in the mood for the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games, at least consider giving Judgment a try, chances are you'll find them great too.

The amount of options, air juggles, ground combos and wallbounce/bound combos are insane not to mention just the sheer amount of moves there are to use. This game takes the gameplay of the Yakuza series is known for and transforms it into something even better which is saying a lot because I've played and loved every game in the series outside of Isshin (Due to there being no english sub). 

Story is also very good, presentation is up there with Like a Dragon and Yakuza 0 in terms of direction, characters and writing. On top of that it has a lot more of the goofy charm the Yakuza series is known for, the first Judgment game (which is also very much worth a playthrough) took itself slightly more seriously than the rest of the series but this game goes back to and fully embraces the goofy, wackiness of the mainline Yakuza series.

Side content in this one is super fleshed out and has some of the best presentation in the entire series, this game doesnt really have minigames so much as entirely fleshed out game modes. Theres skateboard competitions, Biker gang races where the goal is to knock the opponents gang off their bikes, and entire Fight Night style boxing game mode that genuinely fun and has some depth to it and thats just the tip of the iceburg when it comes to fun side stuff.

I actually have to give this game my seal as favourite game in the Yakuza franchise, it has the same if not slightly higher level of presentation, writing, characters and story as the other best games in the franchise (Yakuza 0, Like a Dragon and Kiwami 2) but it beats those other entries out with its incredibly deep combat system and genuinely well presented and consistently fun side content.",1667620715,1667620715,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you don't now what an ""RGG game"" is, it's short for Ryu Ga Gotoku, the name of the main franchise (also known as Yakuza) as well as the studio that makes it, RGG Studios.

These games are beat em up action RPGs with (relatively) small, but extremely dense open world environments, and most famous for managing to use mostly the same maps over multiple games with lots of asset re-use, but still manage to feel fresh and fun each time, though an excellent gameplay loop, tons of minigames and ridiculous sidequests, and corny but still fun action stories.

[b]I love these games as essentially the videogame equivalent of comfort food.[/b] Some are better or worse than others, but you broadly know what you are getting and can expect a consistent baseline of quality in each one.

[b]If you are new to these games, I do NOT think Lost Judgement should be your first.[/b] If you want to start with the Judgement spinoff franchise please start with the first Judgement, if you want a broader intro to RGG games I recommend Yakuza 0 instead as the ideal game for potential new fans. Both are on Steam!

I played with all DLC enabled, but I'm not reviewing The Kaito Files here, I haven't played it yet.

With that said, the rest of this review will be written for people already familiar with RGG games but wondering how Lost Judgement shapes up. These are my thoughts.

[h1]THE GOOD STUFF[/h1]

[list]
[*][b]The combat in this game is a JOY.[/b] Base Judgement was a bit iffy in terms of combat, Lost Judgement has improved on it in every single way. Crane and Tiger style have had new features added to make both more appealing and interesting, and the new Snake style is one of THE most fun combat styles RGG have ever done. It adds a timed, omnidirectional parry to your blocking, it allows you to end combos with throws, adds several new throw variations, lets you inflict status effects... It's SUCH a fun way to fight. The EX Surrender moves are also some of the funniest Heat Actions in the entire series. For the first time, every fighting style feels like its own FULLY fleshed out, uniquely fun way to fight enemies. DLC owners also have the Boxer style to look forward to, which is like a better iteration on the old Rush style. It has a ton of defensive and offensive power behind it, but deliberately lacks versatility.

[*][b]I really liked the story, and I feel some aspects of it are better than anything RGG have done in the past.[/b] I love the new, more socially relevant direction RGG have been taking their stories in, and in particular the final antagonist of this game has become one of the most interesting characters they've ever made IMO. I believe that a lot of people will take this story in vastly different ways depending on their own life experience, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. [b]There are some people who get hung up on the ending, but IMO most of what they are saying is rooted in misunderstanding the plot. IF you have gotten the ending spoiled by people who don't like it, here's a quick context explanation that won't completely, absolutely, and utterly ruin the ride for you, but still AVOID if you don't already know the ending:[/b] [spoiler]In the end, Yagami lets the killer escape. He does NOT do this because he agrees with the killer, even though some of his ex-criminal friends actually do, but because he doesn't have serious evidence that would stick, the killer is going to be in absolutely no position to kill again in the future, and he knows there is corruption in the justice system that will have the killer executed in prison to hide the truth if he was ever arrested. Lost Judgement is a story about trying to do the right thing in a situation where there are only up, down and left things to choose from- You might end up disagreeing with Yagami's choice at the end of the game, but it doesn't make it a bad story[/spoiler]

[*][b]This is definitely a Yokohama game primarily, not a Kamurocho game.[/b] Kamurocho has the [i]usual[/i] activities but absolutely nothing beyond that. In fact, it's got less to do in it than base Judgement, because stuff like Dice & Cube or the Drone Racing League has moved out to Yokohama instead. Having two maps you travel between is definitely pretty cool!

[*][b]The various ""detective activities"" such as tailing, lockpicking, and observing have been refined, and minimised.[/b] Tailing, for example, got REALLY old fast in Judgement. In Lost Judgement, tailing feels more freeform, but is also MUCH less common and takes much less time, so you won't be bored out of your mind. Lockpicking has had thumb turn bypasses removed so you can be speedier on regular lockpicking. There are less Observation points in the story and there's now a hint function if you get stuck, but you can also go into Observation mode in the open world too, and there are actually some mini-puzzles to solve out there using it.

[*][b]There are new ""modes"" for detective work- Parkour, and stealth.[/b] These are both only for scripted story sequences- Kamurocho has not gone full Assassin's Creed. In my opinion, these aren't great. Parkour is harmless, but sadly doesn't add much to the game- I'd love it if it was usable in the open world for shortcuts or back alleys, but that isn't actually the case. Stealth is similar, it's [i]functional[/i] but adds nothing to the game as there really aren't multiple ways to approach situations with the highly limited level design.

[*][b]Even by RGG standards, this OST is a goddamn banger.[/b] Some of the best boss/combat themes in the series are in this game. A real highlight of the game.

[*][b]MORTAL WOUNDS ARE GONE![/b] The biggest issue with the original Judgement has been removed. Instead, you have Mortal Attacks, which are charged, highly telegraphed attacks enemies do that you can beat using a timed quickstep, then follow up with a Mortal Reversal that changes based on your equipped Style. It's a simple way to give enemies super attacks and let players respond in an interesting way.

[*][b]Minigames have been enhanced and expanded across the board.[/b] From simple things like Drone Racing being shorter 2 lap races instead of 3, to the massive School Stories sidequest chain that spans several different minigames, most completely new, and has its own campaign content related to it. RGG have pulled out all the stops to make up for Judgement not having karaoke, and have [i]mostly[/i] managed it.
[/list]

[h1]THE CONS[/h1]

[list]
[*][b]Much of the story won't work as well if you have not played the original Judgement.[/b] As per usual with RGG stories, info from previous games is not critically important to understand this one, and they avoid giving any serious spoilers for the first game, so this can be experienced standalone. However, there are a lot of characters that'll make you think ""who?"" you haven't played the first Judgement.

[*][b]The QTEs, while rare, have become a bit iffy now in terms of your inputs.[/b] You need to execute 3-4 different button inputs in a sequence, and boy, that's a BIT too much to ask players to do in a handful of seconds! They should go back to the regular old single inputs.

[*][b]Overall, I don't think Yagami is as good a protagonist as his predecessors.[/b] Unlike LiD's Ichiban, who is a very smartly composed character to become extremely likeable and endearing, Yagami feels like a remix of Kiryu without the eccentricities that made Kiryu likeable. He's not horrible but he feels unfortunately too much like a blank slate, sadly.
[/list]

[h1]TL:DR[/h1]

I recommend getting the first game ""Judgement"", making sure you are well immersed into the story / detective mindset. but keep in mind that this game isnt your transfer to the next game type like witcher. It is all up to you if you really want to pay 60$ +30$ for kaito's Side case. Take your time and be immersed before you rush things.


The Pros for both games, were the amazing Main story cases along with extra side cases so you wont get bored following a linear path along with fighting  street punks/ gang members / yakuza in the streets of Kamurocho and ijincho, also building relationships with specific girls you've helped.

For this game compared to the first was Impressive how RGG improved the Gameplay and the action combat style of fluidity, more ways to style on your enemies. Also added a side story thats really long but fun when running around in Ijincho. and revisiting certain scenes from the side cases in the first game

Overall i would recommend the first game if you really want to get immersed, and develop feelings for the characters, but if you are just there for gameplay and styling on enemies, it is technically up to you if you really want to pay 60$, its a 50 50 chance that it might be worth. But you can always wait for discounts if you are that patient.

Your camera constantly moves, automatically, and you cannot turn it off. The only way to prevent this is to hold down R, or L2. It is one of the most annoying things in a video game, when you cannot control your camera. If that doesn't bother you, buy both games and have fun. But for people like me who cannot stand the auto-controlled camera, don't get it.

Alright, a bit of an update since my review. I have been using a strip of duct tape to play properly, after rebinding the ""Reset Camera"" button.

The story and side cases were great, but I feel like both of them were better in the first game (in my opinion Judgment has the best story out of any video game/movie/series in history). 

Side cases had more variety in Judgment and were more unique, they were still great and enjoyable in LJ, I just wish they would have made something different than the Dastardly Detective substories.

Lost Judgment does suffer from a case of ""more of the same"" when it comes to comparisons to the series' last entry, but not in any sort of BAD way. It's the same dark detective mystery with brawler-action battles across the Yakuza/Like A Dragon staple cities of Kamurocho and Ijincho. The graphics and the gameplay have been tightened up making the game play and look better than the last - and never let it be said that there's any lack of content.

The main plot is compelling and sprawls the entire game, and the side-stories are numerous. I've played almost 60 hours myself so far and haven't actually *finished* the game.  The content here IS part of where Lost Judgement suffers somewhat. A large part of this game's story is a separate case surrounding cases of high school bullying around Ijincho, and nearly every single facet of that (8 in all) are tied up in a minigame or activity that is required to progress. This ends up taking what I felt to be *a lot* of time, and by the end of each one I was generally sick of whatever minigame I had been required to play to get through it. I dunno, maybe I'm just grumpy and old, but it felt like one great big distraction from the main plot. The payoff is... decent, but the journey is tedious.

I feel like if one ignores a lot of the side stories and secondary content, the game's runtime would be significantly shorter. Even if that was all there were to experience, though, the game would still be good enough to recommend, especially to fans of the Yakuza series.",1666205850,1667109255,True,0,0,0.4150523841381073,0,True,False,False

The ending feels more impactful.  The main theme of the game is bully and the story around it is well crafted. Much better combat than Judgement, got 2 more new styles and the flow of the combat is improved a lot. Most of the side quests are packed into the school stories and it's pretty good. Besides mini games, the open-world now has squire collecting, which is a very interesting puzzle activity that you can use the detective gadgets to solve (for unlocking skills and materials). The school stories has many mini games, some of them are very good and interesting ex: boxing, skating (oh yeah, there is a new way of traversing, skating. But it's a bit limited), racing,... Solving some side cases using keywords in Chatter is pretty fun as well.

Cons: While some of the mini games are great there is one that it's extremely boring and long. That's the robot club activity. There are 4 long quest lines in the school stories and the robot it's easily the worst one. The side quests outside of the school stories are a bit lacking and uninteresting. They somehow butchered some of the old mini games, the biggest one they butchered is the dating game: no chatting, the chatting now is collecting key words in the open-world and then watch an awkward, no sound, no dialogue animation. The quest lines for girlfriend are much shorter. The batting is harder, the darts feel like shit and it's my favorite mini game in Judgement, even if you aim properly and the power is correct, sometimes you'll still magically missed. Drone racing and VR feels the same, removing dice limit actually makes VR a bit better. There is also 1 mini game in VR but it's shitty and nobody plays it anyway.

Overall, it's still a very good game with a very good story, much more contents than the first one and definitely worth buying.",1666531566,1666531767,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

TECHNICAL:

I'm pretty sure the performance improved as I was playing the game by virtue of me buying the game on release and important patches being released within a few months while I was actively playing it. That being said the performance was fine but not good. You can obviously tell when a new area is being loaded because the game freezes for a couple seconds, and this was a thing until the very end of the game. Also, whenever you boot the game up, the first fight I would get into would have titanic frame drops. There were also a couple of crashes in the early and mid game but as said before this was probably because of things that were patched.

COMBAT:

The combat is way better than in Judgment. For one, Crane style has a reason to exist now due to various buffs and unique moves that Tiger doesn't have. Tiger was punched up a bit with some new moves, and a new style was added, Snake, which is throw and counter based, akin to how Tanimura would fight in Yakuza 4, except improved. Snake also has the bonus of having a set of ""instant-kill"" EX actions to compensate for its slower speed and middling damage output (compared to the other styles). This particular port comes with most (not all) DLC pre-packaged so you also get the Boxer style which I used maybe twice in the whole game.

Yagami can equip gear in this game, which is great. He still can't equip weapons or pick up guns, though, which is unfortunate. 

SIDE CONTENT/EXPLORING:

You get to go to Ijincho in this game. It's not significantly different than it was when it was first introduced. Same with Kamurocho. The new area is Seiryo High School, which is obviously not a city but a campus you can walk around.

The bulk of the side content is in the ""School Stories"" which are in Seiryo High. Unlike substories/side cases these have overarching plot lines and unique minigames akin to the side stories in Yakuza 5. They vary in depth and quality: the Robotics Club has a massive slate of parts you need to build and a bunch of robot battles, and the ESports Club is just you playing one of the arcade games against a weak AI.

Minigames mostly are the same. Kamuro of the Dead is now Hama of the Dead and is set in Ijincho, the Drone Race is easier, and Dice and Cube is now a race against an AI rival instead of you wandering around grabbing money until you run out of dice. 

The ""Celios"" in-universe franchise also returns after having been unseen since Yakuza 5. Aircelios is 90% not being able to see what is going on because enemies are indistinguishable for debris. Boxcelios and its spin-offs always were the arcade's weak points. 

OTHER GAMEPLAY:

There's some story stuff revolving around tailing, parkour, and stealth. Tailing has some mechanical changes but it is still very boring to follow someone around for a long time with nothing else happening. Parkour and stealth are new. Parkour is not particularly in depth and the sections don't last very long. I wouldn't call it bad but I wouldn't call it fun either. The stealth sections are very restrictive; you have to go to particular spots to hide and throw things in particular spots or else you can't progress. It lacks any degree of choice and feels more like pushing a cart down an aisle than playing a game.

PLOT:

Remarkably, this game does not have a lot of insane out-of-the-blue twists. It's quite grounded even when the conspiracy plot engines start revving up. The plot has school bullying as one of its themes, which is certainly closer to home for many than the majority of RGG games. It seems that Yakuza: Like a Dragon has started a sort of trend within the franchise of more directly discussing and centering around specific societal problems. 

Speaking of Yakuza: Like a Dragon, there is a major plot spoiler for that game within the first twenty minutes or so of this one, and mentioned several times after that twenty minute mark. It's an offhand remark but it reveals an integral twist. It's not avoidable, so if you want to dodge that spoiler you may have to hold off this game for a while. Some cameos and organizations also return from Yakuza: LAD but that's not a spoiler.",1666469541,1666469541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is unfortunate that we may never see another Judgement game in the future, this series is such a great place to really delve deep into real world issues with a compelling narrative and amazing gameplay.

[minor spoilers]
In my opinion, Judgement had a more compelling narrative, but the themes of bullying, flaws in the legal system, the ethics of bringing judgement yourself and corruption really makes Lost Judgement narrative exceptional in a deep and meaningful way.

The perspective of the key stakeholders were looked at and they made sense for each person which also reflects how people act in real life, even though they may seem unethical and wrong to do.

SPOILER ALERT

The game's major antagonist is a former school teacher who got fired after an incident of bullying in his class that led victim to attempted suicide. The teacher preserved video evidence of bullying (in which a bunch of pupils participated) and used it 8 years later to blackmail now adult pupils into massively abducting and murdering bullies over Japan (main case of the game is his 7th killing). Through the course of the game, many major characters voiced sympathy for him, and in the end of the game, the main character just lets the (unremorseful!) serial murderer go due to ""lack of evidence"".

This is totally beyond my comprehension. There was quite a lot of evidence to begin with, and even if there was not... I just can't accept how the serial murderer and his accomplices (e.g. parents of bullied kids who agreed to murdering bullies) are portrayed as... Kind of not so bad guys? And to think that many fans seem to agree with this notion of the serial killer being in the right.

One of the best RGG game set in the yakuza universe. The sequel to Judgment is just as entertaining and exciting as the first, but with much better improvements on the story and characterization. There are tons of optional side content to sink your teeth into, with the new addition of school stories which includes various minigames such as dancing, boxing, bike races, etc. The combat mechanics are pretty much the same from before or to any yakuza games (excluding Like a dragon), with the new addition of the snake style. The graphics are definitely at its best, and the sound/music makes you feel the essence of walking around the city of Kamurucho and Ijincho. Overall, this is definitely a great game which will give you hours of entertainment as you roam around and explore the city doing side stories, or trying to find the answer to the main story, which I think is the selling point of the game.

Yet, despite being, on a technical level, a more or less straight improvement on everything the previous game had, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel disinterested in most of its contents. Luckily, it‚Äôs still a very solid entry in the Like a Dragon series, at least mechanically. And it still has some good storytelling.

Just like its direct predecessor, Lost Judgement is an attempt to slightly tweak the Like a Dragon formula of beat ‚Äôem up action adventure in an open world into something that feels more like an investigation game. It‚Äôs still clearly divided into the adventure and action elements, fights can still be challenging and combat with randomly spawning groups of enemies on the streets continues to play a big part. But the adventure parts have more detective-y things than the typical Like a Dragon game. And Lost Judgment improves on basically every mechanic from the previous game, while additionally introducing some new ones. For better and for worse.

For example, detective Yagami still occasionally uses disguises and tails people, but tailing has been made far more freeform in the way it plays. I know some people disliked how the mechanic was overused in the original title, so the developers made it far more fun. Same goes for the chase sequences, how much more improved the sections of looking around in first person view are‚Ä¶ You also get plenty new gadgets to play with in addition to the drone and even a dog that can be used to track smells. Oh and now we get stealth sequences too, which sound like something that fits the game perfectly‚Ä¶ but mechanically they are some of the worst stealth segments I‚Äôve played in the past 15 years, like they‚Äôre from the early 00s PS2 era of bad stealth titles. 

And unfortunately, the mechanical improvements that I‚Äôve listed often feel pointless. There are barely any tailing tasks in the entire game, for example, despite the great improvements, but you still have skills you can unlock for this almost unused feature. The drone is now almost never used by Yagami himself, despite the fact that instead of introducing new gadgets (and a dog) it would‚Äôve made far more sense to put all of those features into the drone and make it more interesting and integral to your arsenal. The Chatter that you used to talk to people all the time in the previous game is now used for 4 contacts in total, only one of them writes you often and you never have any choices or abilities to contact anyone yourself‚Ä¶ You can now do the word filtering process yourself, though, which was just a cutscene thing in the previous game. And it‚Äôs an amazing concept, yet, more often than not it‚Äôs so automated it feels like it‚Äôs underutilized. Oh and disguises are still almost never needed and when they are, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you use.

In general, Lost Judgment follows the same trend as a lot of Like a Dragon sequels in that it tries to do more of everything. You have more fighting styles, more locations, more mini-games, more skills, more stuff to do‚Ä¶ And as it usually is with this approach, a lot of what made the previous game so great gets muddied and lost in the process. For example ‚Äì the fantastic concept of Friends and getting to help the community from the first game, something that had a meaningful and awesome payoff in the end, is now entirely gone. Which ends up making the cities you explore almost irrelevant as locations. Apart from the school, all locations around Isezaki Ijincho (returning from Yakuza: Like a Dragon) and even Kamurocho have no meaningful interactions, form no emotional connections for the player. They‚Äôre just places to go to for stuff to happen. It doesn‚Äôt help that Isezaki Ijincho is a pretty plain location in itself, but if you didn‚Äôt play Yakuza: Like a Dragon previously, you‚Äôll probably never remember anything about it apart from 3-4 landmark locations and even those barely. 

The school interactions are seemingly introduced to replace the whole emotional core of the side content, but they feel so disjointed and so completely unrelated to Yagami as a character, that it‚Äôs hard to understand what the developers were going for here. To the point, where most of Lost Judgement, as far as the storytelling, the mood, the characters and especially side content goes, feels like a collection of 5 separate game ideas that were combined into one game with Yagami filling in the role of many unrelated characters. And as a result not feeling like he belongs to most of the game. Even for the main story until the last third of the game apart from several key narrative beats, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre playing as a Main Character of a Video Game here to do what plot requires, not Yagami and his friends.

It does get better as far as the mood goes in the main story, but it still feels a bit too little, too late and somewhat bland at that. The topics that are brought up are impactful and there are good character moments and scenes. But again ‚Äì it feels like this would‚Äôve been better served as several unrelated games in Like a Dragon universe with separate focus and protagonists, rather than this one single title that ends up feeling shallow as a result. Because it cannot quite deliver on everything it opens up, while almost entirely losing all of the charm that the first game had.

The story DLC Kaito Files feels, in many ways, like a far better take on what original Judgment established and follows a simpler, but still surprising short story, where players get to play as Kaito. It does feel as a DLC, as it‚Äôs far simpler in many ways to the main game, but it has enough content of its own to feel really fun, it tweaks mechanics in ways that feel great. And in some aspects it even ‚Äúfixes‚Äù the problems that the main game created. 

Lost Judgment, despite being in many ways an improvement on the original game, is just so‚Ä¶ disappointing. And, as I mentioned, it ends up feeling shallow and lacking a lot of the charm that the original game had. It has great moments, it is somewhat easier to play and even friendlier to newcomers than the original. And Kaito Files is a really cool short story. But I cannot recommend it to anyone who is not absolutely in love with the series and/or the first game. And even there, I feel like you might be disappointed as I was, depending on what you expect from a Judgment game. Of course, getting the title just for a DLC is also a silly idea, it‚Äôs not really worth it, unless you want to play the main game too. So, I can only hope the series do continue, but next time the game focuses on what made the first Judgement charming, wholesome, investigative and memorable in the first place, instead of trying to turn it into a jack of all trades. Unless, of course, we get to play as a different character who would fit that archetype.",1666128843,1666128843,True,4,0,0.539556145668029785,0,True,False,False

I'll get straight to the point, i think this may be one of the top 3 RGG games period. One of the few games i have been supremely and fully invested and enraptured by. Stellar combat (miles better than Judgment, lemme tell you), in that you have so many options and tools as your disposal to demolish your enemies that you may end up wishing you had a training room to practice some combos on. One thing about the combat however, to balance out the positive, is Snake Style. The parry can make some fights become downright trivial, so i only used it sparingly. You can do the same if you wish to challenge yourself, but don't let me tell you how to play. 

When you don't wanna beat anybody up, rest assured there is a plethora of activities to sink some hours into. You can easily forget about the main story by getting caught up in the new School Stories. 9 whole sub-plots that have their own set of unique characters to get tangled up with. Some come with new minigames to try, such as the Dance Club rhythm game, the Biker Gang racing game, and the Robotics Club's tower defense(?) game. Some are less intricate, but they are all still very fun to look into. As is standard with Judgment games, you can wile away your time in arcades, Drone Racing, golf, the Batting Cages and so on. The usual suspects. That is not to say that they have become any less fun. 

There are some very minor gripes, such as Mafuyu (once again) not being a very important character at all, despite her history with Yagami, the kind of at-times clunky skateboarding controls, just to name a few, however those are very minor nitpicks that barely affect the overall quality of the game. 

All in all, if you haven't touched the Judgment series, you are doing yourself a disservice by not doing so. It is an amazing narrative that can even teach you some things if you're willing look into things a little deeper than what's on the surface. RGG Studios does it once more and knocks it well out of the park. Keep it up guys.

Even if you've played every other game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, I can't think of a single reason to recommend playing Lost Judgement first. These games are extremely story heavy and playing this first will give you a severely diminished experience, as context, relationships and callbacks will be totally lost on you.

That makes this review easy. Assuming you've played the original, this is more of that but even more refined. In gameplay terms at least I would say LJ along with Yakuza 0 is the pinnacle of the original style, real-time combat RGG games. The game is just extremely polished from a mechanical standpoint including its combat and vast array of minigames that range from throwaway to quite engaging (golf, gambling, arcades, VR, dating...you know the drill). You can even get about town on a skateboard, Deadly Premonition style, which makes town traversal a lot more fun. On top of that there's the usual boatload of side-quests, collectables and completionist objectives to dabble in (special mention to the School Stories side-quests which are great). The graphics are also very good, with nice models for the main characters and smooth animations. The towns themselves are fantastically detailed pieces of virtual tourism that get better with each instalment, I assume because the studio can focus on improving existing assets instead of creating new ones.

Ok, on to the game's bread and butter, the story. No spoilers here, the story takes places in your old stomping grounds of Kamurocho and, if you've played Like a Dragon, Isezaki Ijincho with a high school being one of the primary locations. Suffice to say LJ delivers an excellent detective mystery, with great writing and performances on par with the original in my opinion. Expect the usual lavish rendered cutscenes for the main story missions. One thing to be wary of; the story features some disturbing scenes and possibly upsetting subject matter (bullying, suicide).

The game took me about 55 hours to finish with a decent amount of optional content done but I would assume at least another potential 25 hours for full completion.

Overall, this is a fantastic entry in the RGG universe. Here's hoping SEGA can sort out their issues with the lead actor so we can get another sequel down the road!",1666021829,1666022178,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I like to think this game is like the Yakuza 5 of the Judgment games. It might not have 5 characters or 5 cities, but the sheer amount of fantastic content in this game packed on top of one of the best stories in across all the Ryu Ga Gotoku games makes me wholeheartedly say that this is the RGG's best game they've put out to date. I sung the praises of Judgment in my review of that, but Lost Judgment blows that out of the water somehow.

For starters, without any spoilers, the story. It's fantastic. If you liked Judgment you'll get more of the same in this. You have your usual detective work as Yagami Detective Agency working in tandem with Genda Law Office once more with another intricate plot that slowly gives you more pieces to the puzzle, finally letting you put it together in the end. At times it can feel like it's being too complex for the sake of dramatic effect, but it usually quickly pulled away from those moments by giving you a big piece of the puzzle after all that exposition.

The gameplay/combat is the best in the series bar none. The 3 (or 4 depending on your decisions) fighting styles complement each other so well. Although for reasons I won't say, snake was the clear-cut winner for me for a multitude of reasons. Having a skateboard to traverse around Ijincho and Kamurocho was a great addition, albeit kinda finicky with how you'd hop off it if you passed over a pedestrian area for more than a second. I do hope they'll keep it and open up more traversal options in future entries, like being able to do the parkour climbing freely instead of only in instances when it was required by the story/side missions.

As for the actual side content itself, that is where this game shines in ways the other games have failed to, or at least haven't done to this standard. As expected from the previous entry, Drone Races are still here and are more or less unchanged, but have a new set of maps for Ijincho. I was disappointed that I couldn't access the Kamurocho maps in this game, but that's a minor gripe at best. As for the rest of the content present in this game, you have a dance club (this game's karaoke like rhythm mode), A skateboard freestyle competition and races, motorcycle races, a very well fleshed out boxing mode (I think it's the best side content in any of the games so far), robot territory claiming battles, and of course all the returning city activities like darts, batting cages, shogi, blackjack and poker, the arcades, golf, and probably a few other one's I'm forgetting to mention.

In conclusion, play this game if you've ever mildly enjoyed a RGG game. And even if you haven't do yourself a favor and give this game an opportunity.  I truly think this is a 10/10 game, and I'll never get over the fact that this game didn't win game of the year for 2021",1665965679,1665965679,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

More of what you like, although the detective aspect seems to be less prevalent this time around.  Sure, you still tail people (which still sucks), go over evidence and such, but it's not nearly as often as it was in Judgement.  

Combat I'd have to say feels like it has improved.  It still has that classic Yakuza/Judgement feel, but this outing, Yagami feels like he packs more of a punch.  The addition of the Snake style really steals the show in my opinion and really feels like all you need honestly.  Crane and Tiger are still viable, but Snake seems to outclass them in every way.  The boxing style is ok, but It didn't bring a lot to the table other than really quick dodges and punches.  Effective? Sure.  Fun? Not really.  It gets old quickly, and you'll probably find yourself going back to Snake. 

The game is jam packed full of extra stuff to do as per usual.  Your favorite mini games are still there, with some new additions as well.  The school stories require you to partake in the mini games which aren't all that bad, but they get repetitive very quickly.  The robotics mini game  is really cool in concept and works OK, but if fleshed out a little bit more, it would have been way more enjoyable.  It quickly starts to feel like the school stories mini games feel like a chore to progress though which is a negative in my book.  However, you do end up learning some helpful skills from them.

The story is not one of the strongest outings from RGG.  Is it good? Not really.   It's not really bad either, though.  I'd say its about on par with Yakuza 3 or 4 as far as plot.  It isn't bad, but it doesn't stand out as special either.  

Familiar faces return which is always a welcome sight in these games.  While I don't mind Yagami, I don't find him to be nearly as interesting as a main character compared to the other characters we've been introduced to in the Yakuza universe.  He can hold his own in a fight, and has character development, but personally, I don't find him as likeable as Kaito.  

Speaking of Kaito, the DLC is pretty fun.  Again, not an amazing story, but it's decent enough.  There's 4 chapters to get though, and maybe adds an additional 6-8 hours of play time if you try to do all the extra stuff.  Kaito will bring you back to playing previous Yakuza titles, as he's essentially Kiryu with his brawler and beast styles.  Combat feels super fun as Kaito because you're once again a walking tank.  

Overall, I recommend.  If you're a fan of these games, you know what you're in for and you'll get your money's worth.  If you are on the fence, then wait for the sale.  I'm confident most people will enjoy the game, just don't expect it to be Yakuza 0 good.",1665878025,1665878025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The characters are the strongest the yakuza series has ever had, having my favourite character in any RGG Game (who I wont spoil) and just generally likeable new characters.

That being said the story can best be described as... confusing. It feels as though they tried to have this huge grand plot setup and it fell flat on his head, and the only thing reviving it are its amazing character writing and villains. not to mention the beggining chapters of the game are pretty boring and extremely slow paced that it made me feel like im playing yakuza 3 again.

Lost Judgment is RGG Studios at it's best, placing itself alongside Yakuza 0 and Yakuza 7 as one of the best games they've ever made.

From the great thought provoking elements of the story to the huge amount of fun side content. There's always something to do and you almost always enjoy doing it.

Having not beaten Lost Judgment on console so I could wait for it on PC, I'm very happy with my choice, as Lost Judgment improves on the gameplay presented in Judgment in almost every single way. 

Combat might be at its peak across the whole Yakuza/Like a Dragon/Judgment series, with four styles to choose from, fleshed out upgrades, and amazing animation it feels incredible. I've never looked out for fights as much in other games in the series like I do in Lost Judgment. You also spend a good amount of time early on beating up school kids (amazing). 

It's absolutely PACKED full with content, with most returning activities given extra polish and depth and a ton of new activities that are all fun and engaging. Side stories, clubs, school stories, mini games, you can even buy old Sega master system carts and play a variety of games in your office. 

Tons of quality of life features like the skateboard especially are very welcome. Alongside that, a lot of the stuff that received criticism from the first game for over staying their welcome like the Tailing missions are surprisingly improved and also a lot less frequent. 

The detective features in this game are much more fleshed out in comparison to Judgment. You can start investigation at any time even in the open world and in missions, and you have new tools including a sound amp, a noise detector, and a dog to carry out your detective work. 

Ijincho from Yakuza: Like a Dragon returns as the main city this time, however you have the ability to go back to Kamurocho at any time. Both of them are looking better than ever with updated lighting, effects, and density, making this the best looking game in the series bar none. 

Audio is great, with both quality English and Japanese voices. The soundtrack in this game is INSANE though, with some of the best music from the entire series. I've played every mainline game in the series to completion except for this one and this game's OST sets a high bar.

PC Port is great, but has some stability issues. Runs great and looks great but for some reason when I play the VR mini game, I've crashed 3 times alone just in that mode, and never crashed outside of that. There's also a weird black flickering only during night time that is rare but noticeable. Both can be easily patched soon I'm sure but just making it known.

The story is the only thing comparable in quality to the first Judgment game, which is a fairly solid bar to reach for. The first Judgment had a lot more moments that stand out as great set pieces with events unfolding through the entire game and constantly evolving until the very last second of the story even if it did have a lot of moments where it was taking a while to get going or it felt like they tried to pad out the story length. 

Lost Judgment's story on the other hand feels more emotionally intense. It grabs you from the get go and feels like the developers are making this game to say a lot of things that they truly feel strongly about, which is very refreshing to experience, even if the latter third of the game feels like it might run out of steam after all the secrets and plot points are revealed. I'd say it's very subjective as to which story is better, even if they are both great stories. But I prefer the faster pace, the character arcs, the themes, and the villains in Lost Judgment over the original myself. I wouldn't hold it against anyone for preferring the first though. 

I'm a humongous fan of the Yakuza/Like a Dragon/Judgment series, they're all great fun without an outright terrible entry to be found. However playing Lost Judgment makes the original Judgment look like a proof of concept demo in comparison, and even makes some of the other Yakuza games look like ancient relics.

Luckily, Sega got the green light to release both of the game. It was a dream to finally play the sequel on PC. I played the first one back on PS4 and it was an awesome experience. The fact that RGG risk in making a new IP to depart from the Yakuza series is just surprising. Turns out, the game was better than expected and I mean a lot better than the main series. This is just a spin off.

Lost Judgment is a direct sequel from the first game but tbh, I enjoyed the first game storyline than this one. Don't get me wrong, the storyline is good but the fact that Yagami keep mentioning 'Sawa Sensei' in every chapter is just tiring. Man could not get away for not mentioning every cutscene. Also, I can say this is the first game I feel kind of bad of the antagonist. The ending does put a smile of my face.

Personally, I enjoyed the side contents a lot than the main story. School stories, sub cases. The school stories are one fine as wine content in the game. You're having fun while investigating. I spend almost 50 hours in completing the whole story. It was worth it. Sub cases are also good and interesting like always.

Combat are too good. The best combat in any Yakuza games except 7 because that's turned based. It's smooth and satisfying. Mortal reversal are a great addition to the game. 

In conclusion, this is a worthy sequel and a must have for Yakuza fans out there. I gave a solid 8/10 for everything. Really hoping for a third game now.

The combat in both games is great, with obvious upgrades in Lost Judgement. However, I think you need to get used to the combat in both games. If you came from Yakuza games, then it'll come as second nature as the gameplay (prior to 7) is almost the same as this game.

Graphics is also great, in my eyes, with once again, upgrades in Lost Judgement. It runs nicely to me as well, with a R5 3600 and a RTX 2060 Super and RTX 3060Ti (because i upgraded along the way).

(((((POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT))))

tl;dr: I like the second one better because the theme is closer to my heart and the side stories is somewhat better story wise.

Now then, the reason why I write this review, particularly on Lost Judgement is because of the story. I really like both of the stories in Judgement and Lost Judgement. Both do tackle injustice. Without spoiling anything (I hope), [spoiler] Judgement covers theme about how fair can a system be in order to achieve something. Whereas Lost Judgement covers a lot about Bullying and what does it cost. In all honestly, the second one has managed to tucked my heart a lot, because the topic is very close to my heart as a victim of bullying. This could be something that people need to talk about more in society as bullying will actually do something not just to the victim (which is obvious), but also to the rest of society. The side story itself is also very good with an entire story spanning to 70-80% of the entire side story. It is, to me, very good as well. [/spoiler]


As for Kaito Files, it is an extra bit of story. Of course, it pales a bit if compared to the main game, but some of the twist and turns can actually make you feel ""Oh crap, really???"" in a good way.

So overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this game not just because it's absolutely fun, but also it is a very good story that could become a ""study case"" of what could happen.

School Stories are very hit and miss and some take a while to open up, and they overshadow side cases/substories as the main side arcs on offer. But on the other hand again, it's the best iteration of combat in the entire series so far. Unlike in Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, the different styles actually have some overlap which means they aren't completely disjointed. Tiger and Snake to respectively take on singular or clusters of enemies is a much better and more practical idea than two balanced, a light but weak and a strong but heavy style. LJ also actively rewards you for switching up styles during encounters, and with the increased style switch speed and new Snake style for counter-offensive plays it makes for good fast-paced fun. Unfortunately the style themes are ungodly bland even without the comparison to JE's, but the rest of the soundtrack is about on par.

The game takes place primarily in Ijincho and under the shadow of (Yakuza 7) [spoiler]the disbandment of the yakuza[/spoiler], which is unfortunate given the game was announced with the promise that Yakuza and Judgment would be parallel. Instead, LJ has to pick apart the pieces Yakuza left behind while Yokoyama grasps at the bottom of the barrel for any excuse to quell his separation anxiety for Kazuma Kiryu and actually have the guts to say to the world ""there was no way around him appearing in Yakuza 8. Honest."" RGGS shot themselves in the feet with the Ijincho map; it's a confused map that's comprised of samples of districts and offers nothing of value. It's so big and lifeless and I guess they felt the need to justify the time and effort that went into making it by reusing it and... not actually improving it. In LJ you get a skateboard for quicker traversal, which would be great if either map were actually designed around this. Instead it's only really viable in a few long stretches of road in Ijincho, [i]if[/i] Yagami doesn't decide to just get off the board whenever he feels like.

Speaking of maps, Kamurocho returns but like in Yakuza 7, it's really only a formality. So little actually takes place in Kamurocho in this game that it may as well have been gutted, with taxi fares from Ijincho just directly taking you to Genda Law Office, given that it's the one place in Kamurocho you visit the most. Without Don Quijote, and given that many of the elements unique to Judgment like Paradise VR and Iyama's hermit den suspiciously all migrate to Ijincho, Yagami Detective Agency may as well up and move there already. RGGS are trying to move forward while desperately clinging onto the past and the end result is a sad Kamurocho with relatively nothing to do, in back to back games.

The story is pretty interesting. It starts off very disjointed though, back and forth between sexual harassment and groping, and... high school bullying. Once it starts to tie itself together it does so nicely, and I lament all the pre-release reviews complaining about the perfectly fine handling of its sensitive content just [i]because[/i] they're sensitive topics. I recall the story being far messier, but in actuality it wasn't as bad as I remembered. It's still messy in places, but I still enjoyed it more than any main series Yakuza stories.

Overall, it does things better, and it does things worse compared to its predecessor. It's relatively a solid entry though (when are RGGS games not messy and rushed?) and one I also prefer to anything in the main series. It says a lot that Furuta can still write a good story even while running damage control for Yokoyama's main series stunts. If he had written LJ, the reason behind that video would be [spoiler]Mirror Face. And nobody wants that. Again.[/spoiler] As someone speaking out of love for Yakuza (believe it or not) but also with an ability to call out the low points of the series without any rose tints, it honestly baffles, and worries, me about RGGS' future output with him in charge.

There are a ton of similarities between the two games and that makes sense given that it's the same genre, studio, locations, etc. However, there are quite a few differences, and they're not always positive. So let's start with those.

Let me start by saying that in RGG games especially, connecting to the protagonist is important. In Like a Dragon you had Ichiban; a loveable goofball with a loud suit and a botched haircut that he eventually embraces (you can't change it in the game, ever). In other Yakuzas you had Kiryu; a stoic dreamer honor bound and allergic to smiling.

Yagami is somewhere in the middle. The boring, weird, stupid middle. He's a middle-aged man wearing teen idol fashion (skinny jeans, wallet chain) with a haircut that looks like a feathered bird's nest. His personality is bland and predictable; a generic good guy with few defining characteristics or interesting idiosyncrasies. I've never given less of a shit, basically. I don't care if he lives or dies, as long as I get my SP points so I can punch dudes harder. That's not a very immersive experience. I feel like I'm being forced to go on a really cool road trip with an excessively boring person going through a midlife crisis.

Now let's talk about one of the game's main features; the detection. Detecting? Detectiving? Anyways.

When you're ""investigating"" a scene you're just zoomed in a bit, and you move the cursor around until a button prompt and audio cue from Yagami (""oh!"" ""interesting!"" etc) occurs. You hit the button and you receive more information on that object. Eventually you get a notification that you've found all the things and the investigation is complete.

When speaking to someone, you can question them, and/or choose multiple prompts. Usually the player's choice doesn't matter; you just go through all of the options until the dialogue is exhausted. When it does matter, it still doesn't because choosing the wrong option whether presenting evidence or asking a question just leads to ""yeah maybe I shouldn't have chosen that"" and then you try again. No consequences. No branching dialogue. The game just mocks your decision a little and you try one of the other few options.

You also have a handful of gadgets. One is a long range listening device that you use exactly the same way you investigate a scene but now you're looking for a sound source instead of evidence. Another is a device that finds signals coming from things like electronic bugs so you follow a beeping sound and why am I still talking about this. You also slowly and tediously tail suspects, wait for the right shot with your camera, and do other things I also don't care to get into.

If anything, the detecting just cripples the fun. The world is explosive, combat is violent, and the activities are an ADHD wonderland (or nightmare). But when you throw in a ""walk behind this suspect for 10 minutes"" moment that happens quite often, it impedes the pacing and makes you want to just get it over with. When you're pixel hunting for a stupid hot spot or shambling through a parking lot listening for beeps it feels like someone ripped the controller out of your hand and replaced it with a book.

And that's the end of the negatives. The cosmetics are subjective, and yeah I can be picky about my protagonist so take that with a grain of salt. As someone that plays protagonists as an extension of themselves (versus the puppet master mentality) I can't even play games like Ni No Kuni because I can't play as a 13 year old boy voiced by a 33 year old woman. I tried. It was weird.

The detective stuff might bring you some immersion or maybe it was simply mandatory to include those mechanics to really drive home the whole ""I'm literally a detective"" thing, but I don't know why they couldn't just leave it to the writers to make you feel like one without mini games who were (spoiler alert) the real killer all along.

Moving on.

The combat is solid. It's polished, predictable Yakuza combat with beautifully garish visuals, absurd animations, and flawless sound design. There's enough diversity between combat styles, moves, and stat boosts to keep you chasing upgrades and experimenting in fights. There's an incremental reward system for doing specific things in a fight which can yield more skill points too, so mixing things up and making things weird is rewarded.

The graphics are the Dragon Engine so obviously they're gorgeous. Environments are detailed, the lighting makes the city feel real and alive, and character models are detailed down to sewing patterns in their clothing and/or a subtle blemish on their cheek. But more importantly than any of that you can actually DISABLE AA so the game looks crisp, unlike the extremely popular forced TAA turning sharp, vibrant experiences into vaseline smeared fever dreams. I'm looking at you, Cyberpunk. And Playstation ports. Like, basically all of them.

The writing is... something. Something pretty good, most of the time. I mean, I know there's a cultural divide here, and things literally get lost in translation but the game's tone and writing constantly fluctuates between melodramatic soap and cringe-comedy for kids. 

Sometimes swearing is done very well in games and it conveys a real emotion or emphasizes a point with elegance and tact. And sometimes it's just a bunch of bad words thrown together at random in rapid succession by an uncensored Speak & Spell in the hands of a 12 year old with a learning disability. Lost Judgement does that a lot. Like, a lot. Like too much.

The main murder case is engaging and interesting with some unexpected twists and turns depending on whether or not you knew Bruce Willis was dead the whole time in that one movie with a young Keenan Feldspar.  It's not groundbreaking, but it's pretty damn good.

Minigames and side activities including side stories (quests) are varied and mostly entertaining. Some are intentionally shallow and goofy while others have real depth and strategy. There's a VR board game, fully functional Sega Master System, Battle Bot simulator, Boxing, Drone Racing, and all the other things that already exist in most Yakuza games.

Aside from that, the game is absolutely a recommend from someone that beat Like a Dragon three times but I'm told it doesn't count if you're just bored and drunk so take it from someone that beat Like a Dragon just one time this game will scratch the itch if you're reading reviews because you need that Yakuza itch scratched. The combat and RPG elements alone will keep you addicted, but maybe you'll stick around for the story. And maybe, just maybe, you'll find the detective mechanics kinda cool just kidding seriously they're terrible.",1665433308,1665433932,True,1,0,0.446839034557342529,0,True,False,False

THE END OF THE REVIEW. BUY THE GAME.

Haha... So anyway lets actually begin the review, though thats the biggest thing you need, other than dont worry, trailing missions were mostly removed, and actually made insanely better. They only appear like twice in the main story. However, stealth has now taken its place, but it only shows up like 3 or 4 times so, good job Lost Judgment.

So, the biggest first thing to address are these new gimmicks, along with other things that made Judgment, Judgment.

1. Investigation no longer is annoying and sucks. What did they change? Nothing. They just made it enjoyable by making it much more intuitve, unlike in Judgment, where you would be rubbing up against every wall and sliding your camera around annoyingly trying to find out what clue you are looking for, Lost Judgment one, makes this not happen every damn mission, and is much rarer, and ALSO always has direction in what you are looking for, this was just way better game design in its direction.

2. Uncharted wall climb/parkour Yeah, Yakuza got it now. Welcome to Lost Judgment, its about what you expect but it can be slow when its not a swing or a wall run. I REALLY wish they did more with this.

3. Lockpicking and the silly key ring thing was removed, and the trailing was made good, no longer having boxes to snap to you naturally in a very Assassins creed type way get behind any surface. VERY GOOD. Plus, you can now blend into the environement when under suspicion.

4. Stealth. The new trailing missions of Judgment. They suck, seriously they are really dumb. Throw a coin to break away attention then stealth take down. OR THROW A SMOKE BOMB AT THEM. Problem being its super linear and basically forces you to throw it. It basically almost plays itself just you interact with it. Its SUPER BORING. though like I said, it happens like 3 or 4 times. It isnt plagued with it like traling was in Judgment. In fact, ALL THIS STUFF IS RARER IN LOST JUDGEMENT. VERY NICE!

Lets cover stances, where Judgment in a way revived the concept after long wait since before DRAGON ENGINE, (0, K1)
Now, we have them back, and 3 of them this time in Lost Judgment, as well as a 4th you can obtain called Boxer.

Snake, and Boxer are two new stances. Snake is a defensive, quick, grapple style thats block parries enemies. Its smooth as butter and my favorite stance in the entire series. Boxer, similar to Rush from K1 and 0, but no grab and its all boxer rules. Its over powered because when upgraded allows you to basically make the enemy die for even daring to try to hurt you, its dodges and counters are absolutely insane. These two stances are the best in the series honestly, with how powerful they are, they are VERY VERY FUN.
THIS IS PEAK COMBAT FOR THE YAKUZA SERIES, EVEN CRANE AND TIGER FEEL BETTER HERE.

The side missons are amazing, and not just the files you get in Judgment. Since the story has links to a highschool, you get a lot of interaction with school clubs and school mysteries now that Yagami works part time there. These are super good and some of the deepest side quests EVER in the series. Some argue to feel like they could be main game. Another think I love is that Judgment had the audacity to do forced filler, which Lost Judgment got rid of. Beautiful once more Lost Judgment. You also are given tools like a listening tool, and a detection tool to locate situations in the world, this grows into all kinds of secrets and side content, on top of all of them the best ""tool"" or goodest boy.

[b] THE DOG. THIS IS THE BEST YAKUZA GAME, BECAUSE YOU CAN WALK THE DOG. [/b]
Beyond the point of [b] DOG [/b] you can take him for walks, he will detect trouble afoot, and bring you to some more new mysteries. Its actually incredible how you seemingly investigate some side content, not just ""take a case"" or ""run into an event."" I LOOOOVE THIS CONCEPT! KEEP DOING THIS RYU GA GOTOKU ITS SOOO GOOD!

There is also a skate board you are given to travel around, its basically the first vehicle in the series, its super fun even if a little jank, and I found it great for moments of getting somewhere that would be much necessary for a taxi, or just zooming around faster or EVEN doing tricks which were fun. there are even coins to collect that are all around as you ride around that can be grabbed for rewards.

The only other thing I can pick at is that the skill tree still isn't as good as past games. Seriously, can we also please stop hiding EX's in the skill tree Ryu Ga Gotoku? It makes the game ooze less coolness when everyone will want to go for meta or abilities that make the game more fun, give more power, strategy, or abilities. Keep all of the EX moves open from the start.

This game is an ABSOLUTELY STELLAR GAME IN THE SERIES, MY GOD.

The only down side? Somewhat the story....
Its REALLY good, don't get me wrong, but it feels like it under delivered compared to Judgment a little. Ill never forget Judgments finally and all its segments to get there.
 (Especially the shit ton of annoying investigation, and trailing missions...)
Overall, Lost Judgment OOZES with perfection in every field, I still loved the story, even if it was a bit of a mess in my opinion, it undershot Judgment. 

9.7/10 - Lost Judgment, is my third favorite in the series. I have found it to grow to be special to me, its the best combat the series has ever had, its what Yakuza 6 wanted to be, with the quality of Yakuza 0. It is the master class dream, its only downside being a story that could have been better. Beyond this, the game is nearly in most departments the peak of the series, absolutely do not miss Lost Judgment. If you didn't like Judgment, try this game still. Judgment, you stick around for the story among the annoyances in design with good combat. For Lost Judgment, you stick around for it all. The best combat of the series, (beating K1 and 0 which I think is the peak.) Insanely deep side content, a lot of mini games, and things to do and experience, drone racing is even back on top of all this new stuff! School cases and clubs, the two cities, the 4 stances, vehicle... dog.... WOW. It may not be perfect, it may not be the best in every angle. Though, I believe the Lost Judgment, is nearly the greatest in every department, and in a good amount THE BEST.

DO NOT MISS LOST JUDGMENT, BUY THIS FRICKEN GAME! THERE IS THE FIRST DLC EVER ON TOP OF THIS YOU CAN PLAY A KAITO JUST GET THE GAME, PLAY AS KAITO, AND WALK TO DOG!

For one, the annoying Mortal Wounds from the first game have been removed and you can now perform a counter-attack (unique to each style) against Deadly Attacks called a Mortal Reversal, allowing Yagami to stay on the offensive with a well-timed quickstep. Crane and Tiger have been rebalanced to better compliment each other while the new Snake stance is a wet dream for those who love landing parries and grapples. The OP DLC-exclusive Boxer style combines power and evasion that will decimate bosses with a flurry of punches for those who prefer to literally throw hands. Neither style is objectively better than the other and the game encourages you to cycle through them frequently for their various movesets hence keeping the combat very dynamic and fluid.

The story is, at the very least, on par with Judgment's. Once again Yagami is investigating yet another murder but this time, there's a very heavy dose of bullying centered around it so a good majority of the game's content features the new Seiryo High. I will say, it is immensely cathartic taking down school bullies, especially as someone who was once a victim to it. Returning side characters have been given more screen time to flesh them out more as individuals, particularly Sugiura and Tsukumo, while the newer ones are given strong introductions to make them instantly memorable. Even if the gameplay isn't to your liking, at least you get a compelling Japanese crime-thriller to experience.

My only real complaints are some of the new school club minigames being somewhat wonky to play (looking at you Robo lab and Motorcycle club) and the mandatory scripted stealth segments. On Hard difficulty, enemies will be alerted near instantaneously and you must sit through a 5-10 second animation of Yagami being caught and knocked out with zero ways to escape--it's frustrating when this is the same guy who could walk into a club and comfortably take on a dozen street punks (this is thankfully fixed in the Kaito Files expansion).

As a PC port, Lost Judgment runs buttery smooth with very little technical issues on my end. It seems RGG Studio has progressively gotten better with each new release on Steam and I hope they maintain this level of quality.

To me, it's three things: the heart-wrenching story, the silly mini-games, and the general sense of hopefulness and goodness in humanity. This game has it all and even more.

Yakuza's main story has always have had serious tones, and this game is no different. The main theme of the game is bullying and how the law fails to protect and save the people it is designed to do so. You will feel despair, you will feel happiness, Yakuza games have never been shy from killing off both one-shot villains and characters that are important to the protagonist's growth.  [spoiler]At the end of chapter 7, there is a huge misdirection that will completely break you: you think Sawa will be killed since the villain has captured her, the villain literally tells you that Sawa is not important to them so she will be left alone, but no she will die by their hand when you find out in an extremely emotional scene. This scene hits me hard; I had to actually stopped playing for the remaining night, and when I picked up the game again, I just went into mini-games to kind of move on. It is a bit of a fridging in my opinion; her death's main purpose is to provide an ideal for the protagonist to cling on further into his story.[/spoiler]

Yakuza has always have had ""good endings"" for most of its side stories (you can also make the case that most main stories also have a good ending). This is what I mean by ""a general sense of hopefulness and goodness in humanity,"" in that the side stories make you feel good and hopeful, if not often laugh out loud at the silliness of it. I like a good story and if the story calls for a sad ending, I understand if that is the logical conclusion for that story, but at the end of the day we play games to escape reality, and isn't it better to escape into a reality that makes us feel happy?

The best thing this game did right are the School Stories: they have a satisfying conclusion that ties in all the individual steps made in-between, and they allow to live through that high-school experience one more time; for many folks, high school was the best time of their lives so I can see the appeal. I thought the advisor mechanism is a pretty smart story framing device in this respect.  [spoiler]In Judgment, there is a Friend system but it is extremely limited: your friends can help you in open-city combat if they happen to spawn nearby, but that's the extent of it. In Lost Judgment, you probably won't finish all the School Stories until you finish the main story (i.e. Premium Adventure, which is a downer), but the conclusion is a grand reunion of all the students you have met and changed their lives for the better, which makes all the efforts you've spent into the sub-stories pay off. And the conclusion falls into the ""good ending"" category that I mentioned earlier, so even a bigger plus![/spoiler]

Talking about finishing all sub-School Stories, the Robotics Club sub-story is extremely unbalanced; you will want a guide in order to finish it. Essentially, the strategy I went with was to ignore everything else and went straight for putting a block into opponent's home base. I got lucky with the final battle and finished it in only one try; for some of the previous battles, I had to try multiple times and got extremely angry when my own robots would block my path (I learnt to work around it), or when the opponents simply kept destroying my robot so I couldn't anything. Generally, when the game design takes the agency out of your hand due to RNG, it's not very fun.

The Boxing Club sub-story is a blast. It is challenging but not unbalanced (like the Robotics Club), and I don't think you can cheese this very much. There is no difficulty level in this sub-story, unlike the Dance Club sub-story that replaces the dancing mini-games Yakuza games are famous for. If you're not good with rhythm games, you will still be able to make progress.

I think the story has some issues though. It drags on a bit too long in some sections of the story. There end up being too many names of people you haven't met and other cases being involved that you never investigated being tied to the one you are investigating. It can get confusing who some of the characters are talking about sometimes. 

Far too many instances of talking about bullying being bad and that bystanders need to do something. I swear Yagami and Kuwana have this conversation like 30 times. 

Out of the ten games I have completed in the Yakuza series, If I was ranking this one on story alone. It would be the fifth best game. I think Judgment has a much better story than this one. 

If I was ranking the game on gameplay and content. It would rank either first or second. 

It is a very good fun game with a good story that has some issues in the writing.

They took whats great about the first game and improve them while taking out the not so great stuff (Looking at you mortal wounds). I personally found the story for LJ much more gripping and thought provoking compared to the first game. Dont get me wrong as I found both games' story fantastic, but while the first game's story is pretty black and white, LJ's story is much more gray and interesting. Compare the all their past games' story, LJ's story is probably the most thrilling and gray narrative they done so far.
I really love this game. The combat. The music (Unwavering Belief is one of the greatest final boss themes in gaming imo). The side activities (holy crap boxing is fun!). The side cases and the School Stories! And I still havent done the Kaito DLC yet as I want to do everything I can on premium adventure and replay the game on legend.

It has all the familiar elements of the previous game with a few changes here and there. Like the tailing missions for example. There are much lesser of them now and the mechanics themselves are more polished. Yagami also gets a brand new fighting style, the snake style, which is very fun to use. The two old styles have changes as well that make them more distinct. The detective part of the gameplay is also more fleshed out and is more engaging than in its predecessor. And thank god that annoying mortal wound feature is not in Lost Judgment.

However, some mechanics from Judgment that were removed here, like the shortcut paths, expanding inventory, certain abilities, etc. I feel should've been kept in. I keep finding myself trying to do something then remembering it's not possible in this one.

The story deals with a much heavier and much more real topic than the rest of the series, ie. school bullying and suicides. This works as a double edged blade because while the story is definitely more hard hitting, the typical Yakuza series nonsensical plot elements are still there and those are made more jarring by the more serious theme. However, it is still a very good story and it shouldn't be skipped.

On the other hand, the school stories side storyline could've been way better. I didn't get through it because it gets very repetitive, especially the robotics club. Fuck that one in particular.

I have done the Kaito Files campaign as well but I'll review that on the DLC page instead.

The only criticism I have is the main plot isn't as compelling as the first Judgment. Unlike the first, this one is more of a philosophical exploration of justice and its consequences. So it's toned down from the usual RGG thriller motif. The hand holding in this one was almost as bad as the first which I find to be mildly irritating. There's no room for allowing the mystery or story beats to settle on the player, everything is explained, re-explained, examined and explored in detail with chapter recaps as the cherry on top. Yagami is motivated in much the same way as Kiryu but motivated by the truth at all costs rather than a bushido morality. This becomes a fairly strange handicap for the story in Lost Judgment because more than once I found myself disagreeing with Yagami and not being persuaded by his arguments or actions. I think I enjoyed that aspect and it played well within the story even if it was a little strange but they tied it up neatly at the end. 

The highschool setting was great though and it had a lot of fun side activities to go along with it. Definitely much stronger being in Ijincho than Kamurocho like the first game. Although some things do play out in Kamurocho and having a 2nd city is a benefit to the story and gameplay. and thankfully, unlike some past titles in the Yakuza series, there's unique stuff in both cities so they didn't get lazy (or w/e the reason) like they did in Y7 (LAD) or Y6.

In my opinion they are better than the Yakuza games. The story and the characters are way more cooler and feel attached to them. Don't get me wrong, Yakuza games are awesome but they lack what Judgment games have.

I will talk now about Lost Judgment.
Lost Judgment is easily one of the best games I have ever played.
The game has a strong story, very deep. The developers chose a difficult theme and that's bullying and I say they did a great job. This game helps in bringing to light the many problems we encounter/hear regarding bullying and the bullies. A great story with a difficult theme, very well delivered.
The characters...well, you know them if you played Judgment. They are so cool, you get attached to them. Yagami and the team have this amazing chemistry, so cool. The new characters are cool as well, even though some of them...you want to punch them in the face yourself xD.
The soundtrack is beautiful, especially in the emotional scenes.
The gameplay is great but...it has a downside and that's the stealth sequences. It could have been done better. Some parts...I dunno, seemed really weird, they could have implemented better stealth mechanics but apart from that, the gameplay rocks.
Lost Judgment is an awesome and well deserved sequel to Judgment. I would dare to say that this one is a little bit better than the first one but it's just my opinion.

Second: I'm going to be using the Japanese names for the fighting styles in this review: Waltz is Crane, Flash is Tiger, and Flow is Snake.

Now with that out of the way, the actual review: It's about goddamn time. Lost Judgment is the best work RGG Studio has produced in a long time (and, given that Ichiban remains the main protagonist of Yakuza and Kiryu returning for Yakuza 8, that ""long time"" is starting to look an awful lot like ""ever"".) The music is top notch, likewise the fight choreography. The combat is the best in the studio's entire catalog. The writing is top-notch, bucking long-standing RGG trends that I'd always found insufferable. The minigames are fun with the high school they're linked to being about as fun as you can get a high school to be and an equally fun narrative surrounding its students. Lost Judgment is a complete package that's earned my 2021 GOTY spot and, thanks to both this Steam release and the Kaitou Files expansion releasing earlier this year, has very handily usurped Sifu and Midnight Fight Express for my 2022 GOTY. But... why? Why do I hold it in such high regard? Let's get into that!

First of all: Yagami. This isn't his first outing, but it is the first I've been able to join him on and I love the guy; his dynamic with his buddies (whether it's the original crew from Judge Eyes or newcomer Kyouko Amasawa) is wildly enjoyable. Whether he's cheering up a bullied child and encouraging her not to give up on her dreams or being repeatedly thrown for a loop by Amasawa's, well, loopiness, Yagami's interactions are always a blast. He has the ""Just Some Guy"" charm of Kiryu-era Yakuza bosses down pat. His fighting styles are all graceful and well-designed with additions like vaulting and wall-jumping to shake up the combat and his choreography benefits greatly from the fact that Yagami has to actually avoid and defend against attacks.

However, the biggest reason I like Yagami so much is that for once in their career, RGG Studio have managed to create a protagonist that isn't patently insufferable. Kazuma Kiryu [i]very[/i] quickly establishes himself as a sanctimonious hypocrite who prefers to run away from his problems until someone close to him gets hurt or killed and is wholly uninterested in committing to his platitudes about confronting the past and who he is, while Ichiban Kasuga is essentially the Japanese Wade Watts: a loser with no personality beyond ""lol video game references xD!"" who drags the entire game down into Satan's wine cellar and whose status as hero and protagonist is facilitated purely by the creators violating the narrative to jack him off at every opportunity.

Yagami, on the other hand, has [b]NONE OF THAT SHIT.[/b] His ideals are consistent and he has no qualms with committing to them; joined Seiryo High's Mystery Research Club as guidance counselor so he can investigate the main case freely? He will gladly see that job to completion. Strongly disagrees with the main villain on the nature of the law? He will just as lief throw hands for his ideals.

Likewise, while he's certainly more relaxed than Kiryu, he's not childish like Ichiban: He'll kill time at the arcade or on the Mega Drive he's got at his office, but when he's kidnapped and strapped to a chair the man with the chainsaw who's about to vivisect him doesn't abruptly transform into some lol so random xd enemy design with a terrible pun for a name. When one of his coworkers has their house besieged by gangsters, the building doesn't abruptly turn into a dungeon with turnbased enemy encounters because ""OMG DAE it's just like Dragon Quest!!!1!1!""

Next up, combat: With RGG Studio deciding that LAD's braindead ungabunga which number biggest ""combat"" is going to be the future of Yakuza, it's up to Lost Judgment to continue the tradition of beat 'em up combat that is very easy to learn and hard to master, and it does so with gusto. But, not content to simply reiterate on what Kiryu had or what Judge Eyes gave Yagami, Lost Judgment decides to take that combat and make it [i]more[/i] so. Both Yakuza and Judge Eyes have always had had light RPG and fighting game elements, but they've always been just that--light. Lost Judgment leans much more heavily on both by introducing status effects and allowing you to cancel attacks outside of super mode and the results are [i]delightful[/i]. Juggling enemies is incredibly satisfying, and status effects are balanced just right to spice up the gameplay while keeping it intrinsic.

Additionally, the fighting styles themselves are a blast: Waltz, your crowd-control style, is loaded with graceful kicks and sweeping multi-hit attacks that make it as effective against a single enemy as against a crowd. Flash, the dedicated ""strike first, strike hard, no mercy"" single-target style has elements of bajiquan and a hold-to-charge mechanic that succeeds at making you feel the oomph of the charged attacks, while also providing you with a potent counter in the form of the franchise's mainstay Tiger Drop. Flow, the new style introduced with LJ that focuses on defensive prowess and throwing enemies, has a parry mechanic and strong options against armed enemies, as well as drawing very heavy inspiration from Wing Chun.

Boss battles are also some of the best in the franchise because they're where everything comes together, backed by some stellar boss design; a recurring boss in the game has a number of the same options Yagami does, bringing his fights as close to Yakuza PvP as we're likely ever gonna get. However, there's also some other neat tricks: Mortal Reversals, and QTE design.

Judge Eyes' controversial Deadly Attacks return here, but they don't lock your health bar anymore and dodging out of the way and hitting 3 (B/Circle for you non-Tekken folks) at the right time performs a Mortal Reversal which does a massive amount of damage to the boss. On top of this, LJ breaks away from RGG's single-input QTE design to occasionally introduce multi-step QTEs often designed to evoke actions you can perform in gameplay that resemble what Yagami does if you succeed.

And then there's the writing. Lost Judgment has what I consider to be the best writing of any game RGG has released so far. With the Tojo and Omi disbanded as part of LAD's campaign to make its protagonist as special as possible, LJ doesn't have the benefit of established lore; it has to build everything from scratch and it does so [i]wonderfully.[/i] The game moves with surprising speed given how much work it has to do in comparison to its predecessors, and the antagonist factions it introduces leverage that atrocious decision excellently. The mystery in the game is legitimately compelling, and the game's climax is one of the best I've ever seen; it gets the ""TV legal thriller J-drama"" thing it's going for absolutely DOWN, and that makes it all the more badass when Yagami clinches a court case in the coolest manner imaginable. The high schoolers and their stories are all intriguing and do an excellent job of getting you [i]way[/i] more invested than you probably should be. The antagonists are absolute gigachads who break two of RGG's main molds: One is a genuinely morally gray antagonist who has just as much of a point as the protagonist and manages to break the pattern of RGG villains getting capped literally the second they show anything that vaguely looks like doubt and the other is an unapologetic villain who has zero interest in redemption and stays evil until the end--and, much like Lost Judgment as a whole, they are very much a breath of fresh air.

In conclusion: Absolutely buy this game. It's RGG's best work yet and its mere presence on Steam alongside Judge Eyes is a good sign that there's more Yagami in our future--and I'll drink to that. [i]Karii![/i]",1664513613,1664513613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main mystery is incredibly intriguing however, and the main side activity, the school stories, adds an extra layer of mystery, which works very well for this game  
Other than that, it's classic Yakuza, just in a grand scale  
Out of the realtime combat Yakuza games, this is easily the biggest, and is chock full of things to do all over the two towns of Kamurocho and Isezaki Ijincho (A criticism I made on the previous Judgment is that being limited to Kamurocho hampered the game, but this game counters that very well)  
The all new Seiryo High School increases this a bit further  
As of the time of writing this review, I haven't finished either story yet, but looking forward to finishing sometime soon  
  
Editing after completing main story, school stories, and 28/42 side quests:  
  
The main mystery was incredibly compelling and comes to a believable resolution, but once the core points of the mystery are solved, the main story falters.  
  
Yagami's obsession over [spoiler]BUT WHAT ABOUT SAWA-SENSEI?![/spoiler] turns him into a bona fide hypocrite who criticizes others for trying to invoke their own justice at the cost of others' sacrifices while he himself does the same thing. Ultimately, nothing is really settled, and Yagami's solution is to fall back on the very same broken system that caused everything to happen in the first place, with an assurance that he'll protect those who fall through the cracks, which is downright laughable.  
  
The school stories storyline is the other major story content in this game, and is something fresh in the context of RGG Studio games. This storyline tries to tread the fine line between the craziness of the side stories and the seriousness of the main story, and the results of this are rather mixed. The climax has an anime-ish SEISHUN! POWER OF FRIENDSHIP! type of feel to it, and I'm not sure if that really works. Still, the mystery of it all is very compelling, and made me want to see it through to the end, playing through all the minigames to get to it. Dancing, robotics, street racing, boxing, it all adds up to a massive amount of variety, giving you so much to do in the course of this storyline.  
  
Some of the minigames did feel boring, however, such as the Girls Bite minigame, and it felt like it had to be done too many times to get to the end of that particular questline. Still, it's a minor blemish, and you come across several rather colourful and entertaining characters through it all. It's a shame most of this story is unvoiced. Would've loved to hear Amasawa Kyoko talk a bit more.  
  
Oh, and I missed something important when I first wrote this review: TAILING MISSIONS. This was a huge annoyance in the first game, and luckily, the gameplay itself has been improved slightly, but more than anything, the number and frequency of tailing missions have been reduced drastically. If there was criticism about this from players back then by any chance, the devs clearly listened.  
  
In the end, Yakuza 7/LaD remains the best Yakuza/RGG Studio game to date in my mind.  
Lost Judgment does quite a few things right and is an overall improvement over Judgment and older Yakuza games in general, but the main story falters in the end, and the characters of 7 are more entertaining in general, giving 7 an edge over it",1664086554,1664351466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lost Judgment is the long-awaited sequel to Judgment, two games that I and probably many others thought would never see on Steam. But here they are and damn are they worth the wait. As good as Judgment is, it is a rough-around-the-edges mess with a good story and (in my opinion) an even better story hidden within in the form of School Stories. What do I mean by rough-around-the-edges? A lot of new 'features' from Judgment that makes the story borderline annoying to play through. Tailing missions have improved for the better in theory, allowing you to blend in at any time when your target looks back at you, and you can finally take cover anywhere. However, it is still tedious. Other new features include what I would call basic platform jumping and climbing segments, where you have a stamina meter. Oh, and the stealth missions, which I normally suck at and hate, but the game holds your hand a little too much, forcing you to take cover at certain areas and even where to throw distractions. All these half-baked ideas are mashed together and somehow... work? I can't really explain it, but every moment you have to do these is somehow understandable as to why and never feel like an uneccesary chore.

Combat is, well, like an RGG game that isn't Like a Dragon 7. And there are three battle styles (+1 through dlc) and each feel fantastic, with the kind of crunch you expect from an RGG game. Absolutely terrific.

As for the story, this is probably the best one I've played through. Despite an early warning that it would involve suicide and bullying, two things that went through my head in my teens, turning me off to the story  from the start, I was eventually drawn in to the intrigue and plot twists, and my favourite antagonist to date. Trust me, I won't spoil anything because the main story is great.

The best part however, is the School Stories, as you investigate shenanigans involving the high school in Ijincho. Each part unlocks different minigames, and events, as well as a well-written if a bit sappy story.

And now, the negatives, and none of them relate to the game itself.

- Denuvo. Just because I play games with that piece of anticonsumer garbage in them doesn't mean I like it. And I will ALWAYS call out SEGA as long as they continue putting this garbage in their games.

- DLC. Yes the master race gets all bar the Kaito Files with the base game, but it's still ridiculous that items that make minigames pathetically easy as well as locking THREE OF THE FOUR girlfriends behind a paywall for PS4/5 versions is insulting. And if you think PC's getting away with it remember that Ishin is coming out at the same time as consoles. It's coming.

- Price. Come on SEGA, no way both games should cost over $100 SGD. And making the Kaito Files 'free' when it definitely isn't worth forty bucks with the bundle is still stupid.

Still though, I absolutely recommend Lost Judgment. I enjoyed every minute of it and will continue to enjoy it a lot more.

Lost Judgement is a very dramatic take on the standard Yakuza series.  It tackles questions that may or may not hit home for a lot of people, very good social commentary.

Overall, the game is extremely fun, everything you do is going to be exciting.  I played on Hard, and I didn't have to restart too often (learning the combos is very fun, all 4 combat styles can either be exclusively used, or in classic DMC style, swapped between for buffs/juggling/etc).  The mini games are awesome.

A few complaints:

I've already posted on the Steam Bug forum about this, but the classic Sony games (fighting and racing) run at ridiculous speeds that makes you feel like you're going to have a seizure.  This may be on my end, as I have a 165hz monitor that I play on (tried to troubleshoot with graphics driver/borderless/etc), which segways into my next point...

Full Screen does not work for me, again, 165hz monitor.  The game is stuck on a black screen when focused on, and will actually show the game if I hover over the icon in the toolbar.  I digress.

There are a few other minor graphical bugs, but other than the above, you're going to have a good time.  Please support the release by purchasing the full copy, I wish for more Yakuza-like games for the PC.  :)",1663652693,1663652693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
2058190,122524001,76561198106335234,0,7,2416,0,990,1664803226,"So, I've played the majority of the Yakuza games, plus Judgement (which I finished recently). Judgement was really good in its story, but I got bored of the combat after awhile. What was there was good, but Yakuza lives and dies off its combat. Delighted to say that Lost Judgement has remedied this amazingly . The combat is amazing, a lot of moves, and different styles, the snake style being an instant favorite. SP gain is also vastly improved from Judgement, especially if you get the skills early on that increase the SP you get from fights, because let's face it, it's a yakuza game, you're gonna get attacked every ten feet. You might as well get good points from it. 

 Currently on chapter 5 and I'll keep the spoilers down.

The main plot is a murder case, because of course it is. Yet, I've honestly been more pre-occupied with the school activities. Yagami becomes an advisor for the various school clubs, starting with dancing. The good thing is that if you're not good at rhythm games, you can put it on extra easy and press one button. The other clubs are incredibly fun, you get to play battle bots with the robotics club, which it can seem difficult at first but you can win pretty easily. Then there's the boxing gym to channel your Hajime No Ippo fantasies. There's also a casino if you're more into good ol' gambling.

All of this and more while helping the Mystery Club, headed by a clever girl that nearly lands your ass in prison. It's great. Also, you get to beat the shit out of high school assholes, and honestly, that's good enough reason to get the game there. 

Besides that, you got your usual side-cases, there's a lot of cats too, so if you love cats, you're in for a treat. One of which sees the return of Ninja Ryan. You'll see quite a few familiar faces if you played Judgement, which honestly you should. You also get a skateboard, which can be a bit finnicky, but it makes getting around fun and fast.


The tailing and chase system are also improved, still one of the weaker parts of both games, but a lot better.

In conclusion, Lost Judgement improves on pretty much every aspect of the previous game in spades. I'm only thirteen hours in, so I have a lot more to go but I have no regrets whatsoever at paying full price of $65 USD for LJ. It's been a blast and if you're a fan of Yakuza or its spin offs, definitely buy this one, I don't think you'll be disappointed, even at full price.",1663649473,1663649473,True,3,0,0.535353541374206543,0,True,False,False

+Nice graphics... when it's realtime. From environments to character models. There are perks though...
+Sound's standard. Acceptable music, sound effects, and good acting
+Story is good. It's not groundbreaking, but once you start, you'll be hooked on it until it's over like a Japanese housewife on a weekday afternoon
+Gameplay's OK. Nothing groundbreaking here too, but one doesn't have to fix what ain't broke. 
+Playable content is huge. Playable area isn't, but the small areas are loaded with stuff to do.

-...I don't understand why at least a quarter of story scenes have to be prerendered on video when it's perfectly able to do so in realtime, such as the first courtroom scene, which was partially prerendered and a good chunk of it later in realtime. Devs used to do this when the specific scenes are too heavy to render in realtime, but that courtroom scene has no business at all being partially prerendered when the graphical load is the same. You better get used to these jarring transitions between prerendered 30fps cutscenes and realtime 60fps scenes, unless you're a pleb plays on 30fps for 'cinematic experience'

Gameplay wise, hands down, the best RGG game. Especially if you're not a big fan of turn based combat the main series will stick around with, they really polished Dragon Engine combat in this one compared to Kiwami 2 and Y6. Can't wait to see what they did with LAD: Gaiden. Also Yagami is such a likeable character + he's voiced by Nanba's VA in English and Nanba = best bro so that's +10 points.
Music is also godlike in this one, especially the final boss theme (and Snake style).

Now that they're finally on PC, the long-awaited dream of me suggesting this game to literally everyone has finally come. 

I have accumulated over 150+ hours on both Judgement(2 playthroughs) and Lost Judgement(4 playthroughs) on the PS5 in just 2 months of getting them, and now another playthrough of LJ on PC! I can never say this enough, but the gameplay and story of both games are simply fantastic. Not to mention the super stylish moves you can pull off(and of course juggling lol).

A few complaints I do have for the PC port are that pre-rendered cutscenes are locked at 30 FPS and playing anything above 60 FPS will make certain things janky/weird. An example of that would be the Snake Style parry. It works normally on 60 FPS, but starts being weird at 120 (however still playable). Another issue that has plagued other Dragon Engine games would be how charged finishers(Tiger Style and maybe Snake Style specifically for LJ) would freeze the character in place if played at an uncapped framerate. So if you're having that problem, I suggest limiting your framerate to 120. 

Those issues aside, amazing game and story-writing. All around lovable and very well-written characters. Would definitely recommend to everyone and especially to people who enjoy stylish brawler combat set in the RGG world.",1663255317,1663255317,True,36,0,0.7440451979637146,0,True,False,False

[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]


Detective Takayuki Yagami is back in the gripping sequel to Judgment. Lost Judgment drops you into another gripping tale from the developers behind Yakuza. After a police officer mentions the murder of a student teacher who bullied his son to suicide, Yagami must go undercover as a high school club advisor to uncover the truth behind the vicious cycle of bullying and the worrying increase in victims. Now with 3 fighting styles and the ability to join the Dance Club, it is up to you to end this horrible repeat of events.


[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]


Lost Judgment runs around the same as its predecessor, being able to hit 40 FPS 95% of the time with drops occurring when loading in the environment quickly. It feels really smooth most of the time though and looks fantastic on the screen. The temps generally stay below 70c and can get around 3 - 3.5 hours of battery life thanks to a mix of medium/low settings, FSR 2.0, and a TDP set to 8.

The one big difference with Lost Judgment is the FSR 2.0 blur is a bit more noticeable. It wasn't enough to deter my enjoyment of the game, but it was something to note. In some scenes, when you were far away from a person in a cutscene, the face looked a little bit blurry. But the worst was pausing when a cutscene was going and every person who was moving would look smudged. Unpausing immediately returned everything to normal though.

Even with all of this, I genuinely am enjoying the experience so far. The 40 FPS sacrifices are completely worth it thanks to how smooth the game feels. I will be testing out a new build to counteract the blurring, though it will eat more battery, and try implementing FSR 2.1 files to see if they help. The settings/build we used are on our website below!

But first things first, thank you SEGA for casting whatever black magic to convince the certain agency that held this game and Judgment from appearing in PC.

How's the game?
If you don't really like Yakuza 6/Kiwami 2 (which i am not a big fan of) combat, this game IMPROVES upon that combat a lot, as they added more fighting style in the game. In previous game, there's two combat styles, which is Tiger and Crane, both are different but unfortunately Tiger have a move that is pretty broken. But now in this game, both Tiger and Crane are pretty balanced, as they both even gained more options, also there are 2 new fighting style for this entry, a snake that have major focus on countering, and boxing which personally i haven't use a lot but from what i've seen, it is pretty broken as you can easily juggle some enemies with it. (and its originally a DLC style)

Graphic wise, its Dragon Engine. The quality of Yakuza games honestly can be a hit or miss (like K2 green filter is very questionable) and personally? Lost Judgment is a hit for me.

For content, this game is VERY PACKED with it. A lot of mini games and the school stories stuff, combined with side cases. Not to mention that you not only visit Kamurocho, you also get to Yokohama (as majority of game takes place there)

As for story, some people actually prefer the previous entry more, but for me, I think that I prefered this plot more as I found the premise of the plot pretty grounded, and relatable.

Also do i need to say somehting about the music? Well it's still a banger. Like give some of the soundtrack a listen, you'll know why. It just still have that quality that the main Yakuza/Like a Dragon games have.

This game was my GOTY in 2021. And I think it will be my GOTY for this year as well (sorry Elden Ring. You're still a great game)

I think the gameplay, combat, and side content in this game tops all of the other games in the franchise. It improves on everything in the first Judgment, and while there are a few things that can be argued that the first Judgment does better (Side Cases and Friend Mechanic imo,) I still think this game is an all time classic that should be experienced.

I made a 36 minute YouTube review if you would like a super in depth and spoiler free look at Lost Judgment and everything it has to offer. If not, then my TL;DR is that this game is a 10/10 masterpiece and I recommend it wholeheartedly.
