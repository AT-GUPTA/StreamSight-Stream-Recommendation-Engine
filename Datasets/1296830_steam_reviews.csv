""Warm Snow"" does have a lot of similarities with ""Hades""...and that is a compliment.

In comparison to ""Hades"", this game is only weaker when it comes to storytelling, but I think partially fault for that is translation.
Everything else is on par with ""Hades""...and in some aspects might even exceeds it.

Visual aspect of the game is lovely.
Game mechanics by itself is also simple - melee attack, ranged attack (flying swords) and it's recall (that can trigger a special skill) and ulti attack.

But here is a HUGE twist - melee weapons come in various quality (from common to mythic) and they can also have passive bonuses. You can equip up to four relics (and depending on which position you put them, they can trigger various bonuses and ultimate attacks) that also come in various quality. And you also have perks/traits that you can gain through gameplay (you can choose 1 out 3 offered). This opens almost unlimited possibilities on builds and the most fun aspect is that they can be quite unpredictable (in a good way).
Plus, every time you die, you gain skills points for upgrading three skill trees. Collecting artifacts can unlock permanent bonuses. You can also upgrading your swords in terms of quality and bonuses. And game also offers some additional game modes.

And it will be a challenging game, especially last two levels.

Well, this game has gameplay that's like Hades but it is still different enough to be its own game. I do recommend it and while the lore is nowhere near in-your-face as Hades - especially as the main character is the only one capable of realizing he died -> there is quite a bit of lore going around. Collecting the lore is the gateway to alternative endings and stuff too; there are some non-random specific things you can break -> which drops lore so that's a thing too.

Flying Swords are like casting; relics are like ability boons; skill books are like passive boons; Weapons are ""Excaliburs"" and there are only swords and one attack pattern for the most part; dashing is the same; and ""sheathe"" is a dedicated skill that varies. And you can fall down for a few seconds in some situations, usually getting hit, and like Monster Hunter fashion, you're invincible until you get up. 
Also, there are ""Sects"" which is the closest thing to selecting a weapon in Hades. More on them later.
Fun fact: There are BUILDS you can make based on falling down. They're pretty good. lol


The biggest problem in this game is the inconsistent translations leading to silly things. For example, there's an achievement that tells you to ""get both ""Indomitable"" and ""Hurricane"" skills at the same time"" - but in-game, the names of the skills are ""Immovable"" and ""Galestorm."" You can still get the achievement just fine, but know that this extends to the wiki too. This leads to the next problem about this game: information about it is kinda scarce. The wiki has no info on the second DLC and suffers from the inconsistent translation mentioned. 

On the topic of the DLCs, the first one is free and introduces new stuff to play through with new mechanics that adds depths while making you monstrously strong. The second DLC, the one you pay for, does the same but adds more. I do recommend them as they also alter the base game too. 



So, what's good about the game? Well, it plays and handles well and has a decent amount of variety going for it. It's got nice music, a variety of enemies that you can learn to recognize and avoid all their attacks. It's got quite a lot of bosses and minibosses as well as harder difficulties that update boss patterns to make things more interesting - as well as make other things harder in other ways. It's not just number inflation against you.

Generally, you have your weapon and your flying swords behind you. ""Excaliburs"" can completely change up how the run is going to go. Along side them, you get Relics which are similar to boons in Hades but a major difference: you can swap them around as you please, including dropping them and refining them to boost your stats (mainly: max HP and damage). Then there are ""Skills"" which can serve as minor little buffs (like, +5% Damage) and go all the way to major game-changing skills - which is usually relevant to your sect.

Oh yeah, there are a whole bunch of ""sects"" represented by statues -> and you pick one before you get started. Each sect has two styles and some of these are fairly similar but some are completely different. The first sect you start out with is a basic one where you use both your weapon and flying swords without much in the ways of gimmicks. This might sound basic or weak but it is one of the most powerful sects because the lack of gimmicks means one thing: you get stronger by just doing bigger damage. The two weakest sects, in my opinion, are the thunder and ice sects (the fire sect is a bit stronger than them) because you don't start doing bigger damage but instead you do stuff which eventually results in big damage. The early game is a pain for almost all sects but for these two, even the mid-game is a pain for some sects, unless you get lucky.
The thunder sect is more powerful than the ice sect. One style in the thunder sect has end-game where you just dash all the time and killing everything which is crazy fun. 

On a cooldown, you have the ability to ""Sheathe."" You can reduce the cooldown as your progress to a maximum of 90% reduction (so, most sects will have around 3 seconds total when you max that out). Sheathing is one of the biggest differences between sects as well as styles between the same sect.
For example: the sect with the biggest variation is perhaps my favorite: the Shadow-Walker sect. You lose your flying swords for both styles of this sect but when you sheathe, you summon a flickering shadow that helps you if you pass through it with your ability. 
One style gives you the ability to parry attacks and upon a successful parry, you get some lovely invincibility times and enter ""Sheathed"" state - where your next attack will be a powerful dashing attack that deals major damage. 
If you sheathe, you enter this state without needing to parry - and if you grab a specific skill -> doing this attack through the aforementioned flickering shadow -> puts you right back into ""Sheathed"" state. Grab yet another skill and this will also respawn the Flickering Shadow -> meaning you can do it infinitely. End-game here is just hilarious invincibility time while you dash around killing all enemies all the while you make sure you go through the flickering shadow. Dropped it? Sheathe again. Here we go again.
Meanwhile the other style does not have a Parry. Instead, you have a dash attack that deals large damage to enemies along the path and around the area you stop. You start with just 2 dashes that come back after some time and Sheathing gives you a ""greater dash"" (that isn't effected by the limit of 2) if you go through the flickering shadow -> and the end game is constantly using ""greater dash"" through the flickering shadow infinitely, killing all enemies. It is the easier of the two and more flexible, but no invincibility. 

The closest thing to easy mode are the two sects: ""Infinite Arhat"" and the (paid) DLC's ""Soul Blade Shura.""
Infinite Arhat one has a style called ""Sunburst"" replaces your flying swords with just one that you charge and fire. With proper timing, you fire a ""Sun Piercer"" that travels far, pierces through enemies and deals a lot of damage. This allows you effectively kill all enemies before you see any of them. (note: I use controller so unless I'm manually aiming, my flying swords auto-aim at enemies). The sheathe is 5 seconds of guaranteed Sun Piercers, so you can mash to win and by mid-game, you'll have enough sheathe cooldown to have it permanently.
Soul Blade Shura has a style called ""Myriad."" To simplify it: you sheathe and then you hold down the button for flying swords as you dash through the area. Once you kill all enemies, wait for the cooldown and repeat. Once your sheathe cooldown is low enough, you'll be holding down the buttons for both sheathe and flying sword at the same time as you dash through the game. Forget timing or mashing, just hold them down and keep running.

What about an example for Excaliburs? Well, Sunburst has one called ""Fallen Sun"" that causes an explosion on a successful Sun Piercer. The explosion hits the enemy and the ones around it for 70% of the damage of Sun Piercer itself. If you hit 3 enemies, that's 3 explosions so each enemy gets hit four times. 
Furthermore, If you have the highest quality (Mythic) Excalibur, then you get a bonus effect. Fallen Sun's bonus effect is to double the damage of the explosion and increase the size of the explosion by 50%. As I said, easy mode. 
There are sect-specific Excaliburs -> and then there are generic ones. Some generic ones work with specific relics and others work with specific skills. 

I didn't even touch on a lot of things, such as unlocks as you progress and the lore. Oh well. In conclusion, I do recommend this game and it's DLC. If you think what I typed up here sounded like fun, give it a go. Have fun.",1707333995,1707333995,True,36,0,0.798902511596679688,0,True,False,False

So unbalanced that it feels like the only two upgrades in the game are ""does nothing"" and ""you win"".  You either get an OP upgrade and easily blow through the game, or just get a bunch of nothing and lose. I died to the first boss 4 times then I got a few overpowered upgrades and leisurely walked through the entire game. Quickly beat every boss with no trouble at all, first try, with basically no meta upgrades.
First boss insta-kill mechanic is no fun. Makes it so certain upgrades/builds are not viable. 
The game plays pretty well, looks good, and could be a lot of fun if they tweak the balance a bit. The big problem with OP stuff is that it's not fun, you just mash all the buttons and annihilate everything. So I imagine grinding to unlock all the meta upgrades will just be a chore. Instead of being excited to try new stuff and keep playing, it all just doesn't matter. 
Would recommend it if they balanced the upgrades and removed insta-kill. All they need to do is make it so the useless upgrades actually do something, then it would feel better and be more fun instead of just hoping for good luck with RNG to get the good stuff or retrying because the game decided ""not this run"".

So picture this, you are realy enjoying this ""hades-like"" you found, beat it pretty fast and going through the new diffculties , see that the HP of the enemies is significantly more but ok, there are some broken build as well.
Reach the second to last difficulty, try a build you knew was busted, hack and slash through the run, 30 min in you're on the last boss, make a mistake reducing your damage output, start the fight you're dealing little damage because of your mistake but it is pretty managable.
Boss reach its second phase, start doing that annoying thing where it goes to the middle of the arena (didn't know it was a instakill because never got hit by it), you dodge it pretty easily 3 times in this fight alone because you just have to walk to the edge (you'd guess by the other 30 times you dodged it), the fourth time for some reason you are super extra slow to escape from the center, didn't escape, character kneels. get killed with two extra gourds (potions), has extra life, see defeat screen nonetheless

They've cleaned up a lot of the translation/localization, so it's easier to make sense of things. This did involve some changes to names, but no mechanics actually changed regarding that. This is now much more accessible to an English speaking audience. Also, some balance changes happened, and there's new Statues/Paths to play with, along with relics and weapons. Still a recommend from me. Enjoy!

This game is a lot more engaging than I expected, though before you have any unlocks in the beginning it can be a bit tough--particularly the DLC, since it uses the same permanent upgrades as the main game on top of its own. An inverse bonus is that the DLC can potentially unlock the Blood Soul(?) currency for upgrades at a faster/quicker pace.

I find the art style to be pretty good. Specifically, they really fill out the detail on a lot of stuff in environments, characters, enemies, or the visuals in general.

The only *real* drawback to this game is that the translation/localization is really bad a lot of the time. Sometimes the UI is uncooperative, particularly when doing the DLC and it not allowing you to hover over and check your current textbook buffs. However, some of the skills, debuffs/buffs, and abilities aren't conveyed very well until you actually start playing them. The Supreme Bodhi is a good example, as the translated explanation for No Trace was very confusing until I did a run and experimented with it. Others are how mechanics work, and in some cases there's a lack of explanation. I didn't know you could start with a relic until after I beat the third difficulty and had unlocked quite a bit of stuff already, and further after that I didn't know about recycling extra powers for an attack or HP bonus. I don't really want to fault the game for this, since it's not a native English game. It just means you're going to have to work some things out on your own with experimenting and playing... or read some information online. A lot of the 'older' base content explains things well enough, even the lore, though you'll find a lot of typos and grammatical errors.

There's a big emphasis on choice in builds. The general idea is that your endgame will have you pretty OP once you have a lot of things unlocked, and the higher difficulties are definitely challenging. The DLC is a bit crazier, since some of the bosses are straight up much harder than the main game, and pushing that to finish does require a more cohesive build. I'd say the top difficulties in the main game end up harder, though, since you can't accelerate builds as quickly.

Adding to the above, there's different playstyles between the statues to worship. Most of them have a Melee/Ranged (Flying Sword) option that will focus on a different aspect of your damage. Some will allow you to forgo Melee or Ranged altogether, and Supreme Bodhi is melee focused, but it's a high damage/precision melee that is intended to be less intense and spammy as the others can get. One is built around Poison/Toxin and DoTs. A nice touch is that you can hold down the attack to spam your melee attack. That might seem lazy, but you can get to some absolutely insane attack speed levels that will be impossible to manage with spam clicking. With the Lightning statue I can straight up dip my framerate in the DLC's later stages with a bunch of trigger and lightning effects during Sheathe on a room full of enemies.

As far as performance and bugs go: Overall, I didn't really experience many bugs, and no framerate issues except the above hyper-niche scenario. The only one is the aforementioned DLC issue where I can't check my text upgrades for some reason. Charge enemies, and the ""Fish Tail"" (high difficulties) that has following ground attacks chain-stunning you off the ground is pretty obnoxious. Sometimes it's hard to spot the suicide stun bots, too, though I can't blame those for ever actually getting me killed. You can play around all of this with a little practice.

Overall, I quite like this game, and recommend if you're into the genre. Like I said: Translation/localization in English is really bad, but other than that I found it to be a good experience overall. The visuals are nice, and generally clean to discern until you get a giga late game build. The bosses are actually wicked, and I was surprised how challenging some could be, and how cool some are. I do dislike Fate Tower, since the Library stages are lacking in detail and variety, often getting the same room format and enemy spawns twice in a row in some runs. Fate Tower's final boss can also drag a bit due to her phase two being time based, rather than exclusively health based. (It speeds up considerably if you run the challenge that causes you to bleed out in combat over time.)

This is Chinese Hades no doubts, so it'll be more approachable to Eastern fans.
Very strong rogue-like elements, lots of available builds, swords, skills, upgrades. The graphics is really good especially for this type of game. Story is somewhat meh, not that much explaining and not that deep, but who cares? The replay value is stupidly high, the only game I kept playing daily.
It plays really well on the Steam Deck and highly recommend over PC.

I am not sure if it is good or bad, but sometimes, if you are lucky, the build could be insanely strong and kill every boss in seconds. The gameplay is straightforward. You have dash, melee, and ""flying swords,"" which basically range attack; different weapons, different relics, different ""cards"" with modifications. 
Beautiful graphics, scenes, and voice lines were done well (Chinese). English localization is excellent; I have no complaints at all. 
Enemies have different patterns of attacks, strategies, and so on. I was surprised that they even go further in DLC, with new types of enemies there.

I stumbled over this game on the shop and when I saw it had a demo, I downloaded it and played - and I think about 20 minutes later, I bought the full version, because I couldn't stop. I am usually not very competitive or much of completionist either, but this game really has me strive to complete everything and every difficulty.

The available sects are varied and offer plenty of alternative play styles and you'll come to love some more than others. The RNG and variety of the upgrades/skills you find during your runs allows for some meh runs but also to some ridiculously powerful ones if you're lucky.

The translation is overall fine, though could use a little polishing and it would be nice to have a menu where we could review all the different skills and effects, instead of the incomplete one we have right now.

I think my only gripe right now, is that the Poison sect actually causes self-damage enough to actually get me killed in missions (and there are still 2 or 3 I have to unlock) - but maybe the poison one is just me not planning accordingly.

Anyway, what I criticize are minor things that don't really distract from the overall enjoyment. The game is very much worth its money and I haven't even touched the DLCs much.",1702661914,1702661914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game ở thời điểm early khá ổn cũng như không có tương tác nhiều về mặt vũ khí + skill + cơ chế boss nên nói chung phù hợp theo dạng Rogue-lite hơn là Rogue-like

Về sau thì chỉ cần spam bài kèm combo ổn là đủ. thậm chí đôi khi có những chỉ số stats bị lạm dụng quá đà trong game + skill thiên hướng passive hơn nên có thể nói là khá dễ cũng như nhàm chán hơn dự định nếu như mọi người chưa pass tới chế độ cuối của game

riêng về DLC thì mình chỉ cảm nhận được ba điểm
+ Thêm class mới cũng như tinh chỉnh item ( mặc dù chưa phù hợp )
+ Cốt truyện cũng như có thêm chút tính liên kết giữa các item
+ Sửa lỗi cơ bản cũng như chỉnh sửa tối ưu game thêm

- Class dù có thêm mới nhưng tính cân bằng cũng như giá trị chơi lại thì khá là half - half
- Tiếng Anh trong game dù nói là dịch sát nghĩa ( item + lore ) nhưng thật sự cũng rất bruh 
- Hệ thống trong bảng nâng cấp mới của game ban đầu khá hay nhưng về sau thì.. meh 50/50

Nói chung là 105 giờ chơi để hoàn thành cũng như là đạt được một số thành tựu khó thì cũng xứng đáng.
Hi vọng developer có thể ra mắt phần 2 cũng như sửa được và đem lại thêm một trải nghiệm mới

It's innovative use of inventory management perfectly balances itself between items, weapons, and passives buffs in a way that feels satisfying both aiming for certain builds or experimenting to see what works. Difficulty modifiers that utilize risk/reward in every step to bring harsh challenges without merely weakening the player to uselessness. The playable classes, or sects as they are called, are all wildly different with their own focuses through unique buffs and what synergies they optimize or even have access to. Seriously, I could write a thousand words on just what each sect excels at and combos with if I thought anyone would read it. The story isn't top dollar, but for a roguelite it's existence at all is something to celebrate. Honestly my only real complaint is that I think there's too many items that focus on defense, in a game where raw strength and massive number clouds is more rewarding than anything else. However, this is thankfully mostly negated with an item-ban system! After getting deep into the game (which is perfectly held off to force new players to experiment and try out all the items before access is readily granted) you can remove them from the pool.

Before each run you choose a Dharmic deity to commit to which represent a element, and from there you can choose one of two abilities. You unlock new deities by defeating bosses.

You only have one weapon. A sword in one hand and a bunch of flying swords as your ranged weapon.

You can get new swords that change stats and compliment other things you have. But the main butter of the builds is the relics and scrolls which give you passive stat buffs, like buffing you abilities, atk dmg, health etc and also active buffs such as enhancing your dodge and attack abilities.

You also unlock new relics and scrolls by beating more runs and collecting story items which are randomly dropped by bosses.

The game is not very randomised except for the difficulties changing up some of the mid level bosses (what the game calls mini-bosses).

[h1] But as I said, this game is definitely below Hades and Dead Cells, they are S tier roguelites, but the combat has an addictive nature to it, and it is fun to jump in and do a run every now and again.

The best part about the game is the wide variety of builds that actually work at endgame.

To add to that, even if you build a melee poison this run, there are multiple swords that can synergize with it each with a different unique passive.
One thing to note: the last boss has a rather annoying one shot mechanic - get to a random circle in time, while slowed, or die.

Who knows, the game may have become fun by now, but I have no desire whatsoever to try it out again. If I find time and willingness to do so, y'all will see it in another edit. Even if that happens, the initial review is here to stay so that newcomers would see the long path of improvement. Now stop showering me with Jesters. You like the game – good for you, back then it was a boring crap and I'm willing to die on that hill.

An okayish roguelite but a bit too monotonous to have much replayability. 
Once you complete it with each class and subclass - there's nothing you haven't seen and nothing you haven't done in the game.
And even that feels quite repetitive. Different classes are not so different per se, you have cold/lightning/poison-bleeding damage which are basically different animations that feel exactly the same in the end. You run to a group of enemies or to a boss, hold left mouse button, everything dies, or you shot them from a distance and recall you swords back to you, just dealing different types of damage. This way it feels even less different since in melee you at least have different animations.

Difficulty scaling is absurd and boring. Enemies just get shittons of HP (which feels good at the beginning cuz they just die to fast when you get your build going so you don't feel the difference after getting some near-OP skill). But don't worry, you don't feel that difference at higher difficulties either except that if your build is bad, it'll take a good minute to kill a bunch of normal opponents and much longer to kill a boss, if the build's good, you still one-shot most normal foes, maybe two-three shot more resilient ones and spend about a minute to kill a boss (well, minus the cutscenes and phases of invulnerability). The game doesn't become difficult, it just becomes utterly boring as you do all the same stuff but it takes much longer to kill anything. I've played until Heavy snow, as I understand, there's two more ""difficulty levels"" but.. What's in it? Just more health for enemies, you hit them, you evade, you kill - nothing new, done it for almost 40 hours now. Still taken down all bosses in practically the same time at ""heavy"" and at basic difficulty, you push down their health bar in seconds, watch the animation, evade some projectiles/red circles/huge red rectangles, push it down further, evade more stuff and voila - you go to the next chapter. 

Also, it is beyond me why they couln't make boss entrances/changes in phases skippable or faster, same goes for the ending cutscene and the final titles (sure, they are skippable, but you have to hold escape button twice and still spend time for something absolutely useless and unentertaining, gosh I can't even read these hyeroglyphs anyway).

Translation is just awful. I don't know Chinese but I'm well aware that there's a lot of people who know both English and Chinese, and I'm sure they could help. Even some fans could probably help for free. Still we see what I'd assume machine translation with a bit of editing (hopeffully) looks like. Dream gate developers, for instance, asked their fans to help them translate it. I didn't care to check the translation in-game but all the phrases on the website they used were translated right when I went there to help. Some developers care about their product and find ways.

For the record, I have 393 hours in Hades, half of that before the release, then I started anew to see new dialogues and stuff that was added after. And I still occasionally play it.
This game, on the other hand, has little to no replayability. What a shame for a roguelite.",1644788954,1701789715,False,43,5,0.561769664287567139,7,True,False,False

怪堆血，BOSS锁血，这就是制作组对于无尽模式的理解？暖雪游玩的过程就是把游戏变得越来越不爽的过程，好不容易挺过前期build成型，结果怪的血涨幅大于伤害，BOSS锁血还是刮痧。行，你们堪比鬼谷张三了。不会再玩你们的任何游戏。


【玩完白灰难度更新】：
特意把好评改成差评来骂制作组，nnnd，有你们这样设计难度机制的么，增加难度的方法就是堆怪的血量并且把最后一关的怪放到第一关。你们的概率设计也是迷，我玩雷系，三关末尾在锤子哥那刷不到增加雷伤的词条，正常么。。。


【刚玩的评价】：
肉鸽爽游，前期刮痧痛苦，但build成型后马上变割草游戏，玩的很爽。
但制作组设计上还是有些不足，比如击败最终BOSS之后居然没有奖励，导致打完了摆设的秦武就会想重开了；
另外瞬身总是被障碍物绊到，一个小石块就能卡住。。。在玩迅影流或者获得了疾风骤雨后体验不佳。
希望制作组在之后的更新中能修复这些问题。",1699583774,1701185505,False,0,0,0.487987995147705078,0,True,False,False

For each run, you choose the powers of a deity of your choice from among 6-7, then equip a weapon and 4 artifacts and obtain new skills along the way, all with different tiers of rarity. 
If you manage to finish a run, you can increase the difficulty several times, which also increases the drops.
For even more challenge, specific game rules can be activated in exchange for a powerful reward at each checkpoint.

For me, a good roguelite is one that offers plenty of permanent upgrades, and this game doesn't lack any. The skill tree allows you to gain raw stats, or for exemple, to select a legendary artifact at the start of each run, making it much easier to create your build, or to experiment with others without having to wait for randomness to be on your side.
A special store allows you to unlock more bonuses at checkpoints, which are an opportunity to modify your weapon, or gain stats/artifacts or resources.
There are also small gains in stats by completing lists of items to find (lore).

What's more, the free DLC offers just as much content as the base game (it could be its own standalone game), adding special rules and powerful buffs in a new zone separate from that of the base game (in short, at the start of your run you choose either the base game or the DLC).
And even if the two zones aren't connected, the DLC's new special skill tree also allows you to obtain certain upgrades for the base game, a very useful boost for more casual players, or to unlock difficult achievements.
The DLC also adds an infinite mode that increases difficulty as you go along, providing players with both powerful buffs and debuffs, making it a great mode for testing out the strongest builds, as the duration is longer than the basic runs.

In conclusion, I really like these games that offer content accessible to players of all levels.
If you're pretty hardcore, the game offers many options to increase the challenge, and if you're more casual, it offers many different upgrades that can compensate for your lack of personal experience. Great game.",1697388571,1697388571,True,18,0,0.701156914234161377,0,True,False,False

[code]
+   is positives
+/- is informational or neutral
-   is negatives
[/code]
+ Compelling meta-story that gets an unexpected twist and an ending in the DLC
+ The flying sword mechanic and how each different class/subclass gets different mechanics is particularly well-designed and feels amazing to play with
+ Combat is smooth, fast and responsive. Not much else to say here
+ Wide variety of weapons and relics. There are 50 relics, 51 swords and 7 classes (14 different subclasses) to mess around with. Some swords are subclass-specific swords that massively boost your passives, as a bonus. Many weapons also synergize with one or more relics. Relics have different effects depending on which 4 slots you put them into
+ Meta progression is satisfying and adds new mechanics over time

+/- Higher difficulties practically let you have two orange-grade relics right from the start of a run, which makes it easier to get your build going sooner than later
+/- Free DLC that adds a new game mode with unique Nightmare mechanic. It also adds skins for the NPCs that make them add a bonus effect to their services
+/- You can not turn off the vignette effect. You also can not turn off the ""slow motion"" effect that occurs in multiple instances
+/- Will take around 30~ hours to get everything including achievements, depending on your luck and how skilled you are. Might take a bit longer if you want the endless mode skins for the 7 classes, however
+/- There are some instant-kill moves, but they are very easy to avoid once you learn about them
+/- You can customize the death message, which is a neat detail

- Different difficulty levels don't add anything other than a massive stat inflation. There are no new mechanics or moves that change how you play the game or fight the bosses. Also, the game is too easy once you figure out what relic combinations work best, regardless of difficulty setting
- Severe localization issues which make a lot of the text illegible. Sometimes they are too long and don't fit where they are supposed to fit, as a bonus. Both of these issues also makes some lore entries impossible to understand. Even a fan would have done a better job when it comes to translating this game, if you ask me. There are also occasional typos here and there. Subtitles (when they exist at all) also are not synced with the voice-over. There is no English voice option, either
- Some classes/subclasses are comparatively weaker while some are absolutely broken even if you don't get lucky with your build
- The skill tree still opens up after every ""game over"" even if you maxed out everything. I mean, the lady is pretty, but you are wasting my time, game
- Takes time to collect some stuff if you are unlucky. There could have been more ""anti bad luck"" mechanics overall
- Some transitions and cutscenes can't be skipped, no matter how many times you saw them before
- Some relics feel absolutely worthless, even if they are relevant for some builds (due to better options). Also, most of them synergize with themselves, so you end up getting two of the same relic in some cases
- Difficulty setting doesn't apply to the DLC game mode. This means you can still get lower grade weapons and relics
- You can sometimes get stuck on tiny objects that probably didn't need a collision box to begin with. Looking at you, Nightmare mode torches

[h2]Other Notes:[/h2]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ending in the DLC explains everything and ties in the loose ends, including some of the core gameplay mechanics, like the roguelite aspect. You see, [spoiler]in reality, you are trapped in a nightmare by someone. To prevent your escape, they are keeping you busy by making you repeatedly fight the same cycle over and over again. The warm snow event and the giant lotus were both in your head. However, someone from the real world starts contacting and helping you (in the DLC), and you get a chance to get out of the nightmare. The nightmare world twists and melts, with new enemies appearing and old ones starting to spawn in mixed varieties. To escape for good, you must NOT give in to temptation and defeat 5 ""Teller of Untruths"". The ending shows you (the player) getting out of a gate, and the text ""To Be Continued"" appears.[/spoiler] A bit of a sequel-bait, but I can't complain. The ending is fitting, and knowing it will eventually continue makes me slightly hyped.",1695839907,1695848513,True,1,0,0.438149183988571167,1,True,False,False

Warm Snow is a fun take on action roguelike, as mentioned kind of Hades-esque but both more diverse and less diverse in builds somehow. Instead of different weapons at the start of a run, you choose a buddha (kind of like stances? Maybe?), which can significantly alter your playstyle. The ""default"" is you can slash your blade, throw flying swords into enemies (no aiming, they just find the nearest goon), and do a ""sheath"" (also called blade call in the translation randomly) to pull the flying blades back, doing extra damage and usually an effect. This combines to be very flashy but simple combat in modestly sized rooms and a bunch of semi-random elements.

The buddha stances range from ""normal but you do ice damage"" to ""you can't throw swords but you can parry"" or ""your swords are now wine and don't do damage until ignited"", there are a ton (oh, let's not forget the infinite-flying-swords that are sometimes lasers one), and there are relics to complement those and many other builds. These are where a ton of the randomness per run comes into play, as you have 4 relic slots and each relic has an effect depending what slot it's in. Also you can have multiple of the same relic.

The other big factor are skill tomes you find, which give you various passive bonuses, usually to damage or defense, but also each buddha has unique ones that crank up the builds.

There are also weapons (excaliburs?) which basically just function as stat sticks - they look quite different but don't change anything besides your damage, and whatever passive effects they give. Again some have unique effects if you have certain relics, or skills, or even a specific buddha, so they can be a big difference, but they feel less ""required"" than the right relics + skills to compliment your build.

You have to beat the game multiple times to unlock the higher difficulties, and find all the lore to get the ""true"" ending. There's a meta currency thing (actually multiple), a between-stage camp with bonuses, and there's even a free DLC which adds a new area and nightmare skills and an optional endless mode.

Overall, it lacks a little polish and refinement, but it's a ton of fun once you figure it out (taking a look at some of the guide helps if you struggle). A lot of the game is just trying to get so much offense you kill stuff before it can hit you, so it's debatable how ""hard"" it is, but you still have to react and play around some stuff, especially in boss fights.",1695350869,1695350869,True,44,0,0.840432047843933105,0,True,False,False

This is a fast paced difficult game that is pretty attractive and nice to listen to.

Gameplay, this is like hades, it is rouge-like and you will likely die a lot on repeat to get all the talent tree and get stronger, after you fill up the talent, any run you do is just experimenting on a build that you have in mind that the game throws at you, you pick them up and use them, some builds are easier to use like thunder and ice, and some require mechanical use like supreme bodhi or mother trinity
 
the mobs are different every level, or in higher difficulty some later mobs show up earlier than the level and has higher hp (basically bloated health). But your skill, sword and relic is adjusted to the difficulty to get that sweet legendary gear to kill those bloated mobs. 

Bosses are challenging to a point where it can be easy or hard depending on your build, some builds eat bosses like a melted chocolate on hot summer using ice build or thunder, some builds take longer, like poison or infinite arhat. It does not mean poison or infinite arhat are trash builds tho. Each statues shine in their own way, and depending on your luck during a run you can get their unique sword that makes clicking the mouse feel so good.

Enjoyed my time with it, a few issues that need some work.
Some things plastered across the screen remain in Chinese, had an evil cackle followed by a line of text after beating the final boss, no bloody clue what that was, if it was a twist I'm SOL.
Things can get rather hectic at times, can be quite hard to find yourself on screen when surrounded by 10+ dudes.
A few text boxes on items are obscured so you're unable to read the full description of the item.
Other than that, the gameplay is solid, every class you unlock has a bunch of unique boons that make the run even more fun.

I truly hope the devs keep updating and improving the game, there is so much potential here.

TIP: 
- Sword/Relic synergy is the best part of the game. Take advantage of the sword reroll mechanic as much as possible. It would surprise you how often you actually get the sword that you are looking for. 

PROS:
- Insane amount of builds/playstyle. I have played for 80 hours and new builds/combinations still come up
- Imagine if Hades and Vampire Survivors merged
- Devs show great understanding and creativity on power ups and abilities. Is not just ""Do 50% more damage""
- New DLC content is extremely good, I legit would have payed for it. They did the Boss Rush system better than Dead Cells
- Bosses are unique and refreshing

NEUTRAL: 
- Dashing is quite odd in this game. iFrames are pretty short so do not really on them, you actually have to dodge at the right time or you will get hit. I think is raises the skill cap of the game but it was annoying at the beginning. 

Get the skill that increases the invulnerability during dash, it makes it feel better.

CONS:
- Is not super polished
- The English translation is very rough so it takes time to figure out the systems of the game. I think this may turn off a lot of people. Once you understand the relic/sword synergy, the game opens up and it has hundreds of possible builds.
- DLC content is also a bit hard to understand at the beginning. I was about to give up on it until it finally clicked; once it did, I could not stop playing.",1676857930,1676858546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Though mostly ""heroic fantasy"" it also has a horror/hopeless desolation vibe that turns the brutality and creepiness up to eleven. If you have also enjoyed titles like Kuon,DreadOut,Nioh,Onimusha,Bloody-Spell,Eastern Exorcist,and Fatal Frame in the past Warm-Snow is very similar with its' visual designs and cultural inflections.

Likewise if you are the type of gamer whom enjoys having access to many different kinds of character builds,customization options,and procedural generated levels with branching paths that occasionally throw in alternate mid-bosses or unique treasures then Warm-Snow is going to be your next obsession for awhile! It is a commendable rogue-like done by developers whom put a lot of love and heart into this project.

As such it is a pity I'm not the biggest fan of rogue-likes. I'm often ""suckered in"" because on the surface they appear to be satisfyingly visceral and flashy hack n slash action rpgs. The caveat always is the very hard initial difficulty and ""starting over from the beginning"" upon death just a little stronger than you were before.  

This means you are left re-treading the same scenery and often facing the same enemies. Red exp. crystals which you use to permanently raise buffs,stats,and abilities whilst securing stronger equipment you find in your travels are given to you at a trickle until you defeat one of the ""bigger bosses"". Don't misunderstand me. This is a power fantasy and ""eventually"" you will become a war-god! It's just Warm-Snow wants you to grind for it and ""earn"" your place among the heavens.

The ""Enchanted flying-sword style"" makes this hero feel distinctly unique. You can do more damage to enemies by impaling them with your floating blades before attacking them in close melee. In an impressive flourish you can call all your swords back to your side and even charge them up with various mystical elemental attributes. It's a welcome change and this basic building block can be expanded upon in unexpectedly devastating ways! (It is possible to become the ultimate enlightened dervish of destruction ascending into speed-running nirvana!)

For 17.99 Warm-Snow is a solid purchase. Just be sure you know what you are getting into as far as rogue-likes are concerned......

Pros

+Game is as beautiful as a painting come to life in all its' beauty and all its' grotesquery.

+Intriguing heroic fantasy/horror setting. (The giant White-Lotus reminds me of The Marker from Dead Space.)

+Moment to moment combat is a visual feast of speed,grace,mystic mayhem,and brutality.

+Plethora of customization/character build options.

+Branching paths with varied rewards and a few alternate mid-boss encounters.

+Interesting challenges for those willing to take on more risks for greater rewards.

+You can pick up your quest from where you quit. Use this strategically because you know what happens when you perish! 

+If you are smart enough and know where to allocate all your relics,bonuses,and skill points you can ""break the game"" in the best way possible. I've seen this done in play-thrus but I'm still a learning novice.

+Rescued side characters offer up their unique expertise to strengthen your weapons or offer you more gifts and power-ups.

+Sprawling titan-sized ghost-lady merchant will scratch that particular itch!  

+Defeating the main lords unlocks new elemental fighting styles accessed by the increasing prayer statues in the main hub.


Cons

-Excessive grinding

-Upon death you start over from the very beginning

-Red exp. crystals funneled to you at a mere trickle until you have your first major victories.

-Certain bosses have cheap one-hit-kill techniques. (But you can learn to recognize and avoid them even if it is by the skin of your teeth!)

-Despite the ""random generation"" of locations they still are uniform in theme depending on the area. Aka,don't expect too much variance each time through.

-Repetition. Lots of repetition.",1675907945,1676083127,True,8,0,0.60327833890914917,0,True,False,False

Update: There's literally no point in dodging the stupid ""scroll of crane"" boss. It doesn't do anything, and its attacks will land regardless. Why is there a dodge at all if it won't do anything?

I don't know if it's a bug or if it's intended(I hope not).

So bosses will redirect their hits from time to time when you dodge. Basically a well time dodge is not a guaranteed evade. You may still have an attack snap to you and hit you at the end of your dodge animation. This leads to certain mechanics being unavoidable and makes certain ""cards"" void. For instance having increased dmg while at full health is no longer viable or worth taking because I am guaranteed to be hit at least a few times. 

I believe this is a bug because there are times when I dodge and never have a problem and other times I get hit over and over again. Not dodging any earlier or later then I do. 

That's the only pet peeve I have really with the game. It's this snappy hit reg mechanic that is really nice because it makes the game harder and in turn fun to master. Punishing you for dodging to early and yet I can't help but feel it's a bit wonky when you are hit because you dodged a literal millisecond before the attack animation. Meaning the boss snaps to you and attacks you at the end of your dodge animation sometimes waiting for your dodge animation to end(or at least it appeared like that). Since most attacks are fast so when an attack looks longer than usual it is kinda sus.

Serious I have had attacks that normally should be dished out within a second not be thrown out and hold that attack for another second while I finish my dodge animation just to then throw the attack and hit me. Serous sometimes you feel as if the programming is predetermined to hit you at times. I don't like that not one bit!

Of course I don't really know what's going on. I really enjoy the game as I stated above and I prefer this game over the binding of Issac to be frank. It's got depth and both games are fun but this is definitely more my style of game.

A simple fix to that problem stated above(it is a problem) is to indicate attacks using the red and white lines. Even having a better indication of the attack... have the arm or weapon follow the player until 0.2-0.5 seconds or whatever(more clear animations). Then stop the arm or weapons whatever in place. Meaning the attack no longer tracks the player. 

That's what is really key here. There needs to be a clear point in time when the attack no longer tracks the player and it needs to be visibly clear so players can pick up and learn the queues. That's what makes games like these fun to master.

I really want to sink hours into this game but it's really turning me off and slowly diminishing my will to play the game. I mean we are talking if I knew these mechanics were present in the game prior to playing. Just for those reason I would of been more likely not to purchase the game.

I want to give this a thumbs up but if you have mechanics that ruin the experience and burn players out early on. Then I can't exactly give this game a thumbs up.

Assuming both the problems of reaction time between attacks in boss fights and unavoidable damage via the attack animation hitting and sometimes waiting for you to finish a dodge animation is fixed. I can't recommend this game to anyone. Will I continue to play? Yes from time to time but only because I can't refund the game now. It took 3-4 hours to notice these things. At first I thought maybe I just timed my dodge poorly or maybe it was a fluke or just a tiny bug form time to time. Then the pattern starts becoming more apparent as you spend more time playing and you realize it's not your dodging it's the game mechanics. When it's you it's frustrating but I love improving and getting better. It's infuriating when it's mechanics because there is nothing you can do to improve yourself or improve the game... it's out of your hands and that ruins all the fun!",1674406145,1674407379,False,0,0,0.433333337306976318,0,True,False,False

my one problem

by way i have not played the most recent update, if this is fixed then i revised the problem

My only grievance with the game is the occasional boss move that ONE SHOTS  YOU. There is only two moves in the game that do this to my knowledge. This would not be a problem for me in most games like Spelunky or Risk of rain 2 but in this game it feels off. I think it could be the fact that most enemies and some bosses in the game do such a insignificant amount of damage that it give you the idea that the game is more akin to Enter The Gungeon in the way it deals damage to you a war of attrition. 
So when you see a move that look visually the same as most others it gives you the impression it should be taken with the level of importance. ( if i get hit i might lose 10% of my health bar but the boss is one hit away from dying) so i risk it just to die so late in the run that i am furious. So guess my take away is ask for the devs to put in a signal for these insta-kill moves doesn't have to be much just something akin to unblockables in Sekiro Shadows die twice anyway with that being said this is a problem that only a occurs once. You generally know better after. It just kind of feels like you've been cheated but I LOVE THE GAME that is my only nit pick. 












SPOILERS if you don't want to know what these moves are 



















 the first one is the first major boss when it's on it's third stage of it's second phase it has a move where he breathes in if you are caught by this you die. 
and the second one is the final boss of the game when he gets down to below 1/3 of his health bar he makes a circle around him and you have to get out of it  if you are caught by this you die. 
both moves even if you have a passives that gives you a second life you still die. which is probably the frustrating part  please let me know if there are more moves like this",1654942397,1671941081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Later Edit: After a patch, the game is not working anymore, whatever i do. Reinstalled, deleted saves, deleted registry entries, nothing fixes it. I have posted screenshots on the developer's discord and recorded my screen and posted it on youtube, posting the videos on the said discord again, but there is no info or fix from the devs for 2 months now. Clueless devs.

Later edit: 4th of novermber 2022. I was contacted by a dev via discord and in about 3 hours we have found a solution to the bug. The windows user did not have file rights on the savegame folder in app data, most likelly from a antivirus type software. They made a debug version of the game for me to download and to troubleshoot this and we talked back and forward until we fixed it.

Edit after playing the DLC: Completed the DLC with 100% achievements. The gameplay is expanded upon from the base game. It still has the same feeling, but with the new stuff you feel even more powerful and unstopable. I found it more fun to run DLC runs than base game runs.

Edit: I'm stuck on blizzard difficulty, and feel not every class is viable on higher difficulties.

The game feels very good to play. So it's not awkward or wonky, like some games in its genre.
It's kind of easy to complete, but there's overarching progress and progressively higher difficulty modes after you finish the game on one difficulty.

The game has a fun system where you're basically trying to break the game by getting an OP build.
If you play the demo, you might think: ""Ah, this gameplay isn't super exciting or mindblowing."" But if you play it for like 5 hours, you might end up learning how to put together a very satisfying, incredible built where you destroy enemies in one or two hits.

I'd say this type of gameplay & mechanics are more fun than those of Hades, but Hades has a better story, characters, aesthetic and such. But for people just into playing games for sake of gameplay, this game has is a great experience.

Edited after finishing on the 2nd highest difficulty.  

So... the base game is fun, and I like the variety of builds that are actually different. But there are several glaring problems with this game that makes it questionable as of this moment.  

1. Terrible difficulty scaling. The enemies and  especially bosses scales way too hard for the higher difficulty to a point that is not fun to play. A great example would be the 2nd boss. In lower difficulties you can finish her first phase in less than 5 mins. On the 2nd highest difficulty it took about good 10 mins with one of the highest dps builds I could make. And don't even get me started on the last boss, which is about 20 mins of repeating the same patterns. It got so bad that I actually fell asleep for when I was fighting the 3rd boss, luckily I woke up in like 2 seconds and pause the game. Still, falling asleep while fighting a boss should never happen in a game. My runs now consistently goes from 90 mins to 2 hrs. And that's from the 2nd highest difficulty. The runs on the highest difficulty will be even longer.

2. Some builds are too weak. It's a balancing issue, that some builds are just easier to beat the game than others... well at least they can do it much faster/safer. 

3. Too many set pieces for bosses moveset. Like the last boss, he'd do a move in his last form trying to suck you in, and then if you escape, you'd be fine. The problem is this move takes forever, and it's really not a challenge... so it just becomes a time sink. You'd see him repeating the same move - and I'm not exaggerating - more than a dozen times in the fight. You only have so much of a window to burst him down when you can, and then he goes back to repeating the same cycle again. It's stupid and a waste of time. IMO the boss should only do that move once to signal that he's in his last form now, and then go on to do other moves.

4. Hard to read what's on the screen for some builds. I like melee builds, but some of them you literally can't see your character nor the enemies since the special effects basically cover everything. Like using the electric melee build to call down thunder - I can't see where I am or what my character is doing or even what I'm hitting or what's hitting me. At that point I'm just going off intuition but honestly this should not happen.

If you ever read a wuxia story and imagine what it'd be like to throw swords around and slash like crazy, this game's pretty much for you. It fulfills that one fantasy, unlike most other games like it that spread around a bit, but it fulfills it perfectly. As many reviewers pointed out, it's quite similar to hades, but I'd argue a bit higher paced, if less varied. 

Note that the balancing isn't the greatest, and that you progress through the game fairly quickly--but I actually enjoy these two points, especially having gone into the game blind. Stumbling onto an insanely oppressive build that was finished 2 stages before the last was extremely fun, and just playing around with various possibilities is equally so. If you're an end-game purist, perhaps these balancing nods might piss you off, but I mostly play for the entertainment and usually stop once I've hit that 'play for 200 hours' wall, so this is perfect for me. 

If you want a game where you can dump around 30-40 minutes a night into and have a blast, this one's for you. Runs can go on a bit longer at a higher difficulty, especially if you don't get a good roll of luck early on, but oh well, you can always restart. 

UI's a bit wonky at times as it clearly wasn't optimized for English language so sometimes you'll see words bleed beyond the border, but they are relatively rare. Anyway, if you're a fan of fast-paced, Hades-like games, this one's for you. Plus, if you ever wanted to feel what it would be like to take upon the mantle of a wuxia MC, look no further.

You play as a silent protagonist who must, for some reason, slay the corrupted members of the populace, ending each stage with a Four Symbols-themed boss fight.

There are many minibosses, but there are only 5 main boss for each playthrough: the 4 officials (Pig, Crane-Phoenix, Turtle, General Tiger) and the Dragon Emperor.

In higher difficulties, the mobs (and their mutations) pose a bigger problem than the bosses, in my opinion.

If you are a Chinese mythology/wuxia/xianxia buff, this game is for you. If you are a Hades fan, you will enjoy it. I played the game and finished the base difficulty months ago. I came back recently. They've added tons of stuff which made me play and finish the game on higher difficulties.

I rate it 9/10, if for the fact that 10/10 would mean that they'd have to expound more on the story and probably get a better engine for the game. And at its price point, it's head and shoulders above the competition. Try it for yourself.",1662195870,1662196751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All the builds in this game are quite balanced if you have the right weapon, sect, and artifact. Personally, the lightning Buddha is the weakest for me. It is really fast, can stun, but lacks the damage in the hardest difficulty. You need the x3 lightning damage artifact for the build to be viable. The rest of the classes are close in terms of DPS.
 
The best weapon in this game is the Butcher pair with damnation. 40% for the attack to deal 300% damage. 

Seven Sword - all rounded, great DPS, life leech, great for bleeding.

Carousing Fire - fire damage, it's ok, nothing special.

Mother Trinity - poison damage, tankiest class in the game for its life leech but in exchange for dps. You can literally tank any boss in the hardest difficulty making up for your dps. 

Infinite Arhat - flying sword baby! very long range, huge damage, great for some blood pact

Bitter River - ice damage, freeze enemies, great dps 

Thunder Fury - lightning damage, fast but lack dps, can stun normal mobs, can’t stun boss 

Supreme Bodhi - use flicker and shealth a lot, shealth doesn’t affect by shealth cooldown. It stays 30 seconds forever. Fastest class in the game, great damage

The story unfortunately isn’t that interesting or even exciting and the poor translation doesn’t help. Another issue is there’s a lot of clipping with text in English and there are still some weapons that you have no Idea what they do by trying to read it in the game. 
One great thing I liked about it is how increase in difficulty is actually more than just increasing HP and Attack, you have new enemies appear, harder enemies appearing and even entirely new mechanics for bosses or new minibosses.

My pros heavily outweigh the cons and have had  a lot f fun exploring different build paths and items. I'll list a couple specific pros and cons for anyone who might be interested or is new to the game. 

Pros:

-Variety: I have just over 20 hours and I feel like I haven't had any two builds be the same. With all the different weapons and relics, all with color coded tiers, modifiers, and attributes that are randomized (on weapons), the game feels like ther is a never ending combination of things to play with. To top it off, you get to eventually choose a bunch of different things to use before you even start the run so you don't feel like your success is completely rng based.

-Combat: The combat feels very crisp all from lighting fast, meat slapping atk and mvmt speed to slower but hard hitting curb stomping damage. Throw in a bunch of debuffs and status effects and you got yourself some very powerful feeling slicing and dicing.

Cons:

-Dialogue/ Narration: This game does not have english narration which isn't a huge issue, just would be nice to know what characters are saying without having to read speech bubbles. The real con here is the translation in item descriptions are not super accurate and sometimes it takes some depicting to figure out what it says, or doesn't even finish the description at all.

-Terrain: I really like all the little things they put on the floor to add to the density of the stages, but it's infuriating when there's a bunch of stuff going on and I get stuck on a little book or something and end up taking a bunch of damage, or sometimes the character stick to walls in very odd ways and have the same conclusion.

Updated as of 07/06/2022

Since the Major bug that kept the games progression locked in place was fixed, Warm Snow has proven to be a very enjoyable title. It's a good game if you feel like sinking a few hours into something and relaxing with some mindless hack 'n slash. 

That being said, with maps remaining static for each biome (the maps aren't randomised) it tends to get repetitive rather quickly if you binge play, so try keeping it to an hour or two and you might draw more enjoyment out of it in the long run.

Other than that, the only thing I can speak to is the Price Vs. Value of the game which is completely fair and justified. You get what you pay for, a good game that you'll enjoy playing.

So if you are new to Warm Snow and you want to make things a little easier here's a hint...

1.  You can't use arrow keys to move.  Games that have WASD allow us left-handers to use arrow keys also, or otherwise allow key rebinding.  Dev said they would look into adding it in a January 2022 comment, but seems they haven't bothered in the end.
2.  No 'gore off' option.  Everyone you kill leaves a huge splat of blood on the ground.  I like to reduce gore when playing because my youngest son will often watch me play games.

Aside from that, I wasn't keen on the item matching bonuses.  This card does X effect if you have exact Y card.  This feels pretty restrictive.  Normally it would be you get a bonus if you have Y type of card to allow more open synergies, not naming a single specific card you have to come across.

On the plus side, I did like that you had a range ability by default in addition to melee ability - although so many effects were focused around 'if you do a melee attack after a ranged attack' or vice versa - so the game was heavily pushing that I had to use both rather than letting me focus on one.

While it lacks the Hades polish, it more than makes up for it with incredible build diversity, on-the-fly customization, and sheer power fantasy.

My first few runs looked pretty rough because I tried to play it safe, avoid damage, and conserve throwing swords. But eventually you figure out that dashes are invulnerable, there are lots of ways to recover health, and all your swords come back when you change rooms. So just play like a fearless anime protagonist and kill shit before they have a chance to do damage.

[i] My progress as of this review: I have cleared 3 difficulties. [/i] 

[b] My pros: [/b]
[list]
[*]The combat feels good when you're attacking. It feels very impactful and quick, the movement is smooth, and you have a lot of attack and movement option. 
[*]The building is fun and there are a lot of choices to make. 
[*]The initial difficulty is extremely approachable. My first clear was 4h into my playtime. There is also no artificial gate or meta-progression preventing you from beating this game on your first attempt, which I see as a win. 
[*]Ghost lady booba
[*]The meta-progression is meaningful. You can actually feel the effects of your progression and there is not an excessive amount of grinding required to complete your tree. 
[*]You can quit and return to where you were in the middle of a run. This is a great QoL feature that some roguelites don't include, but as a father this is very important to me. 
[*]Beautiful hand-drawn art and awesome particle effects. 
[*]Good sound design, music isn't memorable. 
[/list]

[b] My Cons: [/b] 
[*]Excessive knock-downs from enemies. A lot of the time this CC will come from offscreen or an enemy will rush you with not nearly enough time to react. This issue is only exacerbated as you progress through the difficulties. 
[*]Lots of choices, but not all choices made equal. I feel pretty confined as to what I can build or what God I can start with. Some just feel straight up useless. 
[*]HUGE ramp up in difficulty in the final area. You may think you have a fantastic build going only to find out the sponges in the final area take 2 full minutes to kill and hit like a semi. 
[*]Too few i-frames. Especially considering some enemies have attacks that have very small dodge windows. Fighting the concubine is an absolute slog because of this, unless you have a broken build. There is an item to increase the i-frames, but I feel as though they should just fix the dodge by adding innate i-frames..
[*]Unskippable boss cutscenes. Every time I get to the bosses I have to watch an unskippable mini-cinematic that I've already seen 10 times. It just adds unnecessary time to runs and gets annoying. 
[*]If possible, combat clarity needs work. A lot of the time I find I'm just face-tanking without realizing because I can't for the life of me see what the hell is going on behind all the particle effects. 
[*]Lu Kunhai auto-fail mechanic. No. Just no. Remove it. If you have the indomitable perk it makes this fight literally not possible to complete unless you react 3 seconds in advance to a randomized moveset. Also, indomitable sucks, please fix. 
[*]Enemies get very spongey later on, and without a crazy build you will be trudging through an absolute swamp of HP trying to get to the end. I've had several runs I just straight up reset because I was on the final stage and healthy but didn't want to spend the ridiculous amount of time it would take to whittle down the enemies and bosses. 

[b] TL;DR - It's very fun but has its share of flaws. Overall, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons here and I'd recommend it. I'm sitting at just over 20hrs and planning to put plenty more in. [/b]",1654528346,1654528346,True,12,0,0.628663063049316406,0,True,False,False

Secondly, yes the Translation would really benefit from some polish, and some Weapon Text should be optimized since they don't fit the Box. 
But for the most Part every Item is understandable enough to play it.

And third, there are a lot of reviews about a Bug with the first Boss being invincible, as far as I can tell that has been resolved a long Time ago.

All in all I'd say Warm Snow is a nice Rouge-lite experience, that has a multitude of Factors that can alter your run, most and foremost Sect's (Scrolls) that provide passive Bonuses, but the Weapon of Choice also has a huuuuge effect, specially on 'Classes' that have a Signature Weapon that's benefits them most.

The thing I found most interesting were the Relics, Items that provide Bonuses depending on where in the four Slot 'Inventory' they are placed, the huge thing that can easily be missed/underestimated is, you can always reallocate the Relics order, to adept the effects to new Relics or a new weapon/sect you found along the way.

Coming to the Classes, each run you choose one Avatar which provides a General passive and a secondary playstyle defining passive of two Options. At the start you only have 1 Avatar to pick from, with 6 when you unlocked all of them trough Gameplay.

All in all the Game isn't that long, one run on average took me one Hour, so it lives from repeated Playthroughs, for which you have 6 Classes (12 if you count the Subclasses), and 6 Difficulty Levels.
Apart from the First and last Act, all Acts consist of multiple Loots Areas, a Mini Boss and an Act Boss, while there is a pool of 2 to 3 Minibosses per Act, the Act Bosses are always the same.

The great thing about the Difficulty design is, that at first all Acts are separate, which each Difficulty bleeding the Enemy Types and Mechanic over into all Acts when you hit Difficulty 5 (Blizzard).

The Final Difficulty (White Ash) where you can obtain Master Skins for each of the 6 Classes by playing trough with them is basically identical with Blizzard except that all Act Bosses (and some Mini Bosses) have an additional 'Move' which makes the Fight quite different, especially for Melee Focused Classes (only beat it with a ranged Class yet).

You start out with one class and unlock more classes as you progress through the bosses and difficulties. Together with the relics and weapons you mix and match what you randomly get and see how far you go. It's somewhat unbalanced because some classes are flat out better than others and some relic+weapon combinations output crazy amounts of damage while others are useless.

The harder difficulties are hit or miss depending on how well your relics + weapon + class + acquired skills work together. Sometimes you'll clear at a snail's pace because you get no damage items. Other times you will obliterate floors because you managed to stack synergies very early on. There is no in between. In this regard I wish there were some way to guarantee drops for your class because if you don't get those few drops that work, you're basically wasting your time. The hardest difficulty (white ash) gives bosses additional mechanics that heavily favor ranged over melee, which is not great. Ideally both should be equally viable. 

Improvements I'd like to see:
1) Translations - Not all voice lines have subtitles, and translations for the relics and weapons are confusing. 
2) Transparent projectiles - Some attacks, relic effects, etc. take up large portions of the screen and make it hard to understand what's happening. Perhaps there can be a setting that changes their transparency
3) Camera focus - The camera should always be on the character. Instead it focuses on the boss. In a similar vein to (2), how am I supposed to understand what's going on and react properly if I can't even see my character? The final boss fight is especially guilty of this.
4) Auto-fire & Auto-dash - Some classes do not have this and it's a pain for the wrist/hands to play them.",1651799868,1652226553,True,7,0,0.597864091396331787,0,True,False,False

1. Too many knock back, and getting back up just to be knock back again is getting tedious.
2. On top of that, some enemies (looking at you, some jumping assassins) are really annoying: they teleport to you out of nowhere, especially if you are in the fog area and knock you back near permanently, or rolling with F1 speed from the top of the map that you couldn't see on the screen and slamming right into you, knocking you back.
3. Some relic options are just strictly better than others in certain classes, namely blue dragon spirit and spirit jade for Infinite Arhat (or I may just be not experimenting enough). 
4. Again, knock back. Bosses combo seems unfair, namely the A Qing and a sword man duo: the sword man telegraph a skill that can knock you back, so you have to dodge the line, but immediately after dodging, A Qing throw her weapon on you to catch you, leaving very little room for mistake.

I have a few issue, once you have cleared it on the hardest ""blizzard"" or blizzrad (which is more fitting anyway :D ) as it say in game a couple of times you are just playing to try builds and synergies, And sure there are things like getting a relic at start and a ""card"" and re-roll of cards and 1 legendary on your first ""refine"". But you also want to combine this with your sword, that you want as ""impossible"" highest grade, for the build and statue you rolled,  and to get all these things to come into place to try new things is just too much hit and miss. Also the translation is lacking and text for items/relics flows out of bounds so you cant read them.  

I would have loved a character sheet so i can see how things affect each other have synergy or whatnot. More visible ""buffs"". Also ""Blizzrad"" is just a pain in the a in the way everything just takes too long to kill this together with having to dodge every time the tentacles come up, makes it annoying, not hard just annoying. Just upping health on mobs is a cheap way to make it harder. tip: For every run you do on blizzrad always take ""damnation""(not true with the last update), else it becomes an snoozefest.

If you read it until here let me tell you this is a good game and worth your money and time, lovely art work. But replayabiltiy is diving hard after you have beat it on ""Blizzrad"".

you get :
6 builds with 2 variations

up to 4 different relics you can hold

all that so you can stack up some power and destroy the enemy.
each time you die you get some skill points to waste to get even stronger next run.

the only thing that ruins the game is that the difficulty is just a defense\health\attack buff to the monsters. with some weird purple giant tentacles that misses you most of the time the game becomes to repetitive to grind on . i got to the last difficulty where killing anything becomes legit a chore and it takes the fun out of the game. wish they added different boss abilities and new enemy mechanics .

overall its a grate game to buy for the first 20 hours of it . it becomes a chore to play after that.

With six archetypes for your character and two specialisations each, a ton of equippable relics, weapons with special effects to build on your archetype and your relics and a mass of skills to choose from, build variety in this game is great!
Difficulty wise it starts out mellow, but the higher difficulty levels can get pretty challenging. Don't expect to breeze through every time!
Aesthetics are neat imo, so is the music.
Voice acting also sounds quite good, but since it's in Chinese and I'm not a speaker, I have no idea what they are saying x3

All in all the price is decent for a very good, if rough around the edges, game with fast paced action and a lot of replayability!

The vast majority of the game is best played by limit testing - rushing in as fast and stupidly as possible and then learning your limits from there. Gameplay is smooth and fast paced, and dodges are best used proactively rather than reactively (fast, low/no start up lag, low I-frames). By far the best aspect of the game is the build crafting. I've played over 20 runs and am still experimenting with new builds I've never tried before regularly. Most classes and builds are viable, with only a few feeling a bit lacking. 

A few cons to note are translation, which while much better still has a few untranslated lines or confusing text, and difficulty scaling. Relies a bit too much on making numbers larger instead of introducing new mechanics. Numbers are undoubtedly important, but for instance, on the second hardest difficulty at the first boss the game was still slowing down time to allow you to read the enemy and react/dodge appropriately. Removing said time dilation at higher difficulties would be a good way to force you to improve your skills to beat the boss, rather than the game hoping you mess up because the fight takes longer.

The game is such a rush to play and the gameplay is relatively simple, but satisfying with a great feel to it. Randomized powers and items are incredibly powerful and full of awesome synergies to explore and abuse. Stack a ton of damage over time effects with a ton of ""on dealing damage"" effects and ramp up into insane damage. Toss swords to make your melee attacks more powerful, and then melee to let you toss swords more, and throw in some stuff to do additional special attacks for free while you're doing it all. It all feels awesome.

On the downside, the localization into English is rough. Terminology is generally consistent, but can be difficult to figure out at times (primary weapons are all referred to as Excalibur which confused me for a bit, for example). Turtle boss and shopkeeper have voice lines but no subtitles, so I entirely miss the meaning of their dialogue.

I also feel obligated to mention, the game is full of excessive gore and some nudity, which might bother some people. I felt it was appropriate to the dark setting and helped further make me feel like a total badass, but your mileage may vary.

They make it challenging by buffing the HP and Armor of every enemy. (Even that damn pig.)

I want a challenge in the higher difficulty and not be a sweaty try hard and spend a maximum of three to five minutes per section of the path towards the boss. And also spend so much time trying to create a build to counter the huge HP/Armor pool of everything you come across.

It's even beside the enemies that spawn on the death of enemies that are even more buffed than the ones you just literally killed and the corruption maximum of three that you have to keep watch every minute. 

An entire run can take up to 2 hours if you want to defeat that difficulty. So in order not to stress out from that, I just play in the middle.

It also has some bugs, though most/all the major ones have been fixed. 

The biggest issue right now is that the story is basically non-existent and the two highest difficulties are based on severe number bloating, especially the highest one. This also leads to the second biggest issue: class balancing.

While all builds are viable on lower difficulties, the higher you go the less options you have in terms of efficient or even functional builds. Several builds would just not work on the highest difficulty setting or would, at best, be terrible slogs.

3. Very odd game balance issues. A blacksmith unlock who should upgrade your weapon but 99% of the time degrades it? Yup. Early game bosses with instant kill attacks? Yup.  Odd unlock/progression system? Got it.

That's something big I can give this game, and these devs.

The game itself is really fun, the gameplay is super satisfying with the slashes and hit sounds, and the relic system reminds me of Transistor. The relics themselves are well designed and fun, and get more complex and powerful as their rarity increases, same with the Excaliburs (swords) you pick up that synergize with a specific thing, relic or passive or otherwise.

The sects are divided into two subclasses, usually one using the default throw swords/recall swords moveset, and the other sacrificing the ability to throw swords to augment your basic attack or your dash (Flicker) or give you a floating gourd that shoots alcohol and fireballs at people.

This game is a lot of fun to play, and there's a lot of depth to the gameplay that really sucks you in. I'm very glad that I played this game. The translation is a bit off at times, and there are some polish issues. If I had to say this feels more like an early access game than a full release. I've fully gotten my money's worth out of this game though.

That being said, as someone who has cleared all of the difficulty levels; The more I play this game the less I want to play it. Higher difficulty quickly become hordes of damage sponges, only allowing for specific builds/playstyles/aspects to be successful. Worse yet, coming back to lower difficulties and trying to run specific builds for fun doesn't work very well either, as even if you get the items/skills that you want (which is unlikely to be frank) you're unlikely to ever get to ""a full build.""

My #1 complaint right now is the blacksmith. It feels really bad to pour 2k+ into trying to rank up your weapon only to have it end up at a lower level than what you started with. I don't know what the ""failure"" chances are when forging a weapon, but I feel like at the moment it is way to high. I would either remove the failures causing your weapon dropping a tier, or improve the odds that forging will be a success.",1644144381,1644144381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The translation is pretty rough and there are a few places where you can get stuck which is no big deal because if you quit and come back you only get thrown back to the beginning of whatever room you were in, the art is gorgeous outside of the ending sequence which feels more like a 2008 flash animation.

Pros: Great gameplay and variety of playstyles with the different statues that you can pray to which give you different classes I would say.
The controls are pretty nice and responsive, never once felt it lag.
The soundtrack is amazing
The artstyle is gorgeous.
The story and unlockables are interesting and fun to collect.

Cons: The difficulty levels don't offer any variety, the hardest difficulty level only makes the enemies (included bosses) have 50 times the health as usual it feels like, as a consequence a run on the hardest difficulty level ends up feeling more like a chore than something fun you want to do, I've ran blizzard difficulty twice and once I died, the second one I just quit because I couldn't get myself to keep going further seeing as in the third stage the turtle palace it was taking me around 5 - 10 minutes to clear each room.
The bugs; There is this one specific bug that makes the game rezise itself when you dash or ""flicker"" which even it if doesnt affect the gameplay its really annoying.
There are quite a few spots where you can get stuck, which is no big deal but it's still annoying.
The translation needs a lot of work
The game needs a lot of balancing, certain ""classes"" are obviously much stronger than the others discouraging variety at the time of picking up your statue for the next run.

All in all good game but I wouldn't consider it a ""full game"" more like an early access type of thing since there's a lot of work to be done for it to be perfect.

It definitely feels like the game is trying its best to make me as strong as I possibly can.  The balance seems very good, and it's extremely nice that the base difficulty isn't balanced around any meta progress updates.  After beating the Chapter 2 boss who seems like a skill and DPS check wrapped into one, on my third run I was able to face tank my way to the end of the game.

Now for the bad: the localization is awful, some dialogs have absolutely no translation at all, and some pretty major bugs exist with only potential workarounds.

That being said, I 100% recommend giving this game a try, especially if you're a fan of ""Hack and Slash"" style gameplay.

EDIT: Officially beat all the content the game has to offer, and I have a few edits to the review but for the most part everything holds true, although most of the major bugs have been fixed.  Difficulty scaling seems largely just be ""more bullet sponging"" and while it makes you feel phenomenal when you finally crack the curve, the final difficulty mode [spoiler] Blizzard [/spoiler] feels kinda rough.  Although, I really like the increased minimum rarity that comes with the difficulties, as it really lets you push builds to their limits.

The unlockables definitely need some more thought, as I finished the final difficulty before I even managed to unlock the last playable character or unlocked all the hidden stories (Which are an awesome part of the game).  Also, the meta currency could use some in-game uses, as once you've maxed out the skill trees, it's essentially useless.  The NPCs are great and I love the new Blacksmith NPC conceptually, although I'm not a huge fan of the implementation of the sword upgrade feature as the chance to upgrade to impossible feels too low on high difficulties.

Localization is still bad, but its definitely getting better slowly.  I'd really like to see the distillation dialogs fixed, and the text runoff on the item dialogs is really difficulty to play around, and it feels like a lot of the difficulty in item selection is based on trying to parse out how certain interactions might work together on the fly from poorly worded text.

Also, when you sects that render other sects completely useless, it would be nice if those were removed from the pool of items.  It can be a bit disappointing when you've taken a sect that removes your dash, only to be presented with a longer dash or longer invincibility after dashing as your sect choices.

Generally speaking though, the game is incredible with tons of replayability and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great Hack n' Slash roguelite!  You can easily get a few hours out of the game, and the devs are actively supporting the game which makes it much easier to recommend.",1642977530,1644023050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes it has some totally broken combos, and also some underperforming ones, but imho that is also one of the biggest charm of this game.

Artwork is interesting and unique. It feels a bit low budget but it fits the general aesthetic and vibe of the game. Gameplay wise, the synergies and maniacally powerful builds you can come up with really keep you coming back to see what crazy run you can do next. Difficulty scales appropriately and the pace of the game is just right.

The caveat is that the translation is somewhat poor or sometimes even lacking all together so it's hard if not impossible to keep up with the story. It seems like an interesting narrative concept, if only we could figure out what it all means. Also, the haphazard translation of some text in the abilities and boons make it challenging what effect hey truly have. I'm sure this will all be worked out with further development and it's by no mean a deterrent. 

All in all it's an incredibly fun game from a small indie studio that is absolutely worth the price and the time.",1643949482,1643949482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that being said, as I push through Snow Storm and Blizzard difficulties, I'm not enjoying it nearly as much.

Now, it seems that the massive increase in monster health is supposed to be offset by the higher chance of epic and legendary item drops, and impossible Excalibur drops. And some of the special mods that the legendary relics have are really awesome. But in the end, it realllllly falls flat on feeling ""good"". The monster HP scaling is absolutely off the charts, and I have yet to see a build that really counters that.

My last run was on Snow Storm difficulty. I played the blood aspect with a legendary Bruise Herb in my skill slot, so I had insane healing. I was largely unkillable. My other 3 slots were filled with legendary Hydrargyrum in the Core and Power slots, and a legendary Poison Sac in the agility slot. I was never offered a zombie finger, as I think that would have been the only saving grace for my damage if I was able to get a legendary zombie finger in my skill slot for additional stacking. Every normal room was fairly quick and entirely effortless, and every boss took ages. The final boss took about 10 minutes to kill, and I was at absolutely 0 risk of dying at any point of the fight - I ended it with full hp and didn't use a single flask all run. Since I had the bruise herb fully sustaining me, I took every single damage buff offered....and I still felt like I had no damage. To me, that isn't ""fun"". That felt like a but of a god run, but I left it feeling super weak. Oh, also the alternate ending choice after the final boss bugged out on me and disappeared so I was stuck in the boss room. I had to save&exit and restart only to slog through the boss a second time for another 10 minutes. That sucked.

Also, there is the meta upgrades.. I already have the entire meta tree allocated, and another 50 some coins for it. I feel like it maxes out far too quickly with nothing else to spend the upgrades on. Some of the meta upgrades are really cool and useful, but if you can max it before even unlocking Blizzard difficulty, theres not much point in pushing further is there?

So at this point I am tempted to go back to the Fine or Medium snow difficulties just so its not a slog fest to complete a run, yet I want to play with some of the unique legendary and impossible items that are super rare at those difficulties. Kind of just leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth.

Two major things:
-build variety (each new statue/class creates A LOT of possibilities and synergies, and most of them are hella fun in their own way. it's not easy to keep the game challenging while also constantly creating the feeling that your character is OP, but that's exactly how I feel almost every run);
-convenience and flexibility (for example, changing the position of your relics on the fly? easy! don't commit to shit, improvise and have fun!)

It also has a lot of flavour. I do love me some super-Chinese games -- and one part of it is definitely because I lie to myself thinking that playing it helps a bit with my very rusty Chinese... but if you're looking for something very fresh and chunky, lore-wise, this game'll be right up your alley.

also, if you love wuxia stuff, this game is cocaine.

EDIT: just got to the ending for the first time, with a build so OP that even the heavens looked at me with nothing but disgust. It was glorious.

You get new weapons as you progress on each run.  And you unlock more for future runs. Ive seen alot of people call this a Hades copy.   Nah, this is its own thing.  The progression is solid. The upgrades are unique.  The gameplay is top tier.

The progression and combat keeps me playing.  Each time I die i get a new perk by earning points on each run.  The game has randomness down to a science.  The upgrades are amazing and you wont always be facing the same boss everytime.

I would recommend to either find a good Chinese/English translator or ask the community for help in translation. Google translate can take you so far, especially with Chinese :/

- A lot of fun, with a huge amount of variety and content for its price point.
- Graphics are pretty amazing for what it is.
- Fluid combat
- Boss fights are well telegraphed.
- Challenging but not too challenging.

Cons:
- Game is loads of fun, with terrible TERRIBLE English translation.

   1- Misspelling.
   2- Flat out change in terminology (e.g Relics/Elixirs are the same thing apparently)
   3- Some properties or upgrades don't make any sense, and you have no clue if it would work with your build or not.
   4- Incomplete descriptions (e.g Deal lightning damage to the.... to that what?).

No, the one thing that will break that loop every time and make me put down a game is getting stuck on the edges of maps on random pieces of ""aesthetic"" terrain. Some are breakable, but many of the objects on screen are completely unpathable, which should be fine, however, there are visual traps where you may or may not be able to move around an object.

1、后期难度数值崩溃，敌人血量成长与角色攻击成长不成比例，角色成长感不明显，战斗冗长，凸显出了他的第二个问题
2、Boss设计单调重复，动作单一，再加上高难度敌人血量数值崩溃，战斗极其冗长，完全没有任何游玩体验，就是机械劳动。
3、攻击特效华丽，但是会挡住敌人的动作。
3、后期可成长性不足，加完了天赋树，就没有通关与通关之间的可成长性继承了，加上高难度完全是数值堆累，丝毫没有任何重复游玩的动力。
4、开发者可能不知道自己游戏的问题，也可能是MMO玩多了，要搞网游那一套丝毫没有乐趣的重铸属性抽卡系统？我一个无法继承的武器，一局用完就用完了，我为啥要重铸他，来去给几个血量多的没有道理的敌人纹身？

If you enjoyed the core mechanics of Hades, you'll likely enjoy this too. You start runs by choosing what is essentially a class (think a weapon in Hades), then fight through levels, picking which path to take to earn different weapons, or skills, or heals etc. It'll feel very familiar to Hades players. The controls are very responsive, and I've never had a death that I felt wasn't my own fault.

The story and world aren't on the same level as Hades, but what is? The story is pretty basic and simplistic, there just to drive the game forward rather than deliver a compelling narrative.

There are a couple of issues, though; 

First, the translation is really lacking, or outright missing, in places. Some things aren't translated at all, including boss dialogue and some on-screen alerts in the ""base"" stages. There are also typos all over the place.

The other major issue is poor information presentation. This comes in a few forms; some information is too long for the box it's meant to fit in and overflows or gets cut off, especially with high-rarity weapon stats & info. There are also some descriptions which just don't make sense thanks to poor translation, and it's also really difficult to compare the effect of different weapons/skills etc, because there's no place to just see your actual stats like damage output etc. That makes it pretty tricky to plan out a build or really figure out if a change will be a positive or a negative.

It wouldn't take much to fix these issues, so hopefully it's something the developers will address quickly.

That being said, if you can put up with the janky translation and having to figure out what some things do on your own/using the steam community, and you liked Hades and want something familiar but fresh, I highly recommend this game.

The movement and combat is exceptionally clean & tidy, and extremely satisfying. The game design & lore collectables add a real nice unexpected bonus, and the skill tree feels exceptional - putting points, even early, in the trees gives you real tangible benefits.

The seperate classes are very interesting and enjoyable. I've played with at least one of each style, and they all change things up enough to really transform how you play the game & consider your relic/elixir choices.

The rarity tier system feels like a real treat across all aspects and the unique modifiers the Legendary ones provide turn some relics from an instant-skip to a won-run - one of my favourite items I located was an Impossible Ordinary sword, which had a 1/10000 chance of instantly killing everything on screen with every attack under the debuff known as 'Programmer's Rage'. Was fun to see.

However, it's not all good. Here's a short list of issues with the game currently.

* Spelling errors & typos in transaltion - many elements of the game aren't even translated at all, and while that could be purposed as flavour in some games, it's missing in several important aspects here where the game is trying to convey vital information to you without you being able to understand
* Lack of a simplistic stat sheet. Although there is a help menu that explains what each of the conditions do, there's no way to see your current movespeed/crit%/Flying Sword DMG etc etc and I feel the game would really benefit from this clarity
* In another vein on transparency & translation, many skills will tell you there's a 'chance' of something happening without in fact telling you what that chance is. 
* The harder difficulties are an excellent way to step things up - HOWEVER, unless you're running two very particular builds, certain zones are full of bullet sponges - it took me 20 minutes to kill the Concubine on higher difficulties with Infinity & at several points I considered just letting her kill me after watching her jump up the the ceiling for the 100th time. Admittedly, this is likely a skill issue - if you know you're on a hharder difficulty, force a specific build.
*The runs are LONG. Even with a god-like run you can be playing for hours before you get to the final boss. Now admittedly, I play games like Noita so I'm no stranger to throwing hours into a run for purely prep work, but in a fast-paced hack & slash this can be really noticeable after Chapter 3. If you're looking for a rewarding quick dip-in-dip-out game, this isn't it.

With all that said, that may cast a rather negative light on this game. But no, even despite all it's flaws, it's a solid 8 or 9 out of 10. Rewarding, addictive, satisfying.",1643379109,1643379109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mechanics on controller are tight, never felt like the character did something I didn't want.
Builds on the different character classes feel interesting and engaging. 
Hit and hurt boxes are tight. Can stand just outside swipe animations and not get clipped.
Artistic ascetic and lore history felt consistent based on what I know from Asian culture. 
Flying Swords are cool.

Cons:
Story in total feels very lacking, needs more fluff in between the bosses.
Needs more character building, who are the people that we saved.
More English would be cool, there is a lot translated already, but I have no idea what the second boss says. There a few potential mistranslated descriptions.

Game is too easy - I know there are harder difficulties, but i don't know how to access them.

Is it perfect? Absolutely not. It's extremely messy currently. The translation is spotty at best (literally in many cases, as some of the subtitles are in English, and others are in Chinese, and not every voiceover has even an attempt at subtitling), the tooltips are sometimes far, far too obtuse (things like mechanics not being explained, probabilities for something to occur left completely open-ended, etc.), there are definitely still bugs, and there is a suspiciously large number of visuals/themes that are lifted from pre-existing games.

But it's honestly just fun to play. The synergies and scaling build really fast and hard, which makes progression very exciting, and there are a TON of different ways you can build that can all be successful. There is a simplicity to the actual play that some may not appreciate, but it works perfectly for me. As it stands, you have either 3 or 4 abilities to utilize at any given time. I prefer it that way, personally, but I can see where others would prefer more. I actually tend to opt specifically for the builds that eliminate the 4th button because I would rather focus on other things.

The enemies and abilities are complex enough to be challenging in a lot of circumstances (nearing bullet hell levels in a lot of cases), but not so punishing that you have to slam your head against the same boss for hours at a time. I finished my first run about 5 hours into playing, and I'm not the best roguelike player around by any means. Don't let that make it sound too fast or simple, though; I had only unlocked 2 of the 6 base builds at that point, and full clearing only unlocked 2 more of them. There is a ton of replay potential. Maybe not as much as Hades or Dead Cell, but still plenty to keep you entertained for only $18.

For story, it's a complete fail. The obtuse translations that do exist are nowhere near enough to give you even a clue what's going on, the voiceovers aren't translated, and it has the sort of barely coherent, hazy storytelling that is typical of Chinese high fantasy (think Wuxia movies) and that can make it difficult to understand even when the translation IS perfect, which this is clearly not. Buuut you don't always need that much story in a mechanics-heavy roguelike anyway, so it doesn't really bother me.

Die-hard roguelike players: 7/10, definitely worth buying, and has 8 or 9/10 potential with fixes and refinement
General gamers: 6/10, maybe wait for the rest of the bugsquashes and translations to be finished, but you also won't be completely disappointed if you try it now.
Casual gamers: 3/10, nah. The issues with the game can make it very, very confusing if you're not the type to dig into these kinds of games on the regular, and there is 0 comprehensible story to fall back on.",1643319698,1643319698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Il start by simply saying that for the price, this game is well worth it - but i will probably never return to this game again, and the reason for this is that the devs have no idea how to handle difficulty.

I wont get into the sounds and looks of the game since frankly, you can judge them for yourself in the trailer above here. I personally found the look really neat, but the music boring and standard - you make up your own mind.

Let's start with the good stuff;

The combat during the first 3 difficulties feel smooth and fun, something akin to a faster-paced Hades where the attackspeed is counted in nano-seconds instead of attacks per second.

The ability to have 6 different ""classes"" or builds or whatever you wanna call them with 2 variations of each at the beginning feels great aswell (the first 3 difficulties) 

The different items or ""relics"" or ""elixirs"" (depending on where in the game you read about them. Their translation isnt up to snuff yet.) have a really cool feature of doing different things depending on where you equip them - giving the same item different uses with different builds. They also vary between synergising with a specific build or with itself in some cases - so having 4 of the same item isnt always a bad thing.

The weapons, or ""excaliburs"" as the game calls them, are also pretty nice with cool random buffs and each weapon having a synergy with either one passive skill or item in the game, making it feel really neat when you just happen to find a weapon that synergises with your items or choice of passives.

The meh stuff;

The bosses. 
The ones that dont just run up to you and hit you or put down the big ""Dont stand in the fire"" attack instead have these invulnerable states that pose no threat and merely adds to sinking you down. The last boss on the final difficulty is a nightmare due to him going invulnerable every 10 seconds and doing this ""dangerous"" super attack that you can literally always walk away from with no threat to you whatsoever, all it does is stop the game for 20 seconds and then allow you to keep hitting him - more on this particular bastard below.

The enemy variations.
The enemies are fairly few and where there is some difference you quickly realise they are just skins. and later in the difficulties all enemies are showing up in all different locations causing the variations to become even more repetetive.

The really really really BAD;

The fucking difficulty.
Jesus H Christ the difficulty. 
This game is NOT a hard game, its just a VERY taxing game. il try to explain - The difficulties dont really add more difficulty, all they do is beef up the enemies hp and armor. 
The bosses gain no new mechanics, just ALOT more hp and armor, making you able to easily evade everything they throw at you but instead deal 1% damage every few seconds or so ending up taking time and not skill to beat.

The regular mobs gets the same treatment and in the last difficulty just clearing an area can be you permastunning every single mob on the map and doing thousands of damage per second to them with no threat to your life whatsoever - you will just feel the slog as you slooooooowly drain away their hp.

Then you will have the CC immune mobs that wont stay still when you hit them and jump around making it take even longer. 

They also add some demon-fish tentacle that spawns every 30 seconds or so, on the 4th difficulty 1 pops up and the last difficulty 3 of them pops up at the same time - this once again IS NO THREAT. it merely forces you to run around for abit wasting even more time to an already EXTREMELY slow gameplay pace that wont threaten your run in the least.

And the final nail in the coffin and main-reason to why im so burned out on this game. The final, fucking, boss.

The only reason i stuck around long enough to kill him is that Roguelikes and roguelites is my cocain. I need to clear them to move on - and boy, i HATED the last couple of hours in this game due to the fact that i knew this guy was coming up.

The first 75% of his bar isnt a problem, he stands there and you swing at him, unmolested for about 10 minutes. 
then he reaches his 25% mark and decides that enough is enough. 
He then starts calling down aoe attacks on the ground, basically all the time - these in turn occasionally turn into poison pools that apply a debuff to you that deal more damage the longer you fight him. 
Then every 10-15 seconds he turns invulnerable, teleports to the middle of the arena and teleports you in there with him, he then begins charging some doom-attack which you can easily walk out of and then he continues to rain down poison pools and rince repeat forever.

Doesnt sound so bad, the thing is - these pools NEVER go away. so pretty soon the entire arena will be filled with this extremely damaging aoe fields. and youre still doing 1% every few seconds with him going invulnerable for his attack every 10-15 seconds. Btw, this whole thing clocks in at about 10 seconds - so thats you not being able to hit him in a field of poison every 15 seconds for 10 seconds. 

This boss is only a DPS check and this wouldnt have been a huge problem if it wasnt for the fact that the devs went haywire when it came to adding armor/hp buffs on the enemies. were not talking x10 or something, more like x50 (im not even kidding). 

Killing this guy was not fun. I didnt feel ""yeah, take that you asshole, now to try another build"" - i felt ""finally, now i can play something fun.""

Ending this slog of a difficulty with a boss that essentially is only a dps test is the worst idea imo.

This coupled with certain items just not working against bosses makes you really have to plan your builds instead of making do with what you get - and that goes against what i like with Roguelites. All together with the difficulty only being artificial to certain builds just not working at all, to boring harmless meatwalls called bosses standing in your way to the only real threat which is the final boss (or possibly the tiger-lord in the room before him) just makes me soured on the whole game.

Im sure there are some people with more addiction than me that loves this aspect of hitting the same target for an extended period of time with no threat to themselves, but personally i prefer the difficulty of games like Hades that add things other than just massive HP to the enemies.

In Hades ive unlocked and done everything and I still come back to it just cos the gameplay loop is fun, its challenging and im still enjoying it.
This game? Ive gotten every unlock and cleared all the difficulties - I cba to get the secret ending, I just dont want to play it anymore.

I still recommend it for the price though, seriously good price.

[b]It's fun, it has potential[/b], but damn it is unpolished, and i have a lot of criticism for it. 

You can read up on other reviews for pros, I'll elaborate on criticisms here. 

Here you build your characters using Relics, Sect Skills, and Excalibur(weapon). You can only equip max of 4 relics, but you can keep on piling Sect skills, and equip only 1 excalibur. 

In most roguelike, you constantly build your hero till the endgame, every upgrade is additive and gives you the incentive to look for a certain build, not here. The problem with relics is, there are tons of variety, probably 15+, but they don't sync with each other, and here's the deal, everything you get is totally random. So essentially you get your 4 relics very soon but in the later stages, they keep on giving you relics as upgrades, which is totally useless. 

So imagine in Hades, if you get Zeus boons, you know they'll have more Zeus boons later on so that you can build it up and hopefully land that ultimate Zeus boons, and that they limit it so that you have only 4-5 gods' boons appear in 1 playthrough. But here, imagine you get Zeus boons, but there's 15+ other gods' boons that appear that doesn't sync with Zeus, and that you might get Zeus once....and never again.

Imagine in Hades where you can buy different boons, but any boons you buy adds to the character, here the shops sell you 4 relics, but if you have equipped 4 of them, essentially all the shop items are useless, because you have to replace your existing relics.

Then you have your weapon. Some high tier weapons have bonuses if you have 2 specific relics, but the stupid thing is, those 2 relics may never appear in you entire playthrough, so you can't prepare for any build and rely purely on luck. The only thing that keeps on upgrading is Sect skills. I have tons more criticism but I'll probably write it on the discussion forum. 

Also, some people say there's tons of playstyle variety...I tell you honestly..NO, there's only 2, close or range. There's no animation differences to all the weapon, no length no width differences. All the different builds amount to the starting area where you can choose whether you want your weapon to deal fire/ice/lightning/poison damage etc, or you can choose that your range is now more powerful. Don't expect anything like Hades or Devil Slayer:Raksasi where you have different weapons and they work differently.

It's still fun, and I want to support the developers, but it's so unpolished. If Hades is diamond, Warm Snow is still carbon.",1643135961,1643258885,True,44,0,0.775200426578521729,0,True,False,False

This game is so much fun and easy to get into, there's not a big learning curve and after my second death I've yet to die again as I've found a really decent build since it's easy to catch on to how this game works.

The art style is beautiful and the mechanics are simple.

The boss fights are actually a lot of fun and though I don't find them as challenging they do make you use your reflexes which I enjoy a lot coming from Vindictus, Nioh, and Monster Hunter. 

The build customization is what makes this game worth every penny imo; there are so many options to go with depending on your skill and play style and it makes you feel like you have control over how you fight which is very nice and makes you want to play over and over to see if you can get an even better build & weapon. 

The soundtracks are also very interesting and usually I would turn music down to 0% but not this time as it's very peaceful to listen to while you slash away enemies.

This game really gives me old school Contra vibes with the art style and boss sequences and gives a nostalgic feel like I'm a kid playing on my Sega genesis again. 

Overall I give this at 9/10 and will definitely support the devs in their future projects! Well done with this one!

And as such you go trough rogue-like dungeons collecting random upgrades , tho to be perfectly frank the list of upgrades at my current gametime is rather limited, I know there are unlocks down the road so obviously it will be expanded. Regardless it is easy to go for a build of your choosing.

If I had any complaints it is about the Dashing mechanic and auto-attack range.

First the so called ""flicker"" dash has wierd delay at the ""arrival"" point , which makes the combat more clumsy than it needs to be, this has also been an issue for me in Hades UNTIL you unlock double dash, because you can rapidly switch directions. I don't think there is double dash in this game , probably because it isn't really needed.

The auto attack range is rather low on the first 3 strikes and then there's a longer attack on 4th.
It's little bit short for my taste.

So far I got to the 2nd Zone end boss and the fights don't feel too hard and will become much easier on consequitive playtroughs , there is a Upgrade tree which gives significant buffs.
You get Souls-Like Estus flasks
Around 50%+ damage boost , decent amount of attack speed, various foraging upgrades so it's safe to say
that as you expand on this you will be 1 shotting things.

I feel like the difficulty is too frontloaded , the upgrades feel OP , compared to default state, which might result in players having really bad experience first and experience that is too easy later.

All in all as a fan of this type of game I give it 8/10 if you don't know what you're getting into , this is

Otherwise really nice and solid game. Great work developers. Beautiful fluid art, fast paced fun.

Game is completely a giant troll. I mean that. The bosses are all complete pranksters.

At any point you think you have won. There's always another 3 phases to a boss and they just don't die. 
They will probably one shot you out of nowhere. Always keep this in mind.

Clear inspiration from Hades, which people say a lot. - Dark Souls, Sekiro and Nioh. 
Warm Snow feels like the Tale of Immortal version / rogue-like take on these types of games, all the while staying true to it's Chinese Mythology and Wooshoo/cultivation aesthetic.

Very satisfying combat and dynamic flashy moves in the way of skills/books and weapons bringing powers called Excalibur. It is not King Arthur's legendary mythic sword. But more of a unique passive that each weapon has, and effects attached that also sync/work with the items you pick as core moves, your dash, power, or utility, etc.

Makes for the fun and experimental creative side of the game.

Originally I was sceptical about this game, but I downloaded and played the free demo, upon completing it I enjoyed it and bought the game. No regrets. Good game.

Besides the common bugs & the time slow effects which I found way more annoying than helpful or ""cool matrix effect."" 
It's still taking me time to get used to the slow. 

Really solid awesome rogue-like. 

Please put the slow time in options of gameplay settings because it kills the fast pace fluid combat, that's otherwise smooth and usually kills me! When things were going smooth! All because out of nowhere my character slows, so I can't react in-time properly and it's more like: wtf okay? stop this?

A good example is taking away the controller from me like an annoying big brother.

Anyways, I look forward to future updates and releases! Good work Developers!",1642861821,1643041283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As everyone else has said, this game is Hades: if you've played your fill of that game and want a different but weaker in every aspect clone, Warm Snow is your ticket. The concept is strong, the parts are all here, but the polish is completely lacking.

Part of this is a translation problem, without a doubt.As the player, you'll have an impossible time telling how different abilities actually interact with each other. Are bonuses multiplicative? Additive? Who knows. There isn't a player profile with numbers, the tooltips are inadequate, and abilities have unexpected results. Planning your build is replaced by praying your interpretation is approximately true. (It won't be, half the time.)

Even beyond the lack of a profile and adequate English explanations, the game suffers from major balance issues. In Hades, you need the grind to win. Winning was an excruciatingly hard process. Here, some combinations are so completely, senselessly broken you'll win without effort. I facerolled the entire game on perhaps my sixth attempt - after dying to the first major boss every other time, with hardly any of the unlockables unlocked - on the basis of mechanics I couldn't possibly explain to you. But the bosses died when I hit them, so hey, victory.

If this game had been beta-tested and tweaked for even a few more months, it could be quite solid. The controls are tight, and the developers brought some interesting ideas to the table. As it exists, it scratches an itch left by an infinitely-stronger predecessor, but fails to stick core expectations; a stellar roguelite experience demands an interface by which a player can plan. Warm Snow is a fun, random crapshoot of affixes and abilities, but it lacks replayability due to loss of control.

However, I am having fun. The animation is really cool, and it seems that there's a-lot of vertical progression (for a rouge-lite).

The game is absolutely amazing aesthetically and the build variety within it is super neat, you unlock different ""classes"" from beating the bosses each playing differently, and each having 2 subclasses, and within each class there are skill modifying passives you can get combined with the generic ones shared across all classes. Other than that there are randomly rolled weapons with a base weapon type that buffs you if you get a specific combination of items, like turning your throwing knife item into frost damage and increasing the damage if you have another item for it. 

The game falls into the middle ground of ""between run progression is too strong"" and ""you can win without"", they range from straight up just boosting damage by 30%, to doubling healing, to adding other effects, i almost beat the last boss with some 20 statpoints out of 100 ish unlocked, but couldnt heal anymore due to running out of healing items since i only had 2, which i could have had 4 or 5, on top of a free once per run revive if i had more points, so at moments like those it can feel frustrating to lose since you know you could have won, not by being better, but by having more stats. Rough estimate if for all of them would be doubling health and doubling damage atleast, on top of the entire utility tree.


One of the downsides to the game as it stands right now though is that the english translation is... rough. If you play some of them becomes more obvious, but some of them are still quite confusing, such as ""backdraft"" being ignite, and ""sheath"" being your recall sword ability. 

Outside of a few bugs though the game has been super smooth, only one i got was the boss kept attacking after it was dead but i could still run to the next area, so it was just unfortunate. Some have had trouble with bosses being immortal, but so far havent managed to run into it yet.

Regardless of issues i might have i keep coming back and i keep seeing a ton of ways to build a character, with each class playing differently and there being real choices and consequences in your skill selection such as 300% more damage done but also double damage taken, or super tanky stats but cant dash. If you are looking for a game where you can bite your teeth into optimizing a specific build then this is for you.

I have two complaints and it's not much, the graphics are a little wonky and take a bit of getting used to but that's honestly nothing. The second complaint is just the subtitles kind of zip by, I can read them as a speed reader but I'm not sure if that can be said for the rest of the population. Same goes for the dialogue boxes when the NPC's are talking to you.

Overall a blast for the first 30 minutes I've been in. 

The skills are neat, has your standard skill trees like in Gunfire Reborn. There's a ton of options for builds and weapon customization. For instance you do extra damage with ""drunk"" and if your build has fire in it, you start doing DOT damage while they're drunk and on fire. That made me laugh. 

The boss fights are fun, some have some surprising mechanics but in the beginning it's easy and the difficulty only goes up from there until you wonder what the hell just hit you. 

The real icing on the cake though I feel is the weapon/skill build ""class"" customization where you can either hurl wind swords or hoard your swords to be an unkillable tank with defensive stats through the roof. Have a taser fetish where you shock the hell out of enemies and where a shiny cape while doing it? You've got that too. 

The mobs an AI feel extremely similar to Hades or Sentient K where they just bum rush you and enemy archers do the enemy archer thing. Where it kind of shines is the snap inputs in mini-boss and big boss rights where they pop in your face and timing is key, which makes it a little more interesting and fun. 

Maps are beautiful and so is the art. You're just a Ronin/Wuxia warlord running around slaying evil townspeople that sucked up a bad batch of snowflakes in a House of Flying Daggers x Demon Slayer x Onimusha/Nioh kind of demon/zombie/cancer pigs warfare world. 

I'll write a better review as time goes on but so far it's a solid 9/10 for me only because translations and dialogue speed is a little fast. 

TL;DR The monkey boss is a B@$%@RD.

Edit: Upon further review, this game is a challenge when you decide to Russian roulette your build and pray for the RNG to give you what you need.

If you like games like Dead Cell, Hades, I think you are going to have a blast playing this game. Recommended!",1642760245,1642760245,True,1,0,0.528487205505371094,0,True,False,False

If you are going to even think about buying the game, check out the demo first and that will give you a definitive answer as to whether or not you like it. There is a lot more to the game than in the demo (Obviously), but personally i wish there were more content, and more of a direction, plus i cant read chinese, so some of the stuff in the game might clear up my confusions and/or hopes if i could. This isnt very original or constructive, but i hope it brought you to a conclusion that can help you or you are happy with. There are 5 different class statues, 2 different types of class per statue, and if its too easy for you, when you beat the game you can change the difficulty at the main statue of the BOOBA lady that the people are worshiping at the temple/ your home base. Let me know if you want to know more. Most of the stuff you can figure out from videos on youtube and twitch, as well as the demo though.

Pros:
 - Solid rogue-like with a lot of options and builds.
 - Great music.
 - Wuxia setting and a darker tone one to boot, which you don't see too often.
 - Passable story.
 - Responsive combat and controls are intuitive.
 - Boss fights are fun

Cons:
 - Much like any souls-like game, once you've memorised the boss patterns; the game becomes trivial. I think randomise their abilities and pattern a bit more and extend the game with even more boss fights and this should be a moot point!
 - Some scenes are unskippable in boss fights which can make repeating them such a chore.
 - Some text isn't translated still such as the elixir distilling results and some of the story voice acting. However, everything in the game is translated to a point that is definitely more than passable.",1642715844,1642715844,True,29,0,0.731299459934234619,0,True,False,False

Really tough in parts, as you would expect, but the feeling of joy is so strong once you get a really powerful build going. For example I was struggling to get past a boss, but on the next run I killed it in seconds.

Strong recommend.

Fundamentally it is a roguelike (roguelite) dungeon crawler along the lines of The Binding of Isaac or, more accurately to its clear inspiration, Hades. The gameplay feels very much like Hades, in a good way, and with plenty of tweaks to make it stand out as its own game. The combat is tight and responsive, enemies generally have good, clear telegraphs for attacks, and the upgrades are uniquely versatile.  

To speak on the upgrade system, any of the upgrade items you pick up during a run can be applied to one of your four ""inventory"" slots. Depending on which slot you choose, that item will bestow a completely different effect. In one slot it might grant you an active skill which allows you to poison enemies, while in a different slot it will buff poison damage from other sources. This means that you must not only choose which items you want to bring with you, but also exactly which of their effects you want to apply. Even in only one run I have already seen the intricate web of decisions this can lead to.  

As for art, the game looks wonderful. The enemies, characters, and environments are all beautiful (or hideous and horrifying, when they need to be) and I very much enjoyed just looking at the game. It's colorful and creative and all around fun.  

The only real criticism I have so far is that not everything is fully translated. I don't expect English voice acting, but I would like to know what the big shopkeep lady is rambling about, just with some subtitles.",1642593239,1642593239,True,125,4,0.842430710792541504,0,True,False,False
