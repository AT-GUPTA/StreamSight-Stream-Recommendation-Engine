as a mortal kombat lover...someone who his first mk game was MKU3, im disappointed right now But like when i had hope in cyberpunk 2033, im having hope in mk1, sadly im going to make this a negative review because the problem is not just bugs or glitches...

[h2]Kampaign (Towers, Invasion)[/h2]
The lack of content show itself here because in Towers you can only do klassic towers nothing more and that is a big downfall... and in other hand the problem that Invasion brings is the fact that towers of time and krypt combined together and they give way less content that even one of those gave..
[b]MK9[/b] had test your luck, test your might, test your sight, test your strike and dont make me start to talk about that 300 challenge tower.
[b]MKX[/b] had test your luck and test your might and living towers and krypt.
[b]MK11[/b] had towers of time and krypt.

[h2]Versus (Online)[/h2]
it is cool that game is going to have more online mode to do but game really need to have rooms back
 
[h2]Kustomize(Fighter, Kameo)[/h2]
We need more than 1 custom slots for customizing characters 
at least 5 slots for fighters and 3 slots for kameos 
Randomizer Favorites is cool and nice touch but still not enough

[h2]Premium items (Shop)[/h2]
microtransactions are kinda getting out of hand 10$ for a skin!?
and that is not even the crazy part for me the crazy part is some gears like raidens hat or mileenas sias cost more than they should and beside those seasonal stuff that you can get by spending Seasonal Kredits that you can earn by playing Invasion are great things but when the season ends and those items will be back for a full new skin price is too much

[h2](Bugs / Glitches)[/h2]
these are the least problems that game has but overall they are problems that im aware of...

they are bugs for some brutality animations like Geras hammer disappears after doing from another time brutality or Reptile will turn around after doing damn Tasty! brutality and etc..

invasion has a Kompilation that it will tell you how much % of each map you completed but when i quit the game and start the game it will go back to 0%...

[h2](General problems)[/h2]
can anyone believe the fact that the only reason that im not trying to play as Nitara is her voice actress?! that is insane and that is enough to make me not want to play as her and that hurts me 

give ermac a mask.. fun fact the maskless gear is very rare in mk games but man, ermac maskless is the last thing i want to earn in this game

NRS thought that placing a number 1 after the game title was enough to reboot the franchise. Needless to say, innovating and rebooting a game takes way more than that.
For example, take a look at Capcom and its SF6. Despite its problems (not few) it's overall a solid game that Capcom has been able to refresh both in terms of gameplay and visuals.
NRS seems unable to do so yet again. Here's why:


[h2]1-GAMEPLAY.[/h2]

-[b]Kameos[/b] are not the solution. In fact, it's a chaotic system, visually cluttering the screen and introducing a potential ""pay2win"" factor, because some Kameos might favor your chosen character way more than others and if you don't have them you might be at a disadvantage.
I've seen how Chameleon allows to considerably lengthen combos, and that is not good news.

By the way, why is my fight buddy on the sidelines while I fight? Conceptually makes no sense. I'd rather see my character fight alone.
Kameos are a silly idea from the start. Is the game better or more fun now? No it isn't.

-[b]The juggling system[/b] is on steroids here.
I don't care if it's the core brand mechanics of MK, it's an old one dating back to the first MK in 1992. 
If these mechanics by now favor experienced players able to juggle an opponent to oblivion (maybe with the help of a macro) for making just one wrong poke the game becomes frustrating and inaccessible to casual players.

Again, look at what Capcom did with Modern Controls in order to make the game more accessible. They pondered a solution to welcome new players, not to shoo them away. That is called [i]thinking[/i]. 
Player numbers speak for themselves when compared to other fighting games.
I've heard people are having fun with Tekken 8 as well, happily transitioning to that.

Overall where a game like SF6 is dynamic, engaging, stimulates creative strategic play, MK1 is dull, repetitive and frustrating. 
NRS better do something drastic about it. We are no longer in 1992.

Allow me to add that the sum of [b]extended juggling+fatal blows+fatalities[/b] when you think about it are instances of the game where one of the two players becomes completely inactive, passively staring at the screen.
While I won't suggest that Fatalities need to be removed, as they are a foundation of MK's identity, the rest has to be revised precisely to reduce not to increase player passivity. 

The sum of these gameplay decisions heavily contribute to boredom, frustration and the sensation that this game is slow and sluggish.


[h2]2-VISUALS[/h2]

Technically the game looks fantastic and facial animations in the story are some of the best I've ever seen in any games. The acting is wonderful as well, very realistic and lifelike.

The problem is a general lack of style which again shows how NRS is unable to renew its own brand even from this aspect.
Everything is ""well lit"" like a stage and looks quite artificial at times. It lacks atmospheric and thematic feel for the most part, especially in-game scenarios and characters look like action figures in a diorama. Characters' skin looks like dull rubber and overall design choices feel dated.

Hyperrealism is a fine direction to maintain, but that doesn't exclude diving deeper into a more iconic art direction. It could be a particular way of lighting scenes, color schemes and saturation levels, textures, effect...There's plenty of room to explore.

I'm not a Capcom fanboy, but let me once again use that as a comparison. 
In SF4 Capcom revised the game's presentation by introducing the ink splash effects adding a new iconic identity to the series.
In SF6 they took that further and also worked on renewing character design and improving gameplay, but still staying true to their origins. It still looks and feels like SF, but a contemporary one. 
They revised any wrongdoings of the previous releases without losing the overall direction of the game. Now SF6 is so well done that even their lame excuses for a story can be...excused (almost).
In short: they refined their product.

NRS doesn't only put no effort in renewing the overall presentation of MK, but plays the cheapest of cards for the story: [i]multiverse[/i]. Sigh! 
The MK universe has never been more irrelevant than now, where anyone can be good, bad, male, female, blue, red, dead or alive.

It takes more than a flexible stick and two iconic moves for a character to be named Tanya. That is NOT Tanya. Rain is not Rain, it's a new mage-like character who happens to be playing with water.

They already messed up Dvorah transitioning from MK10 to MK11, but this new type of mess is unprecedented. NRS' continuous revisions of their own characters, even new ones, show they have no grasp of their own conceptual work nor are willing to present a consistent world.

At the same time for some reason they thought it would be a good idea to reintroduce a bad character design like that of a grappler dressed like a spartan, with the facial paint of a corny rock-star and named like a Japanese woman. I can do better by throwing dices.

By now NRS appears to be alien to its own product. On top of it, MK has become more and more diluted by the continuous injection of third party franchises who end up stealing the show (Marvel stuff, 80s characters, etc).

The core material of MK needs to be reinforced, not thrown away like a displaceable secondary costume with relativistic story lines and color-sets subjugated to stronger third party characters.

I know what most say, that it's not NRS, it's actually WB's fault. It might very well be, but we can't say that for sure. Regardless, NRS is still responsible for their own choices.


[h2]3-INVASIONS[/h2]

I didn't hate it too much, decent offline diversion. I completed it and I tolerated it. However now that I want coins to throw into the ""items lottery"" I realize that I might need to keep re-playing Invasions...Not happy about it.


[h2]4-MICROTRANSACTIONS[/h2]

Horrid.
This is where both NRS and the aforementioned Capcom suck balls. Between the two NRS is a bit better because at least you do collect some freebies for your characters, unlike SF6 where you just collect them for your useless avatar.

Tragically, this micro-transaction bull-crap pays well and it's the new business model within the sorry state of today's games.

The ones complaining about it are here writing reviews like this one, but the numbers of those who silently pay is way greater, so this business model is successful and sadly here to stay.

I personally choose not to spend anything beyond the base game price. Will see how far I can go.


[h2]CONCLUSIONS:[/h2]

I had down-voted SF6 as well for its micro-transaction policies and lack of interesting content to be unlocked in the game. Capcom needs a slap for that too, but man...I feel like editing my SF6 rating to thumbs-up after playing this lame thing called MK1, because SF6 can be quite fun to play and it's very solid online. MK1 is neither.

After 60+ play time hours I can tell you I still don't know which character to main, because I don't truly enjoy any. At least I got Scarlet in MK11 and Jade looked great.
Whatever I play in MK1 feels repetitive. 
Other players play repetitive too. I'm bored at seeing them abusing the same two moves and combos, and bored with my own strategies for doing the same. It's not a new problem. It's how MK has always been, but it's now worse than ever.
I can't believe what a boring experience this has become.

I won't mention bugs, online play or lack of players cos you might have already read about it elsewhere.

I would just recommend to try the demos of other competitors first and see for yourself, but if you decide to buy this game wait for a discount at least. Don't worry, the more you wait the more they might fix bugs (maybe). However, the game itself is what it is.",1708263628,1708968231,False,3,0,0.531815290451049805,0,True,False,False

Buy Tekken 8 or Street Fighter 6. 

I did have a long review praising the game for essentially everything, but after months of being released and playing with friends, I just can't justify this game being installed when its competitors are better in every way. They ruined the story they were building in the last 3 missions, the seasonal content adds to that as well. The characters, designs, and aesthetic are perfectly refined and some character overhauls are amazing (Baraka and Reptile), but it lacks anything interesting in regards to replay-ability. Not including the fact they charge $10 for a FATALITY. The main aspect of the game that made it famous. $20 skins as well, when Tekken and Street Fighter give you FREE options to overhaul the entire character.

MK1 already is way more fun than MK11 Way more creative that MK11 soo many fun things but it has problems as well but offline ?!? MK11 was better.

about MK1:

   *Main Roster: the main roster without Kameos is pretty balance.
   * KAMEO: these asist characters make every single game different. it's so fun. but it's broken. it's the part that make the game unbalance. for examble Reiko is ok by him self or any kameo but give him Darrius he becomes broken. Raiden is ok but give him Jax or Cyrex he is broken. same with Baraka and Cyrex. Kameos make the game broken.
   * COMBOS: man combos looks amazing they are cool to watch and cool to do
   * STORY: NRS always wasn't good at it they always had stories since MK vs DC but all of them has really stupid problem. but this one has less problems and in some way it's so great to watch and watching all the references to the old games. it's just great. and one thing that I always said was why we have to play story mode only with good guys, I want to play with bad guys too and finally I got it. it's great. SOOOOO FUN
   * Gameplay: everything that I hated about MK11 Gameplay is gone and everything that I love from MK11 is still in the game. one thing that I thought MK11 had and was a biiiiig problem was the fact that the game was so forgiveness for every bad move that you did and MK1 get said BYE BYE to all of them even combo breaker gets all your meters and it's great.
   * Kombat League: it 3 out of 5 now and you can't change your character after a lose match only Kameo. so you can't change to a freaking counter pick every time that you lose your first match. you have to learn the match up. it's AMAZING.
   * Invasions: have love and hate feeling with this one. I like Krypt more but it fine and looks cooler than Krypt.one of the coolest things in fighting games are doing combos and learning them or watching them now imagine every time that your opponent move the have armor. every time that they taunt they have armor, there are 10 things in one match that stun you during you combos. it's the worst thing about the game offline. I had matches that my character couldn't move because ever 1 second something just stuned both of us and I waited for the time to ran out. let's be honest invasions just looks cool but the challenges are boring as F. survive mode ?!?! after level 15 you don't even move and you will survive any way :D. it's dumb 
   * The game is not Optimized on PC. it crashes sometimes and loading time was freaking bad so I had to move the game to SSD
   * Poke mashing still works even with Down 1 being -8 and if you land on it will jail the other player it's still annoying.
   * so many broken things :D it's a game from NRS so yea we all knew it would be broken at probably will be. it's kinda fun but not a big fan of it ether. 
   * HAVIK DLC :| it's unlockable for free with playing story mode and there is still a DLC for it. same as Frost for MK11. it's a s**ty move. don't buy it
   * Rushed and it's soo Buggy
over all it's really fun but like I said at this point it has problems maybe they fix it later but even now I really recommend it.
It's crazy fun
----------
Update: it's a shame since it is kinda fun in so many things but at this point in every part the game is so broken that is not even playable. desynchronized issue was in the game and some how with new update not only it came back but they even added something that make you game crash. it's so broken and unbalanced and unfinished and even with all of these problems they don't spend any time to fix it. they just charge you for 10$ for fatalities. and even the rewarding part and offline part is sooo  bad and not rewarding. it's just some color pallets that it doesn't even worth your time. at this point like the legend said ""IT'S THE BIGGEST PIECE OF DOG S**T*

Tiene un gameplay que sólo premia al jugador por jugar con cierto jugador o kameo, desde día 1 apenas si tiene contenido y está tapado en micropagos. Si, MK11 también los tenía, pero no era necesario trabajar como esclavo para conseguir una única skin después de 2 o 3 meses de grindeo.

The core gameplay is absolutely amazing and in my opinion the best Mortal Kombat has ever been, all the roster is actually viable to play even though it's way tougher to play some kharacters compared to others. The Kameo system, whilst weird at first, allows you do play in a completely different play style without swapping kharacters and allow you to do completely different combos on the same kharacter.

2 - The Story
It's honestly great, Mortal Kombat has had so many time resets and loose plot threads that it needed to address. This story manages to tie it all up neatly.

3 - The Kontent
Now onto the worst part of the game, the kontent or more accurately the lack there of. At the current time of writing this near the end of Invasions Season 3, this game has 5 modes of offline play; Story, Invasions, Towers, local versus and local tournament. And online play has 3; Kasual versus, King of the Hill and Kombat League. Compared to MKX and MK11 this is a massive downgrade. Hopefully though season 4 will add all the kontent we were promised and that should've been in the base game.

4 - Some Minor Annoyances
When you first boot up the game please do yourself a favour and go to settings disable release check, I have no clue why this is on by default but the controls are so much better without it.
Also if you have an NVIDIA graphics and are experiencing a lot of stuttering you might want tweak a few settings.

Well, Kameos are great, the face models are great, 21/22 characters have great voice actors (if you don't know, just search mk1 bad voice acting and I'm sure you'll find what I mean). The character designs are probably the best they've ever been, and their personalities are alright, but the ending is a bit disengaging. But it also ruins the story partly as it invalidates basically everything. the game runs fine, although if you have my setup around mid (I don't exactly know but rtx 2060 with i7 9th gen) the game takes longer than most would like to load. Tekken 8 and street fighter 6 both load extremely quickly, and when you consider the actual length of matches in fighting games, MK1 simply takes too long to load for how much you play per match.
There are a few less combos per character, like 3 or 4, which doesn't sound like much until you look at the combo screen. They did however add some aerial combos, but it just feels lacking. there's only really 2 or 3 combos which you will use (at low to maybe middle skill level) since you're paying so much attention on the kameos. 
Overall Mk1 both innovates and regresses in certain areas, which makes it a questionable buy for some but for the majority they will probably enjoy it. Out of Street fighter 6, Tekken 8, and Mortal kombat 1, I would rank them: Tekken, street fighter, then mortal kombat though. Right now, MK1 offers much less than the alternatives, and personally, there's no character i really want to play. it's nice coming back for the new character every month, but I play a bit then leave. the game just doesn't have as much as the other two, the music is worse, the game runs worse, and the story mode is good until the end where it falls off, despite the reference to an earlier game.

One of the few positives is that the gameplay is very fun and kameos can change up your gameplay greatly and makes picking your team combination fun and suitable for your play style. The hits feel heavy and connect smoothly. Combos are nice and flashy . The game also gives you plenty of free gear and content for just playing the game and this is rare for a modern fighting game. Other than these positives I highly recommend avoiding this game until the major issues are fixed. There is still a great fighting games under the pile of trash.

-The grinding is taken ridiculously too long and boring.
-Story plot's not bad, with some lore swaps and backstory got reset.
-Gameplay fun. Microtransactions sucks.
-No Stage Fatality? Why, Ed Boon? Why?!

That's all, folks. But if you want my rambling version of a review; then please proceed with your excellent reading skill. Otherwise just stop here. Thank you for your time.

Rambling Review:
This is the very first time I played M1K on Steam Deck with the highest graphic settings. Completely beyond expectations and much to my disbelief, it's excellent!

But due to the product not released until September 20th 2023, then I should wait to post this review which I had already wrote on September 14th. Haha... was getting excited too soon. :3

Yeah, at that point; the game still just at the earliest release, so some glitches and bugs can be found, sometimes the graphics drops a little then goes back to normal. But didn't lagging and runs perfectly smooth at the very first day of launch back then on September 14th. Now, the glitches and bugs are rarely found.

I'm sure Ed and his awesome team will making updates regularly with new patches so it will be finally close to perfection. Daily or may be weekly.

Overall; I love everything from this new era. The costume designs are awesome, stages are beautifully done. And most of all . . . the violently brutal, gory but in a good bloodiest and a fun way of this franchise's most unique feature we all knew and loved; all brand new fatalities!

Story mode's pacing is a bit slow and boring. But then, starting from middle it's get interesting, and especially chapter 15 was totally mind blowing. what an epic conclusion and I won't give any spoilers, so chillax. :3

Konquest mode is great and fun only at first try, but then getting tedious and too repetitive after awhile.

The only thing I dislike is the microtransactions or MTX for mostly everything from accessories to skins. That is if you don't have much time to get it all and just decide to buy them with real cash, you do you. I just felt like it's better if we can collect them all simply by playing it often and exploring, without spending any hard earned money, just like any old school games were.

But yeah; It feels truly like a new game of Mortal Kombat I've ever played since the 1992 version. That coin munchers had a long line of queue and here we are now in 2023, with longer lines of gamers online, worldwide! Who would've known it can stand the tide of time. :3

Looking forward to the next new era of MK games in years to come (... hopefully with no micropayments next time, please!). From here on to the future of this series. 

M1K. It's in our blood, and it has begun!

The only other title in the MK series I've ever played was the first one released all the way back in 1992, when I played it on a old Sega Genesis my aunt had. That being said, a game released all the way back in the early nineties is FAR better then this garbage that I made the mistake of buying. My original reason for this purchase was that I saw a bunch of videos online about this game, and from what I saw it looked pretty good. However, this first impression lasted for about an hour and a half. First off, this game runs pretty poorly on pcs. I had to lower the graphics by a decent amount to fix the sometimes 2 minute long loading screens. And i'm not using a potato pc either, I have a pretty good graphics card and CPU. After I finally load in, I start to notice the large amount of microtransactions shoved in my face. Single fighters for $8 USD, packs selling kameos for $20 USD (that you can unlock anyways just by playing the game), And the infamous Kombat Pack, which comes with around 6 fighters and 5 kameos. While to some people this may sound good for $40, let me explain why it isn't. As of writing this, only Omni-Man and Kameleon (i think) are usable in game, and the rest of the fighters will be added later. This is an absolutely slimy business model and basically spitting in the face of anyone that bought this pack. Imagine this, if you will. Pretend you're sitting in a restaurant, and you order a burger. The waiter comes back with the burger you ordered, but it's only the buns and a piece of lettuce. When you ask him why most of the ingredients are missing, he tells you the rest will be added to the burger later. This has to be one of the most egregious ways I've ever seen a game company scam it's playerbase. It's even worse considering you already spent $70 on the game. And that's just the standard edition! As for the game itself, it's honestly ok in my opinion. The kameo system feels overly cumbersome and not very hashed out, as the wrong kameo can make a fighter go from good to terrible. I've only played for about a few hours, so I don't really have much to say about the gameplay. Gameplay's fun for a bit, but quickly gets pretty boring very quickly, especially against the AI. It's quite a shame I can't refund this. Go play Tekken 8 instead if you want a good fighting game.",1708387244,1708387244,False,4,0,0.5680808424949646,0,True,False,False

Edit for Steam Awards 2023


[UPDATE] Sep 23, 2023

Stutters are gone through various means of swapping monitors and/or disable e-cores. What a hassle. Gonna buy a new rig now anyway since MK1 made me realize that my PC might be outdated for the newer games to come.

I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth.
If you still even remember that name.
But I'm afraid you've been misinformed.
You are not here to receive a gift.
Nor, have you been called here by the individual you assume.
Although, you have indeed been called.
You have all been called here.
Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune.
A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize.
You don't even realize that you are trapped.
Your lust of blood has driven you in endless circles.
Chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber.
Always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.
But, you will never find them, none of you will.

Who somehow found this job listing not intended for you.

I have a feeling that's not what you want.
I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be.

I am remaining as well. I am nearby.

And the memory of everything that started this.
Can finally begin to fade away.
As the agony of every tragedy should.
And to you monsters trapped in the corridors.
Be still, and give up your spirits.

For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps, warm.
Waiting for you after the smoke clears.

The way you lifted others into yours.

I should have known, you wouldn't be content to disappear.
Not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.

Maybe it was just the hype carrying me this long but after 4 months, this game is dead. They had the nerve to charge $70-110 for this incomplete game and then charge $10 for a single fatality....or a single character skin.... wtf WB...bunch of crooks that just take a beloved franchise and then crap all over the fans. Give us a full Mortal Kombat game and stop nickle and dimming us for every little thing. If that's your business model, go make mobile games and leave the real games to people who respect the fans and consumers. I'm never buying another MK game again. Nothing works right, they've only released 2 of the playable characters from the ""Kombat Pack"" that I paid extra for at launch and now they can't even give alaunch day for the next scheduled release... online sucks. It either lags so bad that one of us gets clobbered or you are a God while your opponent just seems to sit there and run their mouth at you. Even the pro players are sick of this BS.

MK11 is definitley better with the skin customination and the versus. its better because you can cancel attacks and create your own pfolie with your fav abillities, you can get out of an attack juggle of your opponent , here you can only once in a while when you have all 3 bars loaded.  This game here lack of button precision, when you do the combo ''e.g A,D,->'' it does the combo, but when you do the same combo but standing at the other side e.g D,A-> it often just wont do the attack on keyboard. Also in MK11 you have 2 different buttons for ''blocking'' and ''extended kombo'' And the fatal blow actually works directly after u push the bottons , in MK1 when you use the fatal blow, the opponent has like 4seconds to react to the fatal blow which is bad for you as the FB-user. Still works but you ned to attack the opponent before to jail him. In MK11 you can place it perfect in the fight and the enemy with good reactions can still dodge it, but its easier to actually attack with the Fatal Blow.

Won't be interested in buying nothing in the ingame store from real money because I already paid for that.

Update: got tired of playing players with teleport movement and ducking with their broadband connections, I think people who play on wifi should watch out if they see their opponent having teleport movement or ducking it means they already know your next move so there's nothing to learn and move on.

Mortal Kombat 1 is a refreshing take to a new series that takes the formula of Liu Kang becoming a fire god, with a new take on the old characters, and others returning to the franchise, who has not met their face in so long, yet an abysmal to the legacy of mortal kombat and its characters as a whole. Especially, with its redundant changes to the characters that are unnecessary like Shao, Johnny, and Shang Tsung. The community is nothing but braindead, the gameplay is terrible and clunky as always, and the animations are nothing but loads of pile cream of shit that I would not wanna see when i'm learning on how to animate.
Story: Amazing, beautiful, and comedic.
Content: Awesome, though it needs a little bit more content then just invasion and towers
Characters: Amazing, and well thought out
Artstyle: Refreshing to look at (It gives off autumn vibes)
Cinematic: The cinematic in Mortal Kombat 1 are improving and improving, such as cutscenes, fatal blow, and fatalities
Music: The music are an excellent take on modernizing the old feels of the Midway era while not carrying away the modern charm they are focusing with.
Now lets get started with the cons:
Players: The main problem with them is that they are too engaged in taking you either in corners, or just flat out block, instead of trying to be stealthy offensive (And there are ones that are toxic)
Online: Online has issues with its internet, the internet connections isn't stable to function during online play. Which suddenly comes with fewer problems, such as hitbox, players connection, and etc.
Fatal Blow startup: While the startup may look awesome, and glory to look at. The main issue with it is how predictable and long it is, to where the opponent would just see a small cutscene, and realizes that they need to block. Ruining the unpredictable play of Mortal Kombat because AS a whole, Mortal Kombat always had unpredictable gameplay and role, even x-rays, moves, and fatalities, which is no big surprise. But as a thing, it is getting its inspirations from Injustice, (I don't really mind) Though Mortal Kombat has always been unpredictable with x-rays and others type of mechanics that the devs put in.
Content: The content is nothing but bland and is one of the most boring out there to exist.
Gameplay: The gameplay remains the same like mk11, combining the elements of mkx, but making them worse. The frame rates are awful, some characters are weak, and the lack of defense makes it up for how bland and unfun this game is.
While, Mortal Kombat 1 is an excellent game. It is a terrible game on its own, and the franchise as a whole.",1696780805,1707779506,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

no cross play in 2024 
the game has lack of content and it will become boring for single player and kasual fans easily
23 characters for base roster is small when tekken 8 already has 32 in base roster
WB is killing the game with selling fatalities and 10 dollar skins for a game thats already expensive
No Lobbies
Story is not interesting 
doesnt have a good costumization and most of the skins look the same with different colors
graphics is not better than mk 11 and the game looks uglier in fatalities
no stage fatalities 
no 3 line dialogues and customizable intros

overall i do recommend the game even with much much problems the game have at this point but only if you have someone to play with because the gameplay is better than mk 11

After months since this game's release, there are still problems and a lack of content. But still it's fun. WB is going bankrupt and it's obvious that this game was rushed by WB. But if you look at WB's recent content, MK1 is the one that is still a success.

I love customization in games I spent hours customizing my characters in MK11 and this game lacks customization options but I'm not going to base the entire game on customization because this is a FIGHTING game. Yes, customizing characters is good but this game still has more customization than MKX, MK9. I consider this game's customization equal to MK11 because there were literally useless gears in it. You couldn't even see them in MK11. Many people complained about it now they reduced 3 gear slots to 1, and they look more unique. And personally, I like the skins in this game more.

Another thing people complained about in MK11 was the Krypt. When MK11 first got released, it was hated because of the Krypt and the grind system. They removed the Krypt and added the Invasions Mode. Which one is worse? Invasions. I dislike the Invasions mode but it is not so different from the Krypt because I had the same bad, boring experience with the Krypt.

The story mode is still flawed but better than MK11. Stages are better, the roster is better many MK fans waited for 3D era characters and then they added 3D era characters.

Now the thing I really hate is microtransactions you have to pay money for ""premium"" skins. This sucks but at the same time, this does not affect my overall fun with this game. The gameplay is so great. I enjoy it. Again, people complained about the gameplay in MK11 being so slow. So they changed that but now there are people who say MK11 gameplay is better. It feels like people just don't know what they want. This game will get better.

To people who say ""MK1 is dead I'm playing Tekken now hehhehehe"" nobody cares. Many people, including myself will still enjoy the game.",1695204389,1707599385,True,2,0,0.526385486125946045,0,True,False,False

The new fighting mechanism Kameo is the most interesting element of the game, but with time it gets boring as the only fightning mode available, goodbye 1v1.

The story is fair as a direct continuation of MK11 story. Despite of the new era and the character's ""new"" origin, the story as a whole failed to convince.

Awesome fatalities, as always, on both from main and kameo characters.

Online mode is the same as before and the new Invasions mode isn't quite impressive to stay.

And that's it.... No krypt, no towers. They missed the chance to include those features for replays.

The ugly part of this game: high price microtransactions and characters packs.

Lot to enjoy and the combat, graphics and mechanics, playing with friends are all top notch. Fatalities great as ever!

No world building or extra world exploration in invasions. Short story. Bad online servers with sweat heavy toxic competition online. No crossplay with consoles/platforms/buggy mess. FPS set to 30. Lags ad Disconnects, periodically have to do re-shades. Lastly I am also just not a big fan of the Kameo's its lazy, cheap and makes me just want to have them as actual characters to play as.

But why did I stop playing less than a month after this when I played every other MK game for years before moving on?

People would tell you about the half-baked invasion system, exploitation of micro-transactions, and broken promises from WB as reasons not to play. My main gripe is a lot more simple: Kameos. To me, kameos ruined the entire flow of the combat, and part of your training will include exploiting whatever flavor of the month is the meta. I don't find them fun or interesting at all, and the fact that most of the are alternate timeline versions of the same heroes, makes the entire game feel stupid.

In addition to that, everything besides the combat is a complete downgrade from MK11. MK11 had me hooked with the ability to customize every part of my characters armor. It was very rewarding and provided some value to the single player content. That is now ALL GONE and replaced with recolors or expensive remakes of old skins. What the hell?

This is incredibly disappointing to me. I actually prefer MK over the other fighting games, but NetherRealm really went out of their way to change that with this release.

If you're a fan and want to watch the story, you can watch it for free online. But if you are purchasing a fighting game because you want to actually fight, I'd give SF and Tekken 8 a second glance.",1707422492,1707422492,False,65,1,0.759729743003845215,0,True,False,False

I've completed the main story and the Invasions game mode. Now play a good amount online.
Note: I can NEVER recommend an unfinished game that's full price. This game was intentionally left unfinished because of the modern trend of patching what's broken and adding left out content later, for more money. When I paid $70 I hoped the game would be finished. 

----My TL;DR recommendation is to either wait until the game goes on sale, or wait until it's actually worth $70 (a full, complete game) with future patches. In its current state it's playable, but simply not worth $70 (or $110 for premium edition, ouch).

Pros:
-Game looks amazing on PC with maxed out settings. The craftsmanship and detail in the animations are also great.
-Decent story/lore. Not amazing, but decent. Length and gameplay-wise it was good. It was a good re-introduction to MK after more than a decade.
-Character mastery/unlocking new gear and color palettes for costumes as you level up with a character is fun.
Probably my favorite part of the game. The different character outfits and seasonal-themed stuff is really dope.
-Cool movesets and abilities. I enjoy learning movesets for characters I like.
-The Krypt. Was my favorite part of MK during my childhood and it's pretty cool in this game if you like unlocking concept art, music, and potentially new costumes/gear for characters.
-Playing online is cool. Not many problems other than people spamming the same combos, which I just have to get used to.
-Invasions mode is fun. PvE mode I would go to when tired of PvP. Fun little RPG element, almost like Konquest mode (please bring that back). I spent most of my time in this mode.
-Not as many problems upon release as other modern games, I guess.

Cons:
-Things that come with an unfinished game. Seeing ""Coming soon"" for a game mode because devs didn't have time to finish it before release. Not being able to complete a puzzle in Invasions mode because you don't have the $8 virtual pre-order character, so you're just SOL. Grammar errors (Towers mode-Survivor tower-""Defeat as 25 opponents without regaining health."")

-Just being peripherally aware of how this game looks on Switch, for full price, and how NetherRealm thought that was okay. It objectively looks and runs like trash.

-Honestly not sure how I feel about Kameo characters in fights. I don't prefer it that's for sure.

-Sometimes game loads slow. Most noticeable to me in the Krypt. Also in story mode, every so often the smooth transitional loading would fail going from gameplay to cinematic, and a black loading screen would come up.

-Direction of the story/lore is questionable imo.

-Fatalities and Brutalities need to be unlocked, beyond the first one that each character has. I do like unlocking stuff, but not moves I should already have. I'm ehh on this one.

-Invasions mode. It's fun to me as a completionist. Realistically it's very lackluster, and honestly pretty bad considering who made this game. The fights are too easy, the talismans and relics used as abilities/resistances are mostly useless and don't make sense (you could complete everything without ever using any item). Survival challenges trivial, as in you could just stand in a corner and beat the challenge. Hyperarmor on enemies, meaning you can't even practice combos in this mode.
Modifiers are the worst part of this game mode, and whoever put them in shouldn't make games anymore - Effects during fights that disorient or annoy you. One completely darkens the screen, forcing you to spam ranged attacks or just blindly button-mash in darkness. Another, Chaos, literally randomizes your button inputs during the fight.
Honestly there's a lot wrong with this mode. Very grindy and repetitive, even the ""Secret Fights"" show up too often and you get nothing special from them; they're just additional fights. I'm genuinely curious who thought of this stuff, and when it will be fixed.

The preformance is very mixed on some maps just calling my cameo decreased my fps from 60 to 47;fatal blows,menus,intros etc are locked at 30 fps and because of that the game constantly shifts preformance very clunky like not because of the hardware but because of the game. (also many bugs, i have had issues just attacking in invasions, i would load into a encounter and i wont be able to attack for like 10s so i dunno what that is about) for now il stick to playing offline matches,invasions and towers.
TL;DR Buy it in this state if you have friends and can play on lan and if you dont mind the unplayable online and some bugs,since the offline makes up for it the ai is actually pretty fun to fight and isnt dumb so thats a good positive.
(il make it a more in depth review when it gets fixed up and yes the microtransactions are 
scummy especially locking ermac and quan chi behind the kombat pack 1 while they are already fully playable)

The graphics are amazing, and the character designs give off a classic mortal kombat look yet I cant recommend this game. I've played my fair share of Mortal Kombat from Armageddon to this unfinished product. it came out rushed and unfinished lacking in basic online services that were present in mortal kombat 11. Invasions is repetitive while working towards lackluster rewards. 

and don't even get me started on the prices. the game alone is 70 dollars without any of the dlc characters which adds up to 110 dollars if you want them (1/3 of the roster). Remember when you could unlock cool fatalities? well fuck you now its 10 dollars to buy ONE fatality in the store! wooo thats what we like to see! PREDATORY MICROTRANSACTIONS! thats just what this series needed more of! 

The fighting itself feels much more less advanced than the previous 2 games. Online play feels much more uninspired as you see the exact same singular combo for a character over and over again.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-iadA281BU

It left a creamy taste in my mouth.
To put it more bluntly, this game is like a downgraded version of MK11.
So I would say that Mortal Kombat 1 is the worst Mortal Kombat game of the Reboot era.
I felt this feeling before when I played Tekken 4 at 2002.

*** graphics ***

The details and modeling are flowing, burning, scorching. They had already raised the graphics with MK11, but with MK1 the bar has been raised a lot.


*** Atmosphere/Ambience ***

Frankly i've always believed that Mortal Kombat should have a darker atmosphere. İ didn't like the extremely bright, flowery, buggy and happy nature of this one. The series has officially gone from dark to light. Believing that i'm a veteran Mortal Kombat player, i can say that the atmosphere didn't draw me in.

I'm never saying it was bad, but it wasn't the Mortal Kombat vibe I wanted, the Mortal Kombat vibe I imagined.

Mortal Kombat is a story of mysterious forces, dark stories to be discovered and different realms that continue to live unaware of each other. That's why its color is hazy and dark.

MK1 is a reflection of Liu Kang's spirit. The entire color palette, design and ambiance of the game screams ""I will be bright, peaceful, at peace"".


*** Gameplay ***

After MKX and MK11, I couldn't get used to the combo structure of MK1. İ think the combo structure is a bit more freed up. Compared to the previous games, we have to create and combine combos; therefore, we have to show our skills.

I like the cameo logic, it adds an additional beauty to the game. Very long combos can be done with professionalization.

But there is a serious clunkiness in the gameplay. This game is not as fast as MK11 or MKX.


*** Content ***

I'll touch on the story part last.

Invasions mode looks good for now. İt's a content that will play for a long time. But being single player might bore you after a while.

I don't know if a different tower mode will come, but for now the classic mode seems to work.

There is no krypt this time. They made a part called shrine. Give money, get the item.

Character customizations are nice. The feature of randomizing favorite outfits is nice. For example, there are 4 favorite outfits, it randomly selects one for you every game. On the other hand, the feature of creating different character variations like in MK11 has been removed. You only have cosmetic effects on your character.

İn addition, there are some points I would like to mention with the designs:

MK1's main menu, character selection screen and in-game life-bar, warning text, tokens are designed in a seriously simple way.

The intros at the beginning of the game are only added to the versus section. There are no character intros in tower mode. You switch with a black screen. You start the fight directly. This was an extremely big disappointment.


*** Story ***

Now let's get to the most important part.

Mortal Kombat and its story has the same importance for me as the Silmarillion because it was my childhood love, my first great passion. İ know every bit of the story by heart until MK11.

Especially in MK9 and MKX the story was very well done. İn MK11 there were parts that were like deus ex machina, but they tied it up nicely.",1707039210,1707039264,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- £16 to unlock Kameo (support) characters early. One of which has less brutalities than the others.
- Monetised 'Easy fatalities' that cost actual money.
- The season pass content that is half Guest Characters, half in game but cut out characters. Salt in the wound when you get to the end of story mode and realise they tried to emulate Armageddon.

The fact that they haven't improved or changed their ways since MK9-MK11 is a red flag. The fact that their writing has remained the same aka MID aka AWFUL is a red flag.

The game-play is fun, the story is fun (and looks 100x times better than any previous NRS game), and the monetization stuff has been blown so out of proportion that you could be forgiven for thinking the game actually MSRP'd for $100. 

There are absolutely balancing and competitive changes that must be made for this game to last, but the community is actively trying to sabotage the experience in how they choose to interact with the game at present.

MK1 players are absolutely allergic to trying something new, whether its a combo, or a Kameo, or heaven forbid, even a different character than the one they already have 2,000 hours with across the last 4 Mortal Kombat games, including this one. Every single person you fight, either in Kombat League or the laughably misnamed ""Kasual"" mode, will not fight you. They will camp you, hold back, and block anything you do, so don't ever bother trying to take the initiative, you will never be rewarded. Instead, do what everyone else does: back up and use a Kameo! Did you know that even the most unsafe move is actually plus if paired with the proper Kameo? That's Right! In MK1, the primary, and by far most common play-stlye is to walk away from your opponent the entire match while chucking some Kameo move at them until they finially guess your 50/50 coin toss wrong and you get do one (1) combo for half their health bar. Rinse and repeat one more time and the match is over. Every character is capable of easily, without much practice or labbing, doing ~50% with any hit confirm off of a Kameo starter. After 100 hours of sucking and trying to ""get gud,"" I realized quickly that ""getting gud"" really just means exploiting ultra-safe kameo starters into one (1) optimal string. It is outright boring to do, and exceedingly frustrating to have to deal with. You might think that this sounds like a core gameplay issue, and not the fault of the fans, but you would be wrong. NRS has given players dozens of options for characters, and more than a dozen options for Kameos. But MK1 players actively choose to use 1 of 3 charcters and 1 of 3 Kameos. It is genuinely a novel experience every time I see a Goro, or Darrius, or the mythical Shujinko Kameo. I can count on one hand the amount of Tanyas I have ever seen online. I cannot count (because the number is 0) the number of times I have seen a  Nitara or Sindel. They just aren't played, and not because they aren't viable. The real reason no one uses half the cast is because it would require more than a room-temperature IQ to learn how to do something other than the same Johnny Cage or Kenshi 50/50 hard-to-blockable over and over while mashing the Kameo button like it owes you money. If you try to do anything original or even want to *gasp* learn a new character, you are immediately curb-stomped by some Johnny Cage player who knows just one 50/50 that you will never be able to react to online. ""I just thinks he's really cool! It's purely a coincidence that he is the undisputed top 1 in the game!"" 

The people who are left playing this game (and let's admit it, there aren't that many) are actively trying to kill this game with how they play. These are the same people complaining about a lack of content and having to pay for skins and announcer voices, as if that stuff just falls out of the ******* sky. They seem to actually expect a multi-million dollar game with 20+ playable characters all with skins, and customization options, and announcer voices, and fatalities, and hookers and blackjack, to give them EVEN MORE STUFF FOR FREE! I have never experience a more toxic, unlikable community in my life, and I'm not sure that's even possible anymore.

The real problem with MK1 is the whiny, cry-baby fan-base that expects free stuff, released the instant it is minimally viable, forever. I have never experienced a fan-base that is so demanding off a developer, while simultaneously relentlessly shitting on every decision (creative or financial) that company makes.  The MK1 community is all of the worst parts of fandom and competition congealed into a toxic echo-chamber of negativity and impotent rage. 

I would actually recommend this game if not for the people who play it. Smash Bros. is a healthier, nicer community, and if that is the case, you're ******. 

My 250 hours in this game has led me to the conclusion that only the most profoundly mentally ill, or otherwise cognitively impaired, could possibly enjoy anything about this game or the people who play it. Considering how much time I wasted on it, and the length of this steam review, I guess you can tell which one I am.

Mortal Kombat first released in 1992, as someone who is familiar with the brand i could not remember the story.

By re-introducing this brand they allow not just people in my boat but the new generations to jump in and get caught up with the World of Mortal Kombat.

I enjoyed it, the Reptile is my favorite character so far and i am looking forward to Mortal Kombat 2 remake, to see what happens next!

I only hoped it doesn't deviate from the Original stories and look forward to get to know the actual lore of Mortal Kombat in the future.

So why the negative?

I gave it a negative because they didn't re introduce the original but rather another market inflated generic multi verse / multi timeline product just called it Mortal Kombat I,

There's some fun moments for fans of the series, especially the PS2 games, but if you followed the release you know almost everything. And the lack of intros, especially in ranked, is one of the worst things ever. I hate it. Please. NRS. If you do ANYTHING, give us the quips between characters before a match loads in. I fully regret my premium purchase knowing I won't be able to see Omni-Man and Homelander say wild stuff to each other before each round. 

The single player mode seems neat, as a concept, haven't gotten far into it yet. There were just a few things left out from this game that the last game had that I think would've been neat. Wake-up options are pretty much gutted, air combos are necessity with nearly every character, it just sorta feels like this game taken out of the oven a little too early. It's beautiful though. The facial animations are kinda wild during the story at points. 

There weren't very many 'wow' moments in the story either, which kinda stinks. There were a handful, not to spoil anything, but that's it. Hoping the next one improves on everything this one did. 

I'd say it's worth it, if it goes on sale at some point. Maybe as a 30/40 dollar game, yeah. 100 dollars for 5 days early access?? ...Kinda regretting it.

EDIT: It has been over a month and we haven't gotten any patches for the PC version of this game. Granted, we got a single patch that PS and Xbox got, but that's it. Performance is still abysmal, mics still continue to pick up online even after having another option implemented to turn off voice chat, the game is locked at 30 FPS in menus, loading, and fatal blows -- and worst of all, there is a microtransaction shop that they are HEAVILY pushing. 12 dollars for a fatality at Halloween. 15 dollars for an old Scorpion skin from an older game. 8 dollars for an announcer. Everything that has been FREE in previous games. I can't defend this game at all. I can't. I wish I could get a refund. This is an absolute joke and everyone at NRS and WB involved with this game should feel bad about the current state it's in. Fix the game and get rid of the Battle Royale item shop. Just put the items in the game to unlock. For free.

EDIT 2: It's been about 4 months or so. They added intros to most modes, but the problem is, the intros suck hard compared to MK11. Which is wild. Some of the DLC ones are good. The gameplay is... solid. At times. Air combos are a little 'meh' and so are kameos. You have a little bit more freedom in combos compared to MK11, but MK11 was tighter and felt more rewarding. The cast of characters is pretty fun, but it could be better. Each game feels like a downgrade from the last. and the Premium shop is still as predatory as ever. Invasions is a terribly boring mode. Here's hoping MK2 is so much better. I'll only really be coming back when I'm bored out of my mind or DLC drops.

Let's start with why it's called 1-the story makes it look like it's actually a prequel to the very first MK, going way back to where the story of Raiden (before he became a god), Kung Lao, Shao Kahn before he was Shao Kahn, and others actually begin-including Kronika, the final boss of MK 11. So if you want to see how certain fighters came to be what they are (also how Mileena became such a freak), here you go. If 11 was the end, 1 is the beginning.
Here's where the problems begin: If you have a 4K setup it looks fantastic, but clearly the system requirements were grossly understated. I have a gaming laptop that blows away recommended specs and there are serious framerate issues-I haven't had the ""locked at 30 FPS"" issue but it's very choppy and everytime something happens for the first time, lots of freezing/stuttering. And EVERY SINGLE TIME you start the game it has to preload shaders, which induces constant freezing and thinking the game has locked up on you. The first time I started I had to force quit and restart THREE TIMES just to get through this. It sounds good as always with excellent voice work but the dialogue is just nonstop cheesy and recycled bad puns/jokes with less than zero originality. If you played MK X, 11 or Injustice 2 you'll have no issues with the controls. There are multiple gameplay modes which leads into more gripes-first, Kameos. They're NON PLAYABLE characters you can call for assists and that's it. :ole they're there to pacify ""This person isn't here"" complaints. And the DLC...even if you buy Premium Edition, if you didn't pre-order the game you're not getting Shang Tsung without buying him for another $8. Havik? Gotta buy him too. (Don't buy the Kameo Unlock Pack, you can unlock them all through gameplay so saving time isn't worth the $20) And then there's Dragon Kins aka IAP currency which has no place in a game like this. All on top of perhaps spending $70/110 just for the game.
It goes without saying that if you're gonna buy this, wait for AT LEAST a 50% off sale (which is when I got it). And for the issues with graphics & frame rate to be fixed. MK 1 is another example of just because a game looks incredible visually doesn't mean it plays like that. It's only for the most die-hard fans who want to know how it all began, but this game is really all style and very little substance. It feels like the developers just made this to be a cash cow for them, given their history with the franchise and gaming in general that's just really sad and quite a fall from grace.",1706564907,1706564907,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Last chapter of the story goes at 15-20 fps, while the rest was going at stable 60 fps. The performance in general is bad. In Kombat League there are disconnections, crashes, all the time. The Mute option for online matches doesn't work. I disabled comms but I still hear noises and screams from other players.
Also there are some lacking features like latency on screen during match, modify size of the numbers in health bar (they're too little to read quickly during a fight), online rooms, and the MOST important of ALL: CROSSPLAY (seriously, 2023 and still not doing this?).

On the other hand, the gameplay and mechanichs are great, a vast improvement from MK11. Still need to nerf a few characters like Smoke, Sareena, and maybe adjust some other (haven't tried all the roster yet) but in general it's very good and fun. But since the PC port is trash and with the game being as expensive as it is, I would not recommend it to anyone until they fix it (or finish the game actually, because that is what seems to be the problem).

Update:
Almost 5 months later, gameplay still very good. Some characters and kameos are still completely unbalanced but game is still playable and enjoyable. Invasions is a total bore, playing it feels like a burden instead of a fun experience, so I don't even try to play it anymore, not even to unlock some skins that I want.

Anyways, the PC port is still terrible. It got better offline, pc is running it a bit more smoothly, but when playing online it's still full of glitches, throttling, and constant crashes everyday. And it's not bc of my pc's specs, my hardware is OK and stuff like this happens to people with even more powerful PCs.

So, after 5 months of DLCs, a lot of extra content that is expensive af and many patches, the game still feels raw and unfinished.",1695427610,1706561448,False,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Mortal Kombat may have reset its numbering with this entry, but do not expect any kind of reboot here, both the story and the gameplay are heavily rooted in the previous entries, for better or worse.  I don't love how MK feels, I never have.  It's stiff, the combos feel so odd you have to input your cancels so early, and I find using a block button rather than holding back to be strange and unnatural.  That being said, I still found playing the game to be fun, they have been making these games for a long time and they have iterated the gameplay to the point where, despite my complaints above still being valid, the game is very fun to play.  

Mortal Kombats story mode is a treat, if you are in to that sort of thing.  It's like the craziest B action movie you have ever seen.  Massive cast, tons of fights, tons of high quality cinema scenes, bonkers plot, good voice work, the whole deal.  I had a blast playing through it.  It also makes you use a ton of the characters, which is helpful in figuring out which ones you feel most comfortable with.  In addition to the story mode you have a sort of live service mode (Invasions) which consists of clearing maps filled with fights with special conditions.  You earn currency in this (and the other) modes, that lets you unlock cosmetics.  You also have Kombat towers and an Arcade mode, in addition to, of course, online matches.

I found the online in MK to be frustrating.  There are some minor issues with the servers, I found sometimes that in matches where the opponent and I have good ping, there would still be random lag spikes, moreso than other fighting games I play.  This is a minor complaint though, for the most part that aspect is okay.  My major complaint with the online is just how long everything takes.  Finding matches, starting matches, going from match 1 to match 2... just everything takes forever compared to other games where you are in and out in a flash.  

Mortal Kombat is a great looking game.  I'm not the biggest fan of the photo-realistic style they use, but it is extremely well done, and makes the ultra-violence even more visceral and gruesome.  The stages are incredible looking, some of the best I have ever seen in a fighting game.  

All in all it is an impressive package, with super high production values and a ton of different things to do, that is held back by the fighting system that underpins the whole thing, and some questionable quality of life choices.  That being said, the game is fun, I have been having a lot of fun playing it and have been still firing up the online from time to time, and provides a lot of value, and it is easy to recommend to anyone who is even slightly interested.

If you're in-between casual and competitive like me then this game is just hard to recommend. The content is in two modes, one which is grinding, the other which is just pvp. There is also the standard arcade and arcade endings. But costumes? All locked behind pay walls. OP characters? Also behind pay walls (see Khamelon). It's difficult to recommend this game to anyone that is more casual than competitive but also likes winning and learning fighting games. Street fighter is too hard on me, and I'm not a fan of tekken, so I play Mk1 but it is featureless compared to those two. I might seriously start tekken because of it.

What I will say, is that if you are at rue casual player this game is fun for the fatalities and learning the game. This game is an amazing game in practice mode, but in practice it has more than just a few issues. Wait a year when they drop the inevitable complete edition (but of course the game will be dead by then).",1706317133,1706375947,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core, 30-second gameplay loop is there, that's it. The cosmetic system is flawed, rushed, and predatory. The net code for pc remains nigh-unplayable after 4 months of release. The only real change to the game, besides the initial nerf to the Cyrax Kameo, has been DLC and Invasion changes.

Invasions. How one traverses through the mode is absolute dogwater. Tedious and commits the cardinal sin of gaming in just feeling like a second job. The 'Klues' are coded so poorly that one often doesn't even have to figure them out ... you can just walk through half of them.

The cosmetics. I'm not paying more money on a $70 game that feels this rushed. The only way to gain currency of this kind is to GRIND. What cosmetics are free are just pallette swaps of two costumes or gained from RNG due to the shrine. Krypts gone, better hope you like slot machines. Also gone is the level of cosmetics. Each character has two default costumes and a single item swap (Raiden's hat, Scorpion's Mask, Shao's axe) 

Speaking of the grind. NRS has reduced the offline, tower, and local gains of Profile XP, Player XP, and THREE. DIFFERENT. CURRENCIES. Leaving the consumer to either have a good online friend they play with. Or grind one fight in invasions.

-Good graphics and visual art style
-Big improvement in score/soundtrack
-An alright story mode for a fighting game but with a lot of references to previous parts which is good for old time fans
-Most of the new character designs are good
-No Bo Rai Cho 

Cons:
-An unacceptable amount of bugs on release some of which might still be present in the game both visual and gameplay
-FPS lock (60 FPS during fight and 30 everywhere else including fatal blows)
-Price
-Ads on main menu
-No Krypt, no Konquest mode
-No crossplay (Unlike Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8)
-DLC fatalities (lmao)
-No badass, fun big bosses at the end of the arcade ladder like in MK 1-9
-Mediocre and boring ""Invasion"" mode which replaced krypt and konquest mode where you grind recolored alt skins by doing same thing which is easy and doesn't even require you to use new exclusive to that mode mechanics (Elements and Amulets). While it has different seasons and each update changes rewards and end boss it's nothing but a FOMO mode with the same gameplay each season just with different recolor of minigames projectiles and recolored alt costume rewards
-Slowest possible character and kameo leveling system unless you're into grinding invasion mode
-Some characters require more skill to do big damage while others can do the same amount of damage with less effort which can be frustrating in online mode.

 Going through ""Invasions"" mode gameplay at the release with obviously boring and annoying mechanics to then get them removed/nerfed felt like I was some beta tester for future players (not hard mechanics but ones that would drag and waste time in an already boring mode even more).

 If you're a casual player then the game doesn't justify the cost with all it's issues and for what it offers content wise. If you're more into online play then get ready to face mostly same meta characters.
 At the end of the day it's still Mortal Kombat but it feels like all the actual fun stuff are getting removed with each installment in favor of making more money and raising e-sports since this franchise is still considered among the best at least for now.",1706230172,1706230366,False,1,0,0.505434811115264893,1,True,False,False

The plot is full of ups and downs, captivating, and the Chinese characters have a lot of scenes. I love watching Liu Kang versus Shang Tsung. However, the reason I give a negative review is that Warner has a tunnel vision on Chinese culture and pretends to understand it!
Firstly, the form of HanFu has a cross-necked right lapel. Most of the people wearing left lapels are nomadic ethnic minorities, and left lapels are often seen in burial objects and tomb murals of the deceased.
Secondly, why does the tea house have a slogan selling cookies? Overall, I really enjoy the rhythm of fighting between Raiden and Bi-Han, but I have never seen a Chinese person add ice to his tea. It would be much more reasonable to switch to a milk tea shop.
Thirdly, it's really okay if the dubbers can't speak authentic Mandarin Chinese, but can you stop using messy accented pronunciations to fool us?
Finally, the portrayal of female characters is becoming increasingly hasty. I really love Princess Kitana in the double buns in MKX, please design more ancient hairstyles like this. The voices of Kronika and Shang Tsung are really unique, they’re amazing! I will never hate a menacing and charming villain. But Shang Tsung's men's hairpin ornaments are completely different from ancient Chinese styles, and there are so many styles that can be borrowed from HanFu. I'm not intentionally causing trouble, it's just that these common sense concepts only require a little careful understanding and won't go wrong.
In addition, the guest appearance system further imbalances the fairness of skills. Perhaps adding a 5V5 multiplayer mode would be more interesting?

这款游戏的手感对我来说很棒，剧情跌宕起伏、引人入胜，中国角色的戏份很足，就爱看刘康对战尚宗，但我打差评的原因在于华纳对于中华文化根本视野狭隘、不懂装懂！
首先，汉服是交领右衽。穿着左衽的大多是少数游牧民族，左衽也常出现在逝者的随葬品和墓室壁画中。
其次，茶楼为什么会贴有卖曲奇标语？总体上我很喜欢雷电和避寒的打戏节奏，但我从没见过有中国人喝茶时加冰块的，如果换成奶茶店会合理很多。
第三，如果配音演员不会说正版的普通话真的没关系，但能不能不要再用乱七八糟的口音读法来糊弄我们？
最后，女性角色的塑造也越来越草率了事，我很爱第十部里双鬟髻的吉塔娜公主，请多设计这类古风发型。克罗尼卡和尚宗的声线真有特色，太绝了！我永远不会讨厌有威胁性又极富魅力的反派。但尚宗的男性发冠完全不像中国古代款式，明明汉服里有那么多可以借鉴的风格。我不是在故意找麻烦，只是这些常识只需稍稍用心了解一下就不会出错。
此外，客串系统令技能公平性更加失衡。也许添一个5V5模式会更有趣？",1706022532,1706155218,False,7,2,0.578837454319000244,0,True,False,False

Trying to play online feels bad because I'm stuck on the menu waiting, there's no training mode matchmaking or anything else to do while waiting, you're just put on hold. Then, when I find a match, I'm treated to 15-30 seconds of a completely black screen. It's not a proper loading screen with any kind of feedback, just a long moment of wondering whether the game has frozen. I've also tried private lobbies but trying to set up King of the Hill with two friends consistently crashed the game.

Single player modes feel similar. Invasions are a good idea for a single player mode but every animation and loading screen feels so sluggish that it ends up being more frustrating than fun. The story mode is OK, I don't really like where the story went but that's up to preference.

What really bothers me is the online. I found the ranked matchmaking experience very similar to Tekken 7, and at least Tekken has training mode matchmaking and gives you a proper ""get ready for the next battle"" screen during those 15-30 seconds of loading. I can't really explain how much MK1 feels like it's going to crash at any minute, and I'm comparing it to a NINE year old game here.

It's impossible to recommend a AAA game in this state, even if the fighting game hiding underneath is fun.

Instead, it's riddled with bugs, especially on PC, and locked to 30 fps in many places (why? I have no idea). It still doesn't have crossplay either four months after launch, so I haven't been able to play with several of my friends this whole time.

A $70 game should also be respectful of our time and money. Instead, unlocking Havik requires either playing out the story mode or spending an additional $8. Kameos are in a similar situation, and the dollars option to unlock them immediately is $20. Also Shang Tsung is another $8 if you didn't pre-order, and there's no alternative there. NONE of this is included with the Premium Edition.

So, if you want to buy this game today and immediately have access to all the characters and kameos that were available at launch, it'll cost you $106 total. Otherwise, it'll cost you $78 and several hours of grinding.

Omni-Man? He's not included in any of that. Would you like to buy Kombat Pack 1 for $40 more? I did, but I regret it now.

Also communication from the development team is next to nothing.  Players have been dealing with disconnects for over 6 weeks now with only recently a small statement about the problem being addressed.

- Kameo system is lame. It would have been better if all characters could be selected as your 1st and 2nd character, and it played like a tag team fight. This could also create a gamemode where two players can play on the same team and battle together.

Is it MK? Yes. Are the cinematics pretty good? Yeah. Unfortunately that's about it.

This game is LOADED with microtransactions like a mobile game. For a game that charges full price it feels like an early access product in terms of its base content. The roster is small, the story is incomplete, and for early buyers the game was incredibly buggy and has needed months or updates to even preform acceptably.  

The biggest sin though is not only will you be asked to spend MORE money than the initial price for each and every DLC character but you'll also be asked to pay for every new skin, every new stage, and every new fatality. Yes, even the fatalities are being gated behind microtransactions. 

But hows the gameplay? In a word, simple.  Once you learn one character you've learned them all. The control scheme is highly simplified and the game actively punishes more technical/difficult combos. You've got air juggles, assist characters, special and super cancels but it all feels like a waste once you realize that your combos will quickly cap out in damage around 40% no matter how crazy you get with your imaginative combos. At the same time EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER can do a basic 3 or 4 hit string, into assist, repeat that, then do a special move at the end for about 60% with very little effort. The characters are only slightly unique and basically all play with this same basic gameplan and combo structure. 

Last thing I want to mention. MK is a brand near to my heart, I grew up with these games and I've spent my entire life thus far at least trying every single game, movie, web series, etc. for better or worse. This game is one of the worst. In terms of content its actually weaker than some mobile games. 

If you REALLY want to pick this up I hope you do it during a really good sale and I recommend getting into mods because the community made skins are free and made at an embarrassingly higher quality than the official stuff they want you to pay an additional $10 for. 

Last last thing. Invasion mode is possibly the laziest and most boring waste of a gamemode ever added to any fighting game.",1705834178,1705834350,False,5,0,0.548022627830505371,0,True,False,False

It should have been a slam dunk and the sales would tell you that, but the game is dying because of poor management. When I bought the game it was a buggy mess, basically a party game and not a competitive fighting game. I decided to take a 2 month break to let them patch out the bugs and improve game. 2 DLC characters and a balance patch and the game still isn't there yet. It may never reach it's full potential. It's sad because the addition/idea of Kameos in MK is actually fun in a vacuum until you go online or play any of the solo content, which is severely lacking compared to MK11. It's a bummer because I like to lab my character and there's no incentive to do any of that because this game is a chore to play.

- Netcode is terrible in this golden age of fighting games.
- Has chronic desync issues.
- Load times are very long (I have an SSD).
- Finding a match online takes too long (avg 3-5 mins at a time without freezes).
- Rematch load times are long.
- Invasions, the main single player content is painfully dull.  
- The game is overly monetized.
- No crossplay.
- Game is unfinished and there are modes that are present but not accessible today.

There are problems with this game that would turn people away. For example: There is no cross-play online, the net code is not great for online players, the game can get a bit glitchy no matter what mode you are playing in, and there's not enough content to keep the players playing this overpriced game. 

For Casuals who prefer to play single-player content, there's not enough content to keep you occupied. There are only Story Mode, Invasions, and Towers. That's about all you are getting. Story is great to watch and play, so thumbs up for that. I understand the idea of what they wanted Invasions to be, but to me it feels like it just didn't turn out the way they wanted. In my opinion, Invasions looked like they wanted to make something similar to Konquest, only it turned out to be too repetitive, too grindy, and it just gets boring fast. And Towers are just towers. You have the Arcade towers, 25 Character Survival Tower, and Endurance Tower.

I hear that Online is not great either, but since I am not at all interested in Kombat League, or even Casual Matches/King of the Hill, I couldn't tell you just how bad it is.

Do I recommend buying this game for folks who are interested in playing this game? ONLY if you want to play. I won't force anyone to not buy this game.  I don't recommend playing this game for now, but maybe in the future, this game will get its second wind and be a good game. I have hope for this game. I really do. I genuinely enjoy playing this game by myself or with friends. 

I won't allow comments on this post mainly because I am tired of seeing people's posts/replies complaining about games when they use the words ""Garbage"", ""Trash"", or that this game ""sucks"". I mean I get it, they are just voicing their opinions and everything, but it is hard for me personally to take anyone seriously when they use those words without any reasonable explanation why they think that way. I am not defending this game at all. I am mainly disappointed that this game turned out the way it did.

I believe I've thoroughly played enough of this game to give a valid review. 

Before you continue, you should know that I'm just a guy who loves MK and I'm by no means a fighting game guru

[h2] The Good [/h2]

That said, this gameplay fun as hell. I've played UMK3, MK9, and MK11 and though the kosmetics and single-player modes in MK11 are superior (and kustomization fleshed out), at its core, MK1's kombat with the new Kameo system is one of coolest design decisions imo. It adds a level of creativity (at least it should be), for a new style of play. 

The tutorial is fantastic too, which makes getting into this game super easy for those new to fighting games (there's also an unsuspecting drawback to this, but more on that later).

Love or hate the story mode, you can tell they put the most effort in crafting the kampaign. Props to NRS for making an exciting soft-reboot of a beloved franchise, komplete with badass kharacters that I think anyone with no knowledge of MK Lore would enjoy as an introduction to it.

[h2] The Bad [/h2]

Sadly, the bad things outnumber the good things in its current state. I'll name a few in a list but I want to talk about one specific thing that makes me wanna take a break and uninstall for the time being:

1. Constant freezing and desynchronizations in online matches (even after patch)
2. Repetitive Single-player mode (Invasions)
3. Microtransactions and Premium Currency existing
4. Mostly boring seasonal kosmetic unlocks
5. Paywall for Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, and Ermac
6. Some bugs and glitches (kharacters not facing the right way, combos not triggering)

[h2] The Ugliest [/h2]
And finally, my biggest gripe: META Fighter-Kameo comps.

Now I know competitive games always have 'METAs'. I've shamefully played over 1000 hours of Overwatch, and I hated it there too.

Because just like in Overwatch, after a while it got stale and repetitive.
Want to win games or climb Kombat League ranks for the rewards? Guess what: You HAVE to play certain kharacters or you're at a significant disadvantage.

I'm not sure if I'm in the minority, but the way I choose who to main in games is based on:
1. How cool they look.
2. How cool their lore is.

That said, as cool as the kharacter is, I do NOT want to play Johnny Cage to repeat the same strings over and over just to win a game. Because that's not fun for me at all. That would just make me doze off. Same goes for Raiden, and Omni-Man to name a couple of more.

What I said earlier about the game being ""easy for those new to fighting games""? Inversely, because its so easy to get into and master (at least for most kharacters), people can easily pick up the META and start dominating really quick. Your chances of winning against certain kharacters are low regardless of the skill level of the player using them, as long as they memorize the 2 or 3 strings they need.

The game, in turn, encourages you to abandon creativity for some of these Fighter-Kameo comps, because their 'optimal combos' do more damage while being safer to use.

I only played KL because I wanted the kosmetic unlocks, don't really care for rank. But every match-up I get is the same 3 or 4 kharacters, using the same strings, and the same kameos. Even if I do somehow win against them (because you end up memorizing their go-to kombos), it just gets so bland. 

I just want to play who I want, get good at them, and have fun in the process.
The game won't even work properly sometimes with all the other issues I mentioned above. 

Overall, I don't regret buying the premium edition (got it for 30% off). But this game just has so much resistance against anyone who wants kasual pla, like me.

The META may never disappear, and I can live with that, but NRS to wake up and address the other issues plaguing this otherwise fantastic franchise.

Save your money first until this game is fundamentally fixed, or better yet just grab the older titles on sale if you want your kombat fix.",1705590179,1705635831,False,7,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed MK11 a lot and I think it was a worthy successor of the franchise, Ik a lot of people hated it, people thought it was bland and much more restricted comparing to MKX but at least it had some good online play, tons of content, tons of customization, and some variety of game modes, MK1 brings nothing new to the table, or does it? Ok, let's talk about the elephant in the room... Kameos, this is one of the dumbest ideas I've ever seen in a fighting game, ruining the essence of MK's nature 1v1 Kombat to this weird hybrid of tag team, but instead of 2v2 It's still 1v1, but both players use a main character and a side character? Very bizarre choice, but the mechanic is so badly implemented as well, moves that are unsafe can now be safe on block when you cancel into a kameo, and it's insanely boring to play against or even use it in the first place, special moves or kombo strings that are unsafe there's a reason for it, maybe it's a launcher, maybe it resets the opponent, maybe it extends the kombo for more damage, meaning the high risk - high reward is literally thrown out the window with this new kameo system, this mechanic is so bland and flawed that at some point is turns laughable.
As for the gameplay itself, I genuinely like it, they got rid of the bad things from MK11, and got fixed in this one, no more krushing blows (I still liked some of them, but the requirement sometimes was frustrating and straight unbalanced, specially the 50/50 failed grab ones), no more breakaway, Fatal Blows now start an animation before the hit meaning players can now predict better to punish and made it less spammy, and lastly characters in this game don't need offensive meter to begin kombos, I see this as a very good plus to me, I enjoy some more rushed down aggressive play style as opposed to the more strategic, zoning and slow pace from MK11.  
You only have pretty much 3 game modes as I write this review: Story, Invasions and lastly Towers, the Towers are the same old klassic arcade ladder, Story works exactly the same since MK9 (each character have their own chapter and the fight ends, cinematic begins etc.), and a new game: Invasions is so awful, how do I even describe this.... It's a Map fighter with some elements of RPG and you go ahead and fight against CPU opponents with some modifiers that mostly came from MK11? Whose idea was this?, it's insanely boring, and it gets old pretty quickly, at some point I need to take a break and stop playing Invasions because how boring it is.
Now this section is more about the problems with the PC Port, how can we in 2024 have companies that launch games at 30fps, but oh ""the 30fps create a cinematic feel"", it's stupid and very out of touch in today's standards of technology, if Smash Bros can run at 60fps on a Switch, or Tekken at 60fps in every platform, absolutely MK1 can run at 60fps on PC (and even consoles), this is laziness at its peak.
And with all of that, there you go, that's MK1, people pay 70€ (or more if you want dlcs) to have this unfinished and broken game, I genuinely think the MK franchise will die once more like Armageddon unless NRS makes a drastic move and changes the game entirely, maybe add more game modes? Create a second versus mode with kameos disabled? Mini-games? Even the krypt is missing for f*** sakes, also why is Test Your Might can't be played by 2 players like in MKX? This is such a waste of opportunity…
I want nothing but success to this franchise, but I really have to put this game as negative, MK9, MKX AND MK11 are 100% superior games to play as opposed to MK1.",1705556289,1705557006,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The character roster is the smallest I've ever seen from a MK game, which could be forgiven if the characters were each unique and varied- they're not. Character designs are unbelievably bland, from their appearance to their boring movesets. Previous fan-favorites are just made uglier and generic. There are fully-programmed characters within the story, like Ermac, which for whatever reason isn't within the roster and is completely unavailable for players.

Half the roster is locked behind paywall, costing $8 EACH on top of a $70 game. I understand the DLC costs for other IPs like Omni-Man and Homelander, but even central, base game characters like Quan Chi and Shang Tsung will run you that $8 price tag. 

While MK of course isn't known for spectacular stories, characters, or voice acting, this game brings it even further down. Absolutely miserable performances from many characters, none more so than Nitara voiced by Megan Fox.

So you shouldn't buy it for great gameplay nor a satisfying story. Are you here for great visuals and fatalities? No. While it's certainly a subjective opinion on this last part, I don't think you'll find anyone saying they liked MK1's visuals over any other entry in the last decade. Graphics are visually passable yet unsatisfactory given the absurd price tag, and the fatalities are simultaneously more cartoonish and unoriginal than MK10 or 11.

There also was a great change in the fighting scene animation which the camera would change direction on some special moves. Kind of liked that one.
More combination moves are added. Good job. A little bit expensive DLCs and in game purchases btw. I bought this game on release and now the price of upcoming DLCs are even more than the base game which is a nice WTF! The DLCs only contain skins though.
Totally I recommend this to those who are much of a fan to these genre of games. It might get boring for normal or non competitive players so be careful.

Review is written based on the playthrough of the story. After quite some time i return to a MK title and honestly this did not dissapoint. An intriguing story in a new timeline that offers a new start in a non-Mortal Kombat in a world restarted by Liu Kang offers a feeling of content as, as expected, the plot thickens with the return of some old evil-doers. 

The fighting in itself is smooth and the two fighter system gives it a nice addition in comboing. Graphics are beutiful with a lot of detail, the world is filled with ingredients that make it feel real. The fighting system underwent some changes (i.e. X-ray attack) and feels somewhat simpler to previous titles which is not a bad thing. In my eyes MK was always the simpler fighting title for casuals like me and also more hardcore fighter game players to enjoy. 

The game has some minor issues, the switching between cinematic 30fps and then 60fps in Kombat is a bit straining on the eyes, more sensitive people might have a problem with that, and sometimes the loading times are a bit too long as one would expect them. I think with some further updates the developers will iron this out. what I am missing is also the option of high frame rate that some would argue might be very important in a fighter title. Also the story is a bit short in my opinion although I cannot say it is not enjoyable except for the final climb, that part was a bit lackluster for me. The choice of fighters is more than suitable though I am of the opinion that a triple-A title should not lock characters behind DLC's. In this regard some studios might learn a thing or two from the God of War developers. 

In the end the game still offers quite a bit of enjoyment and those minor faults can be corrected with further updates down the line. And maybe we can hope for a free story DLC with some origin stories of our new-world fighters. If you are a hardcore fan of the MK series you will buy it at any price, in general I would say wait for a sale.",1705532636,1705532636,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MK1 feels like an unfinished beta, and it seems the companies behind it don't care and/or actively express mockery & sarcasm towards players & fans for their legitimate criticisms. This has gotten so bad that the larger community surrounding the game are in an outright revolt currently, feel free to check the game's socials if you don't believe me.

There's [b]constant[/b] desync issues online. The character grind is [i]absurdly[/i] slow. The gameplay is simple & already stale.

They nickle & dime you for costumes that are either uninteresting or worse versions of what past games had- don't get me started on the awful bodysuits & Netherrealm's snark surrounding them, I really could go on & on.

Without any real spoilers; there was great potential with the story mode and the big reset, but it's filled with nonsense and uninteresting high school level melodrama.

Maybe they'll fix it someday, but for now it feels [i]far[/i] below what many players including myself expected.

MK1 is a game that is easy to learn, but a legendary one to master. You can get by as a beginner, and face reasonable competition as one. As a master, you will find much more skilled combo demons, that will show you what can be done when you are rhythm master playing guitar hero or rockband. Its very nice that you can look at your abilities mid match against a cpu and start in the basic section and remember a few at a time. Do those a few times, then move down the list. Once, that list is done, move to the next section and so on and so on. Its very easy to learn this way. Also the combos just seem to make sense as you will quickly memorize most of the abilities and combos, much quicker than i remember when i briefly attempted to play a match awhile back, but that was it, just a match or two. The invasions mode is what i mostly play. It adds a little openness and uniqueness to just spamming fights. Theres level ups, skill points, kaemo fighters, various unlockables, such as relics and pendants that offer var2ying levels of strength as well as stats, from pretty normal, like fire resistance, and shoot fireballs, to wildly unique. One talisman i add actually passed gas at a fighter. Another spawns a bunch of little guys that charge and explode on hitting your opponent. this you can trigger during battle, and has 1 to several. Relics do alot of stuff, from adding passive buffs, to sucking your life, to taunting. They have multiple things that are actively, but passively. The game is amazing.

Sonic fox got cooked a few days ago on twitter/X the other day for saying that he wished mk did a little better comparing it to the likes of Tekken 8 knowing fully well that NRS asked him and other pros for insight and feedback during development of the game. MAYBE he didn't know this was going to be mk1 in totallity but that is the current state of things. 
   MK1 players, I mean PLAYERS, not casuals who like watching fatalities have plenty of issues with this game.  People like characters and franchises and remain loyal despite flaws. I get it. I LOVE mortal kombat. I was excited for it like I was for elden ring after years of dumping HOURS onto dark souls 1-3. I played the crap out of MK11 and don't regret one single bit. Despite my unwavering loyalty for female ninjas and cool ass bruce lee archetypes, I decided not to pre-order this game. IM GLAD. IMAGINE PAYING $100 (i think more) for a incomplete game that ASKS YOU TO SPEND MORE FOR THINGS THAT WERE WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR FREE IN MK11. 

   Guys, I spent my weekend playing mk11 for nostalgia. I played kombat league to demigod with skarlet for fun. In between ranked matches, I'd go to look at ALL THE NICE SKINS EVERY CHARACTER CAME WITH. They all had nice gear. After thousands of hours played, I have yet to unlock everything or at least most things via the shrine. I will never forget this particular moment as a gamer till I die. I'm a very tolerant person in the sense that I don't care about alot of details. IF a game is garbage. I'll play it and find some fun in it or overlook things. However, mk1, literally had me say ""Wait, that's it?"" when the shrine told me ""come back next season"" or whatever. My wife turned to me as I said that and told me, ""well aren't you glad you didn't preorder it?""

   Want to be a franchise slave? Buy it. Maybe they make something better in like 5 years or something.
Want a good game? Maybe wait for Tekken 8 or go back to another fighter that you love. Idk man. Im going to play mk11 until they drop skarlet in mk1 (RIP not happening). OR maybe I'll just go play elden ring till the dlc comes out. That may be an abysmal time to wait but I WILL LOVE EVERY SINGLE SECOND because it's fun and has tons of content. Tell me I'm wrong. I'll just assume you think 6Arakin is good.

I hopped on the MK bandwagon with the MK9 reboot and was hooked on Netherrealm Games ever since. It sucks to see a once great company be reduced to what it is now, between the micro transactions galore, pre-order bonuses, and scummy tactics it really does feel like a whole different beast. 

You can only get Shang-Tsung, the villain of the game, through pre-ordering or handing over real money. On top of that 4 other characters/Kameos are also purchasable from the start, however you're able to unlock them just by playing the story which they very sneakily leave out. So not only is the game $70, but you also don't get access to all the characters that you technically ALREADY payed for as their characters downloads are required to play the game. 

Online matchmaking is actually wild, as I currently have a W/L of 20/11 and am being matched against actual gods with a W/L in the 500/300s. Why. 
They bring back Kombat League, which can be a fun way of unlocking new outfits for your favorite characters, you just have to be able to recognize frames at the speed of The fucking Flash, and react accordingly, or you'll get wiped from one screen to the other by guys doing 50% combos with ease and calling you a slur for even daring to hop in the ring with prime Mike Tyson.

The big gimmick of this MK is the new addition of the ""kameos"" as they couldn't be bothered to actually include playable fan favorite characters and instead made them your sidekick and gave them 2 moves to do as combo extenders. Good luck finding anyone not using Sareena for her blade attack over and over again. They also made this game a lot floatier, with the addition of air combos and air specific moves, they just forgot to give everyone more than 2 combo starters or any launcher at all, making half of their move set completely useless for some. 

Instead of towers this time they have ""invasions"" which is their way of getting the community off their back about bringing back conquest mode from older titles. And instead of The Krypt this time around, you get to just piss away 1000 hard earned coins at a time into a dragons mouth and watch it burn it all away in the random hopes of getting something actually cool aside from a yellow color swap for Goro or something stupid.

NRS's pricing strategy for skins introduces a disconcerting dynamic, as these cosmetic enhancements, priced significantly, disappointingly lack substantive alterations to the characters' apparel. Instead of offering a transformative visual experience, these skins merely tinker with color schemes, leaving players yearning for more meaningful customization options. Moreover, the audacious move of charging $10 for a cut-scene, readily available for passive consumption on platforms like YouTube, raises eyebrows within the gaming community. The invasions mode, laden with untapped potential, falls short of expectations, delivering an experience that feels lackluster and burdensome to engage with. The game's mechanics beg for a more refined and immersive gameplay design to fully capitalize on the richness that the concept of invasions holds. The disheartening aspect surfaces when hard-earned skins lose their exclusivity, promptly making their appearance in the in-game shop in the subsequent season. This renders the arduous grind for skins during invasions seemingly meaningless, as the allure of exclusivity dissipates. The dichotomy emerges starkly when considering that individuals with disposable income can effortlessly bypass the grind by resorting to real money transactions. This strategic maneuver raises questions about the game's ethos, seemingly driven by corporate greed rather than a commitment to enhancing the gaming experience. The juxtaposition of prioritizing profit over rectifying fundamental issues within the game speaks volumes about the overarching motivations at play. Despite these reservations, the enduring connection to the game persists, anchored in a nostalgic bond with a beloved franchise from one's formative years. The reluctance to witness this cherished franchise tarnished by profit-centric decisions underscores the tension between the passion for the game and the disenchantment with the corporate interests steering its course.

Even with a top-of-the-line CPU and graphics card, I find the game borderline unplayable in multiplayer. 

I think the story mode is very silly, very fun, and has some great cinematics. However, the gameplay is definitely worse than MK11, and the online experience and competitiveness of the game does not hold up to the likes of Strive and SF6.

-janky performance. Acknowledged by the devs.

-The story is fine but the ending is like the writers were like ""fuck it! random dude fights the final boss and wins 'cuz power of friendship!""

-Tutorials explain the basics of the game and how the Kameo system works. But nothing specific character wise. 
For example: this string is good for whiff punishing, use this as an ati-air, use this for punishing a recovery heavy attack on block, etc.
No fast scrolling the Move List. No way to tag special moves nor combos.

-Multiplayer menu is a joke: you select your team, the mode & you enter matchmaking. Can't practice in the meantime. Gotta love looking at the fire spinning thing. Ranking per account, not fighter used (like SF6).

-Kustomization is one accesory (mask, weapon), the outfit (skin and their respective color pallette). Which is an improvement compared to MK11 imo.

-invasion is just filler material.

-We could be getting cross-play soon (tag was removed from store page). Doesn't have a ping meter during a match.

Now for the things I wish they didn't change since the other releases.

Where is my krypt? The krypt in mk11 was so good so I was really excited to get one in this game with tons of references like the one in mk11 but sadly there is none.

Also the customization is good but I miss the detail you could implement on the characters in mk11.

And lastly I miss variations like you could do in MKX and MK11.

PS: now with 250hrs in and played 100% of all invasions, story mode, almost all combo challenges and reached grandmaster in KL with 3 different characters i have to say my option chanced a bit, NRS seens do not knows how to balance a fighting game after more than 10yrs doing only that and the technical problems have been renewed, most of the ones in the release were fixed and a bunch of new ones have poped off since, this game is a mess.

This project was not started 4yrs ago as they said, this is obvious now, maybe the story was written since the end of MK11, but not the game itself, i would love to change my mind, but for now im saying this game is a 7/10 now that hype of the release is over and so little was done in the right direction, its a shame!

I am a huge fan of the franchise but it lacks all the good stuff 11, 9 and 10 had... good game... but WB turned out to put too much money in greedy mechanics / systems + massive promotion.. for a game that does not deliver ..except on the single player story mode..

Story Mode :   9.5/10 
Good reboot and connections and winks to previous MK titles.. fun ride overall 

Gameplay : 7.5/10
Its is definitely a watered down version of Mk11...  

you can no longer configure your characters moves leaving less space on that front, where you gain variety is with the kameo fighters you pick that can add to your main character playstyle and patch some weaker points... 
its a bit messy / clunky and visually overstimulating when 4 characters are on screen throwing powers... 
this said, gameplay is as tight as you can expect from the MK franchise, 
with more aerial combinations then the previous titles... roster is small but solid and kombat pack will give us full fan service I don't doubt it.. 

Visuals: 8.5/10

Story mode is pretty overall and well directed
Environments are gorgeous (using the full potential of UNREAL ENGINE) ... 
its very colorful and pink and purple , but some other environments can be dark and gore too.. so it balance in a way. 

character designs:  7/10
for most of them, they are less detailed and a bit more uncanny than MK11, 
some designs are better than others

Fatalities : 6/10
 They are shorter and faster.. still super gore as expected but very buggy at times.. 

Extra : 

As all else, the gear system is minimal, 
and reduced to one item customisable per character, which leave barely any room to customisation, 
which is a bit sad, 
skins are rare but nice but you can no longer change skins in the local fight menu before a fight or have many choices... so you stick with what you chose in the Kustomisation menu.. 

INVASIONS: 4.5/10

Meh.. its kind of the only way to unlock stuff.. 
appart from throwing your gold to the shrine.. 
its an ok but very minimalistic long tutorial with many fights... 
with very basic, almost cheesy mobile game app mechanics.. pepperred with rpg components that you barely control

If they bring DLC'S, hoping they add to the gear system or bring tag team.. 

Feels like a watered mk11 variant with some good and bad stuff

overall a fun game, good story, but not a step up... even a step back in some spheres..

The reason for this was because even though I spend lots of cash pre-ordering the game for early access and access to all the DLC content it would not work on my computer. This game was plagued with horrible stuttering and frame-rate issues at launch that finally subsided for me a coupe months ago (that was in Nov. 2023). PC players to this day are still having similar issues that I was having when I first got the game. Second, the new invasions mode is boring, repetitive, and either too easy or bullshit depending on the level/fight you choose on the map. The invasions map is uninteresting, the leveling is boring, and the challenges and challenge fights are usually confusing or unnecessarily difficult and test patience rather than skill. What makes this even more unfortunate is that leveling up characters is faster when playing the invasions mode, and new unlockable cosmetics for each season are usually only earned through invasions.

How do I say all this and put this game as ""recommended""? I have seen other reviewers on Steam say this for years so this is not a new complaint, but I wish there was a ""mixed"" review option. The gameplay and story mode are great. It is awesome seeing the characters have their stories reset especially since this is the 12th main line game in the franchise. This allows for newcomers to enjoy the story and for fans to appreciate the new character development and compare it with past entries. The fighting feels solid enough and is better than MK11 in my opinion as the separate offensive and defensive bars have been merged into the EX meter again which is a much better system. Fatal blows still exist which is frustrating if you play the game a lot because you will see one almost every fight. You are encouraged to use it as it has armor to go through opponents attacks, they need 3 EX bars and their Kameo to combo break it, and it plays a flashy animation that is cool the first few times but gets old the longer you play the game (this has been an issue since X-rays in MKX, though fatal blows are better in my opinion as players cannot spam their ""ultimate"" ability in MK11 or this game). The Kameo system is also a bit silly in my opinion and only changes up the game slightly. Most characters I play I use the Kameo system to make up for shortcomings of the main characters I play instead of experimenting with different play-styles. For example, with Omni-Man why would I use any other Kameo besides Kung Lao? That Kameo makes up for his lack of low moves and allows for full screen mix-ups. Some may argue that there are other character options for lows such as frost but frost is objectively a worse pick as Omni-Man already has great pressure and just needs some more ways to mix-up and break his opponent's guard. I often find myself forgetting to use Kameos or just spamming the one ability I actually picked them for instead of trying new things, and this happens in towers, practice, and ranked games. I wish we got more playable fighters instead of the Kameos as balancing is a bigger issue (which NRS does not need, they already have a hard time getting the balance right without assist fighters).

Despite all of this I still think this is a fun game if you play it for the story, play it local/casually with friends or family, or play it to get better online and rank up. You will not be able to level everything up very easily if you stay away from invasions, but at least you will have a more enjoyable time with the game actually playing the modes that are tried and true to this series. MK1 story and fighting is a 8/10 while invasions is a solid 0/10 piece of shit mode that needs to be re-worked or changed completely. Or they could just do character and rotating towers like in MK11 but not hide it within the invasions menu and make you sit through BS load screens to access.

The shrine is the worst thing they could have added to this game, pay 1000 koins for a long ass animation that's essentially a slot machine for one random thing that might not even be a skin. How did it go from the amazing Krypt in MK11 to this. Another extension of this issue comes from the severe lack of customization, you can choose from palettes for certain skins, and you get one choice of gear to change, which half the time is either a mask or a characters weapon, another downgrade from MK11s great customization. 

The menus even on a good system take as long to navigate as it takes for your opponent to pull of their long ass combos. You have to wait a solid 5 to 6 seconds between each menu, which it an extreme turn off especially for a game made in 2023. Also for some reason the game is locked at 60 fps and the menu and fatal blows are locked at 30, and there's no cross play yet, which is unfortunate.

The Invasions mode and single-player options in general boring and inferior to other games (except for the story, I actually enjoyed that very much). Invasions is a glorified conveyor belt of fights like the tower but you can walk on the map and do ""challenges"" for boring skins. The reason I gripe about the lack of fun single-player options is due to the fact that the multiplayer in this game is without a doubt one of the most absurdly annoying things I've ever had the misfortune of playing. Also the main towers that serve as a source for cosmetics are a chore to navigate through and don't even show you the rewards that you get.

The DLC prices are pretty bad, like really bad actually. Kombat Pack 1 costs almost as much as the full game which is insane for just a few characters. And then there's the fact that Shang Tsung is blocked by paywall, which is also dumb considering you can play him in the campaign. It's like they were literally teasing your balls with it.

Hopefully in the future most of the issues I have get ironed out so I can enjoy the game as much as I did previous titles, but as it stands, even barring the ridiculous DLC prices, the game doesn't feel as fun as it should be. Hopefully they add some more enticing single player content in the future, something like MK9 or MK11.

With these reasons I can't in good faith recommend this to any sane human being, but I'm a cuck so I'm probably still gonna play the game a shit load anyways. Ok bye",1703468387,1704844640,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The realms are living in peace, or as peaceful as the realms can be.. BUT Keeping with tradition it's time for a new Mortal Kombat competition, and this time Outworld is the host.  The game follows the events of the competition  and introduces some new or could it be familiar villians.. time will tell..

The Story - Wow, the story is amazing, it plays like a movie, you watch a really interesting set of stories, and then you are introduced to a fight, then more story..  This could be the setting of the next movie and it would be completely awesome.. in fact the whole storyline seen the previous few games has been really amazing.. This one follows suit.  I don't even really enjoy fighting games but managed to actually play this one all the way through.

Gameplay - If you've played one Mortal Kombat you've likely played them all..  They pretty much all play the same with some minor alterations.  The game is broken down into a few different sections. 

The first one is Story mode, where you play through the amazing story.  

The second one is Invasion, which sees you play through a bunch of different battles, level up characters, level up Kamoas (various fighters from previous game that act as your helper during battles) and level up your account.  

The third is towers, which is your traditional Mortal Kombat experience, you pick the tower you want to tackle of various sizes..  You can also select the difficulty level. A great way to level up characters and kamoas, and if you enjoy the old school Mortal Kombat this will be for you..

Last and certainly least is the Multiplayer, while I say least, that might not be the case for everyone, but it is for me.. I'm just not a big multiplayer guy, especially in fighting games, so this was never going to be my cup of tea,, although from what I hear it's exceptionally good this time around, but for me, I'm on the shallow end of the fighting game pool.

Pro's

Great Story, like literally amazing (did I mention I hate fighting games)
Easy Controls and Fatalities (In older games I could never do a fataility, in this one they were super easy.. not brutalities on the other hand. OUCH)
Awesome graphics 
Easy BUT Grindy achievements (100% this game and I hate fighting games lol) 

Con's 

I suck at multiplayer (not really sure it's a con, but one for me)
Certain battles are complete cheese
Quite a few crashes when doing towers 

Recommendations 

I recommend this game for the story alone, it was probably the best 8 hours I ever spent playing a fighting game.  Also for those achievement hunters you can easily 100% this game, although be ready for a fairly intense and boring grind, getting 5 kameos to max level, going to take ALONG time and doing the same invasion over and over and over again.  The price might be a bit steep if fighting games aren't your thing, so keep that in mind.  I bought the Premium Edition, but at a steep discount.  I felt like my money was well spent.

Lets get the obvious points out of the way. It's a Mortal Kombat game, therefore it is awesome by default. Compared to other fighting games, MK1 awesome. The game looks great, has awesome game play, a lot to do, and has continued support updates. Everything you'd want to have in a AAA fighting title. 

HOWEVER, I feel this game really shows a lack of compassion. Which is very unusual for this studio. It feels like left over ideas, and characters from MK9, MK10, and MK11 where all compiled into this game, and the story line had to make sense around these limitations. (Ex. Why does Havik have such a large role in the story? Isn't Havik viewed as a more humorous character in the series? It makes me wonder if Mokap was unavailable for this role?) MK10 and MK11 both had fuller rosters and better story lines. If you are a long term fan of the series, it won't take long to realize MK1 is a retelling/rehash of MK: Deadly Alliance, and MK: Armageddon. It is very clear. Which is a shame because the previous three installments have done such a good job establishing a new timeline. These games where able to completely reinvent the series and separate it from the darker PS2/XBOX/GAMECUBE days. Why return to this time after all this effort has been put in to separate yourselves from it?

I do like the idea of Tag Kombat, and I thought it worked well in MK11. Unfortunately, MK1 does not pull this off as well. By separating the roster into ""Fighter"" and ""Tag Partner"" (whatever they are referred to as in game) groups, it limits the fighter select screen. Additionally, by separating the roster this way, it relegates iconic characters (Jax, Goro, and even Sonya) to merely minor, background, assisting characters. This could have absolutely been optimized better. It's really disappointing. What pushes this complaint over into frustration is some of the characters can be used as both a fighter or a partner (Sub Zero, Scorpion, etc.) If this is the case, why aren't all the playable characters interchangeable? This just shows a lack of effort on the developers part.    

ADDITIONALLY, paying full price for a ""complete"" game only to have to wait for each additional character to be ""revealed"" is marketing nonsense. It's greedy, and it really shows. If I pay full price for both the main game and DLC, I expect the content to be there. I basically spent an extra $40 on 1-2 characters. The other characters will not be released for months.  if the developers have no issues uploading new costumes and minor cosmetics for additional fees, then please put the content I already paid for in the game. This seems like a very reasonable and understandable request. 

Will I always love Mortal Kombat? 
Yes. 

Will I put a lot of hours into this title? 
Absolutely. 

However, when the next installment is released, I will not be buying any ""deluxe"" editions. I will get the base game and wait to see how they decide to ""unveil"" the complete game. This game is the product of what happens when marketing people get involved with video games.

As a fighter it's great, and plays tight. MK always delivers there. However, a lot of what worked so well over the past couple of MK games, and drew players back to the series, seems to have been tossed out the window.
My advice: wait until all the DLC is released and you can pick it up for $25 - $30.

A dash of MK9's movement, slight amounts of MKX's meter system, and a refined flawless block system and fatal blow system from MK11, all things that would make this game extremely fun when combined with how MK games played. Combos are fun to pull off when you finally learn them, frame data is meant to be respected, as it should be (instead of the crappy flawless block launchers into fatal blow dealing 50% in MK11 when you clearly had your turn), but everything feels slow and grindy elsewhere. Pay 10$ for 3 fatalities, pay 10$ for these really cool skins, or deal with the repetitive grind for the same recolours in Invasions. After the first season I was thrilled, my ADHD brain felt really excited with how fast I was earning all these skins and whatnot, but when the 2nd season hit and I had to do the SAME thing again, instant turn off, per se. You just jock your Strength stat up and uppercut your way through everything, its boring as hell after you've already done that the first time. 

Other problems have included the Player 1 bug which has long been fixed, online is full of people abusing the most OP setups (or just abusing that one Sareena move. Also, people probably being toxic as fuck because why not), and you can't just go to unranked because chances are you'll find people even worse because theres no SBMM, and people complaining about Crossplay (I can see why, personally it never bothered me with this game, but its definitely a bummer when you can't play with your friends on different consoles). 

A big fix to some of these is to make various purchasables earnable at a reasonable amount, maybe even through Invasions, that way Invasions gives you even more and would probably make it feel a lot less slow and grindy, while still providing the option to pay for it that way the people that still wanna spend money to get it faster (or to support the devs) can still do that, and people who can't do that can still obtain it, that way the greedy company still gets their monetary value and people can actually get what they want. Again, the player 1 bug has been fixed for months now, and Crossplay is actually coming. And... people will be people, I guess. The only way the game is TRULY enjoyable is by fighting AI, but even then that'll eventually get boring.

TL;DR, greedy company scams everyone EA style, the only positives is the gameplay, but even then its ruined by repetition and other people being assholes to gain rank.",1704644653,1704644653,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-----

This game is an interesting situation, because in comparison to their previous titles, it's highly apparent that Mortal Kombat 1 is an incomplete package. It comes with a full-length story mode, towers, an all-new Invasions mode, and a number of online features that are fewer than what NRS typically puts out. On top of that, there are some quality-of-life features missing from things like the training mode, though these are gradually being added in via updates.

Hopefully the Krypt makes a return as well, because I'm not feeling this new idea of churning out thousands of coins at a shrine just to unlock stuff. Similar to Invasions, it's dreadfully dull. At least the skins you unlock are cool as heck.

Of course, the most important aspect of just about any game is the gameplay itself, and it pleases me to say that after their disaster with Mortal Kombat 11, NetherRealm has redeemed themselves in my eyes. Unlike with 11, I can pour hours into this game and not feel as if I'm wasting them.

I'm surprising myself with this verdict, honestly, because when the Kameo system was first disclosed, I was irritated. With all due respect to tag-based fighters, they were never exactly my cup of tea, but now that I've put almost 200 hours into this game I can say that I'm not so skeptical about Kameos now. Other than serving as a means of adding in more characters at the cost of full movesets unlike with the main lineup, Kameos offer a multi-layered experience for one-on-one fights - or should I say, two-on-two?

At least I don't have to memorize two full movesets with main characters before getting into a match. Instead I only have to learn at least one main character AND a Kameo's three-, four-, or five-move list before jumping into the action. Spares me some effort.

Anti-airs have improved since MK11, especially with the addition of the up block mechanic, which grants a full combo if used on a jump-in OR a grounded overhead. I still prefer using my jab or uppercut for this purpose, but since there are still some jump-ins that are hard to challenge this way, at least I have something else to fall back on if necessary. Just be advised that up-block loses to lows and throws, the latter of which will deal increased damage.

While Flawless Block makes a return, it no longer offers reversal options like it did in MK11, it just reduces chip damage dramatically. This makes the mechanic much more tolerable as it now rewards excellent defense WITHOUT overly punishing the offender. Excellent change.

Breakers are back, but they cost three bars now. I think block breakers should make a return as well, but alas, no sign of them yet. Would sure help in balancing out the massive chip damage and abundant meter gain, but still, I'll take what we've got instead of that abhorrent Breakaway mechanic we had to use for the last four years.

With how Fatal Blows have retained their role as each character's practical super move without being tied to your meter, you now have two reasons to spend meter instead of three: enhancing your special attacks and allowing you to use your breaker. While saving meter for your breaker is an optimal strategy, you should know that you build meter like candy in this game, so you need not feel shy about enhancing your specials here.

...actually, I misspoke: you have three reasons for your meter still, because the Last Breath mechanic has also returned. If you would die from chip damage, you spend meter to keep yourself in the game, and unlike in MK11, it doesn't permanently delete a block from your meter, so assuming you manage to make a comeback, you can rebuild that bar still.

However...I ""have"" noticed instances where I would block while still having meter and the Last Breath mechanic does not activate at all. The cause of this eludes me right now. So don't rely on this too much as a safety net.

Some things about this game could be improved still, but frankly, I'm more optimistic for this game than I ever was for MK11. I look forward to seeing what else NRS will do for this game...provided they don't make any missteps.

The story mode, you say? Well...this is NRS. Sindel's retcon in MK11 aside, they've had a good track record with their stories, and now is no different. Go play through it, or give it a watch.

That's my thoughts as of now. There may be adjustments in light of whatever content NRS adds to this game, in which case I will rewrite this review. But for now, BIG thumbs-up from me.",1698200947,1704590946,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Main thing to note is that most of this games value will be wrapped up in the story mode for those who enjoy/are invested heavily in the MK lore like me. 

Invasions can be a mixed bag depending on the level of grinding you are comfortable with. There is mixed reception however I have found invasions to be a bit repetitive, but that is also comparing the experience I had during MK 11 and MKX when dealing with the Krypt. Here you'll find invasions to be a more straight forward experience then the complexities of MK 11's Krypt when achieving goals season to season or in the hunt to unlock items.

The micro transactions can be a bit overwhelming however I find there is enough content season to season and from the shrine aka the MK Koin roulette wheel and have picked up many of the items I actually value such as the maskless ninjas in season 2. The micro transactions I find are really geared towards those who want to add extra features to their main champions such as skins from previous MK games (e.g. Deception or Deadly Alliance), but so far I have found the game to have enough content to satisfy my needs that I don't turn to the store often outside of browsing. It really does feel that the game is having its free content spread out throughout the seasons which for better or worse will probably mean it'll take a bit longer to get everything and removed a bit of the wall I hit with MK 11's Krypt. Though MK 11's krypt was vast it just became a little too tedious for my enjoyment at a certain point.

EDIT: I originally gave the game a thumbs up, but since launch. most of the problems I talked about in the review below were not addressed (some are very much ingrained in the games structure), and while NRS seems to be committed to patching the game, they are also releasing new characters at what feels like break-neck speed, while the game itself still has deep issues in matchmaking, weird menus and layout decisions, and a lot of ""time wasting"" outside of gameplay (why can I only activate the shrine in single steps? Why do I have to navigate seasonal towers with the invasion interface?). I must also say that after more playtime, I do not enjoy the Kameo system as much as I did in the beginning. Many characters only have one or two Kameos that are clearly optimal, there is little choice or customizability, and when said Kameo gets changed in any way, it has a huge effect on the characters using that Kameo.
But most importantly, the competition for MK1 has gotten even stronger. Street Fighter 6 is still incredibly fun and has a large active community, even though DLC rollout has been very slow. GranBlue Fantasy Versus Rising was released and is simply great, with fast snappy matchmaking, great netcode, fun gameplay and a huge roster. Tekken 8 is about to launch, and if recent impressions from Betas and Demos are any indication, will be awesome as well (as long as they don't fumble the Netcode). So right now, I just cannot recommend MK1, as there are just better alternatives, no matter what you are looking for in a fighting game. Very disappointing.

[b]Original Review below:[/b]

Look, it's a fun game, it's beautiful, it's Mortal Kombat. If you are a fan of the series or of fighting games in general, check it out. However, if you only have a passing interest and want to play a new fighting game, it is very hard to recommend MK1 over Street Fighter 6.
Yes, they are very different games, but SF6 has delivered such a full package that almost anyone can find something fun to do. Almost every aspect, from gameplay to presentation is fine tuned in SF6. MK1 on the other hand delivers what you expect and is still an entertaining and well-made game, but so many parts just fall short. It is frustratingly close to being great.

Almost every part of this game has a small part that feels slightly undercooked: 
[list]
[*]The worst offender is surely the (ranked) matchmaking that might as well be prehistoric in the current state. Once you are in the match, everything feels good and stable, but waiting times are too long, no crossplay at release might hurt the playerbase in the long run (although it was promised to be added later), and the fact that you cannot wait for online matches in training mode was already unacceptable 5 years ago.
[*]Graphics are great and the facial animations (especially in cutscenes) might be the best in the industry. But small visual glitches during gameplay and especially during KO screens are frequent. Cutscences, Fatal Blows and Fatalities are locked to 30 fps
[*]NRS still makes the best cinematic story modes in the genre, but this one feels slightly short and rushed towards the end, as if one or two chapters were not fully explored.
[*]While unlocking outfits, brutalities, etc. was a catastrophe at the launch of MK11, I'm not convinced that the total removal of a Krypt was the right choice.
[*]Core gameplay is SUPER FUN and the Kameo system seems well thought out, even if there are some balance problems at launch. However, I personally don't know if the loss of old mainstay character like Jax, Sonya or the Kombat Kids as playable characters was worth it (but this is a very subjective thing)...
[*]Menus are well structured and easy to navigate, but especially the custumization menu can fell sluggish and frequent (if short) loading pauses make everthing feel unelegant and tedious.
[*]A lot of options for single player content is great, from the story mode to rotating towers to the new invasion mode. But why do I have to navigate the seasonal towers with this slow, clunky board game-esque interface, instead of a single menu where I can see everything on offer at one glance?
[*]Having a day 1 DLC character (that you could also get as preorder bonus) does also not induce any goodwill.
[/list]

P.S.: This might just be me, but with one or two exceptions, I feel the fatalities in MK11 were significantly more entertaining and avoided the awkward ""posing with a corpse"" that has made a return in this game...",1695852243,1704458513,False,0,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Have o play online if you want to unlock anything in this game. Then comes the old classic favorite, loot boxes. What's wrong with using Koins to buy the stuff i want like a normal shop?

Obviously, best played with friends and possibly for a story. Don't get fooled by the graphics, this game isn't worth the full price nor the amount of space it takes up.

I will give the devs props for the transitions from menus to the fight. But that's it.

Now don't get me wrong I love MK1. But there are some things that it lacks. First things first, it feels very rushed. Graphics-wise, it doesn't feel very different from MK11. It has a pretty good story with more character development than any other MK game. Some characters like Reptile or Baraka aren't punching bags anymore. Gameplay-wise, it's a good idea to bring cameos, but sometimes they feel very useless and dull. And it doesn't feel as balanced as MK11. Customizing characters once again is only for the looks of your character and doesn't change anything. Speaking of customization, MK11 had a far more detailed system for it, but let's not forget that there is also the cameo characters roster for it. Speaking of the roster, It has one of the best rosters I've ever seen in MK. I just want to find and shoot the guy who thought having Megan Fox as Nitara was a good idea. Overall, MK1 is a good game.

[h2]Overview[/h2]
NetherRealm Studios, under the banner of Warner Bros. Games, has released a hard reboot of the iconic fighting series with Mortal Kombat 1 on 19 September 2023. While I'm giving it a thumbs-up for its gameplay and presentation, there's a caveat regarding its length and DLC approach.

[h2]Gameplay: Fast, Fluid, and Fiercely Fun[/h2]
This reboot stays true to the Mortal Kombat legacy with combat that is both fast and fluid, demanding precise timing and a strategic mind. It's easy enough to pick up for newcomers but offers a steep learning curve for those looking to master its depths. The controller is your weapon of choice here, as it plays best with tactile feedback in your hands.

The movesets and combos are intricately crafted, providing a satisfying combat experience. The addition of tagging in combatants adds a fresh twist to fatal blows, keeping the fights interesting. If you enjoyed MK 10 and 11, this one's right up your alley. However, be warned – the unlockables are plentiful but the grind is real. And yes, it's DLC heavy, so be prepared to shell out more for the coolest features.

[h2]Story: Short but Sweetly Campy[/h2]
While the story isn't the main draw for many players, it's well-written and performed, with a delightful dash of campiness. The narrative may be on the shorter side (wrapped it up in under 6 hours), and although it gets a bit wild towards the end, it manages to pull through without losing its essence.

[h2]Graphics and Audio: A Gory Feast for the Eyes and Ears[/h2]
True to form, the game excels in its visual and audio presentation. The settings for each stage are both beautiful and imaginative, providing the perfect backdrops for brutal battles. The gore is exactly what MK fans expect – over the top and in your face. The reimagining of existing characters is nothing short of brilliant.

[h2]Conclusion: Great but Greedy?[/h2]
[b]Mortal Kombat 1 is a well-crafted reboot, offering everything a die-hard MK fan could ask for – stunning visuals, fluid gameplay, and that adrenaline-pumping action the series is known for. However, the game's reliance on DLC, combined with a grinding mechanism and a steep price tag, does leave a slightly bitter taste. It feels like the game is setting up players for future fleecing. For the hardcore MK fan or those catching it on sale, it's definitely worth your time and money. Casual players, though, might find the investment a bit too steep post-story mode. In short, it's a fantastic game shadowed by its commercial strategy.[/b]",1704363918,1704363918,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
1971870,155215524,76561198128383272,428,6,1512,0,374,1705873049,"Let me start off by saying that I usually don't enjoy fighting games. HOWEVER, it has nothing to do with my review, because I do quite enjoy the fighting part of this game. My issues stem from all the other things that are wrong with it, namely:
- Menus, invasions, animations (x-ray/fatalities), basically everything except combat are locked at 30 fps. Biggest offender tbh, there is no excuse for that in a 2023 game. Everything looks choppy to the point where I thought my laptop (Ryzen 7 6 gen + 3080) can't handle the game when it obviously can. More importantly, it's nausea inducing having constant switches between 60 and 30 fps. While on the topic, I can't really tell if the game is optimized poorly or it's just the result of fps cap, which is frustrating in and of itself, cause I know it should run good on my hardware but it doesn't feel like it.
- Monetization and shrine: I guess it's kinda inescapable now in modern games, especially live service ones, like MK, however it's still frustrating how much in-your-face and inescapable it is here. Worst offender: main antagonist as a dlc character even for the ""ultimate"" or whatever edition. Also, why in god's name cannot I skip shrine animation and just get to the fucking common cosmetic straight away?
- This one won't be universal, but frustrating tutorial: yeah, yeah, GIT GUD, but some of the tutorial combos have REALLY tight timings, which is fine for character challenges/mastery/whatever it's called, but imo it's a bit too much for the actual tutorial. As a newcomer to fighting games, I thought tutorial would teach me how to play properly, and instead it frustrated me to no end trying to get the tight timings down for 3 hours straight, when I just wanted to learn the mechanics
- Next one's minor, but ""new"" notification dots everywhere and you have to specifically click through every single new item for them to disappear. I may have mild OCD and it just drives me nuts. Shrine dot whenever you have more than 1000 koins is the whole other level of annoying too
- I've encountered multiple bugs, most notably and frustratingly the one where in Invasions when switching character there's always wrong elements displayed. As a new player, I want to have any advantage I can, and I should be forced to memorize every character's element instead of the game properly displaying them
- There's definitely more, but I'll have to go back in game  to remember what else I thought off when playing and come back here after to update this

On the flip side, the game looks beautiful, x-rays and fatalities are top notch, special moves and combos are great, and I liked this one waaaaay better than MK11 gameplay-wise, so it's not all bad.

But to me MK1 is a great example of a victim and representation of everything that's wrong with the industry today: unpolished rushed release (I don't know how else to explain unnecessary fps cap, when 11 had it patched later anyway, and glitches I've encountered), extreme monetization, FOMO inducing live service elements, etc.",1704363473,1704363473,False,1,0,0.506726443767547607,0,True,False,False

The kameo system gives your fighter very disctincs possibilitys depending on who you chosse as kameo. The story is refreshing and gives a really good impression on what direction MK can be moving foward, but the game is unfinished.

Idk what NRS has been doing but this game shouldn't have been release like this, it's full of visuals bugs and lacks the basics of a fighting game, especially a AAA title that costs more than my kidney. 

I'm not talking about more gear or the krypt or different game modes. I'm talking about the possibility to view replays of my matchs, to see my W/L ratio outside rankings matchs, pin moves on practice mode, been able to play the fatalitys on kustomization. Just look how polish SF6 was at launch and how Tekken 8 is advertising every function of its practice mode. literally basic stuff that should be in every fighting game on release.

I'm not writing all this to attack the game, but it's unbearable the state its in now. and i not even touching the subject of not having crossplay at launch or the poor optimization on PC... its a idiotic move from NRS releasing a game in this state.

So... If you love MK buy it. MK1 has the best gameplay since MKX and has one of the best roster since MK9. Its fun as hell when it works propely. 

But if you just like MK save your money... wait until game has all his issues fixed. Let's just hope that MK1 wasnt killed by NRS before it even release.

The weakest roster in number in comparison to MK11 and MKX. 
Kombat pack costs more than the actual game right now, Jesus greedy mf's.
I finished the story mode in less than 5 hours and it felt like I was watching a movie with some playing on the side, not to mention the end of it with 0 specifics to the final fighter you chose.
I am guessing they will release a dlc to the story but I am sure as hell not paying for it.
And I will probably wait for a year or so when that kombat pack drops to a 10$ like what happened to all others before it in different games.
All in all, I am very disappointed, and the fighters have 0 variety compared to MK11, in MKX you had way more special moves then you have now, in MK11 you could make your own variety for the characters but here it seems so bleak, like a missing piece to the puzzle. The kameo's are a nice touch but half of them are locked behind a paywall anyways so it gets repetitive real quick.
And not to mention Shang Tsung, Quan Chi and Havik being a part of the story and having their movesets and you could even play as Shang Tsung in one of the chapters only to see they are also locked behind a paywall (greedy mf's)

Mortal Kombat 1 on PC, despite its iconic status, presents mixed experiences. The game requires a robust PC setup to optimize performance, which may not be feasible for all players. The story mode is adequate but doesn't stand out. For those interested in competitive online play, the game disappoints due to poor netcode and character balance issues, leading to a less enjoyable experience. The cameo system, intended to add variety, detracts from the classic 1v1 format, further diminishing the game's appeal for traditional fighting game enthusiasts. Players might find better alternatives in other games or on console versions. If there is a rating out of 5. I'd give MK1 around a 2.5-3 of out 5. Probably worth it, if the game is on sale only.

The story has had an interesting reset while maintaining continuity from the previous title. In typical NRS fashion it gets a little out there but it's totally followable and the character performances, while still being a *touch* reminiscent of kung fu cinema b-film (bog standard for this series) are way more humanized in this story mode than in previous titles. I found it compelling and slammed it in a couple of sittings.

The Kombat has been reigned in quite a bit, thank God! Comparing this to something like MK9 where everyone has ridiculous superpowers and teleports are more common than not, MK1 has really tightened up the focus towards martial arts and the fighting genre tech (counters, getups, punishing, etc) and it feels really good! It has a buttery smoothness compared to its chunkier predecessors.

I am honestly glad kombatant variations are gone as well, although they were an interesting mechanic I never really cared for them. Replacing that Kustomization is the Kameo system: Think tag fighter rules but you can't switch to your supporting kombatant and they don't have a health bar, there's a recharging meter that determines when you can utilize their Kameo specials (it's just a couple special moves from that character's kommand list) and they assist with kombo breakers as well if you want to burn some of your special meter for that (you should).

All-in-all I'm enjoying it so far and will be taking a few kombatants online and seeing how I fare. Cheers!",1704216645,1704216645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1971870,155068644,76561198030076162,0,3,570,0,494,1705267013,"So, I say this as a Mortal Kombat fanboy; buy when it’s on sale. The game isn’t bad by any means, the combat feels good; though I do miss a couple features. The fatal blows feel a little lackluster, I think they were trying to streamline the fight so fatal blows weren’t so dragged out. They are still fun but don’t scratch quite the same itch. The cast of characters we have to select from feels kinda small, and that’s from someone with the DLCs. I can accept cameo characters and certain characters not being focused on or playable, but man. For a game over 100gbs, I’d personally like a larger selection. MK11 as a whole felt more cohesive and thought out from a big picture standpoint. The story is great, took me approximately 8 hours to finish in a single play-through (with small breaks). I will admit the ending was very disappointing, this is the only part of the game that feels unfinished. I’m fine with a cliff hanger, but to have no real boss fight is insane. The ending seemed to cool but felt so rushed. It definitely feels like the next story DLC will have the true grand finale; which feels lame. MK11 had story DLC but the original story at least had an ending. The story has always been more movie than gameplay and I am fine with that to a degree; that being said; great movie except the ending. Fun story but I definitely don’t feel as important as I did in MK11. I haven’t dug too deep into the customization of characters but so far I’d say I prefer MK11s customization set up. 

Overall it’s a fun game. After Baldurs Gate 3s release it’s difficult to pay $90+ and not feel a little cheated, especially when the game is missing quite a bit of content that will be released later for another $40+.

[h1]Restarting a restart - what is it like?[/h1]

💢 ACHTUNG 💢
[b]Spoilers ahead.[/b]
[spoiler][b]🥷 It takes place in a new timeline created by Liu Kang. All the same heroes we know. But with different destinies. Sub-Zero (Bi Han) and Scorpion (Kuai Liang) are now brothers. Raiden is no longer an Elder God, but a default farmer. Liu Kang is now a demigod, Kung Lao does not know him. Baraka has this appearance due to illness. Mileena is now a positive character who also suffers from Tarkata like Baraka. Reptile got a name and also returned to his human form. Shao Kahn is no longer the mighty Kahn and conqueror of worlds, but the supreme commander of the Outworld army, ruled by Sindel. Speaking of her, now Sindel is also a positive character.[/b][/spoiler]
[b]In general, the plot is cool, addictive, but sometimes ridiculous and predictable. It will go great with beer for 4 hours.[/b]

[h1]Forgotten novelties[/h1]

👉 [b]How is Mortal Kombat 1 played? Just great: it's still a very fast-paced and technically sound fighting game. Against the backdrop of Mortal Kombat 11, battles have become less chaotic - even with lightning, fireballs and other projectiles flying across the screen. At the same time, purely visually, the gap with the previous part is not very large: in some places MK 1 even looks poorer. Each character still has special moves (obviously) and Fatal Blow, which has the same activation conditions as in MK11. By the way, about Fatal Blow, now it’s not a sudden attack, the animation of which you won’t see, but a cinematic cutscene, during which the enemy will be able to put up a block. Yeah, no more sudden Fatal Blows, now we just have to hope that the enemy will stick and miss FB, or connect with a combo.[/b]

👉[b]We also put emphasis on aerial combinations - now you can send your opponent into the air and hit him there, making some good combinations too. Two Strengthening scales and two Defense scales have been removed. The downside is that the interactivity of the arena has been removed. Now you can’t hit the enemy with anything heavy, or push off the wall to get out of the corner. The ability to create your own list of moves has also disappeared (Mortal Kombat 11) - this significantly reduces the variability of attacks. Why these features, available since Mortal Kombat X, were removed is an open question.[/b]

[h1]There are many of us, but you are alone[/h1]

🦐 [b]Cameo... The same mechanic, the main gameplay feature that made a lot of noise about Mortal Kombat 1, even before its release. But what is she? These are characters that can be added to battle with the click of a button. One click and one of the fifteen heroes appears on the screen - a cameo. They are needed to start a combo or interrupt an enemy attack. In fact, this is additional damage and the ability to suddenly poke the enemy. Cameo fighters also participate in grapples and Fatal Blows. Cameos have their own brutalities and fatalities.[/b]

🦐 [b]Personally, I was waiting for the same 2 on 2 that was in Mortal Kombat 9, when you could change the fighter in the middle of the battle and go on to beat the enemy, but the cameo system is also not bad (because they nerfed the fucking Cyrax, hooray). [/b]

[h1]Old - new heroes[/h1]

😈 [b]There are currently 23 characters available in the default roster. Shang Tsung could be obtained by purchasing the Premium version of the game or by pre-ordering the regular version (until September 19), or for a fee (6.28 bucks). You can also play as Havik only after completing the entire story (you can pick him up in notifications) or for an additional fee (6.28 bucks).[/b]

😈 [b]It's ironic, but there are no new characters in the new Mortal Kombat. These are either old men Scorpio, Sub-Zero, Kitana, Mileena, etc., or well-forgotten characters from old parts of Mortal Kombat - like Ashra, Reiko, Nitara or Li Mei. A fresh universe with old characters is an obvious reluctance from NetherRealm Studios to give up on characters that the fanbase is fanatical about. Everyone knows Scorpio, but do you remember Jackie Briggs' face? Instead of introducing new fighters, the studio refreshed the stories and abilities of the existing ones. For example, Reptile received a name and rediscovered his ability to transform. Shao Kahn lost his title and hammer, but received a giant axe, new motivation and special moves. And Baraka now has a clear backstory and the title of the most furious fighter of MK 1, because it’s very difficult to get out of the combo of this bullshit, no matter how hard you want.[/b]

😈 [b]Another metamorphosis was the appearance of the level of the main fighter (level 35 max.) and the cameo fighter (level 15 max.). Now most of the equipment, brutality, skins and backgrounds on the combat map can be obtained by reaching a certain fighter level. But still, the roster is significantly smaller compared to the Mortal Kombat 11 roster. But I hasten to reassure you that fighters from Kombat Pack 1 are slowly starting to appear.[/b]

[h1]“Invasion” that didn’t happen[/h1]

😴 [b]NRS did not move the Krypt from the eleventh part, where you could wander through dark locations and find varied loot. Instead of this they introduced the “Invasion” mode, in which you need to fight invaders from other worlds.[/b]

😴 [b]Everything works according to the principle of seasonality. Every six weeks, players are thrown into a new location and to a new villain - in the first season (September) they had to break Scorpio's face (who, by the way, is Hanzo Hasashi), in the second - to beat Nitara. The camera in “Invasion” moves up, and outside of battles the game turns into an adventure game where you can collect various amenities in the form of game currency and various loot. Well, to fight - what are we here for? But, of course, this is far from the same Krypt from Mortal Kombat 11, which was the most jerking mode. It would be more interesting if we could wander through locations just like in the MK11 Crypt, but as a selected character from the roster. The Towers of Time, in which I spent most of my gaming time, were also removed from the game, trying to get good loot.[/b]

[h1]Your money is MINE![/h1]

✏️ [b]Still, should I take the new Mortal Kombat 1 or not? In fact, the game is still crude, with very little content. This will be the song when the DLC is delivered, as well as the promised story addition, just like in MK11. The previous part acquired all this goodness in 13 months. I think it will be a similar story here. But, of course, the main disadvantage of the game is the astronomical price. Now Mortal Kombat 1 can be called a good, but not perfect fighting game. The relaunch was not soft, but cautious - with the desire to hold on to the old school players, and not to attract a new audience. We hope that in future updates they will deliver a sufficient amount of content, otherwise the game will not last long.[/b]

Some neutral things about the game:
[list]
    [*]The skill ceiling has increased since MK11
    [*]The kameo system is revitalizing but can be confusing and difficult
    [*]The game plays a lot faster than MK11

Some great things about the game:
[list]
    [*]The fighting feels solid across all characters
    [*]Multiplayer plays well and it's a great game to enjoy with friends
    [*]The graphics and performance of this game are amazing, averaging above 40 FPS on Steam Deck with relatively good settings for the device
[/list]

Some bad things about the game:
[list]
    [*]Micro-transactions are littered throughout the game this time around, including event fatalities
    [*]The single-player modes feel incomplete compared to MK11, with a repetitive board game-like mode where each season brings a new boss and set of maps
    [*]No cross-play with other consoles, making it difficult to enjoy with non-PC friends

I want to start by saying the cutscenes in the story mode are top notch. The writing is very similar to the stale Marvel movies with as many low grade quips they could muster. The animation, though, is fantastic. Really well made fight scenes and the quality of the graphics was fantastic.

Beyond that, the game itself is so poorly optimized. The beginning of each fight in the story mode is so choppy and sometimes need a load screen. It doesn't take long but it is a fighting game. MK11 felt completely seamless in comparison.
Of course, as many others have pointed out, it feels more like a live service game than ever before. MK11 at least had more options for customization that pushed you through playing through the ladders and bonus stage.
Previously you could choose 3 different parts of each character's costume to change, along with the overall color scheme/model type. Now you have 1 piece of equipment and fewer options for color scheme. The lack of options gives me less of a drive to continue with the newer Invasion mode. 
Which brings me to invasion mode. I don't understand why they changed it from the other challenge mode that would bring in new daily and weekly challenge ladders (similar to the Injustice games).
They also removed the Krypt which was a fun, slower pace exploration/collection mini game with secrets and references to the different characters and history of locations throughout the MK series. Now it is a ""shrine"", a glorified gashapon where you pay a flat rate of coins for a random collectible. 

From the rebirth of Mortal Kombat and Injustice through MK11 I thought Midway were on a great trajectory for the quality of these fighting games. As a Mortal Kombat fan I cannon in good conscience recommend this game at full price or even its current 50% off discounted price. With the fighter pass, the game comes to $90 pre-discount. I paid $50 for the full game and the fighter pass and I still feel ripped off. I wish I hadn't left it running while I was busy around my house because I would have asked for a refund.

That cake is Mortal Kombat 1.

[u][b]K[/b]onspiracy.[/u]
The game started out strong for me: It has by far the best visuals of all current gen fighting games. The fighters look ultra realistic, the stages are vibrant, immersive and just stunningly detailed. The story mode, which lasted around 9 hours for me, felt like watching a movie and I loved every second of it.

But once I was done with story and looked at what else there is to do I went into Invasion mode and things took a turn into the abyss. Suddenly I'm running around inside a topdown mobile game, clear checkpoints to receive money and cosmetic rewards, upgrade gear (with a chance to fail on later levels) and pick counter elements to enemies. Who in the world thought that was a good idea? It's already trash on mobile, but those games do it a lot better. On top of that the game mode seems unfinished and drops frames. Walking around the world topdown is locked to 30FPS, then the fight starts and should be at 60 but is high 40s instead until I tab out and back in when it becomes 60 as it should be. How is an issue that big in a tripple A game?

[u][b]K[/b]runch.[/u]
In general it appears as if MK1 did not spend enough time in development. Some parts of it work perfectly like Versus. Some parts contain questionable design choices such as locking character select, fatalities/teamwork xray moves and invasions at 30FPS. It's 2023 and those things should be a thing of the past. There simply is no reason for pre-rendering parts of your game at 30. 

And for story mode in particular it feels very good, very smooth like the forementioned watching of a movie for a long time, then suddenly has a bit rougher transition from movie parts to gameplay parts towards the end. As if the team had run out of time.

[u][b]K[/b]ustomization.[/u]
Now, the devs thought how to make money from this game and so on top of the hefty launch price and the 40€ character pass they also made unlocking things ingame as inconvenient and grindy as possible. You can ofc pay to skip to unlock all the Kameos if you want to. 

The character customization is equally horrible: You can find cosmetic items as drops. Either a weapon (or something else like for example a helmet for people who don't use weapons), a finishing move, brutality, or color palette to paint your default costume with. These items all got senseless rarity ratings so some are more often found than others. Good luck completing that, especially with seasonal content disappearing! And obviously you can also spend some of your earned ingame currency on praying for a loot box at the dragon shrine, which contains a random cosmetic.

Another thing to watch out for is the story. I said earlier I loved it and I really do. But I can see how it rubs people the wrong way. The story of MK1 most follows the schematic of a superhero game or movie, both logically and how things are put in scene. It's like playing the next Injustice (also WB games) or watching the next Marvel movie, but with a Mortal Kombat paint job. It's nothing like the dreadful atmosphere of some of the older titles, just flashy and cool with lots of blood. A... deception if you will.

[u][b]K[/b]ontrols.[/u]
There is a recent trend of making fighting games more accessible by offering alternate easier ways to execute moves and highly customize the gamepad layout. It's an important step to gain new audiences, but MK1 is not taking it. You can't even use backwards walking to block, like in almost every other fighting game ever. Some people will instinctively respond with ""yeah but that would change the gameplay too much"" and to those I say: Look at Streetfighter and Tekken - they completely revamped everything and it's working out just fine. There simply is no point in insisting on an outdated control and learning system anymore.

Oh and you also have to be online at all times even for offline game modes. If your wifi stutters the game gets interrupted with the Mortal Kombat logo flashing until you got re-connected. How very consumer friendly.

[u][b]K[/b]onclusion.[/u]
I feel like Mortal Kombat 1 was designed only to entertain for a very limited period of time, and only when you approach it very casually. This sadly means it can not compete with any of the other fighting games on the market right now: Streetfighter 6, Tekken 8 they will draw most players by being modern and accessible. And the rest will probably be picked up by Granblue, KoF or other smaller franchises.

The times when you mentioned Mortal Kombat along with the other big names are over. It could have been possible given the great visuals, great story and fun combat - but the devs lacked the balls to try out new things, while the sales department pushed for mobile style assets. And that ladies and gentlemen is how you end up on the pillar of forgotten games no one talks about.

Have not played a MK game since I was a child, and the gameplay is still great. Combos are extremely hard to execute compared to other Fighting Games, so pulling them off is very fun.

I am not giving it a thumbs down because I didn't enjoy it, but because it is not worth the price unless perhaps you are an avid online player.
First things first, it's mortal Kombat. We aren't talking deep storylines etc, but I was enthusiastic for the reset of MK1. I enjoyed MK11, but was hoping now that they'd done the multiverse thing they could walk away from it. 
Majority of the game was good outworld lore fare, and I enjoyed the return of some classic characters and less of the new generation. The end though...they just had to back track into Dr Kangs multiverse of madness.
Big issue for me is shang tsung having a story chapter but being cut out of the game cuz preorder bonus. If you were going to cut him and make him DLC WB, then don't give him a story chapter plain and simple.
Kameos are cool but underwhelming. Personally preferred MK11 to this one.
I am not much of an online player, so no idea how the netcode is, how the competitive play is, etc, if that's your thing feel free to disregard my review.
If your an MK wanna be from way back, there's fun to be had here, but I bought the ultimate edition for half price and you should too.
Also a glaring immersion breaker for me, and this is sort of a spoiler....


You get to pick your final fighter for the last chapter. I picked Smoke.
In two fights he had an identity crisis and changed into scorpion with no explanation and then changed back to smoke. Why? Who knows, but it kind of killed the games climax.",1703972644,1703972644,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're paying to Play their Beta and be their test dummy. 
Game is NOT FINISHED and extremely inconsistent with combat interactions.
ALSO - Character animations do not properly match hurt boxes. i.e. what appears to be a overhead is actually a mid. This is across the board, like someone made a LAST second decision saying ""Hey Thats too strong, Change it. Not enough time, just change how the attack hits the person and leave the animation""

A direct MIDDLE Finger to all the NRS Fans. I don't recommend supporting NRS or Ed Boon in General, they don't care about their player base ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE are on PC - All your content and patches will come LATER then Console.

I cannot recommend a full price game for BETA Access.  This is honestly SAD that NRS tries to ploy off that WB put them under time constraint when they have Unlimmited funding and the game could be in a much better place. 

Lastly Pro players being involved in development is a terrible decision, large amounts of downplay and influence on character kits which result in poor gameplay, and poor balance decisions.

MK11 was genuinely a great game. They gave us a good chunk of characters, plenty of opportunities to earn skins and accessories, and giving a bit more leeway in choosing characters to fight with in story mode. Those are just things I can think of the top of my head too.

MK1 however...fails to deliver such variety and that saddens me considering how much they could of improved from the base of MK11 and onward.

The only reason I would recommend Mortal Kombat 1 is because Homelander and Omni-man are in this one which was my deciding factor in buying this game. Mortal Kombat 1 is a good game and obviously follows the story and plot to it's Mortal Kombat 11 predecessor which is pretty good. Although, Mk1 really is an enjoyable game, I would personally recommend Mk11 over this one for a multitude of reasons (listed below).
- More gore. I think what makes the Mortal Kombat games stand out is the gore. Mk1 does not have as much gore as Mk11 or MkX
-I also think the character selection could be a lot better in Mk1 but it's following the story to Mk11 so I understand why these characters are chosen. 
- The characters looked better in Mk11 and MkX. The characters in Mk1 almost look copy/pasted. 
- There is a lot more variety in Mk11. For those of you that have played Mk11 you will know what I'm talking about. For those that haven't and are thinking about getting into this game or are coming back, buy Mk11 or previous. With every character in Mk11 you were able to choose certain ""aspects"" that determined their ability/move set. In short, LOTS of variety for each character
-Now I do not know if it's my PC or not, but MK11 seemed to run a lot better than MK1
- Lastly, there seemed to be a lot more activities in the game outside of multiplayer. In Mk11, yes, there were towers but there were so many different towers that had buffs/negations that made the towers more fun and/or challenging. Secondly, the Krypt. I think it was a good addition to the game that allowed you to take a break from the fighting and just aimlessly wander and collect rewards.

+Decent graphics
+Smooth animation
+Tutorial with clear instructions

Cons:
-Poor Optimization
-Bad game network connection
-In-game micro-transactions with high prices
-Too few content
-Grindy and repetitive Invasion mode
-Forced to play with the Kameo system
-30 FPS lock in cutscenes and fatal blows
-Insanely fast paced combo fest
-Unbalanced characters

Overall, it's not worth the money. Mortal Kombat 11 is a lot better than this game for casual players.

Геймплей как всегда на высоте, ростер персонажей непривычный. Много что поменялось. DLC героев пока мало, чтобы делать выводы.

То, о чем хочется поговорить — это санкции для России и Беларуси. Я не понимаю, чему способствует блокировка IP-адресов моей страны. Я считаю, что бить по игрокам это странно и глупо. Кто-то на верхушке Warner Bros. явно превысил свои полномочия.

Я запустил игру через Steam Deck, где на стандартную OS нельзя накатить Outline-клиент, это возможно только через Windows. В общем, посмотрим, насколько быстро консольщики освоят VPN и DNS. Пока ощущение, что игра, в том числе за счет конской цены, проходит мимо нашего региона.

Обратите внимание, сколько абзацев в тексте посвящено политическим решениям, а сколько содержимому MK11. Так не должно быть.

TL;DR. MK11 вполне может быть и отличная игра, но ее издатель принимает крайне идиотские решения. Посмотрите на то, чем сейчас занимаются авторы Batman: Arkham Knight.",1703594347,1703803449,False,16,4,0.5816994309425354,2,True,False,False

The game has less game breaking characters, fantastic news. The game is now fairly balanced and the community has actually bothered learning characters they like instead of maining broken characters, good job.

The main problem is the online is an absolute fucking joke if you want me to be completely honest. The benchmark before the game gives you a nice ping of 40, good to go no? No. You join the game and the game stutters so bad it's literally unplayable. It's so bad both players will occasionally just sit back and WAIT for the stutters/ping to go back to normal.. this is an absolute joke of a game online since the christmas update. Me and thousands of other players have literally quit the because it's so bad and 3 weeks later it's not even fixed lol.

Overall, the direction and execution deserve praise [i](live-action actors, especially Shang Tsung, were impressive)[/i], and even the length of the main campaign is commendable. I breezed through the storyline in one go over several evenings [i](just avoid asking too many questions about the plot; otherwise, you'll facepalm yourself endlessly)[/i]. While the finale suffers a bit from yet another ""multiverse,"" I enjoyed the diversity of chaos the game offers towards the finish line. The visual style is stunning [i](probably like all newly released MK games at the start)[/i], bloodshed and effects, everything we love and expect.

Maybe my mood finally aligned, but I enjoyed the combat in this MK the most. Pulling off combos, executing fatalities, and even managing to win some random online matches multiple times.

The invasion mode somehow spices up the familiar gameplay seen in fighting games. Can't say I'm thrilled about the daily tasks, but at least there's some progression happening. Not sure if I'll fully commit to clearing this activity. I'm too old and have too little time to endlessly grind through such activities. But I'm sure there are people who enjoy this, especially because here you're honing your skills whether you like it or not.

The only downside for me is that Shang Tsung is playable in the campaign, but you can only buy him with real money. It feels like a punch in the gut.

MK has always been a long-term investment. Sometimes, at least once in a blue moon, you gather with friends at home, and it's time to challenge someone to a round of the new MK.

Well, that moment hasn't arrived yet! :D

With a 50% discount, I don't regret the money spent overall. I'm sure I'll drop by here occasionally. At the very least, I might wait for discounts to buy the complete pack of released characters. I really want to try out Omni Man's butt.

almost everything is behind a paywall. typical business companies $100 game to then need more money in game to pay..
starting fatalities are less cinematic, more bland (no glowing visually-interesting after effects).
fun god battle story i really enjoyed! twist i wasn't expecting.. 
graphics aren't groundbreaking but are expected of this day. backgrounds though are a lot more interesting and visually attention grabbing.
minor switch up on moves/combos (slightly better visually imo), remains 'easy to learn - hard to master'.. is not simple enough for transfer 'good at mk11' = 'good at mk1'
quite a few new mechanics differing modestly from MK11.
feels like their aren't too many individual characters. (imo that made 11 great..)
very underwhelming and disappointing cause its much more of a 'optimised company monetisation' for MK.

Well done WB! You should never even touch the gaming community! And stop hiring devs from fiver, it is just not going to work!

I have a really mixed up feelings about this part of MK.

Cons:
- small roster
- ""kameo"" is rather annoying. Why removing x-rays? Why putting characters into kameo, instead of game itself?
- feels like giant step down compared to previous part
- reptile transformations are so low in frame count that looks like he is instantly transforming
- this is year 2023 (still) and game is locked to maximum of 60 fps!
- ...even so I have this on 60fps, fatalities and cinematics feel like 30fps! no fluid transitions and hardware is absolutely not a problem... And it looks like only PC have this problem. 
- Sareena only as kameo :(
- old characters missing! Jax, Sonya, Kano, Stryker as kameo only
- no playable freaks like Goro, Motaro, Kollector... only humanoids
- Shang Tsung behind paywall in addition to ""Kombat Pack""
- absolutely terrible port!

pros:
- it's Mortal Kombat
- story is quite enjoyable (especially the way how characters are developing over time)
- huge potential (not there yet) if it comes to customisation (temple stairs fights with ""fused"" opponents was fun)
- new characters fit game perfectly, no ""out of place""  (maybe except Nitara, but I blame actress playing her. Havik FTW!)",1703542486,1703586558,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,False

In past games you get a shao kahn, shinnok, kronika, onaga, blaze or someone else whos a bit more challenging but not in this game. no in this one you just fight a duo who you fight multiple times throughout the game that arent even challenging.  Story is only about 7 hours maybe less because i tried to play the other modes but wasn't a fan. even tower mode which ive played since the arcade days i wasnt a fan of. it also plays kind of clunky compared to previous mk games ive played not sure if hats the port on not. it just feels odd. honestly whats even worse is they expect you to pay full price for this game and then pay for half of the playable charactrers and half of their characters then additionally for gear. also additional SPOILER wasnt a fan of their scorpion change, i get liu kang wants to make a peaceful ideal realm but the new scorpion doesnt make much sense. id give this a mid grade rating rather than a dislike if i could. 

To summarize my opinion:

the good:
good graphics 
the story isnt terrible
cameos feel like something new 
stupid references for people whove played for decades

The bad:
clunky gameplay
locked at 60fps and makes cinematics clunky
the story is about 70%cinematic if not more
over priced
dlc is ridiculous because half of the mk characters are already in the story just behind a paywall in other modes

Honestly i feel like netherrealms is going to release astory dlc like they did with their last game because of the way this one ended but ialso think theyu should have a another studio make a game thats an action rpg. something similar with what they did to shujinko but wioth more depth and freedom. Theres tons of lore its just kind of wasted on a game that has 7 hour story and could be fun elsewhere. i dont think they should stop making mk. ijust think they should let another wb studios dev do something with the lore and worlds. wouldnt be the first studio to do so. some companies have rpgs , mmos ,shooters , and rts games all set in the same universe and ithink this would feed netherrealms greed and alllow fans to be in the universe more

I really enjoyed the kombat mechanics and the kameos were fun, some were stupidly broken, and some were bad. It was okay. That being said, I seriously regret buying this game, as a person who loves playing Mortal Kombat as a casual/semi competitive player.

My criticisms of the game are:

1. Story Mode. It could've been better, especially having Baraka, Reptile, and Ashrah being shown more, with the last two exploring more of [spoiler] their relationship that was explicitly mentioned in vs dialogues [/spoiler] within the story and have other characters like them be utilized more. I also didn't enjoy having Bi-Han [spoiler] betraying Kuai Liang and Tomas, being a huge jerk to the latter. [/spoiler] I was hoping big changes for him and doing his character justice. For one thing, he isn't [spoiler] killed or turned into Noob Saibot [/spoiler] but they couldn't stop him from being an egotistical, power-hungry, rude guy. If he has to be power-hungry, sure. Whatever, just tone it down and make him be likeable. Tone down his ego too. I'm okay with him being cold-hearted, but not a full-blown jackass. Finally, the whole timeline shenanigan is getting old. Personal gripe, but I wish MK1 has a better title.

2. DRM. Enough said. It's seriously annoying to be forced to connect to the internet to play the game. PS5 didn't need to do that, and so does MK11 (it had DRM before until it was removed on March 22 of 2022) so why on the three goddesses of Hyrule does it need to have DRM? Please remove it already.

3. Expense and greed. Yeah, yeah... I shouldn't be the one to talk because I purchased the game but I still have to address the issue as to why is the game so repulsively expensive? Over $100 for the base game and DLC. But it gets worse from there. For one thing, the costumes and fatalities are over $10 bucks? Why is everything so expensive and greedy. I haven't bought any of the costumes after getting Sindel's costume when it was launch day. I really liked Scorpion and Sub-Zero's Deadly Alliance costumes and Nitara's classic costume. It's just so stupid that its overpriced and that we're forced to pay for them in order to get them instead of grinding in-game to get them.

That's all of the criticisms I can list of this game. I'm honestly shocked and disappointed that NRS and WB still managed to make it disappointing. One thing I can say is that I love seeing Reptile and several other characters returning to the series and I especially love Li Mei and Ashrah. Honestly, I don't recommend buying the game if you're new to Mortal Kombat. If you REALLY want to buy it, get it while its on sale. It's not worth full price, at all. Otherwise, stick to other fighting games.",1703388143,1703388143,False,4,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

I know this because: 1. I watched my replays and everytime, the inputs always come out but nothing happens for some reason and 2. confirming into down back 3 after the first hit of Forward 4, 1 is pretty easy to do so there's no reason for me to drop it consistently or at least this much.

- Amazing story mode that brings new life into the series while also keeping traditions alive 
- Gameplay is a massive improvement over the previous installment of MK11 
- Kameo system allows you to still remain dedicated to a singular character while being able to create new play-styles, get creative, and create combos without having to spend time on another ""MAIN"" character
- Legacy characters still have traditional feel and gameplay, but are re-imagined
- 3D era characters do NOT DISAPPOINT and are a treat for any long time fans of the series
- system mechanics and complexity are good for beginners, but have a high skill ceiling that can be achieved if said amount of work and practice is put into the game 
- open communication from Ed Boon and the developers of NetherRealm Studios and have active engagement in the community

CONS 
- Online issues: Only recently added a WiFi filter with an option to decline high-ping and de-synchronization issues that shouldn't occur given the company's resources and reputation 
- Microtransactions are out of control: Doesn't really make sense how Omni-Man is cheaper as a playable character than he is as an announcer for in-game audio.

Simply put: I believe that this game is extremely fun, worth your money and time, and there is something for everyone. However, there are things in this game that I wish I didn't have to worry about that do exist. I wish I could play this game without having to worry about these issues, but those issues don't overshadow the fun factor of the game for me. Excited to see the direction this game goes and the improvements that the fans will see along the way.

Ok, let's start by saying that this is my opinion on the game and nothing more. With this I am not looking for you to change your opinion or anything like that. I've played every MK that's come out since the first one in 1992.

The graphics are beautiful, very colorful and vibrant, it doesn't feel like a franchise game.

The user interface is as if they had been designed for mobile devices, they take up a lot of screen space and when you see them in 4K they are huge.

The music, like in other installments, is very bad.

Online: ON PC THERE IS NO CROSSPLAY, is REGIONLOCK and the same as in previous installments, the netcode is good. You can't create a lobby to play with your friends (at least not at the time of this review).

Gameplay: Too slow, a combo can take you forever, just like a grab, if they open you up, let go of the controller because you'll have to wait a while for it to be your turn again. The fighters feel heavy as if they were ""glued to the floor"", some have very dirty and unfair options. The new Kameos system (in my opinion) does not go or does not combine with the style of play that has always been 1v1 on the screen, you did not see 4 fighters at the same time and it became a bit confusing. The towers and the story are great, the new invasion system is interesting but you get bored of so many things you have to do just to unlock the rewards, the missions ""TEST YOUR MIGHT""  are designed so that you destroy your controller (same as MKX).

Another thing, you pay full price for the game and YOU DO NOT HAVE ALL THE FIGHTERS AVAILABLE (Various Kameos + Havik), you have to unlock them or BUY THE DLC to get them immediately... this is one of the dirtiest practices that exist in terms of DLC, from day 1, are showing that what they want is to squeeze and squeeze this game monetarily and not make a quality game.

As if that were not enough, PC users did not get BETA or early access with the pre-purchase (everyone else was able to try it before), the game takes a long time building shaders at startup, and they ask for SSD and a lot more high performance requirements for the animations being locked at 30FPS in the year 2023, are you kidding?

In short, and in conclusion, wait a year or a little more and buy it at a discount, it is not worth paying full price for this game.

In my opinion, the game is designed more to please professional players than the entire community that grew up playing it. I say this because the amount of content for a single player is large, but the mechanics can be very complex for a casual user.

NOW THE BIG FINALE: There is an archivement where you need to tbag you opponent online to get it, so... YOU NEED TO BE DISRESPECTFUL TO PLAY THIS GAME ONLINE, what a joke, instead of promote a fair and respectful play, they promote what they are, they promote online bullying instead of respect.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, vamos a empezar diciendo que esta es mi opinion sobre el juego y nada mas. Con esto no estoy buscando que cambies tu opinion ni nada por el estilo. He jugado cada uno de los MK que han salido desde el primero en 1992.

Los gráficos son hermosos, muy coloridos y vibrantes, no se siente como un juego de la franquicia.

La interfaz de usuario es como si la hubiesen diseñado para dispositivos móviles, ocupan mucho espacio en pantalla para lo poco que son. Cuando los ves en 4K son enormes.

La música igual que en otras entregas, muy mala.

Online: EN PC NO HAY CROSSPLAY, REGIONLOCK y lo mismo que en las entregas anteriores, el netcode esta bueno. No puedes crear un lobby para jugar con tus amigos (por lo menos no al momento de esta reseña).

Gameplay: Demasiado lento, un combo te puede durar una eternidad, al igual que un agarre, si te abren, suelta el mando porque para que sea tu turno nuevamente vas a tener que esperar un rato. Los peleadores se sienten pesados como si estuvieran ""pegados al piso"", algunos tienen opciones muy sucias e injustas. El nuevo sistema de Kameos (a mi parecer) no va o no combina con el estilo de juego que siempre ha sido 1v1 en pantalla, no veias 4 peleadores al mismo tiempo y llega a ser un poco confuso. La torres y la historia estan geniales, el nuevo sistema de invasiones es interesante pero te aburres de tantas cosas que debes hacer solo para desbloquear las recompenzas, las misiones que son del tipo ""TEST YOUR MIGHT"" estan diseñados para que destruyas tu mando (al igual que en MKX).

Otra cosa, pagas precio completo por el juego y NO TIENES DISPONIBLES TODOS LOS PELEADORES (Varios Kameos + Havik), tienes que desbloquearlos o COMPRAR EL DLC para obtenerlos de inmediato... esta es una de la prácticas mas sucias que existen en cuanto a los temas de DLC, desde el día 1 estan mostrando que lo que quieren es exprimir y exprimir monetariamente este juego y no hacer un juego de calidad.

Como si fuera poco, los usuarios de PC no obtuvieron BETA o acceso anticipado con la precompra (todos los demás si pudieron probarlo antes), el juego tarda un monton conrtuyendo los shaders al inicio, piden SSD y un monton mas de requisitos de alta performance y las animaciones estan bloqueadas a 30FPS en año 2023 estas bromenado?

En fin y como conclusion, esperen un año o un poco mas y comprenlo en descuento, no vale la pena pagar precio completo por este juego.

A mi parecer, el juego esta diseñado mas para complacer a los jugadores prefesionales que a toda la comunidad que creció jugándolo, esto lo digo porque la cantidad de contenido para un jugador es grande, pero las mecánicas pueden llegar a ser muy complejas para un usuario casual.

AHORA EL GRAN FINAL: Existe un logro que para desbloquearlo necesitas tbagear a tu oponente en un match online, asi que... NECESITAS FALTARLE EL RESPETO A TU OPONENTE PARA OBTENER UN SIMPLE LOGRO, en vez de promover el respeto entre oponentes y darle la espalda al bullying en linea, promueven lo tóxicos que ellos son.",1695223714,1703204056,False,5,1,0.542863786220550537,0,True,False,False

MK1, however did away with the fun parts of combat and replaced it with painful combo mechanics, overly complicated support calls, and terrible controls. 

Overall this is a failure of a game and players will leave soon to go back to SF or to the next new shiny fighting game.  Don't waste your money on MK1 until it is extremely discounted. 

The good:
Story mode stands out as a fun nod to the history of MK which is nice, easily the best part of the game.  
Omni-man is broken, but at least he is true to character which shows a lot of care went into that.

The bad:
Online play is trash, abuse of broken attacks and the OP characters is most of what you'll see.  Just really boring to play against the same few characters. 
  
Combo practice is trash since combos have been made insanely difficult.  Previous game I was able to get through them with practice and just ""getting good"".  MK1 has such terrible timing checks for combos.  Too fast and it won't even register the button, and too slow by micro-seconds means the move doesn't go off either.  That make that worse, the input buffer is garbage, easily the worse in any fighting game I've ever seen.  Sometimes it keeps your input and sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it overwrites your input with the next move, and other times it does not. 

Invasions is interesting but not good enough to hold attention, and definitely not long enough for the high cost of the game.  

Still no way to auto-skip fatalities in online play.  it's a feature people have been asking out of MK forever since no one wants to see the same fatality for the 100th time.  People just want to go to the next match.  So if you want to play online be prepared to waste hours having to watch fatalities over and over again.",1703200123,1703200123,False,16,3,0.577640354633331299,0,True,False,False

MK1 is a 2d fighting game. Compared to previous titles, this MK has extremely few combo starters per character, leading to repetitive combat. The roster is fairly limited, which didn't stop the developers from locking 3 base game characters behind pay walls. This game on its own is not worth the $70, but if you want to play as the main villain? 8 bucks. Quan Chi? 8 bucks. Ermac? 8 bucks and unreleased. Even when you pay extra for those characters, they each have 20 mastery levels and two of them don't have any other skins at all. This game greedily uses in-game currency, which has no place in a 70 dollar game.
As far as graphics, mk1 does alright when it isn't bugging all the way out. unfortunately, this game constantly bugs out. Variety of gameplay? there is none. 
My recommendation is not to buy this game or any DLCs until NetherRealm decides to fix their bugs and include what is expected of the base game and DLC. (announcer voices should not cost more than the character they belong to.

Despite the number of hours I have in this game MK1 is the most disappointing Mortal Kombat I have ever played, and I've been playing MK since the SNES era. This is a hard avoid, even if you are curious about the game, I would recommend waiting for the game to be over 50% off before even looking at it.

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]
The base game has less content than MK11 did at launch, but there are other issues such as:
- the characters don't feel finished, multiple characters have holes in their intended playstyle for kameos to fit into, but this makes them feel lacking in an inorganic and sometimes frustrating way
    - several characters are redesigned, which is expected, but some characters don't have the basic tools one has come to 
    expect from mortal kombat. many of the combo tools that players enjoy have been removed entirely and move lists feel 
    barren. The combat got stale in the first week of playing, and the game is dominated by the same two or three optimized 
    strategies with little variation. There is nothing to explore with the combat at this point.
- there are bugs that majorly impact gameplay, such as an input detection bug and several moves not behaving correctly
- there are obvious physics bugs like objects clipping into one another, special moves not disappearing off the screen when they should, and brutalities/fatalities not animating correctly because the physics objects are not tuned correctly
- there are several mechanics that seem to serve no purpose whatsoever, like the uppercut cancel, which has a high cost but doesn't reward the player for using it in any discernible way. It feels like it's there just so they can say there is a new mechanic, but not actually have to use it. The game AI never uses it, players never use it, and it doesn't add anything to gameplay
- Kameos are poorly implemented, making them boring to play around and not giving the player any real incentive to protect them or use them in any interesting fashion

But that's all minutia if you aren't super into fighting games. If you are a big fighting game fan, there's nothing here for you. 

[hr][/hr] 
[h1] STORY [/h1]
If you were here for the story:
- Several of the plot elements set up in MK11 Aftermath are completely ignored. Liu Kang's new timeline isn't explored by the story, and instead the plot quickly bait-and-switches the player with a multiverse plotline that completely invalidates everything up to that point.
- The story is poorly written. Tension isn't allowed to build unless it's one of the designated villain characters, and any potentially interesting aspects of the lore that would have been changed are literally thrown out so that they can do the same storylines from the previous games but worse. The rewritten versions of several characters are completely bland and without any notable personality traits, just the suggestion that they have them.

- Even the pre-fight dialogue is bad. The characters make small talk with one another in a way that makes the fighting gross and uninteresting at the same time. Baraka and Smoke, for example, have a conversation about having lost their family before fighting. This isn't done in a way that gets the player excited for the gameplay, it's just sad and inappropriate. The dialogue is nothing at best and makes the game worse in almost all instances outside of that. It isn't banter, it's filler.

- The story is short, bland, and aside from a few set pieces, doesn't add anything to the story or the characters in any meaningful way. Any damage done to any characters is just an unneeded explanation for why they were disfigured to begin with, such as with Havik or Baraka.
[hr] [/hr]
[h1] OTHER [/h1]
In no particular order:

- The music is generic and uninteresting, and a lot of it feels like bad muzak covers of music from previous MK games.

- The game, despite costing $70 already, tries to bilk the player for more money at every opportunity. The game launched with $50 worth of DLC, then another $20 worth was added to the in-game shop in the first month of the game running, but major bugs have yet to be fixed.
- The single player Invasions content uses psychological manipulation tactics and game theory to grind the player to maximize ""engagement"" without actually rewarding them for sticking around.
- You can't directly choose your character's appearance in local or solo play. If you want to change a skin you have to go through multiple menus and save your new appearance each time. There are no slots or loadouts, you can only make changes one at a time per character.
- Several of the monetization tactics are similar to abusive mobile games, even down to the multiple currency type to make it unclear how much someone is spending on the game. A single skin for one character is ten dollars.
- The game only recently began to inform the players that the free currency could also buy premium items that cost real money, meaning people were tricked into purchasing free content in the game.


[h1] THE FUTURE OF WB GAMES [/h1]
What I'm getting at is that this game isn't just bad, it's a clear message from WB and NetherRealm Studios: Bilking the players is their top priority, and they have no intention of making quality products going forward. If people continue to buy this game, they will continue to find new ways to make that a worse experience for everyone, no matter what.
These are not just my words, these are theirs. They plan on making all of their games like this going forward because their profit margins went up, as stated in an earnings call.

[i]""And similar to the leaders in the industry, we've led with multiple key franchises, each of which is $1 billion gaming property. Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC, which is mainly Batman today, and Mortal Kombat, whose most recent release, Mortal Kombat 1 has sold nearly 3 million copies since its launch in mid-September. So we've got the proven IP and franchises, the world class studios and publishing talent and we intend to continue to invest more capital and more resources into the business.

[b]Our focus is on transforming our biggest franchises from largely console and PC based with three-four year release schedules to include more always on gameplay through live services, multiplatform and free-to-play extensions with the goal to have more players spending more time on more platforms. Ultimately we want to drive engagement and monetization of longer cycles and at higher levels. We have put specific capabilities. We are currently under scale and see significant opportunity to generate greater post purchase revenue.[/b]""[/i]

Netherrealm always had issues balancing characters and adding kameos (which work horrible), are balanced horrible you will most likely see 2 of them like 90% of the time. the multiplayer connection is the worst in any game i ever played when the match is found it shows 120ms and when the game starts it averages at around 200 which is unplayable. The single player content consists of story mode and invasions. the story mode is okay  but the godawful invasions mod is horrible, the tabletop style with annoying modifiers its long its slow its boring. And lets not forget about the money hungry MTs in game in previous games when you bought the kombat pack (season pass) you got all the skins and characters for that season, in this one if you buy the kombat pack you get all the characters  with half the content of the base roster and no skins and outfits you have to buy currency  to buy them in the store. i absolutely dont recommend this game and it hurts me to say that, buy it when it is around 20 bucks .",1703111396,1703111396,False,5,0,0.52449566125869751,0,True,False,False

I got the pre-order as my birthday gift from the family. I've already finished Invasion season and the story mode (no spoilers) which is basically all singlepalyer kontent. 
I love Mortal Kombat but the business practices and the downgrades can't be excused. This released as if it was an Early Access game and it's Mortal Kombat ffs. 
They really shit the bed with this game releasing earlier than intended and it sucks because I've been playing since Deadly Alliance on PS2. I want this series to be succeed and be fantastic but the state it released has been awful.
I don't want to blame the devs, I'm almost positive this is a result of other Warner projects failing or being delayed as well as the strikes that where happening at the time.
And regardless of that, the PC port is awful. Every day something new comes out about it. 
I can only recommend this to people like me, who have played so much MK11, they need something fresh. Otherwise, hold off on this. Go get MK11 ultimate edition on the cheap and wait for updates and price drops here. 

Things I Dislike: 
- It leaves 1GB crash logs on your PC every time it crashes and doesn't delete them. They're in AppData. 
- Their newly released MK mobile game had more content than this. 
- They release seasons broken, so when you come in ready to play, all the rewards unlock for you. They've just shut down the servers to frantically fix this glitch FOR THE SECOND TIME. 
- DO NOT BUY THE KAMEO PACK, DRAGON KRYSTALS OR HAVIK!!! - you can unlock them in-game, easily, for free. Even the Dragon Krystals and Scorpion skins. Very scummy practice. 
- Film Grain always on, as well as other unchangable screen effects. 
- There's an unfinished Tag mode in the game's files that they didn't complete or release. 
- Gear System downgrade: Now you can only kustomise one piece, instead of the previous 3. At least the skins are awesome. But I like more kustomisation not less. 
- It's 90% Online Connection required: Invasions requires internet connection. Same with all your unlocks, including specific characters, character endings you've already got and kustomisation. That's right. Mortal Kombat went 'Games as a service'. 
- AI is awful. Glorified punching bags that, unless you're playing Story on Hard, actually WAIT THEIR TURN after hitting you. No pressure or unpredictability. Their excuse for difficulty in Invasions Mode is modifiers and giving the opponents ""armour"" so they dont stagger. This shit isn't fun. 
- Kameos: Almost the whole game is kameo fights, I just prefer the klassic experience or even tag-team would be better. Even the kompetetive mode is kameos. I just cant get excited for shit coming in off-screen, interrupting the match, when we could've put that effort towards two or three more fully-fledged characters.
- Invasions Mode: Progression is broken because you can just purchase level ups and kurrency is really easy to get. I was max level really soon and it became a chore to get through to the end, which was the only real challenging fight after the starting areas. Now I have a Talisman that can insta-kill any enemy. It adds a 'Fart' move that kills max level enemies in 2 seconds. I'm literally shitting on what I love here. 
- Technical Issues: The game stutters and lags heavily at completely random times. In menus, important 
story cutscenes and during matches, which has lost me multiple rounds. It's just really annoying and unprofessional. It's worse in the Story mode, the ending scenes especially laggy which is a shame because it was good! The 'always online' thing constantly stops the game for a few seconds to reconnect also. 
- Kontent: Story Mode, Towers, Invasions, Online....That's it! They said live, on air, multiple times before the game came out that 'this game has the most features we've put into the game'. Nope. Not even close to some previous titles. I finished the Story, and Invasions. I don't care about online. So when I finish the Towers I'll only be playing season to season. And if your internet connection cuts out, you cant play Invasions or Online. That's right, singleplayer mode is online only. 
- XP Progression: Kombat League progression is super slow. I've played 10 matches, won 7 and I'm still below halfway through the first level. They want you to grind online to keep the game alive and the rewards just aren't worth it. Invasions is the only real way to get XP because you get 0 for quick matches vs CPU and the Towers give you way less. 
- One of the most powerful Invasions relics have been...farts. Get it? It's supposed to be funny! Twice. 
- Cant change costumes in character select. Cant view kurrency totals unless you're about to spend them. They're only now adding the intro dialogue to singleplayer modes. 
- Glitch with kosmetics coming up as N/A and when you select them it freezes and crashes your game. 
- Lied at least twice so far about DLC release dates and kontent. 
- They set up microtransactions before smoothing out all the above. I hope this doesn't have to do with WB and the Hollywood strikes. Because you could've delayed the game a year, with the excuse being what else is coming out around the same time. The game would've benefited from that time. 

Things I Like: 
+ More Mortal Kombat! I played so much MK11 I got tired of it. Having something new and fresh is great. And this 'new timeline' thing could've been the absolute worst, but they stook the landing in the Story mode and still give old fans lots of easter eggs. 
+ The story is one of the best of the series so far. Some cutscenes look so goddamn good, me and my sister kept saying how realistic moments looked. Some genuinely funny moments and lots of easter eggs. And the ending is super fun. 
+ The music is solid. 
+ The whole roster is a win for me. It's not often I can say 'I want to try out everyone!'. I got my mains, but I'm also playing as characters I never thought I'd like. 
+ Megan Fox's voice acting is laughably bad. Jean Claude Van Damme flirts with her in their intros and it's just funny to me. Did they both sign off on that? Anyway, here's the video: https://youtu.be/JUtjereYB1o?feature=shared
+ The fighting has been further improved, might be the best so far, but you wouldn't know unless you're playing Story or Versus another player. 
+ The little things: Grabs look more cinematic. Tutorial now teaches you insane kombos for each character. There are air kombos for each character. Dedicated overhead block so you can punish them if you're fly enough. Lots of 3D era easter eggs.

Laziest MK game so far, with the most egrigious monetization so far, which makes sense since Netherrealm has discovered mobile gaming.

The story in the grand scheme is interesting, but they absolutely missed an opportunity to make characters a little more interesting and 3-dimensional. 

- There is now a battlepass, but no Shang Tsung Lair (not like in MK11). 
- Extremely grindy (this is meant to be more of a live service I guess). Best cosmetics, fatalities and new announcers can only be bough for more RL money in the store.
- Finishers are short, boring and uninspired compared to MK11.
- The real price of the game (if you want all the DLC which existed at launch) is closer to 100 euros than 70 (Kombat pass comes on top of that).

Pros:

+ Amazing gameplay and characters
+ 10/10 graphics
+ Story mode had stunning cutscenes and really well executed
+ Online - The game feels smooth and I have an amazing time playing other people
+ Every character is fun to play and the Kameos are a great addition to the game

Cons:

- Invasions mode feel repetitive and sometimes the bosses are annoying but overall is a fun break from online matches although ""The Krypt"" was better imo
- The shrine feels pointless and slow
- Character customize is not as good as MK11
- Some online disconnects here and there (Black screen after an online set)
- No crossplay
- No 60fps manu, invasion mode and fatal blow cutscenes

If you own a console that can play MK1 I'd reccomend getting that version before PC port for any NRS game. 

This game is great, PC port does seem to have a fair share of problems online for me but when I boot it up for offline casuals it never fails. Ignore people complaining about ""broken characters"", every NRS game has broken characters obviously. Ignore people complaining about the ""small base roster"", this game has tons of assist characters that add way more depth than a few extra characters on the base roster would. 

If this is your first fighting game you'll probably love it, NRS has a pretty dedicated casual community so you'll have no problem finding people of your skill level or working up to a skill level where you can have fun. If you've played other Non-NRS fighters, you might struggle getting into this game as it is wildly different from games developed in Japan. Small things like the block button, strings, block dashing movement, lack of projectile clash, etc, all add up and make a game that can feel absolutely alien to the typical Street Fighter/Anime Fighter player, Tekken players seem to love this game however (probably because they feel at home doing strings, ducking highs and throws, and learning complicated dash mechanics). 

If you've played other NRS games and loved them, you'll feel right at home here. MK1 has a bad story, stupid grind mode for unlocks, and some of the saltiest players saying the dumbest things on the microphone. Fortunately NRS sticks to their guns in making some of the weirdest character designs and archetypes in modern fighting games. Invisible 50/50's, full screen normals, wakeup armored launchers, stance characters, puppet characters, and JK Simmons. Don't come here for honor, glory, or a name.

The game is unplayable if you want to play the game at a skill level above the capacity of a dead pigeon. The frame stutters you get for trying to run this are astonishing. I have a 3070 with an 11th gen i7-11700 and am not even close to having a stable frame rate. The PC port of this game is atrocious. Get a play station if you are desperate to play but i wouldn't bother.

Update as of Quan Chi patch:
The Frame stuttering issue seems to have improved very slightly as they happen less frequently. However this patch has introduced a bug with selecting a kameo where some kameo fighters just simply refuse to load in. If you try to start a match using one of these invisible kameos that wont load in, the game will never load your match and you will be looking at a loading screen forever until you are forced to close the game.

Here's why:
1. Microtransaction a bit too much this time;
[strike]2. No clash system. Kombatan's dialogue can only be heard in local fight. Not invasion nor tower; [/strike]

[strike]3. Chances for skin & gear drop is lowered and it can only be obtained via Invasion, shrine, and store;[/strike] 
4. Only 2 options for kustomizing your fighters, their weapon and their skin;
5. Lack of obtainable skin atm. Most unique skins can only be obtained via Store with real money;
6. Kombat XPs a bit grindy atm;   
7. No CPU vs CPU fight;

[*]The Krypt was really cool way for progression, it's replaced with Invasion that totally suck.

[*]Money grab with seasons and characters. 
[*]Many cool and original characters from MK11 are gone replaced with very boring and stupid ones. Who wants to play with Omni-man or whatever? In MK?
[*] I hate the cameo system. It was unnecessary as it is absurd. Striker with t-shirt and baseball hat reloading his gun next to my thunder god Raiden is just dumb.

It probably moved a bit forward with the combat system, but it generally feel bland. This definitely is the worst MK I have ever played and the last one I am buying. 

Also I just saw there is an update, 20GB to be downloaded and 90GB to be written after the initial 120GB. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO OPTIMIZE YOUR SHIT? No news what is in the update. Get into the current century and make this right!

There are some things I don't like about this one.
Cons:
-30 FPS lock in some situations
-not really into kameo stuff
-currently lacking some extra game modes
-story mode could've been a bit longer
-customization went down in respect to MK11
-invasion is extremely simplistic and boring
Pros:
-super fluid and awesome combat system
-graphics and overall art design
-soundtrack
-story(yes, it's pretty good, they kinda nailed it, and I was sure 100% they we're going for the MCU direction)
-cool roster(imagine what will it be like after all the kombat packs, I want Fujin back tho).

Edit: I decided to go for a 10/10 because of how fluid the game is and how the combos connect to each other, especially when using kameos(yes yes). The game has a lot of potential, it's up to WB/Netherrealm to decide if they wanna give this game the proper treatment or not)

long story short this is more of a middle review, if you can look past these issues its a fun game, but otherwise not worth it",1702353687,1702353687,False,3,0,0.524521112442016602,0,True,False,False

MK 11 is not a bad game it's just not a great game like compared to 9 and X, 11 just came off as kind of slow. Yes the character roster is nice and all, but what's most important factor is the gameplay speed and performance. There was so many issues I had with 11 that this game fixed and executed much better. The combo system isn't so cryptic and broken and seems to be easy to learn to play each character naturally. And unlike 11, its much more fun in Mortal Kombat 1 to unlock stuff and not like a hassle to get skins because you want your main fighter to look presentable. 

Everyone actually looks cool in this game so I have no issue with the default skins. Like for example I remember playing Mortal Komabt 11 for the first time playing Liu Kang and I was pissed off that they made him and several other characters revenants for their default skins ""Like great my favorite character Liu Kang looks like a Zombie and now I have to jump through a bunch of hoops to give him a classic skin..."" I absolutely hated that about Mortal Komabat 11, but even when you got the skins you wanted the game just seemed so slow and off I felt Liu Kang's combos were pretty weak and broken in that game. I also felt that way about Raiden. MK X had the best combo setup for Raiden and he was pretty overpowered. Mk 11 just had way too much stuff in it that game, and I felt like the game play wasn't well polished. 

That being said this game did so much justice for Liu Kang by making him a Fire-God, he's practically the most overpowered character in the game and they made his moves set sick. This is the most fun I've had playing Liu Kang since MK 9. Some people may not agree with this, but I'm kind of relieved they did away with the variation capability. The variation worked for MK X, but with MK 11 not so much. Especially with the option with adding another variation I don't really have time for that I really just want to play the game. Honestly the variation was really a one hit wonder for X. I don't mind it for one game, but having to learn several move sets for every character is practically like learning 3 characters in one and it gets time consuming. 

Compared to this game Mortal Kombat 1 just seems more polished and enjoyable. The new feature they introduce is ""kameo"" characters where you have certain side assist fighters that pop out and attack your opponent to give damage so that's pretty cool. There's no krypt so this time they added the conquest invasion mode where you kind of go on maps in different realms fighting just opponent after opponent while unlocking skins and adding points to characters you use while leveling up like an RPG. Eventually you fight an invasion opponent which is basically an invading alternate Mortal Kombat character from another timeline you battle and unlock their skin so that's kind of fun. 

SPOILERS:

Honestly I prefer Hanzo as Scorpion, but Kaui Liang is a pretty good, and it's handled well with his sibling rivalry with Bi-Han (Sub-Zero), and also Kaui Liang's move set is so good. Hanzo does make an appearance as Kuai Liang's first pupil so that's cool.

Story's pretty good I'm just kind of tired of the multiverse stuff.

My Only Problems:

I mean I like Shang Tsung,  but making him the main big bad is kind of redundant at this point I would've liked it better if they brought back Onaga. Maybe they'll bring Onaga back in story DLC idk.

Like I said i like the story, but it's the same problem I have with making Shang Tsung the bad guy again. The plot went from tournament to MK 11 Aftermath, Armageddon, and Multiverse of Madness.

Recently I found a few other things I had a problem with this game. It seems to have far to  many bugs that need to be fixed. I notice a lot in invasion mode. When equipping certain characters the game won't let me save what I have equipped so I have to fight the game just to get it to cooperate.

And again they're making the same mistake they made with the last game by forcing micro-transactions down our throats. If you can't put the skin in the game to unlock it in a challenge don't bother with the skin at all. I'm not going to bother stocking up on dragon crystals or spend $10 on a skin if I can't unlock it in a certain challenge. It kind of takes the fun out of it. How I see it gamers bought the game they own it now... when you make a game you need to provide more content to put into it for players to enjoy it more instead of trying to get more money out of them. DLC fine but put an end to the micro-transactions. 

Last thing I'd like to address is the lack of sub bosses, I was kind of disappointed that they didn't at least have a signature sub boss in this game. They got Goro and Motaro in this game, but only as Kameo fighters so it really comes off as a tease you don't even get to fight them. I really wanted to fight Motaro. 

All that aside it's a really fun game I highly recommend it.",1695195331,1702349098,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It means brilliant cartoons like ""The Looney Toons"", a cultural phenomena with characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. A cinema giant with a hundred classics spanning decades of cinema. Warner Bros. uses quality ingredients. They wouldn't shovel heaping piles of manure onto your plate, right?

Outside, it's a steakhouse: maybe it's Montana's.
  ""Welcome in,"" the building whispers in your ear. ""We get you.""
 A shiver down your spine as the warm breath of cheap, pressure treated wood hits your nostrils. [i] Finally, a restaurant that gets me. [/i] 
Or, maybe it's the kind where a half-clothed man sprinkles salt through his chest hair onto your plate, and foils his steak in 24k gold.

 You order that Mortal Kombat you've been craving. You know it's bad for you, but you like it anyway. But each time you go back you realize, ""this one's sprinkled with a few more turds this time."" Each time you pay more, but you get less. Soon you're getting sliders: tiny slabs of beef hammered into waiver thin burgers, sprinkled with the secret seasoning: seasoned salt. When you put it in your mouth, it tastes like nothing. ""Flame broiled,"" says a balding corporate executive with a rotund little ass. ""It's flame grilled.""

You few hours later you've got sliderrhea. You're 300 pounds. And it really didn't taste like anything: ""but it's flame grilled...."" will be your last words.

You can hear St. Peter's bell. Until it goes mute and a voice whispers in your ear. A drunken, stroke-victim slurring micro transactions into your ear. ""Only 15.99 to unlock Shang Tsung's nipple-clamps.""

No, WB, I don't think I like green eggs and ham, and done eating your nasty sh*t I am.

The Bad: The Kameo System, overall not a terrible mechanic but poorly implemented, all Kameo characters should be normal roster characters and all playable characters should be usable for Kameo. I find the violence has been fairly watered down, lack of x-ray opportunities, the environmentals are gone. the distance listed for moves required range is terrible there is no ""far"" range just ""close"" and ""mid"" because mid starts at like 10-15 to the other edge of the map >.<

The Ugly: with all the effort they clearly put into this game it's sad that it feels like a cash grab $90 CAD for the base game with a roster of around 23 characters give or take 1 or 2 depending on your pre-orders 2 less then the last two games base roster, $50 CAD for the ""Kombat Pack"" for the playable fighter DLC and $30 CAD for the ""Kameo Pack"" for extra support characters (that honestly don't really add a lot to the game aside from an added animation for the fatal blows and fatalities). Finally the last thing i will mention the Roster Jax, Sonya, Kano, Goro, Cyrax, Sektor, and a few more all Kameo only characters so you cant actually play them they're supports only, and all the new generation fighters they introduced in 
x and 11 are either gone or don't exist yet 

Overview: From a Technical Stand point the game is awesome, if your computer isn't up to spec it might struggle from time to time but i didn't have any major issues, but with how hard they push you to purchase the game currencies and added DLC for such steep prices its hard to recommend so i would say buy on sales only",1702200445,1702200635,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit (2): This game still kinda sucks, invasion was kinda lackluster, customization isn't nearly as fleshed out as MK 11. It still performs pretty badly particularly in story mode going into a cutscene. The final chapter crashed my game (running it on an RTX 3060 32GB RAM).

I don't understand why companies still use Denuvo when it significantly affects performance. I mean, most players buy this game to play online, which means that whether with Denuvo or without it, players can't play without buying the game so that there is no need to keep it. The only thing that can be played in a pirated version of the game is the story mode (which, I can tell you, isn't the best). Also, I have loading times in story mode due to Denuvo, even though I have installed the game on an NVME. Seriously, WB should think about removing Denuvo; it affects performance too much.

The story was a little silly at first, but over time I genuinely became interested in the plots and tales of each character - having not played the games before MKX and MK11, it's nice to be able to understand where the characters are coming from, for once. With the exception of one character (who I'm not gonna flame), all the voice acting is pretty nice.

I liked the customization that was present in MK11, but I think the simplicity that MK1 approaches the game with in using Kameo fighters is much more interesting. Fatal Blows are more graphic, fatalities are more cinematic, and while I have yet to get an X-ray(very likely its not in the game), overall I think the meter and Kameo mechanics work well. Definitely a bonus that getup delays don't cost meter.

The input is completely broken. A lot of times you can't press buttons more than one time for them to work, but if you don't do it the exact frame, it doesn't work either. Sometimes it's even worse, lets say you want to do ""↓+X"" followed by ""→+↓+←+B"" and the game consistently understands the second button (the B) as an X. A complete mess.
Also, online is all about not allowing your opponent to move, and instead of punishing spamming, it rewards it. I guess that applies to most fighting games, but anyway, I can't enjoy it.

Spending 230+ hours in Mortal Kombat 11 I really had a blast, but the same feeling won't come up for Mortal Kombat 1. Is it a bad game? No, definitely not, it is diffrent and here lies the problem for me. But let's start with the pros. The cameo system is nice, knowing there is always a second fighter backing you up. Plus there are a lot of combinations to find out on how one can use the cameo fighter in certain situations. The story mode is again awesome and could be a full featured blockbuster movie in itself. The towers are simple and it feels like more ""back to the roots"". Well, I guess that is what MK1 tried to to in the first place, going back to the roots. Test your Might activities are back, which formed a  big smile on my face, but going back to basics is also where the problem starts for me. Regardless how cool and versitile the cameo system is, fighting itself is also back to basic. You have one ""getting out of a bad situation"" move, which burns all of your meter at once. In MK11 one had 2 bars of defensive and 2 bars of offensive moves at the ready. Properly used, one was able to strike an opponent in a wake up move to get an advantage, or one could roll out of a combo string, to limit damage taken. Not so anymore. There is only one combo breaker move in the game. Ask yourself everytime, when you consider using it, if it is worth losing all your built up meter for it. Of course there are still, enhanced moves in the game, but they do not look that spectacular anymore as they did in MK11. Well, let's talk about invasions. Imagine you have a playing board in front of you with a figure of your choice from the MK Universe.  You roll a dice and your figure moves from one point to another. At any point there is an opponent waiting for you to beat the crap out of him, and you earn some goodies in the process. Sometimes keys, which you'll need to access another area of the play board. Well that is invasions in a nutshell, absent the rolling of a dice, for you control your charakter via controller. The Krypt in MK11 was so much more fun to me. You could explore Shang Tsungs Island, open secret passages, solving riddles etc. to unlock new regions of the Island and new gear for your charakters. There was a forge, where you could forge Items for tower play and so on. The Kollector had each day diffrent nice items for sale or would exchange them for certain items you found within the Krypt. All of that is gone..... Yes, there is a forge to be found within invasions, but it's only purpose is to upgrade your talismans, which you'll find along the raod. You also remember the shrine in MK 11 where you could spend your money on new skins or backgrounds etc..... Well, yes there is a shrine in MK 1 too, but getting something suitable out of it, is a gamble on it's own. What I'm also missing is the variety of customisation, one had in MK 11. There is only one Item to customise on your charakter. Gone are the days where you could change your figjhter into an awesome looking bad ass. Customising your fighting style? Forget it, just not possible anymore. As I mentioned before...... BACK TO THE BASICS.  What really blew me away in MK 1 are the backgrounds and charakters. They are lovely crafted and spread out an atmosphere and charisma, which outpaces even MK11. If you are a true Mortal Kombat fan this is a no brainer, and you have to buy it. If you like fighting games and you are searching for a challenge, MK1 is definitely your game. Should you find yourself more on the casual side of fighting games, well you can have fun, but keep in mind that others, especially online, will often wipe the floor with you. You have to put some effort in to it, to stand a chance online. Yes, I recommend Mortal Kombat 1, although finding myself in a tough spot having fun with it.

Gonna have to leave this game a bad review. Huge MK fan, but this game is everything I hate in video game industry and +++

*EDIT: They just added fatalities to the premium shop LMAO. They want us to pay for fatalities S U C K my ass NRS please don't buy this game. Haven't seen a cash grab that big for a long time.

The gameplay is nice, but that's about it. 

Now for the negative parts:

Game is empty has hell, one piece of gear to change which is a huge downgrade from 11, way less outfit and they've been replaced with seasonal skin which is the worst idea ever for ''color theme characters'' such as MK + they all look the same. Why the fuck would I want to put a scorpion color skin on Sub-Zero!?? (this is not a choice, this is pretty much the only ''skin'' available)

Sadly they made that for a reason, they intend to put shitty gear in-game so you'll buy skins in the store with real money EXCUSE ME NRS IS YOUR GAME FREE? I PAID 90$ FOR IT AND YOU PUT ERMAC + QUAN CHI + SHANG TSUNG AS DLC BEFORE DAY 1 AND YOU STILL WANT ME TO PAY FOR SKINS IN A 90$ GAME!!?????

Invasion in boring as hell, it's slow, grindy and unwanted boring fights, can't believe they removed the krypt with this shitty idea. No more exploration, no more puzzles, no more late nights of searching your favorite piece of gear/outfit or fatality. Worst thing is that this thing and money you got is getting reset every season for repetition grinding, no thanks. 

So the only thing that's left is online, gotta say that I'm not a fan of rank mode either AKA kombat league (which is pretty important in a fighting game). Best of 5 is boring and way too long without any rewards to it...
**EDIT 2 : I just played ranked for the first time in a long time and it's and it's not best of 3s kudos! 
Still down 1 contest out there but at least the contest is shorter Xd.


I haven't spoke of the story because if you pay 90$ for a fighting game story that last a day and a half, well you are weird and don't come in the reviews for that lol. Story plot twist: it's the same as all the other, they just switched some characters roles. (Liu Kang is the new Raiden and Raiden is the new Liu Kang and that's pretty much it) 

Game's seems to run way smoother on console than PC, and no I don't have a potato PC, should be able to run this pretty well but it's not. 

Final review if you are an hardcore fan: I doubt that my review will change your mind, but if you haven't bought yet you can probably wait longer until this is fix if they ever do it. 

You like MK but not a huge fan: You'll get bored pretty quick with the lack of content and all the grindy stuff. Don't buy unless huge discount if you really want it.",1696711684,1701729951,False,247,10,0.826047062873840332,17,True,False,False

Story/ setting (environments)
Firstly, I played the original MK1, back on the Sega Genesis. So? In being partial to the first three games? I was blown away! To see a reboot that didn't suck and/ or wasn't mediocre, as literally every MK game felt like, past MKIII (with some periodic gems that would surface, here and there, in the past two decades). It is incredibly inventive and love how they pulled off the timeline thing, though, I do wonder how these demigods and gods are so freaking absent minded and helpless, at times. It certainly does better with its timeline story than any Marvel movie does. I think it could even make for a fun game/ content spin-off, where maybe NetherRealms does a story mode where we are playing on the side of Titan Shang Tsung.  However? It had moments where it felt like it got a little out of hand, when it began combining characters. I can't think of immediate examples because they were all perplexing to pick out, but as a random example? For instance? Seeing a Raiden/ Sub Zero hybrid type character, and several other weird combinations. It did make me wonder if they had some procedural engine whose aim was to randomly combine characters. Since we are talking multiple universes though, it works and it was kind of funny to see this stuff. It was also very interesting, to see a version of the universe where Outworlders weren't horrible, and seeing everything in a more utopic light (Outworld as it might have been if there were no Shang Tsung). But this is also what sort of made it feel ""not Mortal Kombat""at times. Similar to how Doom Eternal completely changed their art style and made it feel less horrifying and gritty and more vibrantly colored and high fantasy. I'm used to most MK matches being set in a grim environment, yet most of them are very utopic now. 

Combat
The combat definitely has evolved and I ultimately enjoy it better than any before it, from a combat perspective. Although? I did like those MK games over the years that attempted to introduce a 3D environment, such as you might find in games like Tekken, or Soul Calibur and I do wish we could get an MK game like that again, but I can certainly see why they kept to the original formula...it jsut works. But some of the advantages of a 3D combat game opens the doors to many more potential moves. For instance, side-stepping your opponent and grabbing/ throwing them results in a different move than you might get when facing straight on, or behind them...and the same with countering. I also haven't seen the old interactive environments! To the likes of other MK games, like MKII, Killer instinct and Injustice. Knocking people into environment 'stuff' and having environment fatalities? Super fun stuff! Although? Maybe not quite to the extent of Injustice, where I think the environment stuff maybe does a little too much damage. In fact? It wouldn't even have to contribute to ""more damage"" and just be kept as an aesthetic. 

Consumables
I love the consumable approach to buffing your powers/ resistances. I just wish that consumables were stackable and/ or that you could carry more than 5. I.e. Keys, for instance, should even be kept in a consumable slot...or, if it really must be? It should be stackable. I should not have to choose to ditch treasure keys, in order to keep gameplay based consumables. These are two separate things having to do nothing with gameplay. I should be able to keep more than one Chaos Armor consumable in my inventory, stacked. 

Node navigation
Walking from node-to-node, in Invasion mode? Is completely nonsensical and especially infuriating. Assuming your character is facing forward (12 O'clock)? Somehow, pushing forward on the stick results in them turning around and walking back the opposite direction, and yet? You can push forward for your character to return to the prior node, while they are now facing the 6 O'clock position. Yet, walking back to the prior node and continuing pushing forward on the stick results in turning around again. So, as logic would have it? If while the camera is faced 12 O'clock, and my character is facing 6 O'clock? Then logic would dictate that if both my character and camera are facing 12 O'clock? Then pushing my stick in the backward (6 O'clock) direction should result in my finally moving forward, correct? Nope!!! Let me see if I can explain better: 

You are facing 12 O'clock and want to continue to the next node, which is also 12 O'clock from your position. You push the stick in the 12 O'clock, which, again? Is the direction that both the camera and character are facing, yet? The character turns around and walks back to the 6 O'clock position. So, now he/ she is one node opposite the direction you wanted to be, except now now facing the 6 O'clock direction, while the camera continues statically facing the 12 O'clock direction. So, you instinctively push back on the stick, because you want your character to turn back around and face/ head back 12 O'clock, but this only makes them walk further in the 6 O'clock position, so clearly it must be based on which way the camera is facing, if back makes them walk forward and so one might think: ""Okay...so...it must be going off of the direction the camera is facing, which? If that's the case? Why did pushing forward make me turnaround in the first place then?"" So, sure enough? You push 12 O'clock on the stick and it sends you back one node in the correct position, but since you have now ended up two nodes away from your original location, you need to do this once more, to get back to where you started: ""Good! So? Let's push forward once more and get to the node I want to be at!"" So, with the character and camera both facing 12 O'clock again? You push forward and rejoice because now you are back to where you started. So, in retaining the same logic, you pushing 12 O'clock on the stick, once more and the f'ng thing turns around and walks back again!!! Grrrrrr!!!
I've never met gameplay that made me want to throw my controller over such a stupid thing! 

Node navigation - workaround
Well? The workaround that I found? Is that when you push the stick the direction you want to go, keep snapping the stick in the desired direction, as you approach the next node (So, like ""clack clack clack clack clack"") and continue doing that as you approach the node, and your character ""should"" continue walking forward...but not all the time, as, if your timing is off? And one of those stick pushes didn't occur as you approached the next node? The character will still turn around and walk the opposite direction.

All-in-all? I love what NetherRealms has done with the game, but I wish it could feel a little spookier/ grittier again. I think the colors of the characters armor are often too utopic and brightly vibrant/ vivid...and even the narrative voice that says ""Fight!"" and ""Fatality!"" Doesn't sound as deep/ scary as the MK 1-3 versions of the game. But from a gameplay centered perspective? However? If they just fix the clunky node navigation and how consumables/ inventory are stored? They could pretty much do nothing else to the game from here on out and I'd be happy.",1701710484,1701712346,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-Story is a big improvement compared to 11, towards the ending it gets a bit worse in my opinion
-Roster is pretty good
-Invasions mode is interesting
-The combos feel fun to execute
Cons:
-The game has way too many paywalls. For example, you have extra fatalities that cost 10$ each or something like that. I'm one of the people that bought the kombat pack, and I have to wait an unknown number of months if not years to play takeda
-Neutral is beyond dumb. Once again nrs decided that it's really cool for the person who mashes pokes the most to have his turn for the whole game(d1 being punishable is a complete lie, good luck doing it on 100+ ping)
-The kameo system straight up sucks. It doesn't feel like there are any intended synergies made. There is one kameo in the game that is better then all the others and that's the one that everybody uses. At first it was cyrax, now it's kung lao. It just feels like every character uses the same strategy and it gets boring.
-It feels like the characters have been intentionally given less tools. My guess for the reasoning would be that you would have to rely on kameos. We know how that worked out.
-Punishing moves feels very difficult. Blockstun is really high sometimes, combine that with the sluggish movement and you can't even punish moves that are -15
-The movement is very strange. Indeed, it feels fast however it's really clunky. I tried so many times to dash and use a mid to catch my opponent just for it to whiff and get full combo punished.
-There are a bunch of archetypes missing from the game. I know mk never had specific archetypes, but there was a bit of everything. In this game there are only two grapplers, one of them is played more like a zoner the other more like a whiff punish character

In conclusion, this game has a lot of potential, however in it's current state it's really disappointing. There's a pretty good reason for the playerbase dropping so hard.

Story: 8/10 A little bit tired of the multiverse .. But cut-scenes are top notch..

Gameplay: 10/10 Hard to jump in straight away unlike MK11 , much more fast paced and heavily punishing combos.. You might drop the game the first time you try to versus online. A.I is too easy to train against like always.. Kenshin is way too broken

DLCs and Customization : They do not listen to the fans in regards of paid content.. Idk how a character in the campaign manage to be a dlc exclusive .. Easy fatalities cost actual money.. There's not much to costume customization like we had in mk11. 
Unless you have no job but still have money.. You could grind or waste your money .

I wanted to like it, but this is by far the worst MK since before the last reboot. And I'm talking about the game in general, not just the PC port, tho I'll get to that. This MK feels more rushed than the 2021 movie. Not even gonna try to list everything that's been stripped away since MK 11. The customization of move sets, the various intros and outros, augmented gear, and too much other shit. No more Krypt, bc now we got ""Invasions,"" which is a terrible trade-off. No sense of wonder and exploration there, it's just mind-numbing repetitious busy work. Grinding away hours while contemplating your life decisions, wondering how it came to this. There's these occasional ""Survive"" sessions that they should've just called ""Test Your Patience,"" I don't wanna talk about it. ""But what about the kameos,"" you ask? Ever use those 'Summon' Konsumables in MK 11, like in the ToT? Yeah that's basically all it is. Everything about this game just feels phoned in. The fatalities/brutalities are all weak AF, and mostly recycled. Just like the kameo character designs. ""No, no time for concept art...Let's just reuse old shit and call it...nostalgia!"" ...and... ""Let's speedrun through the promotional period before they figure out that this game is really more like a work in progress!"" ...are just some of the things I imagine NRS saying, at some point. But yeah, I went ahead and bought the premium edition on Black Friday, at a whopping 30% off, so it was just over 70 bucks. Felt like I was getting a sweet deal bc a lotta big dummies preordered the game for that price and all they got was a stupid Shang Tsung lol XD...I didn't get any Shang Tsung tho :(  He'd cost me another 8 bucks so he's an NPC as far as I'm concerned... BUT... what I did get, was 6 whole guest characters and like 5 kameos instead!!! ...Well, technically I only got one of each, atm...Not sure how long it'll take for NRS to drip-feed me the rest...since they're still in development. They don't yet exist...but I paid for them. Hmmm...wow. Perhaps I, too, was a big dummy. Gonna beat myself up far more than any in-game opponents, that's for sure. But that's just the game in general. The PC port is...well, better than the Switch port at least. That's something, I guess. But get ready for some frame-dropping cutscenes that will often look like stop-motion animations. Even on low graphic settings, on a PC that meets the recommended specs, and then some. it really makes no difference at all. But the actual fights do seem to run smoothly tho, so I guess QC was like that'll do. But that's just a minor gripe in comparison to how I feel about this game, on the whole. Currently, it's overpriced and undercooked. You really shouldn't buy it yet, if ever. Hopefully this D'vorah of a game will some day transform into...idk, something that doesn't just make me sick to look at.",1701611260,1701611260,False,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

I am not planning to buy them and other overpriced content anytime soon and I recommend other players not to buy them, too. This is disrespectful to the fans.

>>Original review:

I was excited for this release, mostly for the new designs and the story. I was surprised to see that the fighting mechanics were significantly changed and made more fluid/intuitive. I am loving the game so far. Let's see how long it will last!

One final note, (playing at 1440p) it is either the game is not optimised well or my RTX3060 is having difficulties keeping up with the requirements of our time. I hope it is the first one, ironically, so I only need to wait for a patch and not to change my graphic card.

Edit: Finished the story mode. The game was crashing constantly at the end battles, sometimes even in the cutscenes. Also, I could not complete a single tower yet because the game randomly crashes between fights. It should be fixed at once.

Second edit: Finished the Invasion mode. I am experiencing crashes despite the patch, especially in the Towers. Imagine like you reach half the tower in hard mode and the game crashes.

The roster could've been a bit bigger, but I guess that's a result of the reboot theme. I hope that as the story progresses in DLC or new games, the roster will become larger (Noob Saibot pls). But there's one thing I absolutely HATE, which is having to buy characters like Shang Tsung, Quan Chi and Ermac. Unlocking them through the story would've been logical, but why do I have to pay for characters that play a big part in the base game's story? It's just blatant cash grabbing.

This game was clearly rushed and is still unfinished. No online practice, no competent ping or wifi filter, tons of bugs for some reason, and all for the cheap price of 70 base, or 110 if you're like me and wanted all the characters, which will eventually add up to 150 or more by the end of the game's life. Piece of garbage money grubbing WB ruined MK for the foreseeable future. If you can get over the obscene price and lack of features, the balancing of the game is just sad. You simply can't play the characters you want. Sure, you can play some of the worse characters but in this state of the game you really only have one kameo to use with each character. MKX had 33 characters with 100 variations, and you could pretty much play any one of them and get good and have fun. This game is the opposite. I try so hard to like this game because of how expensive it was, but I can't. I can recommend the story though, that was almost a 10/10 for any MK fan. The rest of the game is still in beta and should have never been released. I'm sure the game will be better in a year or maybe even six months, but I don't have a time machine. Maybe for the price of the game they should have sent me one in the mail. More disappointing than MK11, and I didn't think that was possible.

PROS: 

Visually pleasing
Good story champagne with nostalgic ending
Lots of returning OG characters from older MK games
Very diverse combat system with multiple ways to play the same character thanks to the ""kameo system"" 
Interesting DLC line up 

Cons: 

Balancing takes forever to address
Same characters are being played in every match causing very stale and toxic game play
Insane amount of bugs that take way to long for the developers to address 
Insane loading screens 
Game crashes way too often 
Invasion mode is terribly repetitive and just seems like a waste of time

My Personal Thoughts and Opinions: As a dedicated Mortal Kombat fan who has been playing since day one, I approached the latest installment with a mix of excitement and nostalgia. However, after spending considerable time with the game (+200 hours), it pains me to admit that Mortal Kombat 1 falls short of the high standards set by its predecessors. One of the most glaring issues is the lack of content compared to previous entries in the series. Having been a part of the Mortal Kombat community for years, I've witnessed the evolution of the franchise and its ability to deliver robust and engaging content. Unfortunately, this latest iteration feels like a step backward in terms of variety and depth. Beyond the story, the game's additional modes feel like mere afterthoughts. The Towers lack the variety and creativity seen in previous games, and the absence of certain classic game modes is a letdown for those who have been with Mortal Kombat since its inception. The frequency of game crashes is another major concern. As someone who has invested countless hours into the Mortal Kombat franchise, the frustration of having the game abruptly freeze or close is hard to ignore. These interruptions not only disrupt the flow of gameplay but also raise questions about the overall stability of the title. In summary, Mortal Kombat 1 leaves a bitter taste for this day one player, as the abundance of bugs, frequent crashes, and overall lack of polish create an unsettling impression. The game's technical issues, reminiscent of an unfinished beta release, cast a shadow over what could have been a triumphant addition to the Mortal Kombat legacy. As a devoted fan, I can only hope that the developers address these concerns promptly and deliver the necessary updates to bring the game up to the standard of excellence that the franchise is known for. Until then, it's challenging to view Mortal Kombat 1 as anything other than a missed opportunity and a disappointing departure from the series' illustrious history. I just have to say that invasions is quite possibly the dumbest fucking game mode NRS has ever created. 

IN ITS CURRENT STATE: 5/10

After an additional 30 hours of playtime I felt the need to add on to my original review. 

One glaring issue is the time it takes to ascend the ranks, which seems to defy all reason. Despite going on crazy win streaks, the progression feels more like a marathon than a thrilling race. This extended grind not only tests the patience of players but also dampens the excitement of rising through the ranks.

Adding to the frustration is the repetitive nature of each match, with Johnny Cage becoming a ubiquitous presence in every encounter. It's disheartening to witness the lack of variety in character selection, turning what should be a diverse and dynamic fighting experience into a monotonous routine.

Johnny Cage's overwhelming popularity raises questions about game balance and the need for adjustments to encourage a more varied roster. The monotony of facing the same character repeatedly diminishes the overall enjoyment of the game, leaving players yearning for a more diverse and challenging set of opponents.

2/10 in its current state.",1700476528,1701170802,False,5,0,0.548317015171051025,1,True,False,False

Most fighters feel really good when playing them and the kameo system is also fun after getting used to it.

During early access there were a couple of problems with performance, but for me at least they are mostly gone. There are also some flaws and bugs, but nothing that more than a minor inconvenience.

I assume most problems/bugs will be fixed in the near future and more content will roll in, so I think you can't go wrong giving it a shot. Otherwise wait for a couple of stability patches and try it in a couple of weeks.

With MK11 I would play Towers of Time constantly. The Gateway Invasion Towers in this game are god awful. The modifiers are absolutely abysmal. Fire Floor, Fire Smoke, and Heating Up are the absolute worst BS I have ever experienced.

Ever since the update that was supposed to fix the PC issues, I've had nothing but problems. Fights now take up to 20 seconds to start. I have this on an SSD, 64GB of ram, and a GTX3080 with an i9. Unacceptable.

The AI is the most borked crap I have ever seen in a fighting game. I'm not talking about the cameos, I'm talking the actual AI. The game goes into what my wife has coined ""Ape ShÌt Mode"" where it just 1 frame dodges everything and you cannot land a hit no matter what you do. I'm so sick of this button reading, lazy shit in fighting games.

The gameplay itself is smooth and fun, but when there's nothing to really do...what's the point? I can't jump on and play a few towers because the towers are god awful and are usually 1 to 3 fights long...because honestly, that's all you're going to stand thanks to the modifiers.

Fatalities are time gated behind your character level with the specific fighter...so if you want to get a second fatality and other brutalities, you have to grind to level them up. Yeah, you read that right...you have to fucking grind in a fighting game. Unlike MK11 where you could just do the fatality input and get the fatality unlocked, you have to get the character to a high enough level to unlock it. Fuck...that...

Oh, and I forgot to mention there are NO stage fatalities. Why? Why do they keep doing that when they're going to add them later?!?!

The invasion mode itself is fun for the first board and a half...then it's just tedious. All you need to win is put most of your stats into attack, then into health, then special and then defense. The enemies in this faux RPG mode are armored 90% of the time so you have to time your attacks to actually hit them without them just powering through your attacks. It teaches REALLY bad gameplay mannerisms. There's also no map, which you think wouldn't be a problem, but the boards meander all over the place and you can't zoom out far enough to see where you need to go.

Online connection errors are pretty frequent as well, but I don't bother playing online since the FGC is pretty toxic.

If they fix these issues moving forward, I'll change my review from not recommended to recommended. Some things have been fixed...but not enough.",1697070825,1701156899,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

As someone coming from MK11 as their most played mortal kombat game the enhanced moves are a little janky so I don't care for that but I understand that it was reverted back to its MK10 form. Everybody does just a tad bit too much damage overall but that's nothing that cant be changed. Graphics are beautiful. Game play is satisfying. Customization is slightly subpar which was disappointing but I'm sure that that will be updated soon. I put my wallet and my faith in netherrelm.

I have been a customer for the MK games since long time and despite owning XL, 11 and the qualities of this one, I have completely ignored aspects that are just sickeningly revolting. I realise now the greed and control freak habbits of NRS just went too far with the inaccessibility of all unlocked content for a second local player for example.

+ Core gameplay is still enjoyable

+ Some returning characters which I've missed dearly including Ashrah and Li Mei

- Full-price game with mobile-style monetization

- 30 fps menus/fatal blows/fatalities

- All the efforts went into the premium store including paid fatalities, cosmetics and etc.

- Characters existing in the base game being locked behind paywalls,

- No cross-play.

- Sh*t net-code

- Horrible port. There are moments that you feel like the game's codes are gonna fall apart.

- Crash, crash and crash. And when it works it's a stutter-fest

- Incredibly grindy and boring invasion mode, made even worse fighting against brain-dead AI

- Always online bullsh*t

Cough cough MK9, X and 11. This is my first time owning a Netherrealm game on PC and I was a bit worried about how it might go since as you might all know Netherrealm doesn't make their PC ports in house and thats had a mixed bag. MK11 didn't get cross platform and so that didn't help for the games health but it had the Towers of Time which was good for Singleplayer content in my opinion. Invasions is interesting its a nice concept and could be really dope with some tweaks such as those goddamn Secret and Ambushes they become a bit tedious when you just want to get through a mesa. I've never really been too hardcore at fighting games but I understand them and I'm half decent so I've dipped my toes online of course since I'm on PC I don't have to pay to play online anymore thank god. Online reminds me of most MK's you got the top tier really strong characters where you can mostly spam the same thing and be safe so that gets a bit frustrating but ever character does feel viable and one slip up and you can take the game granted you know your strings. The Story mode was nice too I actually really enjoyed the story and the new universe, some of the plot feels weirdly rushed in some parts and just feels weird but game is fun enough to ignore it. The gameplay is so solid and fun I'm actually in the minority of MK fans about MK11 and I enjoyed its a bit slower and more grounded based gameplay. If you come straight from MK11 to 1 the first difference you'll notice is that the game is a bit faster and aerial combos are a big thing in MK1, you even get dedicated air strings for kombos now its really great. Kameo system is nice too but like always online is dominated by the same kameos over and over again. My biggest gripe with the game is the Singleplayer content seems very limited compared to MK11, far fewer cosmetic choices for characters most of it being in the shop instead of DLC characters releasing with skin packs they seem to only appear on the rotating shop now which is not cool in my opinion since there is no way to earn Dragon Krystals like you could with Time Krystals. And so far with Season of Blood starting sadly the skins you earn in it are the exact same as the Season of the Specter but red this time. It also feels like a punch in the gut that Omniman only has one skin. He doesn't even get a Viltrumite outfit or bearded Nolan. He gets a small handful of gear and some colour swaps. I'm hoping its not like this with all the DLC characters as MK11 was so nice having guest and DLC characters to have multiple skins. Pre fight dialogue is my other problem. We are now on two lines instead of MK11's three. The dialogue can only be heard on Versus against AI (Which doesn't reward XP) or you have to play online. It doesn't even play on Towers or Invasions, I guess thats because the Dialogue in this game is a seemless transition from select screen into the match without an obvious loading screen. But if the trade was to have a loading screen just for dialogue on Singleplayer content I'd take it. They really couldn't make the characters at least clash for towers? 

Overall I do really enjoy the game. Its faster than MK11 and zoning isn't the dominate playstyle. The graphics look great and the game runs really well since well its capped at 60fps because its a fighting game so its not that hard to run on cranked settings. But if you need a boost up-scaling is there with DLSS and FSR. I would recommend the game but maybe pick it up on sale if you only plan on doing Singelplayer content since you can't really experience all the dialogue and cool stuff without doing PVP or earning no rewards. If I could give a Yes and No option I maybe would but for now I do enjoy the game so its gets a Yes from me.",1701060404,1701060404,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

Why the hell do I spend 77 dollars for the premium edition ON SALE but also have to buy a 20 dollar pack of kameo characters that somehow are not included with a ""premium"" edition.  This game is good, but it is not good enough to warrant a premium edition that STILL has multiple things missing. Its like if you bought a toy that was already expensive, but it comes without batteries and without a head. If I buy a game for over the price of $70, and it has only half of the items within it, do not call it premium. With games like Injustice 2, if you bought the ultimate edition, you practically got everything, including the DLC characters. Calling a product ""premium"" when it is missing things is disingenuous. Besides, had there not been a sale, I would have paid $110 dollars for a game that comes with half the kameos. Overall, while the gameplay itself is fun, the overmonetization of this game makes it feel more like a pay to play rather than a game in and of itself. Do not buy unless on sale.

No fullscreen

Their bodys are truly like a fighter

And the fanservice is back again
BUT their FACE of any characters are fcked Up especial Shang shung - kitana/mileena  Sindel Rain and general.

Also the fatalities and ultis are not so Gore or hardcore IT FEELS like they got soft 

The only BadAss where Subzero and Kinda Scorpion .

Story plot was very good the Armageddon reference it was epic
They just ruined it with Many doubles

BELIEVE ME THE MK11 ALL THEY WHERE BADASS

THEIR COMBOS
THEIR VISUAL
FATALITIES
THE STORY.

I have a AMD RX 7900 XT graphics card and I had trouble with stuttering at 30fps and even worse at 60fps. Now I know this game is still new and needs time to be patched. I'm just letting the devs know what my major issue is.

That and the fact I bought the Special Edition and come to find out I STILL need to BUY Shang Tsung and the Kameo pack at $20 bucks! Thats insane. Sorry if assumed the SPECIAL EDITION would come with ALL current DLC. Atleast I get access to John Cena and Homelander...sometime in the future🙄
The game is fun. It's not bad. I personally much prefer MK11, that's just me. But yeah, it's not worth THAT much for just some kameo characters. 
Do better NeatherRealm. Be better


Edit: So idk know if people really know this who are thinking about getting the game but you actually don't even have to buy those characters unless you're feeling impatient because you actually unlock them every 5 levels up to 25 whick will only take you like 5 or 6 hrs. I'm about to get Shujinko next and he's the only one I'm really looking forward to cuz tbh I don't really even use them.  I've found myself actually just using them to feel like I'm not wasting the mechanic but I don't find them legitimately necessary...yet. we'll see.
And I have to say after playing more I do actually really love the game. And the invasion mode is actually pretty fun. Tho it is a little tedious running back and forth like a game board piece. But it's still fun and a new mix on an old formula, ala the Krypt. 
But alas I'm still leaving a 👎 until stuttering is addressed. I did get it working better after turning my settings to Esports on my graphics card and auto configuring the game settings. Which is strange cuz the game chose to go all out ultra settings and 16x anisotropic with all the extra junk like motion blur ect. on. And it actually is a lil bit smoother oddly enough. Buuut it still needs work cuz it still can have bad stuttery moments when alot is going on or a survive multiple opponents match comes up.
Sorry NeatherRealm for my be better comment. I mean the $20 dlc is greedy but I LOVE being able to unlock it in-game. Just fix the stutter and I'll change my review",1700954082,1701035943,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Though there is some content missing this is the most fun I've had playing Mortal Kombat in a while and has me invested in the series once again.",1700974855,1700974855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I also love how the krypt was replaced with invasions, gives you a lot more to accomplish and do instead of grinding for currency to get new items. With the addition of titan battles and replacing the challenge towers with the gateway, I feel like this game will continue to provide plenty of fun for a long time to come! 

There are a few cons though, however, as there are for any game. As for Mortal Kombat 1, I found times where loading into fights and cut-scenes took almost several minutes, but I did find a fix for it! All I had to do was verify the integrity of the files and move them onto my C: drive (or the drive where windows is installed on) and that fixed the long loading times!

UPDATE: With season 2, character mastery experience gain is absolutely abysmal; it's been reduced five-fold. While in season 1 I managed to level up 1.5 characters and kameos, by the end of season 2 I could not even complete the remaining 0.5 of the second character and kameo.

After the outcry developers changed the contents of the ""controversial"" 12$ ""Seasonal fatalities package"". Previously you were paying 12$ (1200 dragon krystals) for one seasonal fatality, and now the bundle contains 3 fatalities (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas). And the people who bought the original bundle will also receive the other 2 fatalities.
It's a 1/7th the price of the entire game for 3 fatalities. This bundle is more expensive than GODLY ""Separate Ways"" (RE4 story DLC) that have hours of gameplay!!!
But let's put things into perspective, 10$ is a cost of a DLC character. You know what else costs 10$ in the premium ingame store? Announcers... Each announcer costs 10$! And if you bought Omni-Man DLC and like the character then you gotta buy the announcer separately! 10$ more please! And if I remember right the character costs 8-something $, that's cheaper than damn announcer! The pricing in this game is absolutely nonsensical!
Remember MK11? It got a FREE update where all of the characters got a whole ""Friendship"".
The game has ""Blizzard level"" of monetization. Hell, they are even selling stuff that could've been earned in the first season of the Invasions for Premium currency. What's worse however: 1) you can't refund; 2) you don't know what you're buying. I mean if you have something from the bundle you won't know what you already have and what you're buying; 3) Sometimes the contents are depicted wrong in the previews (Nitara's DA skin for example, 2 palettes were different).
And you can't earn premium currency in the game the way you could do it in MK11! You can earn about 5000 Dragon krystals through finishing the story, leveling up the profile and the character mastery (massive grind) but after that you can only buy it in the premium store.
Again, are we sure it's not a Blizzard game? 
Good fucking grief.
Oh, by the way, did I mention MK1 is a live service game? What does it mean? That means you can't do s#it without connection to servers. And once the developers pull the plug on the game you're gonna lose everything. ""Buuuut they're gonna patch it!"" No they won't. They removed their ""GOLDEN KOW"" (MK9, the game that had chances of becoming the ""Resident evil 4"" of the franchise) from the stores because of the stupid Freddy Krueger. And believe me they are not gonna renew the licences for all of the guest characters, so eventually once the servers go down the game will be unplayable. Just fantastic! It's a game with an expiration rate (just like MK11!) 
And I am not even mentioning that it's practically a beta version (as of now: 22.11.2023). The game with a bare bones content, horrible netcode, no crossplay, lots of bugs and glitches, and yeah, no Krypt!
That hurts. That really hurts. Because I loved the new story and revamp of most characters. The game features THE BEST versions of many characters. I am not gonna spoil the story, all I can say is that I've really enjoyed it, it's a huge upgrade from MK9-11.
Sadly, let's summarize the review.
If you don't have the game, DO NOT BUY IT. Wait the for the ""Ultimate Edition"" 2 years from now with everything included in it and a discount (60-85%).
And if you have the game like me, DO NOT BUY Dragon Krystals! Vote with your wallet! Over the top aggressive monetization in the game is absolutely outrageous and inexcusable!",1698427423,1700838180,False,33,2,0.636441469192504883,0,True,False,False

It's in a state that can be called a beta, not a final product. It has nothing to do with optimisation, the PC port is done by the cheap amators (it can't show me even 30 fps on lowest settings where MK11 worked okay on highest settings).

The Invasions mode is a dramatic degradation comparing to Crypt and Towers of Time in MK11. P2 doesn't have access to skins and finishers of P1. They screwd up face sculpt once more and created a bunch of ugly female chacacters.

It looks like a free-to-play game, it works like a free-to-play game, it sounds like a free-to-play game. I don't recommend it anymore. It's a BS.

Title: A Classic Brawler That Still Packs a Punch - Mortal Kombat 1 Review

Rating: 9.3/10

Mortal Kombat 1 is a timeless classic that has left an indelible mark on the fighting game genre, and even after all these years, it continues to stand tall as a testament to the golden age of arcade gaming.

The first installment of the Mortal Kombat series, released in 1992, introduced us to a world of intense martial arts battles, unique characters, and groundbreaking digitized graphics. One of the game's standout features is its iconic and now legendary fatalities, which were a groundbreaking and controversial addition at the time. These finishing moves added an extra layer of excitement and strategy to the gameplay, setting Mortal Kombat apart from its contemporaries.

The character roster, while not as extensive as later iterations, is diverse and memorable. Each fighter comes with a distinct set of moves and special abilities, making the game enjoyable for both casual players and seasoned fighting game enthusiasts. From Scorpion's spear to Sub-Zero's freezing techniques, the characters are brimming with personality and style.

The gameplay itself is fast-paced and responsive, with a smooth combo system that allows for satisfying and strategic combat. Mortal Kombat 1 struck a balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for those looking to master the intricacies of each character. The difficulty curve is well-designed, providing a challenge that keeps players engaged without becoming frustrating.

The digitized graphics, although dated by today's standards, were groundbreaking at the time and contributed to Mortal Kombat's distinctive visual identity. The character sprites are large and detailed, showcasing the effort put into creating a visually striking and memorable gaming experience.

The atmospheric soundtrack adds to the overall intensity of the game, with each character having their theme that perfectly complements their persona. The sound effects, especially the bone-crushing punches and kicks, further enhance the visceral and impactful nature of the battles.

While Mortal Kombat 1 may lack some of the bells and whistles of more recent entries in the series, its historical significance and enduring appeal make it a must-play for anyone interested in the roots of the fighting game genre. Whether you're a nostalgic fan reliving the glory days of the arcade or a newcomer curious about gaming history, Mortal Kombat 1 is a true classic that deserves its place in the pantheon of great video games. With a rating of 9.3/10, it stands as a testament to the enduring quality of this iconic title.",1700804263,1700804263,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

Im not going to claim to be a MK expert cause ive only played about 3 of their games. Im going to compare MK1 to MK11 in this review. First off the campaign. If you want to start the story over and clean slate it, then do just that! The story is so bent on its head for trying to restart and trying to continue. PICK A SIDE! Also to have all of these cool skins and variations in the story, to not have anything like that in the customization sucks. The game launched with barley any customization so I feel that would have been a smart play to add in the beginning. Now the invasion game mode. You can tell alot of work went into it for like 4 months then they just said Ctrl+C Ctrl+V. Its extremely repetitive. I hate how they got rid of the freeze frame on fatalities, so now every end is just a generic stand behind a pile of meat with the word fatality in the corner. Now my biggest issue is the actual fighting part of the game. They got rid of krushing blows, for whatever reason. Interacting with the arena is not there anymore. Cameos were such a good idea, but the execution is kinda trash imo. The only this the cameo feels like its there to do is to ruin the game by giving players endless combos. Like hitting combos are cool, but when you loose 70% of your health in one chain the game is kinda broken. So many characters can get you in an insane >50% health combo because of cameos, like I get you should play to not get hit in those but the initial attack can be a instant jab. You only get ONE combo break every THREE bars. That right there I see as a big problem. If every character has a super easy combo that starts high goes low and hits an overhead after to chain into a longer combo that can be spammed cause it has a start up of 10 so there is no way to punish..... THEN WHY TF CAN I ONLY COMBO BREAK 1 TIME EVERY 3 BARS. In MK11 you had a 1 to 1 ratio, and that was good cause not only were the combos not >50% health, but if there was the occasional high damage combo you could break it 3 times. I get that this game you gotta play to master, but these combos are just too much damage. Either lower the damage a combo does, or give me more options to combo break. Until they fix that this game feels unplayable to me. Every match people are playing as if they are going for the championship with these combos. This dosent sound like a big issue, but this is a FIGHTING game. When my character is stuck in the air getting juggled for 10 sec while my health depletes, and I already broke the same combo right before. It tends to ruin the experience. Also to top it off there are already skins and fatalities in the game that the only way to get is to pay real money after spending 70$ for the game feels like a slap in the face.

The character appearance, the story line, even the detail to the background seems like an improvement.

Two of my concerns are the flow of the moves and the text-to-speech accessibility. The moves, to me, don't seem to go together as well as they could. The different moves to make up the combination almost seem separate of each other. Dead or Alive 6 seems to flow better. The text -to-speech is very good, but very bad. Don't get me wrong, I am among those who are most grateful to have it work in every menu option throughout the game. But I don't want to guess what it is saying. 

There is something going on with the graphics. Although great, i feel that they could be better. I don't know what it is. Perhaps someone else would have the words to explain it

That being said, $69 is far too much. I could not resist any longer and bought it for 30% off. I should have waited for 50%.

Mortal Kombat 11 would have been a good stopping point. A fantastic end to a legendary franchise. I was both excited and worried when I saw, Coming Soon, Mortal Kombat 1. Having played it for a short time, I could easily see another 10 years. Perhaps that's my own personal wishful thinking.

There are still things missing that i MISS (KRUSHING BLOWS).........)  And thats what a mortal kombat should be. If the combat fails, then the whole thing is scrapped. But thankfully, only half of this belongs in the trash........ Please do better. 

ALL MY PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME LAY WITH THE STORY/WRITING.

Honestly, I was expecting to not really like this game much. I rarely play fighting games because it has always been frustrating to learn moves and kombos, but to put it simply, this game has changed my entire opinion on fighting games.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discovery and gameplay.

Kombat is fast, snappy, easy to grasp for beginners and hard to master for seasoned fans like myself. 
Even in regular gameplay you will manage to learn something new about whatever character you play.
Like this morning for example. I was running some Towers as Raiden when i discovered that you can chain cartwheels together as a kombostarter. 

Every character has moves that perfectly kounter and chain the moves of other characters and really makes kombat feel more thorough and knowlage based than ""press button and thing happen"".

Half of discovery in this game is based on your Kameo fighter that you select with your roster character before every match. A lot of Kameo and roster picks have synergy with moves and kombos. 
For example, Raiden's cartwheels bounce opponents into the air slightly, leaving just enough time to summon Jax as a Kameo to break their back for 90 damage. Its all about testing and knowledge. 

The FATAL BLOW system is back from MK11, but in a more digestible way.
No longer are late-match Fatal Blow attacks a death sentence, but more of a tool for intense pressure.
Some Fatal Blow moves have special attributes, most notably Johnny Cage's parry Fatal Blow.
It acts as a cure-all Kounter attack to almost every other Fatal Blow, meaning you need actual strategy to time and chain Fatal Blow moves, instead of just chucking them out whenever available. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consumer Info. 

Micro-transactions are available but like most paid games there are ways to get cosmetics without spending a dime more than the cost of the game, but they take a LOT of time, patience, and even luck at times. 
One of the ONLY ways to get in-game premium currency is to complete character and Kameo mastery which takes weeks.
Theres about 200 ""Dragon Krystals"" per character mastery meaning you will eventually run out of spendable currency, which is a shame for players who don't have expendable money outside of what they saved for the games initial purchase, or just don't feel like wasting real money on cosmetic items in a game. With only two or three hundred per character mastery you will only be able to buy a skin for a character after mastering four characters, which is a lot to ask for kasual players who don't have the time or desire to sink weeks into a game that they only play on the side.
Another issue with transactions and skins is the Shrine. The Shrine is like the Krypt of MK past, but significantly more like gambling than before. Spend 1000 Koins (earned by playing matches) and get a random prize. Concept art, Music, Skins, Gear, the whole works. However every season there is a very limited amount of items available in the shrine's gambling system. This conflicts with the Weekly and Daily quests available in-game with some quests requiring you to spend koins in the shrine, effectively locking you out of skins and profile rewards PUNISHING you for completing a major part of the game making it utterly impossible to 100% complete the season.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

KONCLUSION

Mortal Kombat is innovative to the fighting genre.
The story is an incredibly well put together semireboot, the gameplay is snappy and thorough, the graphics are stunning and really bring color back to Kombat, and most importantly, its f*ckin fun to play, mate.

Story was good until the last two chapters. Last two chapters feel super rushed and just have no buildup at all.

Invasions replaces the Krypt with mindless running around and using your uppercuts after a certain point by just dumping all points into attack.

Online has no connection filters, and was just Raiden, Johnny, and Baraka, all with Cyrax and was very boring to fight. Kameo system being in the game already solidified that people will figure out which kameo is the best, and only use that. And they said the kameos were supposed to bring VARIETY. Ha, yeah right.

The PC port is unoptimized, with constant lag and stuttering, even on high end rigs.

Skins are now $10, with price being inflated with color palettes or things you may not want, and most of them aren't even faithful to their source material. Complete ripoff. Especially when MK11 sold you 3 generally good skins, for $6.

STILL no krossplay, in a 2023 game.

Never thought I'd be saying this, but MK is doomed if its headed this direction. Never thought I'd switch over to Street Fighter in my life because of MK being half-baked. I've bought the best editions of every game prior to this, and never regretted it, even in a game's particular lows. But THIS?

Most importantly, the game is LEAPS AND BOUNDS more fun then the previous installment.
---

PROS;
- The most fun MK game since MKX/9. Gameplay is wild and freedom of player expression is on display with the ""Kameo"" system. While neutral/footsies are still important, the overall design of the gameplay system(s) along with the Kameo system makes for a much more engaging and frantic experience.
- While the visual fidelity of the game is ultimately on-par/practically on parity as MK11 purely speaking from a technical standpoint, the art-style/color scheme this game uses is absolutely gorgeous. The one big standout that is certainly better is the lighting used as this is UE4, rather then UE3 as previous NRS titles have been on.
- Easily the best stages NRS has ever designed in any MK game, ever. I'd argue they're some of the best stages in *any* fighting game I've ever played. They're spectacular.
- Strong/Robust initial roster with plenty of fan favorites and some welcome ""new"" additions to the modern era of MK games with some of the 3D characters from Deadly Alliance/Deception. 
- Pretty fantastic musical score. For once, I'm actually interested in the OST in an NRS game. Well done on this front.
- True to NRS form, another good story mode entry. Doesn't take itself too seriously, and is hilarious at various points.
- Invasions mode, allbeit grind-y, is a better/more interesting addition to the single player content in the game rather then the ""Towers of Time"" from MK11.
---

CONS;
- First and foremost being a PC port, this has been hit/miss for many people, and is reflected in the reviews. My experience initially was God-awful and I refunded the game. After 2 days of FOMO (30 year MK fanboy here with the Dragon tattoo.) I was determined to troubleshoot the game and get it functional. I ultimately did. 

YOU MUST ensure your drivers are up-to-date with the latest ""Game Ready Driver"" from nVIDIA (or AMD equivalent.) The game also has some odd frame-pacing/timing issues, regardless of graphical options in-game from all the testing I've done and playtime. To eliminate this issue almost entirely, I used nVIDIA Profile Inspector to ensure Ansel in any/all capacity is completely disabled, FPS locked to 60 (this can be done through the base driver software.) and ensured that FAST VSYNC/GSYNC is enabled. Don't buy into the 60hz refresh rate nonsense you might of read, that makes 0 difference.

In-Game Settings || AMD FSR 1.0 - Quality / All settings Very High/On
i76800K OC'd 4.0/1080 STRIX/32G DDR4-2400

A lot of the issues I've read are actually effecting people with much higher-end hardware then my own. QLOC has acknowledged the performance woes thus far, a patch/update however remains to be seen.

FPS stayed locked at this point to 60 at nearly all times, with only minor hiccups which became very rare. The game *does* pre-cache/cook shaders on initial boot, but it still has some shader hiccups. 

I'm also using Process Lasso to give the game access to as much horsepower as I can to further bolster performance.

Stability has been mostly acceptable in my 25~ hours of playtime with only a few crashes. A few times during invasions, and once during netplay online. I've had 2 8+ hours sessions of playtime with 0 issue thus far.

Lastly on the presentation/performance front - as with MK11 (until it was patched out) menus, cutscenes, fatalities, fatal blows, essentially anything that isn't gameplay with fighting is locked at 30FPS. This is extremely jarring and I'm a little baffled QLOC went this route again on the PC release. This will likely be patched/updated as it was in MK11... I just don't understand why it wasn't designed this way in the first place. Modders are already correcting the FPS for the menus.

- Online in this game is ultimately disappointing and fairly bare bones in it's implementation. Ranked matches FORCE you into playing who the game ultimately matches you against, regardless of their connection type as long as the ping is less then 150ms~. This means, if you're paired against someone on wireless, even if you simply sit at the queue screen and don't accept, the game will eventually *force* you into playing against said player, with no option to decline or back out. You'll also receive a loss if you close the game in the interim/DC if you don't want to play against said player. This is backwards game design. SF doesn't do this. Tekken doesn't do this. GG doesn't do this.

Wireless in fighting games is unacceptable as far as a competitive environment is concerned. If anyone tells you otherwise, they're low in the IQ department. Go purchase an Ethernet cable and wire your setup. It isn't difficult. The netcode in this game is acceptable for people on wired connections but it's not going to do you any favors whatsoever against those on wireless.

NRS - you missed here. This sorely needs to be updated. *no one* likes how you're handling the matchmaking implementation in this game in regards to connection types. Either allow your player base to filter wireless users, or back out of wireless matches.

There are no lobbies as far as casual matches are concerned, or King of the Hill. The game simply performs it's matchmaking query, then connects you to someone. It does have private rooms however for KOTH.

- I'm not a tournament level player of NRS games so perhaps I don't really have any room to complain about this, but this game is *VERY* unfriendly to T/Os looking to run it at their event(s). Save data must be established and story-mode must be completed to unlock Havik, and your profile level must be level 25 to unlock all of the base kameo roster. This is another backwards, out of touch design choice made.

- While there is plenty to unlock in the game from a cosmetics/flare standpoint with skins, color pallets and brutalities, it's still excessively grind-y in NRS fashion and doesn't respect the players time. Hell, using the ""Shrine"" is a practice in time-vampirsm as you can only consume one stack of 1K currency and must wait before you can consume another stack.
---

INDIFFERENT;

- I miss the Krypt.
- The controls in this game like any other NRS titles have that level of ""NRS-Jank"" to them where the input buffer/accuracy is concerned. I don't love it. I don't hate it. The inputs at times however can feel *very* strict.
- Crossplay is missing at launch. For me personally I couldn't care less right now as the online experience is sub-par but this will be a huge miss for a lot of people.
---

Ultimately at the end of the day, this game is leaps and bounds more fun then the previous installment. The Kameo system allows for some awesome player expression, gameplay feels fast and engaging, and the presentation is world-class. It isn't without it's flaws however, with in classic NRS fashion, numerous sub-systems that don't respect the player's time, and a woefully sub-par online experience thus far.

It's also a QLOC PC port, so mileage as evidenced by countless others WILL vary.

If you're a diehard NRS/MK fan like myself and you've got the hardware and some minor PC technical knowledge to combat any issues you might come across, pick it up now. Otherwise, just wait until it's on sale.

If you have a console (baring the SWITCH :kekw:) just get it on console.

Combat mechanics are fluid and intuitive, ensuring that both newcomers and veterans can enjoy the thrill of battle. The character roster is meticulously crafted, offering a diverse range of fighters each with unique styles and moves.

However, there's a significant thing that detracts from the overall experience – the item pricing model. In an unexpected twist, players are required to purchase both fatalities and skins, which are traditionally integral components of the Mortal Kombat experience. This decision not only impacts the game's accessibility but also detracts from the sense of achievement and progression. Unlocking fatalities and skins through gameplay achievements has always been a rewarding aspect of the series, and shifting this to a pay-to-access model feels like a step back from the franchise's player-centric values.",1700678571,1700678571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) I don't know if I didn't search enough and whatnot but comparing to MK11, we can't pick our intro and outro moves or cutscenes), still, correct me if I'm wrong here.

2) Season story is a mess. It needs a total overhaul. Basically you jump into season journey having the narrator explaining the story and then you just walk, fight and loot in a board-game like map which gets really old at a certain point because the story is already told and then it's just a mindless, monotone grind for cosmetics without having any additions to the season story whatsoever.

5) Shrine. The shrine is a place where you can trade some in-game currency for a variety of cosmetics, sure it's good but it takes literally 36,5 hours for it to unlock, what's the problem here ?

6) Kameos. Kameos are okay but a mode without them would be great, I for one am not a fan of Kameos and I rarely used them so far and my games are going great anyway.

7) In invasions which basically is the season thing, there can be some modifiers for the NPC enemy fighter. There's a specific one, the armor which is waaay out of control. Every move, every hit, armor. I swear I played a game with enemy being Sub-Zero with armor and a map modifier for freezing, I didn't move until it was too late, the map literally came into me through the back door. Also the bosses in there, boring. Just a foe with 3 lives and a s**tload of armor.

I like the game so far but I'm not crazy over it like MKX or MK11. You just need to hear out your fan-base to make it a better game. After all, it was meant for us.

P.S: Fix Reptile, and fix Ermac's face before releasing him, like, what is that face lol.

Thanks for your time reading.

One thing I love in this game is the face models for the characters. All of them look amazing. I think we've gotten the best faces for every character in this game. Liu Kang is probably the best looking one as well.
I'm happy they brought back the meter system into the game, very much preferred than the offence and defence bars from 11.
I really do like the story for this game. Not only a reboot, but still a sequel to the previous timeline. What I Love in this game is seeing the recreated origins in different contexts. My favourite would have to be Kenshi's blindness, watching that blindfold slowly tied around his eyes was awesome! Kenshi's relationship with Johnny is still the best in the franchise, from MK X all the way to MK 1. Many characters were once evil are now with the good guys. A sight to behold!
Gameplay is the same to me other than the inputs for moves and the return of the meter system. I love it all the same however.
I do prefer the the customisation in this game for than MK11. Having a skin and one item for good for me. MK11 Had three items you could change, with many characters a third item seemed almost pointless to change. But here in MK1 just one item looks better.
I will say the soundtrack is as always the best. I think for this game the soundtrack fits so perfectly. A game set in peace, yet the hint of danger or mysterious malice at hand. Listening to it brings peace of mind while going through the menu.
Jean-Claude Van Damme being in the game as a Johnny Cage skin is by far the best choice Netherrealm have made for Johhny Cage! Giving him a skin of the man who inspired the character AND wearing the attire from the movie that Started the very inspiration of the Mortal Kombat franchise as a whole! Always loved Van Damme and to have him in the game Voiced by the man himself is a dream come true! A prize over 30 years in the making finally came!
The voice acting is incredible, both new and returning voices. Everyone plays their part Very in character and bring them all to life in All the right ways! Megan Fox however has me conflicted. Her acting in Mortal Kombat 1 sounds almost lifeless. You especially hear the difference when she speaks just before or just after another character speaks. But I don't hate Megan Fox for it, there should have been a direction to point her towards to win a better audience for this game. It confuses me more than anything since Megan Fox has been in voice acting roles before and she sounds just fine, but here she sounds like she's simply reading the lines from the paper and that's it. Strange but not a deal breaker for me.

I absolutely Love Mortal Mortal 1 and can't wait for the DLC packs to arrive overtime. The game had a great story, soundtracks designs and overall aesthetics! Cannot wait for another game in the next 4 years!
Highly Recommended to try for all fighting game fans.",1697235227,1700639557,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

The story of the game is quite fun and is over 4 hours of cut scenes. Like 11, it felt like a movie with parts I get to play. The timeline reset story is fine and I enjoy most of the characters and how they are portrayed. I do miss the conflicts and changes of sides during the previous on going story line. Starting at the beginning again means some characters will be missing from the roster. No Noob Sibot, No robo smoke or Sub-Zero and several more. But the beauty of starting over allows for new ways to introduces those characters. speaking of introducing characters there are ZERO new characters as of currently. The only hope we have is for DLC to bring in new characters but I would assume they would use that for third party characters like Omni-man and bringing in characters that didn't make it in on release like Ermac and Quan Chi whom by the way are fully put together, working characters that are in the story mode but are not playable. Also on the character front, say good-bye to some of your favs because they have been pushed aside as 'Kameo' characters, who you pick along side your playable character who can be used for small boosts, hits and combos but have no use as characters otherwise. The list includes Jax, Sonya, Kano, Sektor, Cyrax, Motaro and frickin' GORO, and more. What makes little sense is that some of the Kameo characters are also playable, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Kung Lao all have both Kameo and Playable character fighters. I'm so bummed that I cant play some of my favorites now that they have been demoted to kameo characters. Mortal Kombat 11 had 25 playable characters on launch while Mortal Kombat 1 has 23 playable characters and 16 wasted Kameo characters. I can only hope they will add some of them as both Kameo and playable. Also characters I hope for are maybe coming based on rumors like Cassie Cage and Noob Sibot but no confirmation. You can also say good-bye to the possibility of the Kollecter being playable, as he is the shop merchant in the story game mode invasions. At the very end of the story *SPOILERS* Liu Kang brings in other elder god, time lords from other timelines to fight off the army of Shang Tsung's time lords and undead foes. during this segment and ensuing fights there are all kinds of characters that we will never get to play who have full move sets, Like a female version of Kano or a merge between Sub-Zero and Scorpion a Sonya who uses Kitana's blades and MANY MANY MORE! Its like they're teasing us with custom characters and playable fighters who we will never get to play. That is unless they add any of this in the future. We can hold out hope I guess.

I know I've talked a lot of negative but there is also a lot to love about this game. Its plays well, combos are fun to pull off, hearing people rage into their microphones when I win. Just some of the few things you can love about this game. Again the story is super entertaining and friendly to old and new Mortal Kombat players alike. And with the story ending in a large cliff hanger (where Jax is missing his arms, very cool) who knows if we'll see more in a DLC or free update. I have high hopes for the future of MK1. Started rocky but a possible uphill climb to perfection.

So at the start of a season, you're facing all the elder gods getting back up.. So don't even bother playing ranked for the first week of reset unless you want to get obliterated by neckbeards. 

There's some input issues where SOMETIMES it'll hit a different button.. There's some weird lag that happens, even in single player so that doesn't make sense. For some reason, they added Omni-Man AND they're gonna add homelander as well.. Which they are basically the same shit, except omni man doesn't have laser eyes. 

They still haven't fixed Sindel's infinite exploit where she just butt rapes you in a corner until you're dead.

You're forced to play kids who have third world country internet in ranked without the option to decline based on ping.. So you'll have to fight some shitter that has 200+ ping for rank..

I would not suggest buying this game until they put out a performance patch because the game plays like literal dog shit. They rushed tf out of this game and you can definitely feel it.

I don't know why I thought performance would be the same as a PS5's. Now, I'm no PC master race enthusiast; I only have a Steam Deck to play this game on, but 30 FPS is very annoying! The loading times make grinding for kameo XP feel longer than on the PS5. The invasions section would very often crash. The seasonal tower would glitch at the end where after the ""Finish Him!"" came on and I executed the final hit, somehow the match would continue. Since the timer was already stopped, there was nothing for me to do other than exit out of the match and lose my tower progress. Sometimes even doing long combos would cause the game to freeze, meaning that I had to force shutdown the game. Also, the graphics would sometimes drop to the point where I thought I was playing the Switch version of the game!

Let me shove the pens of the writing team up their asses. Being this clueless and directionless requires an immeasurable amount of special effort.

Then, second of all, the main villain of the story (Shang Tsung) is a pre-order dlc which is also later purchasable. Alright... Not new. They did the same trick twice in a row, huh? Old habits die hard.
Ermac, one of the helpers of Shang Tsung, will come along with Kombat Pack. Okay.
Havik, a returning character afters a decade or so, who is also included in the story is also a DLC character and does not even unlocked with the kombat pack. As far as I know neither Shang Tsung or Havik should be unlockable in-game.
And then, Takeda out of nowhere.
And of course, 3 popular superheroes in one single DLC pack to milk them effectively. Feels (thematically) ironic. Where is Injustice when you badly need it? 

This amount of greed... It just cannot be understood. Whole new cameo system with a random bullshit go roster. I do not believe it adds much depth into the game. Incredibly awful final boss, incredibly awful last chapter which acts like it was a fanfic of a kindergarten kid who combines his fav. characters into one single being. 4 years later we are still struggling with this whole multiverse and alternate timelines shit. Invasions are unintuitive and incredibly repetitive. Why does it even last a month? 5 hours of shit content. I'd rather have a battle sim and let it play itself lmao. Skins are god awful. Would not spend a dime on them. 
Just fuck off. Where'd you learn to be this sob netherrealm? As long as they insist on not making IJ3 and keep milking MK, I am simply out. I was angry with MK11 already but this game is outright disgracious. Even a soft reboot cannot save the franchise. All they do is cutting and adding characters back and forth until it stop making sense at all. It's a loop, it's a nightmare. The game's forgotten in a span of a week. SF6 torn it apart, simply and beatifully. 

7/10, for the animation and visual team.


Footnote: I am well aware that many of the fighting games do these 'dlc tricks' but since when it became an exact norm to sell/give as a pre-order bonus the characters where they use them in story actively. It's impossible to not grow sick of these antics. Reserve the DLCs for guest characters and legacy characters that are not in the game. Takeda is acceptible in that sense although him as a choice does not make sense to me. Everything else is ridiculous so far.",1695398846,1700623803,False,13,2,0.546579837799072266,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Visuals are nice and the fighting feels fluent. Story was nice and the fights were relatively easy. I like that you can unlock premium shop cosmetics if they are inside of the Shrine. Remote play is nice especially with friends who are less fortunate that do not own the game/pc/steamdeck. I CAN GAMBLE INT HE SHRINE!!1!!!!1!

Cons: 
I do not think that it is worth $70 at any means especially since it has micro-transactions. The Kombat Pack is cool sure, but it should not be more than half of the price of the game especially if there are going to be 2 of them. DLC characters that are available are released to the Kombat Pack early for anyone that had bought it and they can be used online before being released as single DLC purchases. A lot of stuff is overpriced.

""The Bads""
To get them out of the way, the recent prices of skins in microtransacations has been nothing short of terrible. To pay 10 dollars for one skin is a ridiculous amount of money to anyone, and I hope this part of the review ages poorly and they fix it in the future. Customization now is also a giant step down from the last game, with only one customization gear piece and roughly three skins per character you can get for free. Its simply a bad system and I hope in the next game, they can fix it.

""The Goods""
This game has to have one of the best storymodes in any Mk game. Not only is it written well with great homages to the past while also being extremely welcoming to new players, but it also fixes problems with both the last game while improving on characters like Reptile and Baraka who have had less than favorable times in the MK story before this. The twist was something I genuinely didn't see coming, and offers an ultimate bit of fanservice.

This game also just might have the best gameplay since MKX. While it doesn't outright beat MKX in terms of fun fast gameplay, it still offers a lot of strategy and setplay using the brand new Kameo system. Having a set of new moves you can swap between with any Kameo can make characters be played completely differently depending on the kameo you have. Matches can be fun and intense and offer a deep sense of unique gameplay, something that was missed in MK11.

Overall, while the weakness are definite, the main gameplay and story truly make it a fantastic package. I highly recommend this game with an 8/10, I really hope they fix the skin price issue, and I can't wait to see the future seasons of DLC!",1700614114,1700614114,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I'm not feeling too positive about it right now because the Invasions mode, meant for people who like fighting but not PvP, isn't done well. Also, it costs a lot for what you get. I might change my mind later and give it a good review.

Invasions sounded good in theory, but how it actually works isn't great. You can easily speed through it by putting all your points into attack and special abilities, making it too easy. Except for a few tough boss fights, it's a breeze.

Two big problems really bug me about this game: the long wait times when loading and the micro transactions. Even on a decent computer, I had to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes just to start playing. When Invasions are already too easy, this waiting makes the game not fun. Waiting a minute for a short 25-second battle feels frustrating.

For a Mortal Kombat fan this is amazing, for a casual enjoyer who wants to get the bang for their buck wait until changes are made.",1700603095,1700603095,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, I will start with the graphics:

- The graphics of the game are generally much better on the faces and face animations are better than before!
But the biggest improvement in the game's graphics are the game's animations, which I think have become much better than 11

- Smooth and natural motion captures are done in the best way
In terms of execution, the game does not have any stutters (I am playing without the day one patch and this patch has not been released for PC yet (first day of early access), the configuration of my rig is 11 gen i5 , GTX 1650 and 16 gigs of ram.
On 1080p resolution, medium and FSR 2.0 quality, I get between 48 and 60 frames depending on the game location, and of course, the majority of the game is the 50fps and above, and the game runs very cleanly, and I did not see any stutters, bugs, or lags. 

- The graphical arts of the game are awesome.


- In terms of story, I have been playing for about three hours
So far, I think it is more interesting than Kombat X and 11


- The cut-scenes and filming have become much, much better.
One of the faults that I personally had for 11 was the terrible filming in the cut-scenes.

- In the voice department, I must say that it is very perfect and I did not see any special defects in it

- In the fight itself, the characters talk to each other and sing to each other, and we don't see repetitive dialogue anymore.

- The music of the game awesome, and each stage has its own music, which is very pleasant.


But The Gameplay itself:
So far, I have seen a smooth renders and smooth fighting.
In terms of gameplay speed, the game is something between 11 and X, I think, it is not as tactical as 11 and not as aggressive and fast as X. and I really haven't gotten used to the cameo system yet, the combos are easier to hit compared to 11 and are much smoother and so on. The characters have many different techniques. 


- And lastly I still don't have an opinion to compare MK 1 with the Street Fighter 6 and I have to play more to give an opinion.",1700599546,1700599546,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

-invasion movement, fatalities, intros, outros, are locked at 30 FPS.
-since release, the developers are focused more on adding microtransactions than patching the game. Patches supposedly fixed some problems if you check the official patch notes but from my point of view, a lot of bugs appeared after patching. I have mixed feelings on this point because, on the one hand we have patch notes that are extensive, but I have been playing this game since its release and I wouldn't say that anything has been fixed. I experience the same bugs and even more, not to mention that we still have a 30 FPS lock. :(
-unlike MK 11, micropayment currency cannot be earned in-game, you can unlock some of it by grinding levels for your characters, but compared to the prices in the premium shop you can't buy much with it. And of course, taking into account the grinding time, once you collect it, the item will no longer be available in the store. Prepare real money.
-the content of this game is a complete joke. It constitutes maybe 20% of the mk 11 content. But don't worry, the creators have already added some outfits/fatalities for micropayments. 1000 Dragon Crystals for one outfit, so about 10 $ if I calculated correctly.
-invasion seasons, forcing you to grind extremely hard because, after it ends, items from the invasion shop will no longer be available for unlocking. For now it looks like this, we have an invasion season that lasts 30-40 days. During this time, we go through the invasion zones to reach the last boss whom we defeat to unlock 1 ""unique"" outfit, color palettes for it and palettes for other ""standard"" outfits. Unlocking palettes for standard outfits involves an incredible grind for silver, which can then be redeemed in the seasonal shop. After the first season, I managed to unlock all palettes and I was still grinding for silver to have it for the next season. Then game's creators decide to clear all the players' ""savings"" from the first season. Great !!!!
-invasions are extremely tiring due to enemy modifiers such as shields - especially for bosses, burning floors, life draining, blinding, etc. It is also worth mentioning survival games, where the difficulty increased significantly in the second season. Invasions do not have a difficulty level, so if we get stuck at one point, we will not proceed further, and therefore we will not unlock anything This applies to players who are taking their first steps in fighting games or are simply not skilled at it. In this game there is no auxiliary AI that we send to get a reward like in MK 11.
-each character has something like a mastery tree where we gain experience, unlock new levels that give us new color palettes, and a few items to change the appearance of our character. The experience grind for the characters is out of this world and the rewards compared to the grind are worth nothing !!!!!
-during season two, the developers decided to reduce the amount of silver and experience awarded by increasing the grind.
-outfits from the first season appeared in the store. Reducing the amount of silver earned by a player in season two will lead to an increase in the percentage of players who will not have time to grind out all the outfits. Then this will force them to buy the outfits from the store. Special thanks to the creators !!!!
-the Kamo system is overrated as hell. These are nothing more than boosters taken from MK 11 and formed into a rooster, only worse in terms of the actions and attacks they perform.

To sum up, for 110 $ we get a game with microtransactions, small amount of content and insane big grind for minimal rewards. It's a pity because the gameplay is quite nice. In my opinion, this part of Mortal Kombat is simply a rip-off for fans of the series and new players. A lot was promised, and in fact, we players paid a lot and we were given some onion peels.

One thing you'll be happy to know is that the real money shop works perfectly and gets updated regularly with $12 fatalities.  By the time all the characters are released, I'll probably have $200+ in this game and it's not worth it.  The only way to justify the predatory microtransactions would be to make the game free to play, but it's a $70 title, more expensive than competitors will better games right now.  

NRS/WB hasn't shown much effort in addressing the community's problem so I'm starting to lose hope that the game will be brought up to the standards of other games in the fighting game genre.

Pros:
Improved air combat from previous games.
Returning of old characters from the early 2000s.
Fresh new beginning for the story.
Excellent character choices for Kombat Pack 1.
Improved on Scorpion's ""GET OVER HERE!"" since it was quiet in MK11. Along with giving him a rope spear.
Shao and Geras are not as annoying to me unlike the last game.
Invasions are a breath of fresh air, but they're alright as a game mode.

Cons:
Currently the PC port has a locked frame cap at just 30 fps outside of fighting gameplay.
Microtransactions.
Megan Fox's voice acting for Nitara.
Havik as a purchasable character despite you can just play the story and get him for free.
Shang Tsung still being behind a paywall.
EVERYONE online keeps playing as Smoke, Raiden, Baraka, Geras, or Johnny Cage.
Sub-Zero was nerfed so badly a 10 hit kombo could deal like 1%.
Having cosmetics for fighters at an average of 10 USD.
Standard edition costing $70 dollars. Loving 2023!

Mainly because the lack of content, bugs, lack of quality of life features, and microtransactions. I will go into more detail in this review. That being said, I've had a lot of fun playing all the characters in this game! Honestly I've never tried so many characters in a fighting game like I did in this one. With maybe Sub-Zero being the most boring one to play. Let's go ahead and start with the ""Story Mode"".

-STORY MODE-
- To no surprise, Netherealm Studios is known to make the best stories in the fighting game genre. You get to connect with most of the cast as they journey together to participate in the Mortal Kombat tournament which is only hosted once every century. MK1 starts off after the end of the ""Aftermath"" story in MK11 with a cinematic approach. The store puts focus on developing it's characters in Liu Kang's new timeline. Having talented voice actors, and stunt performers on the fighting choreography of the game. The MK1 story is of good quality, with the story falling off a bit towards the end. If I were to compare the story to MK11, I would most certainly say that the MK11 fighting choreography was much more entertaining. MK1 has more focus on developing the rosters story more than the fighting. Makes sense, being that this is KIND OF a new start but the fighting choreography was till good.

- I do have some complaints about the direction of some of the characters, like Shang Tsung. In this story, Shang Tsung is not as intimidating as he is in MK11. He's a lot more soft and fruity. Lacking the brutality of how he was previously. I didn't like this direction for the character, it made him a less compelling villain than how he was in MK11. Perhaps the director was just trying to appeal to a particular audience by making him... colorful without the extra color. One could imagine, being that nowadays we are surrounded by a generation full of leftist influencers that are much like the Mileena fans who will try to kill you like poor Kenshi in the story. Mostly virtually and anonymously at least. Or perhaps the director willingly made Shang Tsung a less intimidating character. Now speaking of... it is almost as if today's Disney made changes to the story and some of it's characters. With the new timeline being used to make the changes on how those characters are.

Also Mileena is not really Mileena anymore, not that I am a Mileena fan but I will miss her former self... Part of why I liked her so much was because of her seductive essence, her ability to fool you with her body language and her ways to make her voice sound seductive, only to spook you once she takes off her mask where you're like ""Woah!  Eww nevermind!"". Gonna miss her teases like ""wanna have fun?"" and the guys are like ""oh no... no no no. I'm good""

Still... cool story! 7/10 Yes! 7 because there's way too many multiverse movies. It's so saturated now that I was about to give it a 6 on the ""story mode"" or even a 5. It's so much like Marvel that it was almost like watching another Marvel movie.

-VERSUS MODES- 
- Online! We are missing A LOT of stuff and we are talking quality of life stuff even. Like Match History, Online Modes, Report System, Hide Selection option, Mute on Select Screen, Practice mode, Practice Mode on KOTH, Mute Self on KOTH, emojis and text chat for KOTH, Crossplay, Lobbies, and Friends List for those who want to play with their friends on Epic Games and potentially others like PlayStation and Xbox. Yeah! It sucks! But fighting against other players is probably one of the better experiences in the game after completing ""Story Mode"". That is until you come across a Sindel with an unblockable infinite combo with Jax or whatever. Even so! Online is the only mode you can play right now where you can enjoy a more dynamic gameplay experience! Since we barely got any modes anyway. 4/10 what happened here?

-INVASION-
- Want palettes for your skins? Seasonal Premiere skin? Titan Skins? You play THIS! Invasion mode... The most BORING monotonous mode in the game that you only play cause you really want that premiere skin. And the grind is absolutely dreadful... You have to go through 5 full mesa maps just to get to the premiere skin in the 6th map and then complete a series of other lame unrewarding fights with the occasional secret fights that get in your way. This mode made me feel so bored of Mortal Kombat that I don't believe I can tolerate it enough to get through the upcoming seasonal premiere skins. This is the ""Towers of Times"" rewards replacement of MK11. And the actual ""towers of time"" are on their own Mesa Map as well. And... I don't seem to get anything interesting in those either. Titan skins are obtained on the Armageddon Mesa and it pops up randomly and it's suppose to only last 4 or 5 days, but it's bugged so it lasts longer than that.  Fighting a large Baraka while he spins at you all crazy, is a bit funny.  Invasion Rating is a 2/10  for me.

-TOWERS-
Well... It's just classic tower mode, nothing special to it.

-MONETIZATION-
- This is $70 game to over $110 if you got the premium edition and you're telling me that we have a store with some expensive exclusive items as if this was a F2P game?! This is was obviously a terrible idea! I do not support it, and I suggest you don't as well but if you want to see something like that added in future games in this fashion, that's up to you. I will buy nothing from the store cause it's obviously greedy Bull Shih-Tzu... wtf dude 1/10, WB games is trash for that.

-CONTENT-
- Barely any modes. Only Story, Versus, Invasion, and Practice (or impossible combo mode) 

-CONTENT THAT'S NOT IN MK1
No Tag Team, No KOTH Survival, No Co-op Tag Team towers or Co-op Tag Team vs Other players, No modifier game modes for versus and online, no group battle, no konquest mode, no elemental reaction mode, no party modes.  Lack of finishers, No Frienship, No Stage Fatalities, No interactable brutalities, no Fatal Blow animation kustomize options which sucks cause a lot of the Fatal Blows are nowhere near as cool as in MK11. Fatal Blows are now like you go punch face, now I punch face... Look up Shang Tsung fatal blow in MK11. Gimme something stylish NRS.

-ENDING-
Hope this helps on your decision in making a purchase. The game is fun to play, but I suggest you wait until the price drops. $70 is way too much for what it offers... If you want a more complete game with less bugs, try out Street Fighter 6.

[Old Review]
As someone that is new to the mortal kombat series, this game has greatly exceeded my expectations. The gameplay is smooth and fast paced. Much more than mk11 which I felt was a little too slow for me. Another great improvement are the graphics. It's way more prettier and brighter than mk11's dark, gloomy, edgy graphics. I would argue this is the most PRETTIEST fighting game I have ever played in my life and it's previous iterations. Story mode is also great as it's like watching a movie.

#23 is Shang Tsung- A pre-order bonus despite being a central character in the main game ($8 if you missed your chance). #24 and 25 are Ermac and Quan Chi- Fully implemented, fully completed, featured side characters in the story that you face more than once. They will be in Kombat pack 1 ($40).

We are fast approaching the logical conclusion of Warner Brothers bs and I am not thrilled at how normalized this behavior is becoming. AAA games are officially $70... fine, it can't be helped. But to ride the standardized price raise while being more aggressive with the nickel/dime tactics is just insulting.

Of course everyone is ranting about WB charging for silly, unnecessary fatalities. And I even felt pity when someone did that fatality on me cause I felt really sad thinking ""poor guy, he has spent 10 dollars, he has to do it"". But I really want to address gameplay and balancing:

- When almost EVERYONE you play against online uses the SAME character (Johnny Cage) and with the SAME kameo it gets tiring. This also happened with the mass of Scorpions in MK 11. It seems like everyone chooses the character/kameo combination with the longest combos just to win, or at least they watch who the pros play with, copy their combos and do the same thing. If everyone decides to choose the best character, with the best strategy, then that is actually bad design: barely no one uses Tanya, Sindel, Rain, Ashrah or Kung Lao. If they choose the other characters, prepare to see the same combo over and over again. There were lots of times that I won against Johnny Cage players, or Raiden, or Baraka/Cyrax, but it didn't feel rewarding at all to win in those cases: it made me feel exhausted, and not wanting to go through the same ordeal again

- Netcode works REALLY bad: my character (mainly Sindel) kept doing things online which I specifically haven't asked, making me doubt that my controller wasn't working correctly or that I was not pressing the right buttons. But then I realized that when the ping was lower, I was able to play correctly. And I didn't have those issues when practicing or playing the towers

- Kameos are a lazy Tag system that is poorly balanced. They had a similar kameo system in the Towers of Time in MK 11 and for some reason they thought it would be a good idea, but nothing is better than tag combat as in MK 9: the combos were limited and you could tag whenever you want if you wanted to change your strategy. I feel like this is like having some extra special moves added to your own character. It doesn't even make sense story-wise

- Combos are VERY repetitive and extremely long and boring: it's annoying for both players to wait for the other to finish their 20 hits combo, to make a mistake and then see the exact same combo. Instead of making players be creative, it restricts everyone to choose the best strategy and use that same thing each time. Also, the animations in some cases are so long that they affect the dynamics of the combat itself: you have to wait for the other to see a combo or for the fatal blow to end to keep playing, as if you are watching a cinematic. I think they should include a system like ""Maximum Damage"" from MK 4, limit the amount of hits or damage per combo, add systems like stamina or maybe increase the difficulty of extending a combo after a certain time.

- There are no rewards for taking major risks during battles: it seems that if you make a mistake, you are bound to see a minute-long combo while realizing that your meter is slowly increasing. You can only break from a combo after your meter is full, but that will happen after the combo ends. So am I supposed to carefully control my meter and not use it to enhance special moves? I thought I didn't like the two-meter system from MK11, but seeing this I realize that it was much better as it separated attack and defense. Also, the meter fill rate should be higher after a certain number of hits. It seems like the game is made not to let the other play, but to play alone.

Overall, I loved it and played a lot, probably due to nostalgia and fanaticism, but the gameplay imbalance, with the addition of bugs, poor ping, bad netcode and lousy monetization and economy decisions (I lost count of how many currencies you can manage in the play, and how some are really unnecessary and inflationary) make me not recommend MK 1, at least until they fix it properly.

Positives:
+ Kitana has the best bakery in all of NetherRealm
+ Fighting is phenomenal
+ Graphics/sound are perfection
+ Base roster (playable and kameo) is pretty solid for the most part

- Premium fatalities cost real money, super scummy microtransations
- Invasions are lame and a significant downgrade from the Krypt
- Quan Chi and Ermac are in campaign but we have to wait for them to release on a kombat pack. That's complete nonsense
- Questionable DLC character choices (if data miners are to believed)

My main annoyance with this game is the seasonal bull crap (apparently seasonal stuff will return so it's not as bad when it comes to you only have X amount of time to do everything since it will return. But still it's basically do the same thing for every season). So they have a game mode thing that the closest thing that came to my mind is Mario Party. Basically they have 6 maps filled with dots that are different activities but you are given lines you have to follow and complete a node before going to the next one (you have to complete the boss of each map to get to the next one). The biggest pain in the butt with this is the map has random scenery that blocks the view not allowing you to see some paths. Also they block off paths with dumb hints on how to unlock them (like one of them that I looked up online is Fengjian Village Klue the clue they give you is ""Klue: ESDORYT TEH DWLOR"" Solution: Destroy The World Solve: Use Cyrax Kameo finisher Annihilation to win the fight). One annoying thing is there are areas on the map that require an item to unlock which apparently you get the item after getting to the end of the seasonal mission (have to beat the final boss then go back through every mission again to fight more difficult versions of the characters you have been fighting the entire time in order to get the last bits of loot).

On gameplay the kameos are dumb. Basically 15 characters that you just call in to do an attack, counter/block an attack or they have their own fatalities. You cannot play as any of them but only 3 of them are different versions of playable characters (Sub-Zero, Scorpion and Kung Lao). Hopefully one day we will get the rest in game as actual playable characters but who knows. Also in combat there are dumb things like when an enemy glows white they're invulnerable and when they're blue they take more damage. The issue with this is they somehow spam the glow white attacks/abilities to then make it that you're fighting a tank which is frustrating/annoying to say the least. Also they have a lethal attack or whatever where whenever an enemy or you get low on health you can do a lethal attack which obliterates the victim's health bar if it hits. The issue with this is when the enemy ai do it it's completely random, annoyingly hard to block and takes out about/over half your health.

On character design I think the only really bad one was Tanya. She went from straight hair with white eyes in every other game to now a weird haircut and regular eyes. They did make several of the female characters uglier than their designs from previous games (like Tanya and Li Mei).

Also it seems like they're just using the same few outfits over and over again. Like last season they had them in more fire based colors/effects and now they are more blood colors/effects. But most characters have like 3 outfits the starting one, another one which I don't remember when/where you get and the final cool one which you can get early through invasions or I believe you get it through leveling up the character. From what I can tell really cool/interesting outfits are stuck in the premium store (some outfits with cool effects or old outfits... not sure how many there are since I have only seen 3 and they have a stupid rotating store aka you see one outfit for some amount of time then it's gone until it rotates back in).



Biggest issue is this game needs to be online and connected to servers for a majority of the content.... so I started changing/writing this when I lost connection in the middle of an invasion. What happened was I went into my ""inventory"" to change my Kameo back to a character I was working on or something and now i get ""There was an error contacting the Mortal Kombat TM  1 Server. If you exit now you will lose any unsaved changes. Do you still wish to exit?"" When I started playing this also seemed to be an issue which diudn't allow me to enter Invasions or go to their stupid Shrine. The Shrine is also annoying because it's where you spend Koins to get random loot (images, music and cosmetics for characters). It's annoying because you can only buy 1 at a time and have to watch a dumb animation every time. Last time I used it I had like 15,000 Koins.... it costs 1,000 koins to buy something and I had to sit there for several minutes watching the same animation 15 times. Also going off of the watching stuff every time I wish could skip the short cutscene after every fight where it's just your character doing the same thing every time.",1695430965,1700267087,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At ""Early"" launch, the game was unbearable and almost unplayable. Took around a month to receive an update to fix the issues but also not fix them cause they are still present now in some fashions. Be it random crashes, poor connections in supposedly ""good"" connection lobbies, move list being incomplete or missing details or wrong information provided, the Player 1 and 2 hitbox/HurtBox bug (Giving Player 1 the advantage), Invasions Crashing, Stages crashing (Mainly Tea House Day Time and Tarkoton Colonie maps), Missing subtitles, Story mode bugs and crashes. Hot mess at launch, after a month a lot of improvements but a lot of damage was already done and in addition with the improvements brought more problems. Still crashes randomly, still missing information, connection issues, list goes on.
Aside from the buggy release and still buggy presence, we now reach the other problems with the game, False Advertisement's, Overpriced DLC's, Overpriced Micro-transactions for In-Game items, Overpriced event/seasonal themed game play items (Halloween Fatality's and ect. as of current), Invasions Mode being awful to play, Invasions Mode holding players hostage to unlock seasonal event cosmetics through absurd EXP grinding to progress through the game mode, still missing or misleading information in game be it in the move list or other areas of the game, misleading information and advertisement of the game itself (Worse for the Nintendo Switch Player's with what they had to deal with).
This is after just the first big update, where are we at after today's big update on 11/15/2023? Not much improvement aside from more poor balancing tactics and finally almost 2 months or basically 2 months they corrected more move list information. Otherwise they still haven't addressed or done anything about the across the board general EXP problems, and they made exp worse in Invasions Mode for Invasions EXP hence why it feels like I am taken hostage when wanting to unlock stuff in the game. I as a casual player feel taken hostage and advantage of when it comes to the Invasions Mode as it is enforcing even more of my time with a mode that's filled with nothing but un-fun, annoying game play gimmicks, enforcing me to grind money, grind exp, this game has more grinding than some JRPG's I have played in the past year but at least with a RPG/JRPG at least the grind is rewarding and depending on said grind can be fun. Invasions is what a lot of this game circles around for its content and player expected game time to go and it is miserable, if I could get every penny back I have spent on the game and within, I would but unfortunately can't.
My recommendation, avoid this game entirely OR if you really want it, wait till its like 50% off or more on everything as nothing involving this game is worth it's price, or earned it's price. $70 USD for mediocre at best game, $110 USD for a mediocre game and a season pass, $40 USD for a Season Pass where nearly half it's content clearly was supposed to be in the base game but was made dlc instead, $8 USD for a character who should of been base game (especially since you play as him during the story mode) and a character is not worth 8 bucks on its own, $8 USD to unlock an existing character in the game to avoid playing the story mode, and another 20$ USD to unlock the 5 locked Cameo characters. Lastly another $5 USD for some in-game currency and a couple recolors themed around Season 1's Invasions theme and is a 1 time application.",1700114968,1700114968,False,8,0,0.532442748546600342,0,True,False,False

I was hyped and hopeful for the first month about what was to come. In the second month, I became tentative and nervous. Now I find myself disheartened. They are selling a premium priced game that has all the micro-transactions of a FTP game. And it is going to get worse. The CEO of WB has stated they want more money for everything. He didn't hint about it, he didn't use some mixed message coding in his speech - he straight out said that they want more money for everything they add to the game. They are selling fatalities now! The hallmark - the trademark of MK is up for sale - $10 for a ""holiday"" fatality. It's a sad day when I have to leave a negative review on MK - I grew up playing the very first one in the arcade, and now it seems they killed it with the appropriately named MK1. It started at one and it has now ended at one as well. 
I cannot recommend anyone buy this game nor any other WB property going forward since they have said this is the direction they want to go with all of their major titles - MK, DC, Harry Potter and Game of Thrones.

Core gameplay is smooth and fun, probably the best of the NRS era

The bad:
Outrageously predatory macrotransactions. A full priced game where any decent new content is gated behind $10+ dollar purchases. They only release recolored palettes for free in updates, anything thats a new skin (and they purposely withheld decent skins for this and launched mediocre base skins on many characters) is $10 for a single character.

This cannot be tolerated. Unless they make dragon kyrstals a resource you can obtain via gameplay that doesn't have a cap, it's unacceptable to gate any decent new content in a game that released with hardly any content behind large additional cash purchases. A typical new skin is 1000 krystals. In the game you can earn 500 for beating campaign the first time (easiest path), which is now half a skin. Then if you get your profile level up to 100 (lets say about 60-100 hours of gameplay) you get 600 more. All that gets you one skin. The remaining finite krystals you can earn is 200 per launch roster character, which there are 23 of (they also lied in a pregame video that there would be 24). So that's 4600, but to get those is an immeasurable grind, likely several hundred hours of specific grinding. In the end all that will net you 5,700 krystals and you will never earn anymore. They're already released more skins than you could buy with that. Skins used to come with Kombat Packs or be sold in sets of multiples for $5 and be infinitely earnable through gameplay grind.

I pre-ordered the game because I've always had a good experience with the prior Mortal Kombat entries, but this release has changed my mind.",1700009362,1700009878,False,4,1,0.512483179569244385,0,True,False,False

Il problema più grande di tutti sono i prezzi assurdi nel premium shop le skin non vengono più date come ricompense praticamente, ma sono bloccate dietro pagamento, le skin che si possono ottenere sono solo palette diverse di skin già esistenti da inizio gioco.

The story mode is a cinematic odyssey that explores the depths of our struggles and rivalries, adding layers to the Mortal Kombat lore that even Raiden couldn't have foreseen.

The gameplay, my brethren, is a sublime dance of combat. The controls respond with the precision required to execute a flawless victory, and the combos flow like the fires of the Netherrealm. The essence of Mortal Kombat is preserved, and yet, new mechanics breathe fresh fire into the fray, creating a scorching experience for players old and new.

Online multiplayer, my allies, is where the true test of strength lies. Engage in battles across realms with warriors from every corner of Earthrealm and beyond. The netcode ensures a seamless experience, allowing you to 'Get Over Here!' and face opponents as if they were standing right in front of you.

Visual is a masterpiece that brings each fighter to life with an intensity that would make even the Netherrealm shudder. The details in my iconic spear toss and Sub-Zero's chilling maneuvers are so vivid, it's like watching our battles play out in a realm beyond the realms. The arenas are more dynamic than ever, and the flames of our eternal rivalry have never burned brighter.

For those who have been with me since the beginning and for those stepping into the arena for the first time, this game is a scorching testament to the legacy of Mortal Kombat. 'Finish Him!'—or her—because this is a kombat experience not to be missed!

Just finished the story. It's kinda disappointing because the villains were all the same and some sort of cliche. It's fun though seeing different form of villains mixed up such as Mileena as Quan Chi variant. It's kinda funny though.

You either release the game for free and have the free to play cash shop model or you sell the game for $110 and have everything in game able to be unlocked reasonably.

I cannot recommend this game for a simple reason. NRS is charging $70 for this game. $110 for those of us who bought the premium edition. This is a AAA Title being sold at the new inflated full price. Despite that they've gutted the game of content and are selling that back to you piecemeal through a cash shop at premium prices. Tired of uninspired palette swaps for scorpion? Well spend $10 on this single skin where he actually looks different. Want an extra fatality? $12 dollars. If you bought a single skin at that price for every character you'd spend more than twice the cost of the game for a drop in the bucket's worth of content that MK11 would have had for free.

This game is predatory and it shouldn't be accepted. The original MK is the game that got me into gaming and it's such a shame to see it devolve into a disgusting example of the problem with the gaming industry of today. The foundation of this game is solid but everything else around it is lackluster because they pulled nearly everything worth getting from the game and slapped it into the cash shop. This is why they got rid of the kypt. Why spend koins to unlock content when you can spend cash.

I wanted to highlight what I thought were some legitimate strengths and weaknesses of this game. I had a lot to say, and I was taking a large chunk of my own time to say it right.

Then they dropped a ten-dollar fatality and my 25+ year MK veteran ass said “Why bother? Why waste the time?” I’m so tired my brothers and sisters. I’m so done. Ultra condensed version of the review coming your way.

I kinda love this game. I love the lore. I loved the story. It was better than most. I didn’t mind most of the changes. It was more fun than not. As a fan, I was very pleased.  I genuinely geeked out on the last chapter and played it over an over. 

I don’t play online. I’m that guy. I know that’s a decent chunk of the game, and I know I’m paying money to not use that feature. I’m fine with that. I look forward to the other things that give the game it’s replay value.

In MK1, those other things are the Invasion Mode. And that Invasion Mode was built at the intersection of janky and broken. (I swear, I spent no extra time on that quip. It just came off the top of my head. That one’s free. Unlike most content in this game.) It’s passable. I play it. It’s still broken. It’s repetitive and things just don’t work. The last season’s tower had you grinding for an hour then getting nothing for your effort because you lost a Test Your Might at the top. Insulting and time wasting. This season is a new flavor of broken. Still. It’s passable and fixable.

There's no Crypt at all. Just some boring ass shrine grinding out pallet swaps and concept art. Another victim of the monetization.

And the monetization has gotten absolutely disgusting. I never wanted to be the guy that critiques a game on the company’s business practices rather than the game itself. But here we are. I can’t defend or ignore it anymore. I let “pay for EZ Fatalities” slide on X because I really didn’t care if people with more dollars than sense wanted to buy them. I didn’t mind DLC through MK11 because I thought it was reasonably priced for what genuinely felt like extra content.

But 40 dollars for six characters? Two of which are in the story mode? And we’re gonna act like 5 Kameo characters make that worth it? I’m pretty sure the entire Aftermath DLC was cheaper than that. It was definitely larger on content. Maybe MK11s Kombat Packs cost that much. I don’t remember. But it feels jarring this time.

And that 10-dollar Halloween themed fatality? No. Walk it back all you want, I’m done. People who want to defend it, do it on your own time, because mine is worth more than WB thinks it is. I legitimately like this game and I still wish I hadn’t bought it. I had to go into a media blackout bubble for weeks leading up to the release because of all the advanced copies they gave out and all the streams that already had the entire story mode and every Fatality, Brutality, and voice line on display. Little did I realize those streamers were doing me a favor. 

Next time I’m gonna do what I should have done this time. Watch the spoilers and skip the game, and the grind, until it reaches the 75% off mark a couple years later. There are so many more rewarding gaming experiences out there than this right now and my fandom is no longer enough to pull me through.

[h3] The Great! [/h3]
The gameplay of this game is absolutely a huge step up compared to 11's, it's fairly fast but not to the extreme of 10's, combo potential has excelled much more than 11's with how limiting it felt, the removal of Krushing Blows fixes the odd pacing from it's previous installment. Variations are now removed as the base roster of characters come COMPLETE with their whole moveset now, instead of picking & choosing what specific special moves you want present.The Kameo system, while skeptical at first before release, ended up being IMO, a welcoming new system that helps with creativity and fun fighter comp's for your playstyle. 
The current base roster is great with plenty of OG characters as well as welcoming a handful from the 3D era of games (Deadly Alliance/Deception/Armageddon) which does excellent in their redesigns & gameplay approach. 

[h3] The Downsides. [/h3]
The story wasn't exceedingly groundbreaking and revolutionary as per usual of the MK games usually go with their storytelling, being pretty mediocre like usual, and fell ESPECIALLY flat come near the middle and onto the ending chapters. What coherence is sort of had in the beginning would come to crumble into the overused trope of 'multiverses' that honestly lost my interest very fast. Single player content is... Okay for what it is. It's honestly rather lackluster. Invasions is a cool concept at first until you get to the point of late fights are just loaded modifiers galore which honestly... Makes it not fun. The lack of a map for each mesa makes it a slog to traverse through as you backtrack back & forth between areas you've yet to explore. (The 30FPS lock makes it even more gross...). There's really no challenge but instead just plain annoyance of how the fights perform where you have back to back ridiculousness of absurdity the modifiers will bring to each fight that just makes it a complete chore to play rather than a interesting challenge. Instead of just boosting the enemy NPC's difficulty as you progress further, their ""playstyles"" will remain the exact same by doing like, 2/3 of their basic string, sit and eat your moves, and just will play like dunces in the fights, as most of the damage taken are strictly from the random modifiers occurring all over the place anyways. It's bad and most of the time, just really gross to look at as your screen is plastered in random special effects going on. It's honestly kind of lazy... Invasion's also a strictly Online only thing too, so if the servers are down and you are wanting to just casually do those for leveling & unlocks... Tough, as you need to be online for this anyways.

The Kustomization is a little limiting compared to 11's with a few steps back. The process of unlocking the skins you'd want is also rather tedious & boring, as you're either grinding high amount of hours upping each mastery level per character for the rewards locked behind the mastery rewards, or gambling your Koins in the awfully slow Shrine system (More info below about that...) or the Season Specific Skins that will be available each season using the specific Kurrency for that season which you can obtain via multiplayer or Invasions.

The shrine, another method to unlocking stuff (mostly boring and uninteresting stuff such as Music, Artwork, stage art, etc.) that's usually unobtainable via character mastery leveling or Invasions, the system that's made to redeem your Koins is rather timewasting and tedious, as you're only able to redeem 1,000 Koins at a time in this shrine. Mind you, for each time you redeem those 1,000 Koins, you HAVE to sit through the disintegration animation of your Koins being melted down for like, 10 seconds to see what reward (Mostly something boring...) you've obtained. Why can't we just redeem all our Koins at once? I have 21,000 Koins... Let me put in 21,000 Koins, redeem, present me 21 rewards... It's a small nitpick but still something to point out considering how time wasting & grueling it is to just sit and see one reward pop up at a time, when I truly want to play the meat & bones of the game a little more.

[h3] The Actual Bad. [/h3]
The biggest things that are preventing me overall from giving it a positive review is the PC port for this game is not that great. MK11 had almost the same issues upon it's own release; Locked 30 FPS in certain areas aside from gameplay itself, stuttering issues, graphical issues, insane useage of your VRAM in random Tower Fights, especially ones with Endurance Mode that would just randomly crash your game (It crashes in other areas too like its own Main Menu...), It just somehow... Looks worse than it's console released ports. (We don't include Nintendo Switch's port.)
The team responsible for the PC port had plenty to learn from their MK11 release on PC and after a few patches over time... It's actually very well now as is today! FPS/Graphics look great, no random crashes, freezing, stuttering, it's actually... Great. If only this could be said about MK1, and actually be steps ahead on release. Unfortunately it'll look to be something that's going to be tweaked over time to wait for once again.

[h3] The Verdict? [/h3]
If you were to ignore the lackluster singleplayer content aside from the passable but not very great story mode, MK1 I can say is a pretty great game compared to the last installment, with the noticeable improvements coming to it's CORE gameplay overall. It brings a fine base roster and the additional interesting twist of Kameo fighter assists that makes the game more dynamic to creating fun & crazy fighter pairs. 

However, I honestly would hold off from obtaining this until the patches actually fix the game's functionality on PC. It's really great, fun, exciting, but the PC Port is just absolutely disappointing once again and has shown room for improvement. Perhaps a little sale will come by along with the game's fixes that would justify your purchase for this actually good game that's unfortunately plagued behind a unoptimized mess the PC version is.",1696186894,1699802362,False,2,1,0.545454561710357666,4,True,False,False

 - Invasions are ass - i have yet to find someone say it otherwise, and i cannot even play it if I would like to

 - talking about crashes, those are occasionally a thing in online play as well
 - still no Lobbies
 - the promise of crossplay. but everyone knows this will never come - same as MK11
 - they cut short on MK stuff to release it sooner - e.g. no friendship, no mercy, only one outro video etc.
 - marketing, pricing is a joke, game misses essentials but rather than adding those or fixing their bugs you get a fuck load of ""please buy"" content 
 - and personal opinion: characters do not fit to the stage, while the stage looks believable due to its high details the characters look like a plastic doll in it

LOVE - MK1 makes me feel like playing MK9 for the first time again. Two thing stands out most in MK1. Gameplay and stages. The STAGES! MK1 has the most beautiful, colorful and background reactive stages of all fighting games. The stages here are even prettier than SF6. The GAMEPLAY! Love that every character plays significantly different and the variety of combat styles. CAMEO system also adds infinite possibility to game play.
HATE - I absolutely hate the GRIND system, locking game play features behind the awful character leveling system. The new invasion initially feels fun but gets old after 2 hours. From then on it felt more like a chore to get skins and colors. I just want a simple fighting game like MK9 that I can spend my time in practice mode rather than doing uppercut a million time to get skins, gear, brutality and taunts.

UPDATE: So one season of grind is NOT enough for them, they decided to implement a second season of even worse grindess, with reduced Kredits gain. Absolutely hate this repetitive invasion mode.

It's a pity the game itself is decent and if they bothered finishing it and releasing it as a full proper game with no live service BS it would have been awesome.

It's lacking of basic fundamental qol features in a modern day fighting game alone speaks in regard to that. There are plenty of reasons that while having solid and rewarding gameplay this game fails at being a triple A fighting game experience. I'll go over the pros and cons.
Pros:
 -Solid gameplay foundation with exciting pressure sequences, fun and unique setup opportunities, cool combos, and overall great design in the visual aspect as well. 
-The game is gorgeous with stunning stages and absolutely amazing character renders that trump even mk11's graphics. 
-Mk1's story is an overall improvement in writing quality compared to mk11 and is the same fun we have come to expect from NRS story campaigns. 
- The new/returning characters are all welcome additions that add a lot of fresh faces to the mix
- The kameo system is robust and fluid allowing for creative gameplay for a variety of different characters. A character can be impacted by a single kameo in similar ways that they would differ in variations (ofc this depends on the kameo/character synergy)
-character taunts are a major improvement and many have fun unique ones
-fatalities are absolutely gorgeous in this game and pound for pound are an improvement over mk11's fatalities
-Brutalities, while still not as good as mkx, are better implemented in mk1 than mk11 with many characters having organic brutalities you can easily fit at the end of combos for cool finishes as well as challenge brutalities that require more setup. 
Cons:
-The netcode of this game is not good. It is rollback netcode however it is more comparative in quality to sf5's original ""rollback"" rather than say mk11's rollback. This was worsened by the recent omniman patch,
-The gear system in general has taken a huge step back in this game. The gear system has been relegated to a singular piece of gear that can either significantly alter your character's look (havik helmet) or make a change that is hardly noticeable in moment to moment gameplay (geras chest piece). 
-The collection system in mk1 has also taken a step back from mk11. There are no more towers and there is no more krypt. The Krypt has been replaced by a gamemode called invasions which is a glorified challenge tower stretched into several board game styled maps. The maps themselves do offer variety in terms of looks and approach  as well as secrets obtainable. However these positives apply to the krypt as well so as a replacement it does not improve on what was already established in my eyes. 
-The training mode.
-Character interactions and presentation have taken a step back. What I mean by this is the presentation and interaction of characters in this game has been stripped. Intro dialogue has been relegated to one phrase for each character as well as being separated from the characters respective intro animation (characters will talk shit to each other and then walk in all cool instead of doing it at the same time.) Round end taunts also are a little worse. while animations for round end taunts are still fantastic I find that there's a lot less dialogue for the characters between rounds with most resorting to grunts, laughs, war cries, or simply silence. 
-Premium currency in a $70 fighting game title. It began with SF6 and it's continued into mk1. It's one thing to have skin packs for characters however it's another to introduce a premium currency with a rotating shop that's overpriced. (Halloween fatality looking at you) 

Mk1 is a great gameplay foundation with a lot of hanging qol, netcode, and gear issues. The good news is many of these can be fixed with updates adding new gear, netcode fixes, training revamp, and general qol improvements to ui and other aspects. However in it's current state I would not recommend mk1 for it's $70 price tag and would suggest waiting for a sale or at least a patch to fix the current performance issues plaguing the game since the omni-man update.",1699645344,1699645344,False,4,0,0.543969154357910156,0,True,False,False

I dig the concept and was heavily invested in this new timeline story as it unfolded over 4 games. I don't want to seem overtly negative but here are the main bullet points you need to know:

-Cosmetics are limited and you grind to get everything in game modes that aren't really interesting or fun. 
-The Story mode is disappointing but looks great. 
-The Kameo system is great if you are a competetive fighting game player who knows how to use them. For us noobs, they are likely not good. 
-The air combat is sweet but tricky to master. 
-The combat feels clunky for the most part. Only a few characters did I find a way to string combos with. In all other games

Negatives:
- False marketing: We were promised a Johnny Cage Kameo but aparently that got scrapped and we end up getting a female version. Crossplay was featured on the steampage but got removed last minute, so basically people got scammed.

- Kombat Kast: an opportunity to promote their game but there's no interraction with the audience and there isn't even a Q&A. They seem to neglect addressing a lot of issues. All they care about is selling their product, with other words it is a waste of time because it doesn't give anything back to the consumer when it comes to providing us with answers, info etc.

- Ed Boon tweeting a post on Twitter claiming that they are working on these features below (which should have been in the game by default according to nowadays standards)
     - Crossplay
     - Wifi Filter
     - Ping filter
     - FT3 now changed to FT2 

The FT2 feature was one of the least desired features according to this poll but we end up receiving this anyway, goes to show that NRS and WB don't listen to their audience (why bother asking your audience if you are going to neglect our opinion anyway?)
It is more likely that PC version of the game wont get crossplay yet AGAIN.

- Lack of music that set the dark tone that for example mk4 had.

- I feel more terrified playing mk 1-4, the tone was set, you knew it was a battle to the death but now I start yawning and I feel i'm punching rubber bags because there's no blood splatting like there used to be.

- They take feedback from casual players (who will give up on this game after a few months) and add those changes to the game.


Positives:
- Better roster than MK11 (it's not a big of an accomplishment because anything else besides that roster would have been an improvement regardless)
- Longer combos that don't consists just out of 2-4 hits and a special.
- You don't need a brain to play this game and it's accessable for anyone to play.",1699626712,1699627801,False,1,2,0.471014469861984253,0,True,False,False

Good: 
- Gameplay is very fun and satisfying in general terms.
- No more boring standardized wake-ups 
- Flawless Block mechanic improved and makes more sense
- The graphics are stunning
- The roster is refreshing and will likely have many many more awesome characters
- DLC content seems really sick so far
- Kameo system brings a refreshing level of depth to the game
- Characters are no longer boring and limited like in MK11
- Story mode is of significantly higher quality in terms of writing and direction
- You will always discover something new in this game in terms of combos and tech
- Shrine has a diverse variety of cosmetics and generally the cosmetics are very appealing

Bad: 
- Warner Bros is one of the greediest publishers ever
- Micro-transactions for a 90$ game (that are also extremely expensive)
- Skin Packs are no longer free
- Balance is (understandably) kind of wacky 
- The player-base all have severe anger issues and are generally unskilled
- Premium currency in a fully-priced game is annoying
- You cannot farm premium currency like in MK11
- Lack of content diversity (as of writing this review at least) 
- There is no cross-play yet (especially bad for a new game)
- Micro-transactions do not fund game events like in previous MK titles

Overall: 
The game is fun. If you enjoy fighting games and Mortal Kombat games, this game is for you. The story mode and online multiplayer are fun, even with no crossplay. Seeing as this game is still in its infancy, I don't think it is fair to immediately label it as bad or good, but the gameplay - which is the most important part - is very good. I do not regret paying the full amount so far, but the micro-transactions are the most infuriating part of this game. If those get sorted out (which honestly would mean getting rid of Warner Bros.) then the game will be truly amazing. Overall if you are not someone who is concerned particularly about cosmetics, this game is really fun and enjoyable - even when you encounter a very toxic player.

Sub-Zero's bug finally got fixed. 14 days later. This is why we won't have crossplay, they cant even bother to fix a character bug until a major patch but they can send a Quick/Emergency patch for console to fix the same bug.

This is my first time playing a MK game, the combat is very fun and constantly trying out new Kameos and interactions is pretty engaging. All that said this game is not worth the $70 price tag, in my opinion. If online combat is all you crave then this game may be for you, but i would wait till cross-play comes (If they even implement it at all). The Single player content is also very disappointing, having never played a MK game, all i heard was how MK was King of single player content in fighting games and while the story mode was interesting i was expecting something more. Invasions mode was not engaging at all, played through all of it and it was VERY tedious, would only recommend it too grind out character EXP levels. The Shop is also a joke. A $70 game should not have a Shop or be pushing out micro-transactions for every little thing. It is also pointless as well. If your gonna make a shop Why not just put really interesting stuff there, Who would want to pay $5 for a recolored Scorpion mask?

I always loved mortal kombat, was one of my favorite fighters ever made.
I sunk hundreds of hours into mk9, 10, and 11 each.
played the old games a ton, own every ps2 game and loved them.

But fucking hell, EVERYTHING I try to do takes forever to load, everything. midfight can freeze for a second, throwing off combos, even waiting for the main menu to load in takes fucking forever. I have yet to really have any enjoyment, I held off on a review, because rocky launches can happen, I am fine with it, but my pc is fine on the requirements but still this game struggles to even pull up the basic shrine to spend my gold.

The combat system is fine to me, and when I get matches that run smooth enough, I can somewhat enjoy it, even if everything feels like it is downgraded gore wise.
Even the story is barely logical.
""Oh hey, this character is stabbed through the stomach, don't worry they are your backup in the fight, even if the next cutscene will show they are barely alive on the fucking ground.""

This may be the second biggest disappointment from buying a game in preorder, only one that topped it was Babylon's Fall, since it was shut down in less than a year, but even that game offered enjoyment for me compared to this.

Even though I liked the story mode in the game, it's still a big disappointment to me when comparing MK1 with MK11. Also WB got greedy by asking €40,- for a ****ing DLC pack on a €70,- game, which includes just 6 characters and 2 of them are already in the storymode. No way I'm buying th DLC for that price. The game alone wasn't even worth buying it for €70,- for the state it was released.

I really wanted to like MK1 and it breaks my heart to write a negative review about MK. I think WB just got to greedy.

  Story: Mid but cool changes
  Player Characters: Roster does miss some iconic characters like Jax, Sonia, and Kano, but used for Cameos Instead. Gameplay its self is strong and enjoyable. I personally hardly have had an issue with the gameplay overall. all the characters themselves is up to you.
  Cameos: Cool concept but there's only 2 that need to be used and the others are forgotten or ignored since they aren't good enough or are actually useless compared to others with higher combo potential
   Your wallet: you don't 100% need it after buying the game, there are ways to earn coins to do shrines and (so fcking slowly) after a couple of concept arts get some cool pieces of gear. Some i have seen on the shop. The prices feel a little high and fatalities are like 12$ as of this comment, so whatever its worth to you.
  Offline: Literally some dumb rpg bs i don't really care about. its cute but i don't have fun with it and it makes getting gear feel not worth it since you cant really get gear online. Towers is useless i just think we need Chess to come back.

very disappointed, game crashes continually.  i managed to finish the story and part of the first invasion.  but moving up a floor on towers = instant crash.  moving to the next challenge in training = instant crash.

- beat everyone to a pulp
- new Kombo's and easy Brutality's 
- Kameo Kombat is a fun new twist on the mk9 team fights
- Invasions is good and it works in  seasons wich is something to look forward too every season
- Wel written story with amazing quality transmission form to kombat cinematic looks exactly the same wich is amazing
- fun with friends a hard learning curve online because some characters feel incomplete (see cons)
- Towers never dissapoints and keeps being tough on very hard ( CPU has amazing combo's)


Cons

- Short story mode, normally this would not be so bad but with only invasions and towers left, it feels like it could have had something extra.
- No Krypt (known beforehand it stil dissapoints)
- No friendship? or Babality? (thus far known)
Some characters have diffrent moveset's than before like scorpion, he misses his fire kick combo, as that i have tried every combo and special move with him this move is gone, wich would be okay if in invasions this seasons end boss, DOES have the move.
this kinda sucked from my PoV feeling like i had a lesser scorpion. (for new players probably not that big of a deal?)
- Characters like Ermac, Quan chi should already be implemented in the roster because they are in story mode ( they wil be DLC)
game just misses extra content, wich wil come in DLC form sadly as i have kombat pack 1 because of the great line up of chars. but henceforward it wil take sometime till they drop, first up is OMNI man wich is a pro",1695537785,1699327408,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll start by saying that this game is very good, gameplay wise. It's got one of the best rosters and characters, with every single one of them being very unique and feeling very fun to play. I've never wanted to play so many different characters in an MK game before. The new kameo system is also a lot more fun than i originally thought. The story mode is also great, better than the MKX and MK11 ones.
I also play this game actively, and will continue to do so for a while.

But this game's launch has probably been NRS' weakest one. The blatant lack of content is very noticeable, and the single-player content is lacking severely. The new 'Invasions' mode is not fun at all, it's very tedious and gets old very fast. The downgrade in customization from MK11 is also ridiculous. We went from about 3-4 default skins and 3 gear slots, to about 2-3 and 1 gear slot for every character. Most of the cosmetics are obtained in either the Shrine (which is very lacking) and the Story mode. 

Then there's the sheer amount of corporate greed that is unmissable. Every MK1 player saw the disaster that was the ''Halloween Fatality''. A cutscene which they sold for 1200 ''Dragon Krystals'' which amounts to about 12 euros or 13 dollars. An insane microtransaction in an already expensive game. Then there's the fact that they said that the Jaune Claude van Damme skin would be exclusive to people who bought the Premium Edition. It then proceeds to show up in the Premium Shop, for Dragon Krystals. They lied. 

I can't give this product a positive review at this point in time. This game has so much potential, but it's getting buried by it's developers.

Yes, i love it a lot, it's superior to MK11 and it rights a lot of wrongs that game had.

If you're one of those people with performance issues, there's your reason. I'll maybe consider changing my review to a positive one once they remove that piece of sh!t from the game because as it stands, my PC is between the specs on minimum and recommended, yet it runs like @ss even WITH upscaling and the likes.

EDIT

So i went ahead and played some more, because at its core, the game is alright and can be fun. I also upgraded my computer slightly in the process and it runs ... ehh ... decently, it still chugs along here and there. Why am i adding an edit to an already negative review? Well, while the chaps i play with were offline, i meddled with offline offerings from the game ( Which are amazingly scarce for a game at this price ). So i finished the basic tutorials around week 1 of pre-launch when i got the game, and today i decided to do some combo challenges for the characters i play frequently ... and i reached Sub-Zero ... and he has an EX Ice Clone combo ... but wait, his EX Ice clone is glitched! HURRAY! Good job NRS! I knew of the ice clone issues but i didn't know that one of the combo challenges uses a glitched move. Which by the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay, the combo challenges are the most awkwardly imagined combo scenarios i ever seen ... while creative ... they are purposefully made difficult for no reason, not to mention plenty of which are unoptimal for PvP. For a combo challenge series that's supposed to teach new players how to combo, it surely will make for even worse players than the scrubs of MK11.

Owh yeah, and the DLC character release schedule is dog poop ... whoever decided Takeda to be last, i hope they get fired.

I'll give the game a week after this edit to see if they patch this game some more and fix more glitches and optimization. Otherwise, i'll uninstall and say Ciao! until way later on when NRS decides to properly take care of their game.",1696020471,1699230563,False,1,0,0.499643057584762573,0,True,False,False

To top it all off, there was a halloween fatality that cost 10 dollars. There are also some characters that appear in the story fully fleshed out and could have been released in the base game but were instead thrown into the year 1 pass to get you to pay extra.

No hate here, tried my best to enjoy what this game has to offer, as someone who loves MK games, since mk9 - my fav was mkX.

I have stutterings and tearings in every load intro during fights, on selecting fighters, just like when doing X-rays and pretty much everywhere where there is no direct gameplay. Kustomization menu also has 30 fps max looking at it.
Disturbs the eye and breaks the immersion. I understand this is because of the PC port, but hey, I trust Netherrealm has the resources and the willpower to do better at this. 
Payed too much for performance like this on a config like mine.

I hope they fix these soon, so I can change this review to a positive one, cause gameplaywise, it feels like an overall improvement for me, even though I'm not a big fan of cameos, they make my brain crack xD


Saddest part is, that private king fo the hill, our favorite way to play with the boiz is broken now, and only one player can join the host, the following players get error when they try to.

I also hate how much time goes off with just loading between menu options, kustomizing, selecting fighters, cameos, etc

There is unnecessary time-lock too when/after spending koins in the altar, at the end of matches, at the start or the second/third rounds in fights, or when entering and navigating the store.

Load times are a bit long for me, but that's a small price to pay to play what is, in my opinion, the best feeling Mortal Kombat game to date, at least in the Netherrealm era. It's on par if not better than MKX, definitely better than MK9, and MILES better than MK11. It feels fast paced without feeling overwhelming, the tutorial does a fantastic job teaching you EVERY minute mechanic and for the first time in MK history (i believe, though i could be wrong) Kombo Challenges for each character! My only gripe is that Havik is locked by story mode, which is fine normally, but charging to unlock him immediately feels a bit bad to me. I understand wanting to have the character immediately unlocked even on a fresh save for tournament reasons, but it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The Kameo system gives the game a fresh feel from every other game in the franchise.

also it has my 3 favorite characters in some capacity and my most favorite character is the playable one leggo (rain, shujinko, and soon tremor)",1699071490,1699071895,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

YOU HEAR THAT BETHESDA?!?!? 

Netherrealm Studios has put together some great games in the past and this game raised the bar again. The story is innovative, and a clever way of using the multiverse/timeline trope to do some creative things with character designs. The game is nearly 30 years old, and has tons of backstory that no longer matters, but in a good way. The new character designs are fantastic, the move-sets are both familiar and innovative, and there is so much content that you would not feel cheated even paying full price.

The Invasion mode is incredibly dull, grindy, and uninteresting. It is essentially a board game leading to fights with different gimmicks or modifiers, but these are either completely ineffective or so disruptive they ruin the game.  Navigation on the board is tedious and lacks any real map or zoom out feature to make navigation reasonable.

Actual gameplay vs other players has high highs, but low lows.

Removes a lot of unnecessary fluff from previous MK games, such as environmental strikes, X-ray attacks, character move variations,  several different forms of currency, and a slow grinding Krypt.  In it's place are essential game modes, sparse customization, and an easy to understand method for unlocking items.  

The true star of the show is the combat itself.  Never has a Mortal Kombat game felt so smooth, creative, fluid, and action packed.  Movement and reflexes never felt as important as they do now, and combat does not feel nearly as stiff as MK11.  Mortal Kombat can finally go toe-to-toe in the gameplay department with icons Tekken and Street Fighter.  I was initially skeptical of the new assist based Kameo system, but after spending time learning the system, I find it to be a genius addition to the series.  The Kameo system is much more interesting to me than bland move variations.  It leaves a lot of room for creativity, and rewards the player for experimentation and creativity.  

The roster is another major boon for MK1.  While some characters are arguably more useful than others, every character feels viable and useful.  You have a unique mix of series icons (Johnny Cage, Scorpion, Sub-Zero), returning fan favorites (Smoke, Reptile), and a few throwbacks from the 3D fighting days (Reiko, Tanya, Li Mei). The character design is brilliant, and it makes grinding for skins and experimentation a real treat.  

MK1 has the best story mode of any fighting I've played to date.  While it perhaps leaves room for innovative storytelling from games like Baldur's Gate 3, the story it tells is intriguing, entertaining, and easy to understand.  It has moments that hit you over the head with exposition, but it makes up for it with its intriguing characters, superb voice acting (save for Megan Fox's awful Nitara performance), and surprising character development.  I hope to see future MK games add more innovations for better replayability, but what is here is great!

Some things I wish were a little better are the customization being very bare-bones, online matches tending to be a little laggy, and the overpriced DLC.  The customization doesn't give you the option to have preset skins, which is a major bummer.  I would have been cool with NRS giving up 3 profiles for each customized character, but instead we have to go into Customize each time we want to change up the skin.  The online infrastructure needs work, as about 15% of my games are laggy to the point of unplayable.  A wider variety of online game modes and options wouldn't hurt either.  Lastly, $12 fatalities, $40 fighter packs, and $10 skins are bordering on disrespectful to the people who dropped $70 on their game.  If they want to charge outrageous prices, they should go free-to-play.  

Conclusion:  MK1 is the best Mortal Kombat ever released.  It addressed a lot of major gripes I have had with the series, and provides the smoothest kombat to date.  Highly recommended, worth the money, and I look forward to what they do with the game in the future.",1698904269,1698904269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Gorgeous game. The stages are amazing and the characters look fantastic. Their designs are top-notch and I really appreciate how they were able to take some previous characters such as Li Mei and Ashrah and make them look and play fantastic. 

-The fighting feels smoother to me than previous MK games- I actually enjoyed playing some characters that I despised playing as before. 

-Audio is really good. (This is for the sound effects and music, not the voice acting.)

Cons:
- story mode. This is obviously subjective to the player; there are quite a few who liked it and this review is not a knock against them enjoying it. I did not like the story- I feel that several very key elements were left out; even if this was supposed to be an opening for future games, I felt like there was a lot that was missing. While I did like the attempt and new and different directions for some characters (particularly Li Mei and Reptile), others were taken in a direction that just didn't feel right for the character even if it was an alternate timeline. Perhaps that's just my personal bias from having played since the original Mortal Kombat. 

- voices- in particular one- Megan Fox as Nitara. This felt like it was phoned in and could have used a coach or someone for vocal direction to keep the character feel consistent. I feel that for her to actually perform the character well, someone to go behind and listen to the lines and steer her in vocal directions would have been very helpful. 

- one thing that bothers me about the offline towers- no character banter. I'm not sure if they have plans to fix this or are planning on just keeping this for online. This is more of a dislike rather than anything that actually impacts the game, but it does feel like the banter set up the conflict for a match very well. 

- my biggest dislike, and ultimately the one that pushed this to a negative review: the steep price behind skins and fatalities. I've already dropped money on the base game as well as the first Kombat Pack. If it was something along the lines of a dollar per skin and fatality, maybe that would be on the upper end of what I would be willing to work with. But what basically amounts to $10-$12 for a fatality? No thank you. While I do think the idea of unlocks for characters by using them and the invasions mode are a good idea, as well as the seasonal unlocks, the price is steep for the crystals to unlock. 

 Is this a bad game? No. If you are a Mortal Kombat fan, I would feel comfortable saying that this would be a decent buy. As a casual player or if you are one who doesn't have a lot of money and not a lot of time, the monetization practices are what would push me to tell you to go play something else. And lets be clear- what is in place right now at this time isn't exactly terrible compared to some games, but it is a slippery slope for pricing and if no one says anything, it will get worse.

A very interesting reboot of the franchise that does a lot of interesting stuff with the old characters to make them interesting. Reptile and Mileena are highlights. The ending is rushed though and probably could have been an entire game on it's own, but is serviceable I suppose.

However, outside of the story there's a lot that doesn't work for me in the new game. Kameos are a pointless addition. MKX introduced the ability to summon a fighter to perform an attack nearly 10 years ago. This isn't new. Removing things like character variations and stage interactions has further hamstrung the kombat mechanics. Kombat is the least varied in the series since MK9 (at least in 9 you had two fighters at once).

The only meaningful single player experience is the new invasions mode. Invasions aren't particularly interesting, amounting to short single round fights against the very small fighting roster with the occasional buff or debuff. A step backwards from the fun towers we had in the other games.

Finally, kustomisation and character intros/banter have been pretty much removed. Injustice 2 gave us five gear slots we could customise, MK11 had three, MK1 gives us one. The process of unlocking kosmetics is painfully tedious with several different currencies you don't know how to earn or spend. Intros and banter now only exist in multiplayer or single fight modes. Invasions for some reason do not include any character interactions.

In summary. The story is mostly great. Everything else is outdated to the point you'd probably have more fun with any other NetherRealm game from the past 15 years.",1698792053,1698792053,False,1,0,0.469885051250457764,0,True,False,False

The port is awful I currently have a high end gaming PC and this game runs terrible. Frames drop at all settings the hair texture looks like a ps2 game. Its the first game I've had any issues with so its not a my computer issue. The game stutters and freezes often too. The game was released incomplete with patches coming to console days before they came to PC. Besides the performance issues we were promised cross play this time and once again NRS didn't deliver. Match making takes several minutes to find a opponent and normally you're stuck facing the same person over and over again. At first week this game only had 15.000 active players on PC. NRS has gave up on PC and we still have to pay the same price... Invasions are super boring and dragged out the multiplayer is laggy and drops tons of frames it is impossible for me to recommend the game in the current state. We pre ordered the game and paid the premium to get the JCVD skin for it to be in the shop the next week too.

40 Bucks for a Kombat Pack when usual fighter packs are 25$ or less.
The Characters themselves are not worth that much.

It feels like a step backwards from MK11, which that game already felt like a one step forward two steps back from MKX. Its EVEN slower, but, personally, i dont mind, though I know many will. Theres less personalization. Customization feels very limited compared to MK11, as well as the way intros were redone. It just feels like theres less, and for some reason, it feels like these characters are talking “blooper takes” instead of actual fighting-esk intros. It all felt more personal, more intense, but now they feel a bit too either over actiony, over cringe, or just too wholesome. The entire game feels a bit “softer” too, and i guess I should’ve expected that once Ed Boom started saying how he felt “we went too far” with Noob in MK9 leading to him being toned down for MK11. That shouldve been my red flag for things to come. Im not saying this is a bad fighting game, but, it feels like its trying to be a bit of something else, like an Injustice 3 with a fan made Mortal Kombat Mod, and honestly I wouldn’t be suprised if Injustice 3 was for all intents and purposes a reskin of this game.

It is not a bad game by itself, but it doesn't have too much to offer. It's very dissapointing, even if it isn't compared to the previous game.
Mortal Kombat 11 will bring you lots of hours of fights and challenges. This game just doesn't, and EVEN THEN they dare to cut content so you have to buy if you want to, for instance, perform another finisher.

The funny part is despite the game shows you only one finisher on the movements list, you can still perform the other ones. It's not even necessary to spend money that ""dlc"": the only thing you're purchasing is their appeareance on the list, but if you try one of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035597325] these [/url] you will be entirely capable of perform them.

In spite of that, the game is not bad. It's good, but is has too little to offer.
Towers are boring.
Kameo fighters are a thing but I'd personally rather use them for actual fights.
Optimization is unfortunate. The game runs better than it did in the day one, but still.
Sometimes, the game doesn't even start. Most of times, you can't even play Invasions, which is like the main source of playable content for this game.
Also, progressing in this game is very slow. Maybe it is related to Netherrealm's tendency to turn everything into downloable content?

I liked it at first. I had fun, I played the story mode (which is very silly and I believe it was the most right decision they made), and played so many towers and it was ok. But, honestly, this is the first Mortal Kombat game that doesn't bring me any reason to get back and play it a little bit more.

So I will return to Mk11, or even Mk9.",1698605225,1698617721,False,3,0,0.558565974235534668,0,True,False,False

MK1 is a good and bad game in its core. For now I do not recommend the game but I am confident that it will get updated and be better just how they updated Mk11.

The good: 
The fighter roster is amazing as each fighter has unique move sets from other fighters.
Has a lot more game modes than mk11.
Caters to both online and single-player  players by being able to level up characters in all modes except story-mode and local fights.
New seasons can introduce a lot of new character inspired skins.

The bad:
There is less customisation where only 1 gear piece can be changed and only 1 intro and outro are available for all characters.
Brutalities and fatalities can only be unlocked trough levelling up specific characters rather through the krypt, AI perform the fatality or through the the tower of time like in MK11.
Character kombos are good, however very little defence against kombos is available, the barrel roll, get up attacks and stage interactions are gone and replaced with the kameo when reaching full special bars ,and uses them, can break opponent kombos and using your special moves as get up attacks which can result in your opponent using juggling kombos for the entire match or spamming down attacks.",1695153443,1698512157,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Gameplay itself is great, but that's all. There's nothing else good I can say about this game.

Invasion mode, which replaces towers of time from mk11 (the mode you gonna spend most of your time unless you want to play ranked 24/7), is the worst thing ever. I have 50hrs in game and I can't play any of the characters. Why you would ask? Because in those 50hrs, mostly spend in invasion, I never had a chance to learn. Every (I mean every, not some, every) enemy has an armor activated randomly every few seconds, even mid combos, which mitigates all dmg and makes them totally immune. Which will just drop your combo, there's no point in learning. They are also very weak, they die to 3 uppercuts, if they don't have the armor at the moment of impact. There are some other modifiers, but armor is always on. If anything it made me a worse MK1 player as armor also slows down time a little so your timing on combos will be off, if you actually tried to pull them off, . You learn how NOT to play the game. It's a copy of Mortal Kombat mobile's Crypt mode, but done even worse.

Story mode is somehow enjoyable, 6+/10.

It's expensive. I paid 92e for it and that was fine, before I realized that they gonna treat it like a mobile game, or even worse. And now there's halloween event live. And the whole ""event"" consist of you being able to spend real money on 3 different skins + another 10e on fatality. That's the ""event"". Even mobile games those days give you at least something to unlock without paying. I honestly feel scammed.

Not to mention now you can buy Jean-Claude Van Damme Skin for Johnny Cage in the shop now, which was part of a Premium. I thought at least one skin will be more unique and unavailable at least for a while. That little badge of honor (stupidity I guess), that I put my trust and money in the game before it was even out.

So why do I give thumbs up? Well, it's good to compare titles of the same franchise, but at the same time, we need to judge a game on its own as well, and MK1 on its own is good. Nothing too fancy and nothing too trashy.

[i] MK1 does some things better than MK11 and other things worse, in order to be as precise as possible, I will compare it to MK11 but I will also judge some of its aspects on their own  [/i]
[u] The good ones [/u]
-Fast paced combat with depth and satisfying aerial combos
-Level design is out of this world
-Different variations of levels (night, dawn etc)
-Character design is top notch
-Roster is even better than MK11's (which I was a big fan btw)
-Story is great
-Audio design is good
-Graphics are beautiful
-Voice acting is great

[u] The bad ones [/u]
Let me start by saying that the game is clearly unfinished, it's lacking replay value and actual modes, other than that:
-Invasions are boring and tedious
-There are only the basic tower modes 
-Roster has less characters
-Character and Cameo progression systems are grindy as all hell and unfun
-Cameo system, whoever thought this was a good idea, should be fired immediately
-Customization is very limited
-Fatalities are a joke compared to MK11's

All in all, MK1 is a decent title, it totally doesn't worth 70 bucks and it needs a lot of work for someone to even think to compare it to MK11, but there is potential, the only unfixable thing is the cameo system, that's the 80% of MK1's problems, the rest will eventually come.
What I didn't expect was the devolution of the Fatalities, they are supposed to get better with each game, they are too simple and too fast in this one, some of them were simple brutalities back in MK11.

This is an empty game. There is so little content that even the weekly shop recycles items. They are drip-feeding us skins over the span of weeks/months; skins that are already in the game's files. Invasions is a drag, forcing you to fight hundreds of opponents with super armour while scrambling your controls on a dark screen. The story's writing is on par with a highschool fanfiction. The frame data on some characters is straight up false. There was a daily quest to perform mercies when mercies aren't even a feature in the game yet. Private practice online is not an option, was in MK11. Lobbies aren't an option, was in MK11. No wifi filter. This game is EMPTY.

Yet, it's also full. It's full of microtransactions; a $12 CAD fatalty. It's full of gimmicks that break the game. Chip damage over 22% of your healthbar; unblockable setups with numerous characters; an overwhelming meta; easy-to-perform low investment combos on some characters that will do 55% while harder higher investment ones on other characters do 35%. It's no wonder Mortal Kombat is an embarrassment in the FGC compared to Street Fighter.

Well the story mode was pretty damn big, that's a good thing, the visuals combined with that, dazzling, the graphics are very nice. Music is on point.
Towers are great, quite a selection to choose from , hourly, daily, weekly , challenge towers, seasonal etc etc. Then we got them invasions, real good again, seasonal based activities , with lots of wonderful rewards, which you can view as you progress in the kollection.

But now comes the really bad parts...

1. You have to buy Shang Tsung for completion (yep, go to the fighter collection, all the upgrade parts you earn, cant be applied to him, till you buy him). Not sure what Netherrealm are thinking on this one, but this is not very gamer friendly.

27/10/2023 - Updating my review, as it seems a patch was dropped by the devs, and has thankfully stopped the crashing for me, and the audio doesnt crackle one bit now. Been playing the tower invasions for a few days now, and not once crash.

I still think charging for a character that you need to actually apply pallete parts, gear, etc, is out of order (Shang Tsung, your money is mine).

The GOOD:
The gameplay actually doesn't suck this time.
Movement feels good.
AIR COMBOS!
The combo system is very fun and lots of freedom of combo expression has been added via the kameo system.
The breaker system actually resets neutral for both players which is GREAT.
The single player story mode is apparently quite good? I cannot confirm this personally, I only play competitive multiplayer.

The BAD:
NRS banning Russian players with no warning after they spent $100 on this game. This is pretty much theft.
NRS sucks.

Great game but Killer Instinct is still more fun. I would probably enjoy this game a lot more if I had never played Killer Instinct. And the same goes for pretty much any modern fighting game these days.",1695304747,1698282432,True,0,0,0.480637818574905396,0,True,False,False

Mortal Kombat 1, released in 2023, delivers a thrilling blend of nostalgia and modern gaming. The graphics are absolutely stunning, showcasing the power of contemporary hardware to bring characters and environments to life in vivid detail. The game's roster of characters, both classic and new additions, provides an exciting array of combat styles, ensuring that every player can find a favorite. The intricate combos, an essential aspect of the series, remain as satisfying as ever, offering a deep level of strategy and challenge.

However, the gaming experience is not without its blemishes. NeatherRealm Studios' sketchy business practices, including the presence of an item shop and Kombat Pack, are hard to ignore. The microtransactions and loot box-like elements within the item shop can feel intrusive and may tempt players to spend more money than they intended. Additionally, the Kombat Pack, while offering extra content, can create a division in the player community by gating certain characters and features behind a paywall. These issues, while disappointing, should not overshadow the fact that Mortal Kombat 1 in 2023 remains a visually impressive and mechanically captivating fighting game.",1698260905,1698260905,True,3,0,0.506323516368865967,0,True,False,False

there are quite a few bugs, like voice lines being delayed when fighting against another player locally, or captions being delayed/missed completely. the game also takes quite a long time to load, but honestly, can't really blame a game this size for needing some time.

Across all these modes you get trivial amounts of xp and even less xp when playing a normal match against the computer.  It makes unlocking character rewards extremely boring for solo players.  Characters have two sets of outfits that offer a bunch of pallet swaps, but any other ""fun"" skins are bought with real money.

The gameplay feels about as good as MK11 which was really enjoyable.

The Kameo system is a great addition in my opinion, a system that makes for some new innovations when facing fighters. It's not as simple as learning their move sets and other players will always surprise you with something you've never seen before that consistent new tech, new combos it can refresh a meta and that's good for a game's lifespan.

However NetherRealm being NetherRealm it's not perfect.

Adding in Invasions mode for single player is a nice touch MK as an RPG? I'm all in favour! If it were like MK Deception and Konquest mode, but annoyingly it's made a challenge only by super armour cheese and messing with the game as a whole in terms of frame timing, rather than making it an actual challenge of skill.
The hardest it gets is Test Your Might. That is not very fun. It would be much better if it rewarded the stuff that makes a difference in an actual match not relying on gimmicks. Now the elemental twist is nice but after a while stops being relevant

One mark off for the jittery PC cutscenes in story, that's pretty annoying AND exclusive to PC! (I'm on ultra settings on a high end PC with a 3080ti so I don't want to hear the 'inferior hardware' argument.)
One mark off for Invasions requiring very little skill and relying on cheese albeit in typical MK fashion.
One mark off for Micro-transactions, seriously. I get your game is a business but still, these things don't need to be omnipresent. What's wrong with DLC costumes over buying an in game virtual currency to buy them anyway?",1698191297,1698191297,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't recommend until they improve their netcode, or improve their online solution entirely.  Single player content is okay... but nothing really worth spending too much time into once you've completed the story.  Rather disappointing as I had thought the previous game to have ran just fine.

Locking DLC behind internet access so if your internet is shit too bad, cant use your $40 DLC pack.

It runs like sludge ,  its half baked , its $70 , two of its dlc characters are certainly base roster cuts, it takes up 100 gigs and when it crashes (and it does so often) it saves crash reports that take up around 1.5 gb each. If youre not carefull and clear these out , this will easily brick up your pc. 
This game is coded so poorly it might as well be malwere. I remember Cyberpunk 2077 running better on my first plathrough(on release) on an old PC with a Ryzen 5 and GTX 1060 combo then this game runs now on my current 12 gen i7 GTX3060 combo.

- The gameplay is good though.
Not my favourite mk ever but its pretty cool.
The visuals are best we ever had as well and while some of the character designs are not my favourite thats hardly a knock on the visual fidelity of the game.
Its a big step up from 11 and 11 was already a visually stunning game.
Sadly unlike 11 it really is surface level.
Once you bite into it youlll realize that it left you craving more and asking yourself where did the rest of it go.
There are NO cosmetics to unlock. Most of the cool cosmetics are premium shop. 
I repeat this $70 game is selling cometics as if its fortnite or apex legends. One skin? yeah , gimme $10 . One annnouncer voice? Also $10.  Base mk11 i could play for months before i unlocked all the stuff but here I literally got a message from the game that I unlocked everything in the shrine and to come back next patch. Like ARE you kidding me!? Thank god we have 5 PREMIUM currency exclusive skins though. There are only 4-5 skins you can unlock in the game (bar the color swaps for each characters base skin and alternate costume)  
They are 
Yakuza Kenshi
Indiana Jones Johnny Cage
Evil Sindel and Geras
Scorpion gets a unique kombat league skin this season too.
In the premium shop we get
2 color set variants of dia de los muertos sub zero
1 dia de los muertos scorpion
Kanibal Mileena 
MKDeception Scorpion
Brazil Tanya 
And it gets even worse for kameos as they have NO skins in either the shrine OR the premium shop.
The ONLY skin for your kameo is Sonyas MK3 skin and honestly its just a flat out upgrade to her MK1 design so it might as well be her default because her default is ugly as sin.
The online is also the worst its been since MKX got outfitted with rollback. The game often runs like sludge online.  Im genuenly shocked at how bad this game is. There is a really good game here but its being absolutely run into the ground with corporate greed and what i can only assume is a rushed development. I bet we had injustice 3 in the making but was scrapped in the change in menagement from WB after the aquisition. So while some people tought this game was the one that took longest to develop (skipping injustice 3) it might be the opposite. The super hero DLC roster might be salvaged character designs from said injustice 3 . 
Overall whats on display here is good. Really good but its what isnt here that makes this sting so much.
So much is missing and even the good parts dont work often as the game is just poorly coded with lots of bugs , crashes and gameplay sttuter. 
Wait for a sale. While we wait for discounts they will hopefully fix the game and add actual content to it.
They really need to pull a cyberpunk comeback or at least mount a sf5 level glowup.",1698133285,1698133285,False,3,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

The invasion mode is fun but is drawn out with a bunch of bloat mechanics that slow down progression through it. The main bad of guy of this (Shang Tsung) is locked behind an 8 dollar paywall if you didn't preorder as well. Not a big fan of the Kameo system either but that's more down to personal preference. Overall I think this is just a much lesser game than it's predecessor and clearly needed another year or two in the oven before release, makes me think WB wanted to bank on the good will MK11 and Aftermath instilled to make a quick buck, and I feel the 40$ kombat pack 1 reinforces that idea.",1698133038,1698133038,False,4,0,0.539748966693878174,0,True,False,False

Frame Data is still incorrect in menu
No online practice
Random Skin selection does not work in Private Online
Block drops for no reason while online
Host hit boxes are larger than guest players hit boxes, even in Kombat League
No cross platform-play
Cross region play is awful and has server side issues
Skins/Alternative costumes are limited and it's obviously limited due to the fact NRS is looking to Micro-Transaction, the F, out of this game
Load times are awful
Will freeze at time just loading out of the Invasion game mode
Obvious balancing issues (Cyrax, Johnny, Raiden, Baraka do more damage for the same resources as any other character.)
Infinite with Sindel has been out for weeks, no fix
Bug with using Shujinko that causes General Shao to loose access to his axe
The shrine takes 3 minutes to cycle after using it, I mean, holy hell
The shrine is literally the only thing ""Koins"" are used for so they can force monthly live-service seasons currency for absolutely no reason
Invasion is too grindy and boring. When the best way to level is spam the starting area trio-endurance match, you know there is something wrong with your progression design.

The new direction and redesign of the world and characters is a very welcome breath of fresh air in this old franchise. The sound direction is also superb.

A word on performance: it's fine. A lot of people on here seem to either not have the right equipment for a modern game (been seeing this with a lot of releases this year. It's not the developers fault you don't have a strong enough computer) or are upset that they can't run the game on the highest settings. Even on mid-range settings, this game is absolutely gorgeous. While some patches are very much needed, I'm not going to judge a game based on what will almost certainly be fixed in the near future (and isn't really that bad in the first place).

There is a lot to do here and while there is a cash shop, it's not really that big a deal. Spend some money or don't, it's really not required or pushed in your face.

The worst thing about this game is Megan Fox's absolutely sub-par voice acting. I mean it's super noticeable. After hearing hours of quality professional voice acting, Nitara sounds noticeably amateur. I really hope they replace her with someone.

played the game with 3070ti almost no bugs and crashes .
i had a 1060 gb had very few issues with bugs and crashes.
played the game with 3060ti almost no bugs and crashes .
played the game with rx 7600 bugs and crashes all the time when i get out of campaign and training and go into online match i pray it does not crash .

i dont expect loading screen to be fluid after all everybody has different pc machines but the connections issues destroy the experience.

lets talk about the game

The story is imo the best of the franchise. It feels good to see actual character development, or characters with actual morals and personalities, whether good or bad. Spoiler: [spoiler]It got a bit chaotic after the twist into the end, and i was kind of hoping for a more laidback story that was more about the new era and not a multiverse scenario, but it was still enjoyable[/spoiler] Gameplay is very good, and seeing how all the characters work makes me want to learn all of them, something that lacked in the previous title, MK11. Invasion mode is... meh. I love the idea of a cool environment with a boardgame-like playstyle, but it does get a bit tedious after a while. Fights dont feel rewarding (aside from xp) until after you've beaten the final bosses and completed a mesa, and even then I still wonder what exactly I earned. As well, the choice of towers included is a bit ironic, considering Invasion was supposed to be an alternative to Towers of Time from MK11. Secret fights are also a bit dumb. Invasion already includes ambushes, which are surprise fights that can occur at any time as you traverse the mesas. Secret fights add nothing but drag on the tower fights, with no actual rewards to make it worth it. Invasion mode is a bit messy, but the idea is there and has a lot of potential. I haven't played ranked yet but I can't wait to get my ass handed to me lol.

Overall, I am definitely enjoying the game, but I feel like with the Invasion mode in order to keep me more invested in the single player aspect of the game, there needs to be some work done. The gameplay is phenomenal, and the story is a lot of fun with major improvements to characters and plot compared to X and 11. I dont think $70 is a very fun price, let alone $110, so if you arent a super Mortal Kombat fan, maybe consider waiting for a small discount or consider steam keys.

Fuck inflation

I regret to declare this game is extremely disappointing. It has been over a month since release, and for many ps5 and PC players, in offline multiplayer, player 2 cannot perform ANY fatalities or use unlocked skins. This is absolutely unacceptable for a MK game, which in no small part is designed to be played at parties and other social events with your buddies.

The story for this game, while mostly great in the first half, and refreshing for giving unlikely characters a story chapter, is so poorly written in the second half it puts anyone's concens about MK11's story to shame. By the end, this is easily the worst story mode for a MK game, trading any narrative value, conflict stakes, or character depth merely to show off a variety of skins. If you come to MK for the story, watch it on youtube. Don't waste your money on this.

Invasions mode is also pretty disappointing when you consider what it is. You move from square to square to fight an enemy under certain conditions while reading text boxes and listening to narration. MKX's Krypt, and MK11's Krypt, and even MK9's challenge towers were all significantly more fun to play through than this.

Finally, this might be just a me thing, but I'm unhappy with the kameo system. Unless you're a high level player who is good at juggling and stringing together long combos, the kameos aren't very fun to use, and ultimately strike me as a low effort attempt for NRS to put more characters in the game without having to go to the trouble of actually making them playable (you'd expect them to be, when the game is 100GB of memory despite it being exclusively a 2.5D fighting game).

In conclusion I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I've been putting off this review while waiting for the game to be patched with a solution for the offline multiplayer problem, but I payed $90 for this game and a month later it's still unusable at any social gathering.

Story 8/10 Im Basing the story off the fact that this is my first Mortal Kombat Game I've Ever Played But I Genuinely Enjoyed The Story Mode
Online 4/10 Solid Fighting Alot Of Cool Combos But Terrible Gameplay Frame Skipping,Game Crashing,Mic Audio,Freezing, Overall Just Not A Good Experience.
I Would Not Recommend The Game In The Current State That It's In.
If The Developers In The Future Decide To Fix it Then and Only Then You Should Think About It.

Something is wrong and it still hasn't been fixed yet.

Until this issue is fixed I can't recommend purchasing the game and it sucks because learning the combos has been so much fun, the gameplay itself feels really good.

Kameos make this game shine so much more than previous entries and all the characters don't feel like they have training wheels on them constantly like MK11 characters did. 3D era characters returning is such a nice addition and I love their redesigns. Despite all this DO NOT SPEND 70 DOLLARS FOR THIS GAME. The PC port is horrendously optimized with frequent stuttering and load times that rival tekken 7's. Along with this is paid costumes for characters in a game where there are already so few cosmetics. Imagine spending 70 bucks for a game and seeing a cool scorpion skin in the shop only for it to ask you to fork over another 10 bucks. Just plain stupid.

- Story is pretty interesting at least in first half

The bad:
- They go into full multiverse with the story, how original
- Lack of balance, insane chip damage, Cyrax kameos is broken, Raiden is broken, Baraka is broken wtf
- No character selection in multiplayer, lol
- No intros in multi

The UGLY:
- Game as a service, mandatory cash, shop and season, woohoo, don't forget to log everyday for daily quests
- Lack of single player content, Invasions mode is dogs hit
- No crossplay for Steam, do I need to add more?

I suggest getting a console version of the game because of all the issues. I'm very disappointed in all the bugs overall. Kameos not doing their attack, bad connectivity without the ability to deny a match, and if your opponent has this game installed on an HDD you are boned.

Furthermore the metagame is relatively stale right now: lots of Cyrax with the top 3 characters. The issue isn't there are top tier strategies...the issue is there is _one top tier strategy for each character_. Reiko/Darrius, Raiden/Jax, Johnny/Cyrax, Kung Lao/Goro...And during a set you can't change fighters which causes the issue where you can be stuck in a bad matchup!

I'm hoping this game will get fixes and works better but honestly I'm not certain it will happen.

I've had a ton of fun with story mode, online, and even just practice mode testing out all the fun combos I can do. The game has a lot of life to it, and I would typically recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the series, or just a fun of fighting games in general. Loads of fun.

There are some negatives though. It's worth noting this was initially a negative review because the game launched with some game-breaking bugs, but they were patched pretty fast which I appreciate. The game still has a few bugs of course, and there's occasional issues with online mode (disconnects and such), but most of the time playing online feels good. Balance wise, the game is in a decent state with some things to be desired. At the time of writing, Sindel has an infinite (though I imagine this will be fixed, as its more of a bug) and there are some characters that feel much stronger when compared to others (Raiden, Johnny Cage, Kenshi, Baraka) but hopefully they'll balance them when the time comes.

Oh it's also worth noting that this game's monetization, while not nearly as bad as some other games currently out, is bad. Kombat Pack 1 / 2 costing 40 bucks plus the game costing 70, along with the fact that Shang Tsung is a pre-order bonus is really, really a lot of money. Just buying all characters alone, you'd be paying $155 presuming you didn't preorder Shang Tsung. I am very excited for the content we're getting for these packs though.

This game has been crashing for me alot. I'm disappointed the PC version is regularly crashing. Sometimes I can get a good session playing through the story mode but eventually my game will freeze and then close when I try to up the visual settings or change the resolution. I can run SF6, Tekken, and Guilty Gear Strive all at 60fps high settings without a single hiccup! And then MK1 is barely able to load in a character select screen sometimes.

- Story mode is 9 hours long, and invasions are also 9 hours long
- Story made is great, Megan Fox is not
- Invasion mode is basically a bunch of repeated fights in a mario party board
- Game runs at 60 FPS MAX (I assume for fighting game reasons)
- Menus, Fatalities, In-Game cutscenes, and invasion board all are locked at 30fps and stutters alot
- Fatality distance is written incorrectly (close is actually mid, mid is actually long, long is actually longer)
- Season 1 invasion cosmetics for all characters look like garbage
- Story mode is great tho
- Either multiplayer is full of lagswitchers or the games are generally super laggy online
- Game is not polished (no starting character interactions, some character models would float in the air during brutalities)
- The company has not made any patches or feedback to the kommunity in this game since its early release in September
- Every time your game crashes, the game creates a crash report that consumes 1GB of storage
- Kombat pack is a DLC ""season pass"" without telling you its a season pass, which is deceptive marketing

SIDENOTE: Alot of people on Windows have reported having numerous crashes and bugs in the game. I play on Linux with an AMD graphics and CPU system, and i have not had a single crash or bug playing this game. Your experience with the games performance might vary wildly at this point.

It's 100x closer to being a game compared to its contemporaries -- which would be more charitably described as ""tournament apps"" -- but compared to previous Netherrealm titles like MK11 or Injustice 2 it's like whoever's job it was to come up with gameplay ideas took a loooooooong vacation during development and no one dared pick up the slack. 

MK12 (let's face it that's the more appropriate title) feels like it was half-assed in every category that wasn't online multiplayer focused. For example the character banter at the loading screen into the fights in Versus Mode is one of the most creative ideas in recent history... but if you're not playing strictly in versus and, say, doing the exact same dueling to the death in one of the handful of other gameplay modes that feature is not only absent but you get to stare at a blank screen. I feel sorry for the voice actors and writers who spent so much work just to have a blank screen for 90% of the times where it would be applicable. 

No Krypt mode either. Instead there's invasion mode, which is a neat idea on paper but again half-assed since you could re-create the entire experience in RPG Maker from 10 years ago. 

Three cheers to Netherrealm for not engaging in loot boxes, pay-extra progression, and other signs of villainy... but again what the game does have to reward you with is largely half-assed (I think I'm seeing a pattern here). They run out of ideas so quickly that your reward for getting a given cameo to level five is an insulting handful of easy fatality tokens, instead of a costume, color scheme, etc that would add some flavor to gameplay. 

All that said and the story I'm in two minds about. On one hand it's the best story in fighting games released in 2023, but compared to their competition it would be like winning an arm wrestling match against a man with no arms. And there's a certain lack of effort I'm endeavoring to try to stop banging on about, but it is really disappointing because the first half of the story was a 10/10 experience. Then a lever gets flipped at the halfway mark and the masterful story writer gets tagged out for a four-year old downing pixie sticks hand over fist and all attempts at world-building are swiftly brutalized. It would have been less insulting to cut to black halfway thru, write ""one thing lead to another"" in plain Arial font on the screen, then cut to credits. 

And whoever's job it was to balance the gameplay experience fell ill, died, etc during development because frankly its atrocious. I play thru a character's tower mode on the highest difficulty, conclude the fight with a brutality to get the highest earnings, and am rewarded with 175 XP. Meanwhile I could go into invasion mode, bully a level 1 mission with my max level character with a single uppercut, and get 300 XP. 

The two clearly positive things I can say about this are:
   1) The combo system is straightforward and very satisfying. 
   2) Every character on the roster is worthy of your attention, from looks to combat feel

If that's enough for you, great. If not, leave this game to rot in the flesh pits of online tournaments (because clearly that was the only bit of this that had development's full attention).

Seeing some of the characters get changed the way they did like Barakka and such, was amazing. I really enjoyed them as a character, I enjoy how doing the towers is how you see how alot of these threads get capped off. The biggest strength of MK1, is its clean looking. Runs absolutely fantastic! And theres plenty of content, if your just a PVE player.

Lets break it down though:

Story Mode: I loved the story mode, the story was really fun, really engaging, and constantly wanting you to know whats going to happen next. Its a simple story, but its a fun story. I also enjoy how all these people had new origins. The ending was amazing, loved fighting the mix up fighters. Downside about it, its a one and done kinda deal sadly. Theres no reason to ever touch it again. Wish there was more achievements locked to it or some reason to go back.

Invasions: What can I say about invasions? They are incredibly fun, but very repetitious. I really wish they used the mix up fighters from the end of the story mode, in invasions and hope they do something like that in future seasons. Season 1 invasion took me afew days to complete, I unlocked all the seasonal gear. You'll get plenty of currency and all in all, its fun if your looking for just a single player experience. You then have the gateway nexus where you get all sorts of towers be it daily, weekly, hourly, seasonal. And absolutely none of them are worth it, from my experience. 

Towers: Towers are so much fun to do, only for the ending. Outside of that, its very formulaic. But the endings are completely worth it to get.

Shrine: Holy smokes, this is the games lootbox system. Its fine, its fun if your trying to complete the Kollection and to my knowledge, the only way to get the concept art and what not. But the fact I can only spend 1000 koins, have to then wait 30 seconds, before going through another cutscene. This is a simple fix and more of a QoL problem, then a mechanical one.

Tutorials/Practice: I'm not sure if ANY other MK games have this, but its a god send. I love practice mode, I love the tutorials, because you can focus on learning each of your fighters kombos.

Fighters: I love the initial list. Because each one of the fighters truely feels unique in their own way and each fighter feels like they have their extreme strengths and weaknesses. I played around 20 hours of Liu Kang, absolutely loved playing him. Then switched to trying to find a secondary character and found I struggled because you get so used to movements and strengths. I was expecting each fighter to be essentially just a reskin, nope. Geras plays completely differently than Liu Kang does. The only downside, is that the game is not super balanced, there are some fighters who just got luckier in development than others. And the MK1 Kombat Pack 1 being available but none of the content released at launch is a huge negative. Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, who are BOTH in the base game, ALREADY as fighters, you have to play against and you have to pay for them, is a joke.

Kameo: Oh boy, this one has been a wild ride. Some Kameos are absolutely useful as hell. Then you get some Kameos who are just useless. The idea behind the Kameo system is absolutely amazing and I really hope for MK2 or in MK1 updates, we get some updates on it. But as of right now, pick Sareena and just rolfmao.

Kombat Leagues: Oh boy. its just best of 5. Tier 1 - 3, you can't lose any ranking. So, just spam your games out to get the seasonal rewards to hit Tier 4.

Warrior Shrine: Still locked, can't review anything.

All in all, I have 42 hours on MK1. I absolutely love the game and can't wait to keep sinking more hours in. At this time, i've hit Tier 4 in Kombat League, finished all the invasion kontent, did all the towers and am sitting at about 35% kompleteion rate of the kollection.

Can't recommend it enough if your new to the series and hopefully will have the same kinda experience i've had with the game. Can't wait to log another 40 hours.",1697656282,1697656282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Without much experiance, MK1 was easy to pick up, but offering a good amount of depth. The roster is nice, including fan-favourites as well as some obscure characters, who all feel unique. I especially like the gameplay, kameo system and visual style. Unfortunately, the story mode disappointed me. It felt fresh at the beginning but after 3/4 mark it started to be way too weird and messy for my liking. I had fun nontheless. The game itself also lacks some key features like pinning moves in training mode, match lobbies, changing skin in character select etc. - mostly quality of life stuff. What I dislake is Invasions mode. It's boring, repetitive, and even with a lot of rewards hidden there I prefer top play online and get skins amd gear from the Shrine. Mortal Kombat 1 also has some technical issues. Even though my PC should handle the game well and for most of the time I can play i twith very hight graphic settings with little o no bad effect on performance, the game crashed many times. It happend more in the first day after the realease, now it seems to be fixed but still sometimes happens. In conclusion it's a very fun and exciting game, that simply needs more polish.

Just a disclaimer, I can't say I did not have fun in this game because I for sure did. It is a good time but the cracks will start showing and will only deepen until you will realize this game has had mixed focus on its features but its replayability is lacking in many ways I will get into.

I am a huge MK fan but I joined late in about 2013. My favorite to this day is MKX and still holds best and coolest combos. This MK1 introduces many ways to build combos which is quite awesome but sometimes these feel so drawn out and similar to MK11's gravity. Kameos are a great addition but is it really something new? I swear we had something similar in MK11 towers where we could use some character's help every now and then. Kameos bring new ways to play BUT they take fighters away. The kameos will almost never talk meaning they can put anyone in the role but I for one I am annoyed many of them are JUST kameo fighters and not normal fighters, with unique voicelines and more moves. As a Jax main, I miss punching the hell out of the opponents but I can only resort to some combo extenders foir others...

Story is entertaining but it gets messy until its very end, just like MK11 but with more weird shit. It is cool seeing all these returning characters, however I wish for some characters they had kept same voice actors. It is also inexcusable to have story characters as DLC...like Ermac & Quan Chi. Waiting for them will be pain...

Invasions mode is such a weird RPG board game kinda thing that takes centuries to progress and its fights become annoying as hell with unblockable, uninterruptible characters & random effects that just makes you mad. You can tone the fuckery down with the syringes & upgrading your character as you level up.

And one of my main points is the replayability: once you've gone through invasions & story you will realize you have such meaningless and similar looking gear & pallettes to choose from...these feel so lazy and barely noticeable sometimes. Very few are creative and cool but guess what...most of those are PAID SKINS! Skins that may cost even 10$??? In an already 100$ game? This is beyond greedy. Grinding this game is barely worth the hassle for now, they gotta do better.

And for the really ugly: unfinished stuff. The story sometimes has insane lag & desync from subtitles, fades to black randomly despite me doing the shaders precompilation...Oh my god the menus take FOREVER...moving in invasions as well...I can't skip anything before & after a fight...just WHY?? Especially in singleplayer...Also training doesnt let me pin any moves, there is no crossplay, the brutalities have sometimes weird inputs to them but not as bad as MK11's. The character intros could have used 3 lines instead of 2 and make them less boring. There are no friendships(yet), but we got kameo fatalities which are cool I guess.

There are so many more I'd like to point out but it's already getting long enough. Do I recommend this game? To a degree and a certain price drop, yes....but for 70 bucks I will definitely not. The game can be fun but has many many issues that could be fixed in time and IF they actually make the game better, I will then recommend the game and change my review. But for now, this game feels so much like early access & knowing some characters will NEVER be main characters, but just kameos kinda hurts, man. My man Tremor did not deserve that, as well as Jax, Sonya & Kano and all the others honestly. The gameplay can be quite awesome and addicting but your rewards are usually so meaningless and not much different.

I love Mortal Kombat so I've been playing it a lot but this is THE buggiest piece of garbage I've ever seen. It needs sorting out, I know that's not gonna happen though because they don't care, they proved that when they abandoned MK11.

Bugs I've seen:
1. Reptile in his reptile form at the end of matches when the Main roster character and the Kameo pose for the victory screen, his lips jiggle around
2. Random props jiggling around on brutality screens like Shao's axe
3. At the end of a classic tower you see Shang and Quan Chi being knocked into a hole, then your two characters stand and pose at the top, I used Cyrax one time and his Saw was floating in front of him
4. I played a tower in invasions in the gateway bit and I lost against Mileena, but the continue button didn't show up for like 30-45 seconds because she was doing a very slow motion teleport animation and she disappeared until it was just her hair left glowing pink
5. The things on the ground to let you know which towers you're going to in the gateway area are wrong, i.e., the weekly, daily and hourly things are labelled wrong
6. A handful of things in the menus are wrong like brutality requirements or how many bars of meter certain moves cost (this is fucking basic shit, get it fixed, its disgusting that the previous games have this polish and this game for some reason is exempt)
7. Mileena's amplified (ground) ball roll sometimes misses, she makes contact with the opponent but when she slams the sais into what is supposed to be the opponents feet she does it the wrong way and you've wasted a bar of meter

I can honestly say that I haven't witnessed any bugs in MKX or 11. This is a massive step back, the company and devs should be completely ashamed of what they've released. Its an incomplete mess. There are things in the menus that are greyed out and unavailable. They've taken out features of previous games like rooms. What the actual fuck is going on?

What were they thinking with the gateway towers? Why do your combos get interrupted every few seconds, is that supposed to be fun? Its not, but was that the intent?

I KNOW this is going to fall on deaf ears though. I will actually be surprised if they fix this stuff.

I originally wrote a review where I recommended the game despite its flaws but more flaws keep cropping up and its beyond a joke. That's not even taking into account how PC players get screwed over by poor optimisation.

TL;DR if you're someone who is looking at this as your first fighting game or first Mortal Kombat game, I promise you its not worth it right now. Get MKX or 11 instead.

Edit: I found another bug, I play as Mileena a lot so if I'm finding this many bugs on one character there must be tons that I'm not seeing - I used the amplified (air) ball roll in an online match and the sound effect lasted until both rounds had been completed.

I'm also gonna consider the following a bug:
Some attacks whiff on against Baraka which seems COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS considering how easy it is for him to deal 50% damage. I do Mileena's 1,2 attack and the third hit misses and boom he's done 50% damage. Its shit.",1695823915,1697626034,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tons of oversight like they never had anyone playtest the game at all, for example: 
mileena ex low sai requires you have 2 meter even tho it only costs 1, 
her ex air special randomly doesn't cost meter and can be spammed rapidly, 
Nitara hover randomly takes meter even though its a meterless move, 
etc...  

Every crash dumps a 1gb+ crash report into your appdata folder to clutter up your computer. 
Online is horrible and crashes even more than offline. 
Tons of brutalities have badly coded requirements that aren't stated and or also glitch out horribly like they didn't even bother to finish coding it, the movelist menu is broken, frame data is wrong, dialogue shows up as mk12_dialogue_4532, sometimes a characters name or a menu title shows up as tweakVar. 
Actually playing against another player feels like all the worst parts of mk11 with slower strings that make combos last longer in a painfully boring way.

i really really hate that the characters talk in the character select screen and not in their intros, i feel like that makes playing towers (at least for me) super super lifeless, its just awkward not hearing a single word get spoken in the intro and instead just the characters doing little party tricks, they shouldve just put the voicelines after the hidden loading screen and then have them talk in the intro, but whatever

another one of my main issues with the game is that there is just abso-fucking-lutely NOTHING worth playing here, i really couldnt give a fuck less about the campaign, not interested in it like at all, invasions is stupid, truly, its just not fun. The little encounters are so boring that i actually was falling asleep while playing it!

there are almost NO rewards or customization. where did all of it go? what happened to the customization from Injustice 2 and MK11? ""oh but Tricky Dick, what kind of customization is in this game?"" well im glad you asked citizen and registered voter, the answer is NONE! there is NONE! remember Marvels Avengers? of course you do, it sucked, THAT GAME HAD BETTER CUSTOMIZATION THAN THIS GAME, im gonna use Smoke for example, heres the amount of customization you can do, equip a new mask, change the color palette for a fighter (like a destiny shader but somehow even worse) thats about it!  want something slightly cooler? Too bad! You have to pay for it with Micro Transactions! Yippee! Oh i almost forgot to mention you can buy lootboxes, fortunately you buy them with the gold coins you earn, unfortunately, you can buy lootboxes.

theres no krypt, thats really all i can say about that, the fact that they dont have krypt really just makes this game feel so empty, Krypt is pretty much replaced with Invasions, which is like a less fun more boring way of playing Krypt

the game is locked at 60 fps with cutscenes locked at 30 fps for whatever reason, making it look incredibly janky

i cant for the life of me get into an online lobby at any time of the day, that never happened with MK11

The Pro's:

- Invasion Mode has flaws but overall I enjoyed the leveling process and playing to unlock the Scorpion Skin. The game needs more singleplayer modes like this.
- There is actually some decent single player content in it, which will be seasonal.
- The Kameo system, the ease of fatalities and the overall system is pretty good.
- Despite some problems the first half of the story mode is pretty good. (i saw it already online, i'm currently not fully through it yet but I know where it leads)

Contra's:

- The monetisation is quite something...
- There is much less customisation.
- Invasion has too many cases of armor or where you and the oppponent suffer every 2 or so seconds from suffocation, stunning/interrupting the characters.
- Needs far more single player content.
- Bi Han (the original Sub Zero) and Shao Kahn start with promise and end up ruined quickly. 
- The storyline is a reboot for the first 3/4s and then jumps the shark again with multivere nonsense. And even from the start there are things tying it into the previous games. A full reboot would have been better with a more restrained scope and better writing. For example: do the original MK 1 Earthreal and MK2 Outworld Tournaments. Then end there. In future games then move on to things like Shinnok or the Deadly Alliance.


Conclusion:

Good basis.
Fun for fans of the franchise.

Whats WORRYING?

- Woke content (gender swaps, race swaps, transcitioning character)
- Desexualized Female characters but Sexualized Male Characters.


Come on Mortal Kombat, you can do much better than Disney and Netflix.

The gameplay feels, so god damn good, the animations are tight and responsive, not stiff like NRS games have been for years, I especially love the solid hits and simple brutality of my main man Reiko.

The game looks beautiful even on the low graphics that I am running it on, and despite warnings of bad optimisation, I have found the game to be pretty stable, save for a few rare crashes, so personally performance is pretty good for me but I can't speak for everyone, my computer is a weird frankenstein's monster that cannot run fortnite, elder scrolls online or GTA V; but can run shit like WH40k Darktide and, well, this game.

The most shocking bit is just how good the music is? Like it genuinely gets me hyped up during matches, NRS games have had such awful music for YEARS just the most forgettable dreck imaginable, but this time around they got a few stand out bangers, the final round of Living Forest being my absolute favorite

The story, is, admittedly, kinda ""so bad it's good"" for most of it's run time, does fall into a few annoying cliches that MCU movies find them in (I fucking hate the MCU), but I tried my best to go into it with an open mind and found that the characters are surprisingly well written across the board, save for a few. And, without spoiling anything, the story does end up going in a direction I did not expect, and I love it! I genuinely enjoyed the last, quarter of the story I'd say, though, that last super interesting quarter felt waaaaay too short, I am VERY much looking forward to the upcoming story expansion, I have an open mind to whatever wacky bullshit they wanna pull!

The monetisation is still complete hogwash though, please stop charging for cosmetics in a game that costs 100 canadian dollars for the standard edition, I just wanna dress up my hot roman man.

The gameplay is fun and the story presentation and writing is better than NetherRealm's usual mark (though that may not be saying much), but single and multiplayer experiences leave alot of be desired. NetherRealm have said that they plan on supporting MK1 for a while, possibly as long as MK11, so we will wait and see whether the game improves with balance changes and bug fixes.

If you're still on the fence, I would hold off until the first major update in order to balance Invasions and fix any game crashing bugs.

Gameplay: It just boils down to ""do the same 20 second long 30% combo three times each match"" and jailing.  I think that kameos are a big culprit in why this is the case with the combos.  Jailing is a REALLY bad concept (, and it's what this game is.  Without jailing, there is no MK1.  So, if jailing is bad and this game is centered around jailing, this game is bad.

Ranked: Structured terribly.  No placement matches means everyone starts at the lowest rank.  This becomes problematic when you reach a higher rank and get matched up against a very good player who just started ranked.  When you win, you gain points (obviously).  When you win against someone who is a lower rank than you, you gain less points and lose more.  So, I could be matched up against someone who is better than me but is the lowest rank, giving me a possible point gain of like 3 but a possible point loss of like 50.
	Rank is account-based, not character-based.  So, if I play any other character than my main, I will get stomped on.
	Sets are best of 5 instead of best of 3, which is dumb.  It means that a player has to sit through up to 5 matches to gain <10% of a rank.  Also you can only quit early if you lose the round, so if you beat someone who camped the whole time you might have to sit through it again.
	
Invasions: Just boring.  Play against some enemy, do a combo twice, beat the enemy, move on.  Sometimes you have to button-mash too.  Zzzzzzzzzz

Story: Good story-wise, ok gameplay-wise, but bad experience-wise.  If you are at a fight and decide to exit the game, it will save your progress, but when you go to continue it puts you back at the start of the cutscene before the fight.  This wouldn't be an issue because you can skip cutscenes, but you can't actually skip the cutscene until about a minute has passed.  Why?  Also, if you fail a fight you have to watch/listen to a small wind-up dialogue for about 7 seconds.  Why?  I just want to try again, I don't want to hear the same thing 20 times.  Also, there is no clear indication of the next roung starting each fight.  This makes it so you can't act as fast as your opponent, giving them an advantage.  I don't get why they didn't just have it say ""fight"" like it does online.

Misc:
 - Nitara voice acting
 - Crouch block into stand block just doesn't work.  I never let go of the block button, let go of the stick, SEE MY CHARACTER START TO STAND, and still get hit by an overhead.  People other than me have also encountered this, and it is very stupid that you get punished for doing the right thing
 - Some maps make it hard to see what is happening, which could be solved by allowing for client-side map picking.  It wouldn't affect anything because the stage doesn't add anything to the fight like it did in MK11.
 - Throw escape is inconsistent.  I do it right most of the time (maybe not the right direction but it should still say escape failed) but it doesn't work.  Also if you are mid grab wind-up your opponent can still grab you, in which case there SHOULD be a mutual throw escape like in every other video game.
 - Matches take way too long to load into, which is a pretty major downside
 - Seasonal cosmetics (I personally don't like the idea of timed collectibles, but I know most people are probably fine with them).
 - Fatal blows are half kameo half player, when it really should be all player.",1697481847,1697481847,False,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

The game is out for a month and the PC port is still plagued by disconnects, desynchronization, horrible connections and absolutely horrible balance.

- The game has no way to create a lobby with your friends, it only supports 1 v1 and those connections drop frequently
- King of the Hill doesn't work for invites, the lobby only works for the first invitee to accept and the other people are shut out
- Online games frequently desynchronize where you cannot get into a ranked match or Kasual Match
- No way to filter on connection type or quality and no way to back out unless the ping is more than 150
- Characters and kameos are not even close to balanced: Ranked consists almost exclusively of Barakka/Cyra, Johny/Cyrax and one or two others but guess what the Kameo is? Yep, Cyrax.

Gameplay-wise I would not recommend it, but those issues can get fixed with balance patches.

story mode is one of their better stories imop

invasions is okay it needs a bit more spice

after invasions theres nothing to do but do a boring grind for each characters alt skins default color or max rank if you are a singleplayer only enjoyer like myself
if you are planning to just play singleplayer be aware that there isnt that much atm hopefull future seasons will have more content for singleplayer so i can recommend this game

Invasions can only be played while connected online and a lot of the BS battles just aren't fun. 
Some characters that were IN THE STORY MODE are locked behind a paywall. 
Exclusive Johnny skin that was for premium edition only is now on the shop for everyone to buy one month into the game. 
Skins are 10 dollars a piece (so is the Shang Tsung announcer VFX). This game isn't free-to-play Fortnite. Many of us spent $100+ on this game. Stop up charging so much on content. 
Multiplayer is a MESS. Unlike SF6, you can't see your opponent's connection or reject the fight if it's bad. You can't view replays, create clubs, or make lobbies. All of that can be done in SF6 too. 
The ranks in multiplayer are a BIG GRIND. It shouldn't be too much of an issue, but 95% of people in the top 3 ranks are abusing the most broken, unskilled characters and kameos: Johnny Cage, Raiden, and Baraka for main charactes while there's Jax and Cyrax for kameos (sometimes Kano for OP Cage setup). It's just the same thing over and over again. They're top tier because they have mix ups and have you constantly guessing where to block - and if you guess wrong for one hit, there goes about 40% of your health. I should also mention there was a Player 1 advantage bug for the first 2-3 weeks where player 2 wouldn't be able to land some combos because gravity differences.

Now, I usually don't care for bugs unless they prevent me from experiencing the game, which in this case they lock me out from obtaining rewards (kombat league) + playing with friends, option to rematch, and finally inability to play kombat league. In addition to that I am profile level 33 but don't got the Scorpion kameo LMAO. 

To expand:
I cannot play kombat league, I get desynced at the start before the match even starts (I have gigabit internet) apparently it might be related to the fact that I don't got the scorpion kameo, but who knows it isn't like they will give it to me. I can apparently just family share it to another steam account to fix it, but like after all this progress you just want me to start over because of sh*tty coding? Fuck no. I cannot even rematch against my friends in private matches because I would just desync every time without fail.

I also experience controller disconnected messages every time I don't touch a button while being comboed (am connected using wire lmao), this also happens to another one of my friends who has a PS4 slim controller (like me) but not my friend who has the older gen controller.

Overall game feels rushed asf, the bugs I mentioned were not even close to everything, they are just the highlights that affected my ability to play.

The themes for invasions will cycle out every couple of months or so but I feel it will just be more of the same at the end of the day. An unfulfilling, mindless grind. I really wish they would stop with the gimmicky voice actor choices for these characters just for the sake of popularity. We should have a choice for an alternate Nitara's  voice actress, I am not a fan of Megan Fox voicing an iconic 3D era character and I would actually pay money to have the option. I'm sorry but she does not fit the bill. She fits it about as much as Rhonda Rousey did voicing Sonya Blade in MK11. Rhonda Rousey definitely did a better job though.  Not to mention there were some glitches in the game which they have patched that are completely inexcusable. I don't know where they put the focus here in this release. The character models look as amazing as ever. I just wish the game did them justice.",1697320041,1697320041,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

you really killed mk11 for this????? killed a game that needed one balance patch to be the perfect fighting game for this mess?

you get into the actual match, they do a string into a move and call the assist to make it safe, if not plus, rinse and repeat.... oorrrrr they do a string that is almost punishable and when you try to take your turn, they just do their armored move, which is punishable, BUT WAIT, they call their assist to make it safe.. rinse and repeat, as you can see, it's just boring and so not worth playing.",1695762516,1697308855,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The kameos are a fun addition. While I think the story opens up for a lot more problems in future installments, it's fun enough here and most of the cast sounds great (Megan Fox is an unfortunate exception here). Invasions are different from the Krypt, but fun enough. Graphics are great, music is great; overall, the presentation and base gameplay of MK1 are rock solid, and normally I would recommend this game.

Unfortunately, I cannot say this without mentioning that, in its current state, you must be willing to deal with outright consumer hostility from the leadership responsible for the direction MK1 has taken in regards to progression and online play. 

First of all, progression. This game has four different kinds of currency: Koins (for the Shrine, where you wait 5 seconds for a stupid animation to play before getting a random cosmetic), Seasonal Currency (for the seasonal shop), Dragon Krystals (for PREMIUM cosmetics from the seasonal shop), and the Invasion currency I can't recall the name of that you'll never end up using because talismans are usually not necessary. While I get the idea behind splitting these currencies up for different purposes, I cannot agree with the amounts you gain for performing tasks in the game. 25 seasonal currency for a daily quest? 250 for a weekly? 100 seasonal currency and koins for completing a tower? When skins cost maybe 1000 or 1500 at minimum, with the featured seasonal skins costing 6000 and 4000? 

That grind you're being asked to perform for these skins is present all over MK1. Character and Kameo mastery? A grind. Reaching Elder God online? A grind. It feels as though someone who has only ever worked on F2P mobile games was contracted to help NRS form the progression system for MK1. There's overall less gear to grind for considering they've stripped the number of gear slots from 3 to 1 from MK11, but that's not really a plus. 

So it's grindy. Unfortunately, the online also just feels wrong. I'm no netcode student, but other fighting games just seem to have cleaner connections on the whole. With no background matchmaking and no cross play, it really feels like MK1 online was designed by someone from the early 2000s of fighting game design. Also, sets are best of 5. You can one-and-done, but the amount of LP you gain is usually quite minuscule if you don't finish sets, meaning that the online is (you guessed it) grindier than other titles in the series. 

It's very sad to see a game either get rushed out the door or hamstrung by leadership decisions like this, because there is fun to be had playing MK1. It's just mired in modern gaming crap meant to squeeze every dime and second it can out of you. If you can deal with all of that or just don't mind it, there's a good fighting game here, but keep in mind that the practices behind it are profit driven at your expense.",1697262960,1697262960,False,1,1,0.521531105041503906,0,True,False,False

After playing some more I'm updating this review with some negatives. I mostly played in Local versus mode which is the way I've always liked playing MK the most, I've no interest in online play.

- P2 cannot see any of their finishing moves in the pause menu. No idea why this is done. Its annoying for new players.
- No krypts :(
- Invasion mode is boring and kinda sucks, time spend making it should have been put in additional playable characters available straight from the start.
- Fatal Blows...blow because you can basically always block them (90% of the time its 100% effective!) 
- Cool characters and extras locked behind season pass and special editions. (meh!)
- Hardly any focus on local VS, its all about online and I don't care about online.

+ Gameplay is solid, compared to older MK's there a much bigger focus on getting enemies airborn and then juggle them with some combos. 
+ Graphics look great (Playing on a Ryzen 7, 4070Ti @ 1440p All maxed out)
+ Local 1on1 versus games are still fun.
+ Singleplayer towers, the story mode is nice for some (new) lore

All in all, the positives make it ok to play, but at times all the negatives make it feel mediocre at best. And I really hate that all the cool extra's (characters!) are all locked behind season bundles... Meh!  I don't care about season passes, I just want all the content to be available when I buy a game. It sucks when devs do this and act like season passes are a gift from the Gods... cause they're not, they're a llame way to tie players longer to the game. It sucks and should stop.

The single player content is absolutely abysmal, which in turn makes getting better at the game more difficult, because there isn't any fun single player content to practice with

The switch to a live service game was great fro finances, but poor for the player experience. A couple of charters have a meaningful amount of unlocks(Scopion and Johny Cage), and the rest have scraps like they were forgotten about

Most characters have one alternate skin, and most of them are terrible, its the same generic monk cloths for 80% of the cast, until next season when a whapping three characters will get the attention that scopion and Johny cage received.

At this rate, the game will need to be out an entire year before it matches the content of MK11, and imo the online matchmaking isnt as good

The kameo system isnt for me, it allows players that are already masters to have an additional leg up over any regular person who finds these games hard, but likes the satisfaction of slowly getting better

A good player can take 30% combo to a 50% combo with the right use of the kameo system, and i dont think good players needed to shit out an additional 20% damage.",1697227628,1697227628,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Personally I have enjoyed MK since day one, the real MK 1 as it seems. The combos are so extreme if you even miss one input while playing you pretty much will lose all your health after the opponent counters. Easily the worst feeling in any fighting game I have experienced before. This will likely push new players away from playing this game.

The environments and character design are amazing! Sometimes I found myself more impressed with the environments then playing the game. The move sets are visually entertaining! The fatalities and brutalities are on another level. NRS did an amazing job here!

In online match-ups there is constant dropped frames or ending of match-ups randomly. You will be playing and in mid stride the match is dropped. There are also times where things just freeze up and you have to restart the entire game. At the time of this writing there is also no cross-platform available. (To be fair they did mention this would be added later.)

I am very tough on studios like this who have massive finance to build games on this scale. It is 2023 and their are things in games that are a standard now. No cross-platform at launch is a dropped ball, not having hit boxes applying when they should is a dropped ball. The lighting on the characters in the stages...is a dropped ball...These are incredibly easy adjustments in a game to fix...It is multiple weeks and no change...

The mechanics are better than MK11, the combos have double the potential, and the story mode looks absolutely beautiful with Unreal Engine 5. To save us both time, let's get straight into pros and cons:
PROS:
- Mechanics: Up block, armored EX attacks, Combo breaker, down1 being punishable, combo potential, Fatal Blow nerfed, dash cancels, air combos, flawless block attacks removed, KB removed
- Customization: Seasonal credits are easily acquirable, especially if you play invasion game mode. Each character has one piece of gear, and one pallet. You play a character, you get progression and rewards for THAT character (Unlike Injustice 2). You cannot customize character intros, but you can pick and choose end of round taunts now. Each character has one signature piece of gear you can customize, and honestly I don't mind it.
- Graphic design: The maps are beautiful, and the transition into a fight is smoother than ever with the clash-like intro. Although there are no environmental interactions (fine by me), certain objects in the background get broken during the fight.
- You can kick Johnny Cage's Roomba during the fight.

CONS:
- Dashes do still feel a tad short, but I am coming from Injustice 2.
- Although my computer is nearly at recommended specs, the game is not running very consistently. 60 FPS most times, and then sometimes the games drops frames or freezes for a moment. The optimizations recommended by the community that you can do via control panel and task manager help a lot, but this game still has some bugs to work out it would seem (Such as the opponents head floating during a classic brutality).
- Certain fighters are earned by playing (Kameos unlock with account levels, but is not hard to get - Havik is unlocked by playing the campaign).
- Graphics setting are oddly laid out. At first I thought there was no detailed settings, but I realized that you have to press another button to see them.

I really enjoy playing playing MK1 at times, but it feels hard for me to fully recommend this game with some major issues still persisting a month after the release. For context, I've been playing fighting games since Marvel vs Capcom 2 on the PS3, and further back if you include Smash Melee. My last Mortal Kombat game that I fully got into was MK9 on PS3. I've played the story of MKX recently. Safe to say, I had positive expectations going into this game. 

Simply put, the issues plaguing the PC port, lackluster optimization, Invasion issues, online and visual bugs, and yes, crashes, are still present, and that saves me from giving this game a fully positive rating.

I enjoyed the story, but the formula for setting up story fights has gotten fatigued at this point. Many times, a character has the ability to kill off an enemy, but chooses not to because of plot armor, and this gets in the way of good storytelling, sadly. There's times where characters just be jogging somewhere and it's unintentionally funny. I liked the finale, but like many have said it feels a bit rushed. 

The game as a whole feels rushed to a point. A month after release and brutality animations are still bugged, and some are near impossible to perform. The PC port is, in general, poorly optimized. I have a PC that can run almost every modern AAA game at high settings with no issues, and yet, this game cannot run at 60FPS unless I lower it to 720p, which is embarrassing. The shrine takes forever just to open a pointless lootbox animation that, most times, never feels rewarding. Most of your rewards are going to be concept art. 

Worse yet, online play feels like a slog sometimes. For some godforsaken reason Ranked battles are locked to 3/5, and you cannot back out if you have won the match, only if you have lost. This is 2023, and we are still dealing with a lackluster online experience with:
-very poor connections with players
-no ability to deny those bad connections
-no ability to host truly private lobbies
-locked casual matches with matchmaking only with those of similar winrate, which defeats the purpose of casual matches in the first place
-no crossplay?!
-crashes upon multiple Kasual Games played in a row (did anyone test this?)

I don't like to make comparisons to other fighting games that have very different flavors and playerbases, but this is not the experience I would have expected from a AAA title at full price.

I do have many positive things to say about the game, however, such as the presentation of many of the characters, variety of color and variety in the maps/arenas, great campy voice acting (other than megan fox, yes, who is not a trained voice actor) and the creativity with movesets, even if combos and fatal blows tend to overstay their welcome in terms of length.
Strangely I also really like that Microphone chat is on by default. It's fun to hear people express themselves when they lose (and sometimes win), even if it's a bit toxic.

To sum things up, I had a friend ask me if he should get MK1, and I told him straight up to play other games until they fix the issues and to try to get the game discounted. And that's what  would recommend to you guys. Just be a patient gamer, and wait. Play things you enjoy playing. This is not a priority release, unless you are a fighting game or MK diehard.

-Very good story
-One of the best rooster in MK history
-Every character is unique and fun to play
-Gorgeous graphics 
-Good gameplay
-Skins are cool

Cons:
-In Invasion the character lvl up takes forever
-There is no dialogue between the characters before fight, only in 1v1, and the dialogues are not as good as it was in MK11
-Character customization is also a step back from MK11, you can alter only one item, and usually its barely visible
-If you play local multiplayer, player 2 has no custom skins, and cannot see the fatality inputs. I hope this is just a bug, and will be fixed soon. 
-Invasion is not as fun as the Krypt in MK11. The idea is good, but it gets very repetitive soon.

Overall, its a good game, the Cons are fixable. I hope they address these issues, and add more content with updates.",1697179423,1697179500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game gets so many things right and so many things wrong but over all i would still recommend, but i would recommend it even more when issues get fixed.

First this games gameplay is the funnest i had in any mk game the kameo feels fresh and really good the combos are really smooth and fluid. There are a few teams that need a nerf badly but that doesnt excuse the fact that the gameplay is good. the story feels really good i liked it, it was fun and funny imo i would rate it 9/10. But what really missed in this game for me is the presentation and detail that mk 11 had. I dont know why but a lot of things are missing from this game that were in 11. the intros and outros are much worse the gear system is much worse and no krypt? which imo is better than ivasions which is a boring endless grind. 
I feel like if this game had the essentials of mk11 this would be a masterpiece. also not to mention there are a lot of bugs. i have a really good pc and a lot of frame stuttering and it is capped at 30fps at moments. 
I dont really care about skins so these people complaining about it i dont really care since it doesnt affect gameplay.
i also wish they had added a tag team mode, missed opportunity in a kameo team system it wouldve been really easy to add a 2v2 mode.

Go play Street Fighter while you wait for them to add content. 

I'd like to preface this by saying I am a huge Mortal Kombat fan. I love this series so much and it hurts all the more seeing NRS releasing such an undercooked title. 
The Good:
-Amazing and satisfying combos. Combined with graphics it feels so clean laying into your opponents
-Roster is the best it's been since MK9 with most of the ninjas and 3D era kharacters making a return
-Stunning graphics
-Timeline reset is a breath of fresh air, seeing former jobber kharacters assume better roles

The BAD:
-TWENTY DOLLAR SKINS in a game that is 70 DOLLARS MINIMUM. It is outrageous that a game this expensive is charging 20 dollars for skins you can't unlock unlike in MK11 where you only paid if you didn't want to grind. Skin packs from MK11 gave THREE skins and they weren't even this expensive.
-Invasions has got to be the worst grind NRS ever made. The battles are tedious, the minigames get old fast, and the rewards you get stink. Did I mention it's the only way to earn xp at a reasonable pace? Basically, if you want the only other skin available for kharacters, you have to grind for hours on end, doing the same battles over and over which leads to my next point.
-Very little content. Like, 2 skins per kharacter, some of them have 3. This isn't because they didn't make any skins, they're just drip feeding them through the seasonal invasions. So basically, until next month's invasions, you'll be seeing a lot of brown and red since that's the theme for this month. Everyone has the same skin because there isn't any more to unlock. The shrine, which has replaced the krypt for a place to spend koins, is a discount gacha system that drops random rewards. It can be completely drained with just over 120,000 koins which can be earned in very little time. Seeing such little content at launch for the most expensive title to date is depressing especially when you look at MK11 which had dozens of skins and gear for each kharacter AT LAUNCH.
-The PC port is TERRIBLE. Even on a high end PC it suffers from random stutters and caps out at 30 fps. This is unacceptable for a 70 dollar game in 2023.
-Essential features from previous titles are just missing. No pinning moves means you need to constantly go to the menu and study a long sheet of specials and combos every time you want to play a new kharacter. Into dialogues can only be seen in single battles against the CPU or online players, they can't be seen in towers at all. There's also no way to change skins or gear quickly in the kharacter selection, only in the menu. 

This game was a massive let down. It's depressing that the new norm for triple A games is to release them unfinished or with a lack of content just to add it later. There is no excuse for this game to have so little content at launch for 70 bucks. If you are a Mortal Kombat fan and are on the fence about buying this game, I'd say wait for a sale or wait for them to add more content. If this is the first Mortal Kombat you've considered buying; don't. Just go play street fighter or some other fighting game that has devs that give a shit. 4/10",1697174114,1697174114,False,1,0,0.488997548818588257,0,True,False,False

Story Wise: Felt rush. First half the story was fine. Second half was a snoozefest. Just Youtube the story because it's pretty nonsensical and cringe. Slight spoiler: I thought this game was going to be a true reboot but it's far from it. It is a sequel and it does the worst offense ever. It makes every event not matter moving forward.

Gameplay Wise: Absolutely. However, customizing your controls honestly suck and it's definitely a game I hard recommend Arcade Stick for. Playing on control is a handicap just because you cannot map multiples of the same button. This comes out because the meter attacks are tricky to time and having to time a command input to a trigger sucks. And remapping block to a button feels rather awkward. But the gameplay is really solid and every hit feels so incredibly impactful. It is a slower pace fighting games on more of the pace of Virtua Fighter then compared to Street Fighter or Tekken. Every input matters a lot and needs prior planning ahead.",1697165792,1697165792,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mortal Kombat has forever been THE casual fighting game, huge playerbase, massive appeal, etc. I find it quite puzzling since the game isn't necessarily easy or ""dumbed down"" like a lot of japanese FGs are trying to do to bring in the casual crowd, its the average MK experience with some characters requiring quite a bit of execution - Kenshi comes to mind for example - yet even then it wasn't just the mechanics that brought in the casual crowd, it was the single-player content MK was known for. A vast campaign, a somewhat decent plot, some kind of single-player enjoyable content like The Krypt, Test Your Might, the fatalities, the unlockable character customization, and so on.

This entry in the series though while it does live up in expectations for a good fighting game, hell it might even be the best systems MK has ever had, it does not provide quality single-player content to warrant a purchase from the vast majority of the fanbase.

After the grandiose success of SF6 and its reinventing of the FG single-player experience, MK1 simply fails to provide even a smidgeon of content when compared to Capcom's masterpiece, and while it does have deep and engaging systems for players who ARE interested in the ""fighting"" aspect, the character customization and single-player content has very little enjoyment to be had for the average buyer.

Invasions are a weak replacement for The Krypt, they're incredibly slow and uninteresting to progress through and feel tacked on amidst a game begging for real content. It has a ton of unnecesary fights and really annoying ""effects"" during the fights that make them incredibly annoying to do. Especially the fucking slow effect, that one sucks.

The multiplayer also has its issues, the ranking system is very barebones and doesn't have a per-character rank so you're always scared of trying new things, the connection to the servers too was very poor during launch, but that has since been fixed. Lobbies have also not returned, which makes the experience of playing against friends inherently frustrating since everyone just has to matchmake each other through the friend list.

Overall the multiplayer aspect of the game is incredibly outdated even when compared to older titles like Skullgirls, Tekken 7 or even MK11!

With all that said tho, I do recommend it. Even with all of these issues I've still been massively enjoying it, I feel like my money was well spent because the GAME part of the game is incredible, I love fighting games and this one is no exception. Maybe I'm biased since MK has never dumbed down its mechanics, but everytime I play it I just have fun. The characters, the kombos, the kameo system, everything related to the FIGHTING aspect is just fantastic. The balancing of characters and assists is the best NRS has ever had (not as good as SF6 but better than NRS's previous titles) and the visuals and animations have greatly improved.

I've never been a fan of MK so this lack of content doesn't affect me in the slightest, all I wanted was a good fighting game and I got it. If however you're looking for single-player ""kontent"" like in SF6, or even like in previous entries to the series you might be sorely disappointed. I, however, really really like it.",1697144279,1697144321,True,1,0,0.496327400207519531,1,True,False,False

Game is great. If you're an MK fan you'll like it hands down. BUTTTTTT Performance is abysmal. Anything that isnt direct gameplay is locked to 30fps. That'd be one issue, but the fact that being capped to 30fps with frame drops is unacceptable for a modern $70 game. Most people spend thousands on PC builds to enjoy games the way the should be and to have cut scenes and game modes drop to 20-25 fps is just insulting.
