Yet,  their classic games were much better.   They used to sell you full-games instead of piecemeal DLC sets and their final products were 95% bug free.

While the game certainly has its fair share of drawbacks, it offers a unique sense of immersion that I've grown to love.

Set in the tumultuous period of Chinese history known as the Three Kingdoms era, you're given the opportunity to step into the shoes of iconic figures such as the courageous Guan Yu or the enchanting Diao Chan. And this is where the game truly shines - the ability to shape these historical figures in ways that deviate from their traditional portrayals.

Imagine Diao Chan, one of the reputed Four Beauties of ancient China, ruling with an iron fist, or the legendary warrior Guan Yu outwitting opponents with his strategic acumen. This sort of role-reversal is not only entertaining but also offers an interesting new perspective on these famous figures.

However, the game is not without its criticisms. The grand combat, a key element in any Three Kingdoms game, does feel somewhat lackluster, especially when compared to the impressive system in Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI.

Moreover, the game isn't as free as some Paradox games, with many significant events requiring strict conditions to be met. And it's true that regardless of which character you play, your role as a minister can often feel repetitive, offering similar experiences whether you're a renowned general like Guan Yu or a less-known character. Of course you may play as an assasin, a trader etc, but each path is fixed to some unique style of playing and the repeatability is a little restricted.

It's also worth noting that some may argue other games in the series or even other Koei Tecmo titles offer a more immersive or unrestricted experience. However, as my first dip into the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, XIII struck a chord with me.

Despite the criticisms, the ability to drastically alter the lives and personalities of my favorite characters from one of the most exciting periods of Chinese history makes for an addictive gaming experience. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, for me, Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII was a flavorful brew that I savored down to the last drop.",1686893630,1686893630,True,5,0,0.552421808242797852,0,True,False,False

No matter what by late game where your part of an other force or leading your own the game boils down to a very repetitive sequence of raise armies in all your towns and send them to attack enemy towns. which could leave you looking at a battle you arn't a part of take place for ages or if you do join in the battle constant enemy reinforcements arriving to make the battle seem unending.

Ok, so I gave this game some decent play time to review, and I feel I owe it a fair update.  Out of the gate I did not like it.  However, after spending some time I've come to enjoy it.  It's different in the way that each job function can make or break a situation.  That change is a welcomed addition.   I do find the game rather enjoyable, different than prior titles, but in depth in other ways.   Merchant, civil officer, and commander, all unique ways to play, defend, and destroy the opposition, among others.   I like those additions.

What I didn't like, is that it took quite a bit of time to get into the meat of the title, and because of this, ignorant original comments like mine below, can be generated because of it.   My final conclusion is that I think this is a good title with replay value.  I am satisfied with my purchase.


Original:
So far, complete and utter garbage, even with the bundle.  By far the weakest ROT3K title to date.    It feels more like a cinema animation rather than the customization that makes these titles what they use to be.  I had more fun on the early ROT3k versions from genesis, and then later snes, and playstation.  

I will try to give it a fair amount of time for revised assessment, but so far I feel like I was conned out of my money.  2.2 hours played was .2 hours too late for a refund.   I will never be tricked into another late date type of ROT3K purchase again, not ever.

Rotk 13 with expansion pack is by far the best in this series, imo (expansion pack is a must). Rpg aspect and mechanic of managing your force is satisfying me more than 11. 
The battle is pretty fast and fun with bigger scale of war. 

Replayability  is high, as Rpg aspect make each of your play different. It's your choice to be a ruler, officer of the force, free force, merchant, or even killer (free force, merchant, and killer has their own way to win game instead of unite china)

Give me ROTK VIII over this anyday.  The game if full of great features and the ability to role play a historical or original (player created) character is a great idea.  This game fails because of one reason only.  The AI is severely unbalanced.  Dong Zhuo blitzkriegs the map in the anti Dong Zhuo Coalition campaign.  I had to basically start myself off as the ruler of a province to win this campaign.  If you actually enjoy the role playing aspect and want to spend time as a free officer and then as a subordinate officer, you will find that once one of the AI factions gets even the slightest leg up they become unstoppable.

I enjoyed ROTK VIII because I could actually start out as a free officer and eventually work my way up a faction and take over as the ruler and conquer China.  Unless you're a super strategic genius you're probably not going to have a shot at doing that.  If you choose to be a subordinate to another ruler you will find yourself incredibly frustrated at the fact they constantly change your orders on you.  If I had to guess, I'd say I've managed to complete less than 5% of my domestic tasks before I get a message from my leader telling me I have to participate in an attack on a strategically meaningless town that is going to suck away all our manpower and leave us susceptible to counterattack.  

Even more frustrating is being close to finishing a task in which you have achieved enough for a reward only to be told to go to a council meeting where you may or may not get to decide on an important issue affecting your faction.  

Now, those who have played it will say, ""Well, you don't have to do what the leader says.  It's actually just a request.""  That is correct.  You can ignore the leader's request and continue performing your tasks, but I just prefer to maintain a healthy relationship with the ruler.  

It really makes this game unfun.  Even when I go into settings and set expansion progress to ""slow"", it seems one of the AI factions basically says, ""Fritz your settings; I'm a gangsta"" and starts taking everybody over.  And once they do that, your only hope of winning the campaign is to declare yourself a free officer and go join them.  Which is really just the same as putting in a cheat code.  I haven't used cheat codes since A,B,B,A in Ikari Warriors (just dated myself... whatever).

If you're new to ROTK, I recommend you try it just to get a taste of what it's about.  but then go find one of the other ROTKs and play that one (ROTK VIII was way better, not sure about the other eleven).  But, in general, and especially for experienced ROTKers, I'd say this one is a bust and as such have selected the thumb down.

Edit..... nearly 5 years later. I reviewed this at 180 hours of game play. Got bored and pulled it up for another 185 hours. No change. There is some enjoyment to get out of this game, but it is just beyond frustrating.  There is no depth to this game if you choose to play as anything but a ruler. If you want to get into the role playing aspect and be a free officer or even a governor.... repetitive as a drumroll. Battles last forever because the AI can keep spamming troops. An Army of 80000 still has to take DAYS to brush aside a tiny little army of 3,000. And in those crucial days the AI sends another tiny little 3000 man army to again slow you down for days. Just ridiculous. 

Bottom line. This one is a double down for me. If you're an ROTK series fan you already own this game by now.  You already decided you love it. If you are not into ROTK and thinking about this game.... I stand by what I said after my initial review. Go ahead and try it out; you might like it.

It used the gameplay formula of RTK 12 as base, but turn it into officer play by adding roleplaying elements. I like RTK 12 the least among RTK 8~12 because I dislike the real time combat. I also found RTK 13's roleplaying elements inferior to RTK 8 and 10, and not mesh well with the real time aspect of the gameplay in general. 

However, I still have loads of fun with this game, in some way maybe even more than some of the previous games which I like better. I think this game has better AI or balance than a lot of previous games. I know many people don't like how army cannot be transferred from city to city in this game, but it does help avoiding the player snowing ball and steamrolling everyone mid games. AI also does better in reinforcing attacked city from nearby cities. A regional AI power can actually hold out for a long time if the players don't play smart. 

The game still has some rough edges, like gameplay element not explained very well, some inconvenient control and repetitive generic events. However, it is still a enjoyable RTK game and I would recommend it.

I can't help but wonder why they didn't keep so many features of RTK11 and just build upon the weak points.

11 had everything more or less perfect besides the AI, the dueling/debating systems were a lot of fun ( fighting Lu Bu with a team of 3 mid-tier warriors was a lot of fun) , the combat was simple to use, but had some depth, the stats your characters had made sense and connected to what was going on. All that sucked was the AI. They could have bolted on a officer mode, and fixed the AI, and people would have loved it.

But instead we have a return to the pause/play system, instead of turn based. 

Worse combat that feels floaty and weird, units just sort of glide towards automatically generated camps that need taking, every battle feels the same.

A domestic/economic development gameplay that boils down to just watching circles slowly fill up ( this would have been a good place to include some more mini-games such as the debates and duels ). 

Speaking of duels and debates, the systems have been changed here for apparently no reason, again, and what we have is this weird, guessing game where it all just becomes random chance, whereas in 11 you knew your opponent's move and could try to counter it, but character stats would heavily influence the outcome. In this you just fight an endless parade of bandits who's war stat bounces all over the place, and you may as well just flip a coin sometimes picking your moves, i also don't appreciate them lazily porting in models from Dynasty warriors for NPCs, they look incredibly out of place.

And while the officer-play does return, and i appreciate the inclusion, I can't help feel that it's sort of wasted on all the above, as does the phenomenal artwork on the officer portraits.

On top of all this, the price stays rigidly high, and never goes on sale, and the sad thing is, i'm reviewing this long after release, and there's a new RTK game out that's newer and more recent, and from the looks of it, they've essentially done the same thing again, they've introduced new unnecessary gameplay systems, rather than looking at what worked, and slapped a 50-60 quid price tag on it.",1615639711,1615639711,False,14,0,0.677335143089294434,0,True,False,False

I think people are mostly assuming the game is something it's not, which makes sense when you consider the previous titles in the franchise were mostly shallow 4x strategy games.  If you are a fan of Paradox's grand strategy games, particularly Crusader Kings, you will find this game is more or less equally as deep and rewarding without costing you a thousand dollars for DLC. In fact in a step above the crusader kings series you can actually roam the land as an unaffiliated lone wolf, merchant, or even bandit if you choose. It's true that the game doesn't hand hold in terms of walking you through all the of the emergent mechanics but honestly that is what makes games like this and CK 2 interesting for years.   As far as stability, it has become much more stable throughout development and since the release of the PUK expansion I maybe get a crash every 10 hours or so, more or less on par with Skyrim or any other AAA title. 

Overall this is the best game in the Romance series hands down in terms of content. The only negative is that being an international title by old guard Koei, the price is stickier than what it should be this late in the game.

It was also about that time I stopped playing PC games because I had other hobbies.  Now with the Rona around I bought a new laptop and decided to re-visit this game and after a ton of playing and losing, I finally understood the mechanics of the game.  Have already beaten it with Liu Biao and the Yellow Turbans; the latter in the free-for-all scenario.  And now I am trying it as a free agent. I already like it a lot better than 11, which I played a ton.  To the people who complain about being overwhelmed by a ton of forces... I thought it was funny when I was basically wiping out all of Wei's forces in a few battles (they would send all their armies from all cities to one battle but i would decimate them at a choke point), and other scenarios where I would wipe out provinces with the same army.

Of course there are some issues such as incessant pop up events, and at times it feels like it is nowhere near optimized for a PC (even on my fully-loaded Lenovo 7i).  And the side quests are basically the same for every character.  I can see why people complain about repetitiveness, although that will be the nature of almost any game in general.

- I boot up the game, create my characters (as is the custom/tradition with this franchise)
- Load up the campaign map and set it up... it sends me back to the menu (what?)
- Clearly, I must be doing something wrong, right?
- Lo and behold, there is an option that has to be set to ""Standard"" instead of ""High""
- This makes no frigging sense
- On top of this, the game legit lags (I mean, it lags... on a modern system)

- As if the technical bugs were not enough, when you conquer a territory, you have to (and I mean have to) disperse your army. Otherwise, they just waste food with a standing army. Do they occupy the city/region like other iterations of the game? No, why would they? How would that even make any sense? We all know that all great conquering nations on earth conquer and then just randomly decides to, you know, go back from whence they came. Makes a whole lotta sense... 

Let me get this straight, the ruler then decides to send supplies, officers and an army back to the city we just conquered? I could have just stayed there.

Gameplay
Unlike my Nobunaga's Ambition review, I highly recommend you play this game for battle. Domestics and Diplomacy are nothing like they are in NA, and serve you in the most basic sense. Officer growth comes from items, so get rich. I would say that except for the battle system, Sphere of Influence: Ascension got it right. If they merged the games it would be amazing. ROTK 11 is still the best though.

Sound
The game's soundtrack is broken up into ill defined regional areas. Use the internet to find out where is part of what, as the game won't help you. However, the songs aren't bad, and the sound prompts are ok. No English though, as the amazing VA cast ended with NA:SOI:A.

Graphics
The game was released in 2016, and it shows. Battle scenes handle it the best. Strategy games will never get AAA effort.

Completion
This game, despite being the 30th anniversary game of the series, was launched incomplete. The DLC fixes most of this, but it is not as good as Ascension was to NA, another 30th anniversary game. There are several holes in the game as is, and the price makes it not worth it - pride of being the 30th anniversary game was apparently lost in the haste to push this game out.

Overall
Want more action than any other strategy game I've played? Get this. Depth, eras, and growth all take a back seat here. You want the best the series has to offer? Get RotK 11 on sale.

Pros:
Custom Characters so you can self insert yourself into China.
Battle system is pretty decent and not grid based/ turned based like rotk 10.
Able to marry Multiple women. it's a feature,
Being a Ruler is fun. You have the most freedom
Being a normal Officer/Minister is fun because you don't have to worry about all that stressful stuff.

Cons:
If you try to do a late scenario as a new force you just get steamrolled.  Also if you have over half the map you pretty much can steamroll the Ai.
Attacking an enemy occupied city is like pulling teeth sometimes because as long as they a have at least one officer and like three thousand troops they'll defend that city.  Then reinforcements come to prolong a fight.
Friend Quests are repetitive. Only be friends with the people with high skills and stats because that's what this game boils down to.
No tavern to pick up quests. instead you have to wait like 10 days just to get a little bit of gold.
Being a free officer is a snooze fest.
Being a Viceroy is even more annoying than rotk 10 because you get stuck with the worst people while the ruler gets all the good people and then gives you the hardest missions to do.

Here is my little tale from the past 8 hours I have been playing:

The hours surely flew by as I desperately defended my little corner of southeastern china with a custom character and a few other officers whom I conscripted or joined out of family ties... and I enjoyed it thoroughly as my small hick-town armies of 2000 strong wiped out armies of over 30000 with the correct tactics, positioning, and abilities. It did get a bit repetitive, but the years of my only family member left are flying by, and she will either retire, or pass away. She is the strongest cohort i have, and I fully anticipate my small one-capital nation falling to the powerful warlord that has been after my neck the whole time; I will eventually have to abandon my people that I have defended and presided over for a few decades, and wander China until peace is ushered in, or I might even join in with an army that vies to crush the warlord that's plagued my small corner for so many years. I even had a childhood friend that I created with a bit of a romance thing going on, but early on, they disappeared- never to be seen again... until I had battled them upon a mountain-side: my cavalry charging through their ranks and decimating the frontline with a lethal strategy on a bit of marshlands at the center of the battlefield. Despite their best efforts to rally the troops against my cavalry charge with my own general leading, their morale broke, and were swiftly obliterated. The childhood friend had gotten away, however... and I would see them another time: leading an army of 17000 against my 3000; again we dealt with them using correct strategy.

Things might be getting a bit bleak, as the land isnt as fertile, and the onslaught from the other warlord who even conscripted that friend-turned-rival keeps sending larger and larger armies to fight my army of just 5000 total on both fronts- a few officers that joined in tow. 
-----------------------------

That has been my experience with the game... however, it may not seem that intense to the newer player... this is because, as a long time fan of both Dynasty Warriors Empires, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms: I am able to roleplay my own character. This would be a bit harder if I wasn't able to create a custom general, however, as it's a bit harder to create my own coalitions and own scenarios. For example, I would frequently play as Xingcai in Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires (another game i had spent thousands of hours on on the ps4), and assemble a force made up of the other young officers that fade into history after the fall of Shu. To roleplay successfully, I recommend getting well versed in both the historical account of the three kingdoms era, the romance of the three kingdoms tale, and the other Koei-tecmo titles that flesh out the personalities of the various officers in the games.

I reiterate: you MUST be able to roleplay the general you take control of or create in order to fully enjoy this game, otherwise, its like making a ""Saving Private Ryan"" mental scene out of a Hearts of Iron D-Day attack. It's just not as exciting when you dont immerse yourself into your character's situation.

As well, this game is not as complex as Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron or Anno. You can only control the character you created, as it is like an RTS/4X but mostly an RPG strategy. The most control you will have would be in controlling the movement of other officers in your territories as their LEADER. Othewise, you are fighting only with your own squadron and abilities on those battlefields (unless appointed the grand strategist for the battle).

This game is BASICALLY just a more complex Dynasty Warriors Empires game: you have to manage your commerce, crop yields, relationships (can even have wives and kids), troop counts, space for troops, and where your officers are located if youre the leader. 

A big complaint from the game is the inability to send out troops alone to different forts and cities. The reason why is because the troops have to be accompanied... or rather: led by an officer under your banner. You get to choose the coalition's officers, and troop count... types of troops, their weapons etc. Why that is so hard to understand, i dont know. 

This game offers plenty of customization to the characters you make, other historical officers already made in the game, the historical accuracy of the scenarios you choose; you can even choose whether or not your custom character is FEMALE or MALE; you can choose what kind of weapon they use! You can even choose their strengths: making a Lu Bu OP character from the beginning. 

I recommend playing this game on the hardest difficulty from the get go for all of you DW and RotTK veterans, as just like DW8E, it can get a little too easy (that is unless you prefer roleplaying over the challenging hurdles of having armies of tens of thousands at your doorstep). For all of the new folks who are new to the RTS/4x/Grand Strategy world: THIS GAME IS PERFECT FOR NEW FOLKS! It is simple enough to pick up in the first few hours, though the management of the relationships and commerce might take a little more getting used to. For all of the 4X and RTS vets: this is a very different package that, if you want to ease into, go and play 8 Empires to enjoy the hack and slash nature of the Three Kingdoms Dynasty Warriors games and get a feel for a more stripped down version of RotTK 13, as well as the overall tale of the Three Kingdoms era. 

I can recount all of the battles and important characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, as I have been playing games associated with the story for a little under 20 years, and that aids me in enjoying this game a lot more. I believe that the Dynasty Warriors and Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Samurai Warriors games are all directed more at the large following Koei-Tecmo has amassed rather than completely new folks.

That being said: feel free to commejnt underneath if you have any questions or concerns before buying. This game is not perfect, and it may be hard af to get into if you arent familiar with the tale of the three kingdoms era of china!

You play as one of MANY characters of your selection (or creation) and basically go about living your life during the three kingdoms period (though, obviously the game focuses on the political and military aspects of that and much less in the civilian aspect)
As you  rise through the ranks it takes a more standard strategy feel to it, though still with its own twist.

It puts a lot of focus on bonds and connections, arranging aliances, for example, has you talking with officers of the force you are appealing to, trying to gain their favor and support in court, and so on.

Sure, it had some elements reminiscent of the ROTK games. However, while I was playing it, it felt a lot more attune to the Dynasty Warriors: Empire style of game, but with more depth added. That isn't inherently wrong, but if you are looking for a ROTK game like those of the past, this isn't really it. 

This game as a whole isn't as bad as I thought it would be, but the AI can be easily exploited, in fact I was presently surprised. If you don't set challenges for yourself, or just play the best of your ability with no room for error, I can see this game getting old quick.

For me, I do like the RP elements a lot. For instance there was this officer; Sun Ce. This guy was my biggest rival. At one point I might have ""accidentally"" killed one of his allies in a duel, which made him devote himself to seeing me die. I wiped his kingdom off the map, but he escaped from imprisonment. After that, he showed up in every army I fought against. Like this man pledged allegiance to every ruler in the country just to kill me.

After awhile I decided not to execute him because it was entertaining to me, to keep fighting him (although it was a long rivalry). Sometimes I'd best his army, sometimes it was he who would best mine. But one thing never changed; it was always myself versus him in the end. We would engage in our duels, I would lose some bouts and I would win a lot of those too. At one point he single-handedly wiped my army from existence, so I returned the favour when I could.

At the final battle, I barely (and I do mean barely) escaped with my life and was able to slay him. 


Overall, the game has its flaws and there are many, but they aren't significant enough of a gripe to steer me away.

Also like many others, do not but unless you're willing to chuck 70$ to get the original and the fame and strategy as the ""Fame is strategy"" is the puk. AKA PUK ""Power up kit"". It makes the game have allot more features than the original and is more fun than the original. Im a long time fan of the ROTK series and I would say its average.

In this game, they say that you can roleplay but literally you cant... What I mean is, say you play as a free officer to a general. The game uses so much of your time that you cant progress with your character, because you're constantly thrown into battle by your ruler. Even in battle, your progress (Stats, skills (It will but slowly and steady) will not raise as you need to use your personal time to level/progress. The stats that you give or are given from said officer is what you get, and even if you try to make him the top dog, its difficult as the game wont wait for you. :Example scenario is 207+. Cao Cao has many teritories making him yield more money, food, and troops. 
By the time you're trying to make your stats/skills rise, Cao Cao will snowball everything. Hes already an unstoppable force. N playing on a map where everyone is already divided just clearly shows who will snowball when they have said many teritories. The roleplay is so annoying as it constantly reminds you that you have to multitask other crap. The popup quests are so annoying because you just want to kill TIME in the game and they popup making you have to click over and over. At least in other ROTK Series when you dont want to be disturbed, they dont DISTURB YOU.

As the ruler, the game reminds you that you really need to know how to use the map and when to engage and not to engage. Especially if you try to play against Cao Cao in later scenarios with 1 or 2 cities. Its so stupid when you play as officer as Cao Cao will just throw down a solitication and your ruler will just surrender like that. The only ones that dont ever surrender are the dumb 2 kingdoms SHU and WU. Now when you're officer, the rulers are dumb and make the dumbest of decisions, Koei talks about diplomacy but thats all hogwosh. Cheat the building to have more money, food, and troops and look at them go. Ive had moments where, Yeah they did coalition against Cao Cao, but to trigger that you needed at least 3+ nations that are still alive and need Cao Cao to have an army 1.5x larger than said coalition force combined. For example. Ma Teng, Liu Biao, Gongsun Zan, Liu Bei, Sun Quan. But its still dumb as fk, because they dont do crap. As the coalition only lasts 6 months, and the time in the game it doesnt really matter because the game itself uses allot of time to do everything, nothing gets accomplished forcing you to do something.

This game, as you play more and more and figure out the ins and outs of the game. It becomes a love/hate relationship. The game dumbs down so many things and gives so many features. That theres a balance. It felt as if Koei was making their newer ROTK series UI friendly and in result they had to dumb down their game. (Especially for the English translation of the game, Its basically its own game!)
If you guys are thinking about getting this game, I say wait for a sale (For sure Koei dgaf). There is a mod community full of mods for the chinese verson of the game that makes this game shine brighter than PUK but their mods are specifically for the chinese version. I've tried to make mods work with a pinch of help from a chinese aquaintance who did nothing but say ""Learn chinese"" that I felt even more depressed that such a new world of mods that can make this game better is locked away with language barrier.

This game is fun no lie, but I wouldnt recommend it as the games potential is locked away because of language barrier, I wouldnt even put in 70$ if I had known what I know now. I will still play this game as Im a long time fan of the ROTK Series, but Im really trying to save you guys your hard earned 70$. For english players, if you know chinese then play the chinese version, hit me up and Ill send you the websites for the chinese mods. If you dont know chinese, then you fuked as the english version of the game is just a cheap english translated rip off of the original chinese game. Koei really dgaf about giving a proper english version even though their fking games are not CHEAP. EVEN THEIR NOBUNAGA SERIES ARE NOT CHEAP. Allot of the community for the ROTK Series are all just people using their own time to make the game as much fun as possible and many of them are dissappearing. This is a rant and review as this game is just a fking cash grab. The fking game has been out for awhile and their price is still fking 60$-70$. Just look at Dynasty Warriors, fking dlcs up the yin yang. If they're getting this much Moolah, they should really be making groundbreaking games but seems like they dont want to compete with other popular game companies. 
So yeah...
Dont get this game unless you know chinese, and only get it if you're a longtime ROTk fan. For newer audiences, the game will be something new and fun to play but I gurantee you, you'll be playing another game sooner or later.

I love this game. 

It's pretty niche, and if you aren't into the period or the storylines then I can see where it might feel a little dry. 

But I very much prefer this game to the last few entries in the series. It's more character driven as opposed to leaders being the only thing that matters. 

I dunno. 

I can sink an entire day into this game without even knowing what happened. 

There are so many fun things to do, like playing as Lu Linqui and leaving Lu Bu along with Dio Chan and joining Shu and trying to make a go of it. Especially when you spend 10 in game years trying to forge a lasting alliance between Shu and Lu Bu. 

Then when Shu either falls to Yuan Shao or Cao Cao, you can take your household south and join Sun Ce and have a chance to help Wu win the game. 

Or you can play as Lu Bu during the Dong Zhuo scenario and leave the capitol and start your own faction in the mountains. 

I dunno. If you've ever wanted to play this game, this version is pretty stable and runs pretty well. 

I also hope that someday the English translations of the previous games in the series get released on Steam. 

Koei is a good developer and publisher. The Fire Emblem game on the Switch in some ways reflects the RoTK series. 

I dunno.

   - With the Fame & Strategy expansion, this game is amazing for people that enjoy weaving their own dramas in a tasteful historic fantasy. 
   - Can play as any character in the RTK story through a variety of scenarios and time periods.
   - Can create characters and control when they lived and died in the timeline, thus adding more pieces to the drama. 
   - Gameplay has some variety in style and options; players can walk the path of a vagrant mercenary or merchant, serve in an army under differing roles or even act as ruler. 
   - Different experiences every time you play.
   - Essentially play the game however one wants. There is no ""wrong"" way to play RTK.
   - Neat events between other characters, such as debates and duels.
   - Game AI generally plays by the same rules as the player. So, on the strategy aspect; it doesn't really ""cheat"" like some games do.

Cons:

   - The vanilla game (without Fame & Strategy expansion) is sort of... well, lacking.
   - Expensive game is expensive. I love this game, but it's not really worth it at full price... considering the more complete experience can be found in what the expansion adds to it. KOEI-related sales don't happen very often, and they tend to wait ages before they shave the prices of their titles.
   - Some event mini-games like dueling and debate can get old after a while.
   - Hero Mode is pretty awful. (Though I can't remember if this was an exclusive expansion feature or not. Either way, it isn't all that essential to the game experience.)
   - Learning curve can be a bit steep. 
   - Which doesn't help that the GUI could intimidate new players, I imagine. Sometimes the UI can be a bit jarring thematically from screen-to-screen. 

 To Add:

   'Beneath the hood', Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII is more of a blend between role-playing, strategy and management. I would say the storytelling and art really make the game shine. However, it isn't the game for people expecting a lot of depth in one genre, as this game tries to do a lot at once. I've seen some of the lemmings-- er, I mean, other reviews say to get Three Kingdoms: Total War, instead. Now, I love me some Total War but that logic is pretty asinine. It is like suggesting one get Star Wars: Battlefront II instead of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Both Star Wars games, yet completely different in just about every way imaginable. That's a very 'apples and oranges' comparison, really.

   While I enjoy this, I will say that your mileage may vary. I find that this game has a lot of replay value given all of the different ways that they player can more or less create their own experience for themselves. However it doesn't have a lot of depth and complexity in any particular area because it isn't any 'one thing', really. It is a lot of simple genre themes rolled into one. So, different strokes and all that. This game already draws a very niche crowd compared to other fandoms.",1565213349,1565214819,True,4,0,0.553559243679046631,0,True,False,False

The best way to play is the is with creating new families/officers and starting in the southwest. Fk playing with the 3 big families. 
Also, Romance of the Three Kingdoms 7 still is the best one so far. However, this one still is pretty good! 

Objective: 
For those new people who haven't played this game (or series of games). It takes time to get used to. You can start in which ever city you want and join whichever faction you want, specifically if you play as an original/created character. You start up as an officer rank 9 and work your way until rank 4 or 3 in which you can be selected as governor, not before being either a War, Domestic or Military Minister (depends on ruler and your stats). Be friends with your rules and characters that are better than you. Create bonds and get married or be Lord FriendZone and create the best brother to a beautiful female warrior via giving them alcohol or armor as gifts. 

Subjective: 
This game is way different from Total War. This is pure tactics and strategy while total war has RTS battles. Can't wait for RTK14!",1562019412,1562019412,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The relationship mechanics are mostly a plus for me, but are rather tricky and you have to do a good bit of trial and error. How the battles unfold is a bit of a step down for me, as I prefer the turn based systems. As for those first approaching the series... I would suggest some of the older installments first that let you play as an officer RTK X is my suggestion, even though if you want your created officer to have a family you have set that up when you create them, as it is a far more straightforward system that is quite addictive. If you like that then give this a try when it is on sale.

Further note: As you can OP your created character and have up to three wives, and also potentially surround yourself with platonic waifus; you may feel like Kirito from SAO ( I just threw up a little), however you actually have to still learn how the game works and actually work at gaining said waifus.

I think that the negative reviews on this game is a little absurd considering how fluid the game feels compared to any of its predecessors. It has a relatively real-time system where you can play AS AN OFFICER AND NOT A RULER. This is huge because it makes the game much more immersive. All the games prior were focused on only the historical or the strategic elements. However, this game focuses on what you want to do in the game rather than just feeling forced to do some generic ROTK thing.

I understand some of the OB players' complaints as the series took a large turn on how the game works now. But I think this is a change towards the right direction. It caters towards players who want to feel immersed in the Three Kingdoms world. 

Does this game have its issues? Sure. But the negative comments and reviews makes me feel sad because this game is I think the best one yet in the series. Additionally, there are a lot of free dlc content (although they might not change your gameplay experience too much).

The game is expensive, especially considering how much the Fame and Strategy expansion pack (a dlc that is kinda a must have) is also. It costs a lot to make these games, so I don't think that the price is too unreasonable. If you don't have the cash right now, just wait for the game to be on sale. That's what I did when I bought it.

It's better than Total War in many aspects, as it creates a whole world full of characters that you can play as, interact with, serve and command, duel, have a philosophical debate with or attend banquets with. It's essentially a simulator of a person living in the Era of the Three Kingdoms, and you choose whether this person is a nobody, a provincial governor, or a mighty ruler, and as everything evolves, a king may become a commoner and a commoner may become a king. It's all in you hand. 

[b]How is it better than Total War?[/b] 
While Total War has overall better battles, building tree and tech tree, this game has a powerful character development, a truly living world, and amazing depth when it comes to interacting with other people. You can develop your character like nowhere else, getting more and more important government posts in your country, new ranks, titles, honours, you get powerful items, including weapons, books, horses, delicious alcohols and teas, and eventually settling down with a wife or wives and plan your dynasty. 

1. A much better character system, which means that you can truly roleplay, develop your character, buy or be given unique items, chat or debate with other people, make friends/best friends/oath brothers attend parties, marry, interact with your wives, have children and raise them - this is simply stunning compared to Total War.
2. The world feels so alive with hundreds if not thousands of characters, living their life around you, fighting, shaping their political careers, making friends and foes, and becoming more powerful over time. This is something you will not feel in Total War. Plus, you have ambient events that reflect real history, though these can frustrate your career, if your leader is defeated in an event and loses his country. Harsh, but realistic.
3. You play as a single person, and you can pick pretty much anyone from the era - from nobodies to great rulers, and you can even create your own characters from scratch. That means that you can go through the entire career - from a a commoner, through being a lowly provincial minister, through the minister of your ruler, governor of different provinces, being a viceroy of the entire region to becoming a powerful king and finally emperor. This is much more powerful than anything Total War has to offer.
4. You are free to move around the country, meeting people, buying curiosities, spying, helping people, going on quests, and the travel times are realistic. In Total War going anywhere takes years with absolutely unrealistic unit marching speeds.
5. Province management is better - you assign officers and tasks, and later as a viceroy or a ruler, tasks for provinces and cities to achieve. You report to your liege, who judges your performance and you can only rise through the ranks if your actions benefit the country. 
6. The DLC really helps the game, as it introduces true progression in different areas, that give you access to unique actions, appropriate for you career path. Being the Prime Minister is different from being a diplomat and very different from being a soldier or a strategist. 
7. It's a day-by-day simulation, not season by season, which allows for a much better storytelling, immersion, and interaction with other characters. It also allows army movements to be much more realistic. You can regulate how fast the time passes which is great.

[b]Why should you be cautious about this game?[/b]
1. Its graphics aren't as good (though characters are drawn and simply gorgeous) and battles won't look as epic, although they are more realistic with numbers (100,000 soldier armies are common as they were at the time, no more 2000 vs 2000 mini battles that look just silly).
2. Its slower paced as you're playing as a person - that means you interact with others, move between cities a lot, perform missions, debate, fight, on a day-to-day basis. Total War has 3 month turns which makes it more fast paced, but also unrealistic and cumbersome at times. 
3. Its not very well polished and has quite a few bugs, though nothing game breaking for me so far. 
4. The building and tech trees are too rudimentary for my taste and don't allow cities to truly grow in a certain direction - like a trading port vs manufacturing hub vs an agricultural centre. You somewhat achieve this with expanding commerce/farming/culture in the city, but it's too rudimentary for my taste. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
If you like truly epic RPGs that are ambitious to simulate a huge country over the course of more than a century, this is definitely a game for you. If you just like more arcade city building/battles, choose Total War. Overall, I'd definitely say that this game is superior and definitely worth your attention, even though it's sad to see it not finished and not polished properly.",1559128126,1559128126,True,31,6,0.660834550857543945,0,True,False,False

Quick Review:
Poor implementation of systems.
It has nothing to offer to new player to the series.
Even hardcore RTK fans will have problems with this game.
No Updates or fixes. It is nolonger supported by Koei .
Spent your money on another game.

Review:

First of all, I am a big fan of the RTK series from Koei. I have been playing the seires for more than 20 years. I started playing RTK IV when I was a child. I have owned every RTK game since. I usually scan the japanese websites for upcoming RTK games; even though I cannot read Japanese. I have loved some and dislike some over the years, but I have not been irritated within any until this title.

RTK are very niche games marketed to a very specific strategy audience. It tells the fictional or semihistorical story of ancient china during the last days of the Han's Dynasty. It is the same underling story of Koei's Dynasty Warrior but in a strategic format. All RTK games tells the same story. Each entry differs by how the gameplays, graphics, and implementation of systems.

RTK 13 tooks the basic menu and list of past games and stream line it. In the process, IT FAIL TO DELIVER THE BASIC RTK EXPERIENCE. The gameplays feel and play at a faster pace but fail to allow player interaction and immersion. For examples, the game allow you to  easily move resources from the different city, but the management of troops is not there. So you ended up having troops in city you do not need and little or no troop in the city you do need. The recruiting of troops is hidden and poorly implemented. In a strategy war game, this is a major failure. It also takes away individual city commands and replace it with a restricted court systems which becomes a major hassle once your forces expand. Further more, the basic movement of soldiers during military march is oddly implemented. It is easy to march troops, but you cannot fortify the city you just attack with those troops and offciers. Instead, you have to dissolve and wait until your character get back to the orignal city before you can give other commands. The game also does not offer much else from other RTK games except for more frustrations. In additions, the game is full of typo and errors in the English text which does not help that Koei no longer support the game or updates.

In conclusion, RTK 13 fails on fundamental gameplay mechanics, creating problems and frustrations for long time fans and offers a disapointment for newcomers. Koei is more focus else where like releasing the mobile version than fixing a main entry of the fan loved RTK.

- Some officers like Lu Bu really fits his description of original setting - he destroys everything... well represented

Cons
- Even though you take mightiest officers you can pretty much use only one person's strategy which is LAME!!!!

If you're looking for a turn-based resource builder, this is not the game for you.
If you're looking for an accurate historical representation of the Three Kingdoms period, this is not the game for you.

However, if you're looking to immerse yourself into the historical novel by the same name, then I can honestly say that this is probably the best representation of that you will find, both in terms of playing out events from the novel as well as in playing out ""what if"" scenarios.

In Hero Mode you will play out each of the major characters from the novel through all the various scenarios and find yourself with a rewarding interactive version of the novel. And in the regular campaign, you have every option available from taking on the life of a lowly court officer all the way to a powerful warlord, both historical and custom. You can play social characters who politic behind the scenes through establishing unbreakable bonds of friendship, spying, an negotiation. Or you charge into the field of battle using a variety of battle strategies as well as individual officer tactics to tip the scale in your favor. Or you can be a hands-on governor managing your city's domestics by putting other officers to work, aiding you citizens who call on you for special favors, and perhaps even uncover a variety of interesting artifacts from your due dilligence. You can even do all three! Or you can avoid any of these styles of play that don't suit your liking entirely by simply recruiting enough capable officers to your side to do those portions of the game for you.

As a long-time Koei fan, having played everything from Genghis Khan and ROT3K 1 all the way through to ROT3K 11, I was initially a bit skeptical. I wondered if this game could possibly be worth it. I truly felt it was. The AI is competent enough. The roleplay elements can get repetitive, but ultimately serve a purpose. The story events are wonderfully done. The Chinese voice acting is spot on. (I can't comment on the English or Japanese as I prefer to hear the actors in Chinese, as I was a huge fan of the drama.) The music is very well implemented; nowhere near as repetitive as some older titles in the series. The real time battles play out just like in the novels: leave a camp empty, draw their forces in to attack it, pull a force back to defend it while suddenly charging their main camp with another unit, and then when they fall back to defend ambush them with the traps you set up along the way. Watch as heroic generals duel each other in the middle of a battle in an attempt to demoralize their opponent's men. Just make sure that you don't march too deeply into enemy territory without a rest or setting up enough forts along the way to recover your men's morale! And make sure to restock their supplies at cities along their march!

All in all, while there are a few things that do get repetitive or can be frustrating (like Cao Cao being down to 5000 men and still being able to hold off several battles against 20,000 because of his and Sima Yi's amazing stratgies and tactics) I honestly feel like this is the best game in the series.

This game has many great concept, but fall short of it because most of the feature feel unfinished or questienable. 
For example: 
- Supply system --> I think there is almost no point to put the supply on each city if the supply can be distribute to another city in an instant. They should just make the supply like NA: SoI.
- Duel and debate --> Unlike before, duel and debate in this game is just the same minigame with different skin. In XI, duel and debate are two different minigame, and those make the game felt more interesting.
- Quest --> The quest is the same whether you are a vangabond, officer, or ruler. How can the people of the city ask their ruler to deliver food to her husband, or find a shop in another city.
- Event --> This game relies too heavily on random event. Like quest can only be trigger randomly, can only help other officer... again... randomly.... Duel in battle can only be triggered randomly.
- and many more....

But, even with that flaw, I still enjoy the game. 
There are some of the interesting thing they've done, like:
+ Command --> I like limited slot for command in this game. Because of this, council is felt more useful. Minister and governor are also felt more like they should. In past RotK (as a ruler), we can do all the thing by ourselves, there is no need to involve council, minister or governor.
+ Diplomacy --> diplomacy in this game also involve lobbying key officer of the other faction. This feels authentic from this era, too bad we can't imprison/execute the messenger.
+ Portrait --> New thing like breathing portrait, war portrait are great and make them look alive. And also, the illustration for the portrait itself is still great if not better.
+ Hero mode --> A great place to experience the story of three kingdom. And also act as a great tutorial for the beginning part and as a great challenge for the other part.

With the release of the PK (Fame and Strategy), this game become much better.
Some of the example that PK fix from the base game is:
* Tactics and morale make the battle become more interesting and strategic, like you can't march the army non stop from right corner to the left corner of the map.
* More unique unit type like Elephant in the south to balance the overwhelming north area.
* Role of each people gives this game a better replay value. Like you can be a strategist in first playthrough and in second playthrough you can become a merchant, which completely different.

So with PK (Fame and Strategy), I recommend this game to everyone interested, but without PK, the recommendation only apply to hardcore RoTK fans.",1472381144,1542209376,True,6,0,0.554587304592132568,0,True,False,False

1. You're a hard-core RTK fan, capable of self-immersion and self-imposed limitations to add challenge.
2. You're keen on the role-playing aspects of the game and are comfortable not necessarily playing it like a grand strategy game.

Anyhow, onto the finer details.

No incarnation of RTK has ever been perfect, dating all the way back to my first experience with RTK1 on the NES, and this one is no exception. This one, however, seems to ignore a lot of the lessons learned from previous failures while introducing a whole host of others that make no goddamn sense.

For one, the AI still can't figure out how to put up a decent fight. I don't think I've ever gotten to a point in the game where even the brightest and most capable enemy has put forth a fully-fleshed out elite unit consisting of 3 solid generals and maxed out weapons. And while they aren't nearly as mindless as they were in RTK 11, where the AI would just constantly throw units at you regardless of their likelihood of success, it still feels like it has no grip on reality.

The game is also riddled with text errors and dialogue mistakes that should've been fixed from day one. Not that huge of an issue for me, but it's just a sign of how lazy KOEI has gotten over the years, obviously coasting on brand loyalty rather than innovation to make sales.

The biggest problem with this game, in my opinion, is the pacing. Every grand strategy game hits a point where you know you've effectively ""won"", but you need to spend a few hours finishing the job. It's unavoidable without crappy cop-outs like alternative victory conditions and whatnot, but in RTK13, that imbalance tips particularly hard far too early in the game.

Even with a significant disadvantage, you basically win the game once you've gotten a single weapon type to Elite status in your main city, and can field a few top-tier generals with a high sustained morale and a 300+ attack and defense rating. Once that's done, the enemy just crumbles before you in auto-play combat, because the AI doesn't really bother with training until it's far too late.

As for the problem of not having top-tier generals, fear not. Simply switch your ruler to the Orator prestige, travel the map talking to Free Generals, and Refer them once you've got a rapport of 70 or better. In less than a year, in almost any scenario, you're going to have at least 4-5 guys you can group together to kick some serious beehive.

And despite the game being too easily winnable most of the time, there are some scenarios that are almost impossibly hard. Back in RTK11, the Red Cliff scenarios circa 208AD were winnable as Liu Bei. You could easily hold off the dumb AI long enough to build up a strong central base at Xinye, eventually cutting right into the heart of Wei territory and taking the big baddy down, even without southern subjugation. In RTK13, you won't have the same sort of success without cheating a bit by giving yourself a custom general or two. There's simply too much coming at you right from the first few weeks of the game, and without those Elite weapons ready to go, you just instantly lose a war of attrition versus an enemy that's 20x your size.

So in short, you either get yourself in a winning position WAY too soon to make it fun, or you don't get to win at all.

The nice thing about RTK13, is that you never really lose. Even if your force is wiped out, you can play on as a general in a force of your choosing, rising through the ranks to a position of prominence. In some cases, you can even work your way into the line of succession. So if you're particularly keen on the RP aspects of the game, it definitely gets easier to enjoy. Some of the other game modes, like playing as a merchant or a mercenary can be fun too, and will certainly insert another 50 hours of game time for you if it ends up being your thing.

But as a Grand Strategy game, it's just an unbalanced mess, and it's only good if you, like me, can limit yourself in some way. One thing I tend to do is execute every general that isn't a historical general associated with my force. So if I'm Liu Bei, for example, I'll take the heads of any prisoner that isn't a Shu general from history, in one way or another. So when I conquer Liu Zhang, Zhang Song gets to hang out with me, while Wang Lei gets to eat my axe.

Koei seems to go back to square one EVERY TIME they release an RTK game, leaving behind a lot of the funner aspects of their previous games. Why, exactly? Combat in RTK11 was WAY better and more involved than what you'll get in 13. What was the harm in building on an already great thing? They really need to stop that.

I've rambled long enough about a game I enjoy more than any sane person should. So unless you're like me and fit one of the above two criteria I laid out in my opening paragraph, move on to something else.

I was very upset that the only new Romance of the Three Kingdoms to come out in 10 years since XI (western release) was a total flop.  I forced maybe 10 hours in this game and I just couldn't anymore.  I went to go play the old ones instead.  I've been a big fan of the series since I was 12, and I had lost all hope in Koei.

So why the sudden change of heart?  It's one simple thing.  The ""Fame and Strategy Expansion Pack"" aka the PUK (Power-up Kit).  It drastically changes the gameplay and changes it from mundane to boundless hours of fun.  Firstly they fixed a lot of the bugs with this expansion, which there were plenty.  But they also added so much more content.  The most nameably being the Prestige system, which allows for your officer to go down one of several paths to give them perks, special abilities, special events, and stat boosts.  This also allows for you to make your own private army.  Also introduced is the Comrade system, in which you can bring close friends into your inner circle.  Comrades will always stick with you and follow you around.  You can make a private army together or work together to help a lord.  

Onto the nitty gritty of what this game is like compared to past RTK's.  This one is an RPG, and probably the best one yet.  Civil work isn't a grind like in 7, 8, and 10.  Even if you're a lowly officer you can do things to get some influence to try and steer your ruler on the right track.  As an advisor and warlord type character you have a ton of options to help and strengthen your force on and off the battlefield.  Battles are like a mix of RTK9 and RTK10.  You can give orders at any time, and they'll follow through with fighting.  Each character has their own battle tactics, and they can be used when your force has enough Command points (built up over time, more when you capture bases).  Characters have abilities to go with their stats that help them perform certain domestic duties or give special abilities on the battlefield.    

But this game isn't without it's faults, and most of them being on Koei's poor marketing approach.  The scenarios in this game are great, and they play out with events similar to RTKX (but more interactive and less annoying).  But some of the scenarios are DLC.  ...And some cost extra money.  Not to mention this game is NOT worthwhile without the ""Fame and Strategy"" expansion.  So if you already have the game like me, that's another $35 to fork over to make it playable.  IF you are a new buyer, I implore you to buy them together as a pack, you will spend $70 instead of $95.  But with all of the DLC that you really shouldn't have to buy in the first place, it makes for an amazing game.  It's a great game but Koei is a company that can neglect it's loyal customers, so it leaves me very conflicted.  But the game itself with the expansion?  9/10.  Worth the $70?  Personally, I think so.  Any hardcore RTK enthusiast can't pass this up.",1536270633,1536270633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In fact the complexiety and learning curve is part of the fun, but without the ability to enjoy the game because of the lack of full english support it simply draws too much away.

Koei could and hopefully someday will offer complete english support for this and all ROTK titles, even porting the console versions would be just fine. Hopefully the game doesnt suck beyond that point, find it hard to believe that one would be able to play the game as designed and still find it terrible, but it certainly is possible.

In fact, it's actually two categories of games, the personal growth side and the bird's eye view side. 

As a player who's actually broken his teeth with ROTK 1 back in the 16 bit PC days, my favorite has always been ROTK 10.

I'm not in the majority here. I usually do not play scenarios. I enjoy immersing myself in historic RPG when it comes to these games. Despite having read several iterations of the books, and books on these books, and discussions of books on the books, I don't mind much. I'm just glad KOEI keeps updating the series in whatever form. 

For people who complain about character stats, let's just say that there are simply many schools of thought. In some iterations KOEI can be heavily Liu Bei oriented, in others Cao Cao friendly, and often with great insight, pro Sun family. This particular iteration played down the heroics of Liu Bei and friends a bit. It's just a matter of opinion. 

ROTK 13 is more like ROTK 10. It's not for everyone, but for people looking ROTK 7, 8, 10 experiences, it's great. The PK is an essential add on. For people who prefer ROTK 11 style games, less fun. (No one like ROTK 12) 

Is it as good as CK2 or Civ? No. You just play it because it's ROTK.

Considering I have easily logged over 1000 hours on various other RoTK games, I figured it wouldn't be too much of a gamble to risk 30 bucks on something that could be fun. The reviews are mixed, but who cares about that?

The fact of the matter is that I am having a ton of fun with this game. It's single player and loosely based on the structure set up in RoTK 10, specifically wherein you play as a single officer carrying out the function you desire, be it a ronin wandering china, a vassal, or a ruler.

What makes this game a fantastic experience is how easily it was to dive into. Granted, I have a ton of experience with the other titles, but there is a nifty help section that can help iron out what aspects of the game you don't understand. 

Whether the battles are small-scale or involving half the bloody country, the game controls really well. Units respond fairly well, especially so if you've played any Total War games (the unit pathfinding/AI is actually tighter in this than total war IMO). They've taken out a lot of the time-eating nonsense and made it easier to do what you want while still making it satisfying, whether it's interacting with other officers or getting your troops together to march on various places or make an alliance.

A ton of the other reviews for this game (especially the negative ones) complain about bugs and glitches that are supposedly ruining the game. I can say that, 26 hours in, I'm running this on a windows 10 gaming laptop with ZERO bugs or glitches of any kind. So... I can't really comment on that.

There are some concepts that work well with ROTK XIII and others not so much. 

For instance the new way ""Skills"" are used. There are two types. ""City skills"" and ""War skills"" 

The City skills are for things like commerence and farming. While war skills are for things like Siege, Defensive, naval, troop type. I get why the dev's made it so. But at the sametime, it really doesn't matter since all you have to do is throw EVERYTHING including the kitchen sink into the battle in question and you'll win. No matter what! Which can be funny at times but kinda sad as well because there is really no strategy here. Just throw large forces into the fight and you'll win.

While there is a ""story mode"" aka ""Hero Mode"" it's really the tutorial. And yes, this game does take a page from ROTK X where historical events can happen in the actual main game itself.

You can create your own officers once again. So creativity is there. With the ""fame & strategy"" bundle you can do so much more like creating your own events, and just do a whole lot more. However, like with most things. The ""expansion"" should've been in the main game to begin with because it just adds more layers to the game. But nope, gotta get that $$$$.

And of course the game has an occasional bug or glitch. So just be aware. You can't play multiple forces like in ROTK 7 & 8 so that's a bummer. And there is no: ""Create your own scenario"" which is also disappointing.

Overall, I wouldn't say ROTK XIII is a bad game. But it's not a good game either. I would sincerely wait till the game is on sale before making a purchase.

- Very shallow gameplay, it seems complex at first but after a couple of hours it shows how shallow and undeveloped the main components of gameplay (the strategic, battle and social layers).

I've always loved the RotK games that allowed me to play a single officer, almost like an RPG but with a huge evolving war and hundreds of characters interacting around you. It's for this reason that for a long time 10 was my favourite by far, but now I believe 13 has overtaken it, especially with the Fame and Strategy expansion.

It's a hard game to explain to people who aren't already fans of the series. Basically you play as a warlord in ancient China. You can pick from literally hundreds of historical characters, or just make one of your own. You can be anything from a bandit, to a diplomat, to a trader, or an assassin. You can start as a ruler managing your kingdom, your supplies, assigning governers and setting goals. Or you can always stay as an officer, doing what you can to serve your lord, or perhaps making enough friends to one day backstab him and take the lands for yourself.

It has romance, marriage, children, friendships, rivals, many settings to tweak the game to your liking, duels, debates, land battles, sieges, naval battles, town management, quests based on your current role...

I could go on an on about this forever it seems. If you want an interesting mix of RPG/strategy in an open ssndbox then you may like this game. IT certainly helps if you are a fan of the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history of course.

But now I must continues my current playthrough... I made a western character, wrote a bio about his travelling the silk road in search for a new life, now he is a master trader able to fund kingdoms for his own gains and demand debts to be repaid to your enemies.

If you're looking for a grand strategy game in the vein of ROTK XI (or even Total War or Paradox Games), this game probably isn't for you. It's much more a strategy/RPG hybrid, where you control one individual as opposed to an entire country. Before the PUK update, it wasn't particularly good at doing either - strategy or RPG -, but with the expansion, it actually becomes quite engrossing after they fixed many of the original problems. It is a little bland sometimes, and there still isn't great depth to the RPG side of the game, but it's still great fun. The beauty of the game is akin to something like Crusader Kings 2, where you can just roleplay as one man (or woman!); one small cog in a vast machine, working your way up from a junior adviser working under a local prefect, to a prime minister whispering in the ear of the emperor.

The many different events and characters make the game rich, and befriending them and marrying their foster kids is also fun.

I must also note that I have only played with the Fame and Strategy Pack enabled. As well as the other DLCs.

Now, some of the translations can be a bit tricky. For instance when your Force (group) conquers a city, the announcement reads Force loses ""city"" to ""Army"". When it is the other way around... But those are minor quibbles.

I played the RotK series from 8 to 11 (I played RotK 7 but I couldn't get myself to play the rest of the game and I skipped RotK 12). IMHO, the best RotK in role-playing term is 8 while the best in term of strategy and combat is 11. RotK 13 plays by controlling an officer individually like RotK 7, 8, or 10 instead of ruler or force oriented like 9 or 11. This game seems to combine the real time strategy and map experience of RotK 11 only to spice it with a flavor of role-playing. The Fame and Strategy expansion further enhance the role-playing experience with prestige system, marriages and raising your kids. 

However, what brings the game to its downfall are the horrible AI. Let me give you an example from my personal experience. I play with historical setting and standard difficulty. The game favors heavily on Wei or Cao Cao. Ok, I know that Wei is the strongest of the three kingdoms but the game tip the scale of balance further by having Shu and Wu fight each other the momment their alliance ends. So what's the deal you might ask? Didn't Shu and Wu break their alliance over the issue of Jing province? Apparantly, Shu and Wu rulers AI are uncapable of maintaining an alliance and begin their fighting before the year 219 AD when Wei and Wu worked together to bring down Guan Yu and ending with control of Jing under Wu. When I started from Three Visits scenario, the historical events end with Liu Bei getting Jiang Ling and while halfway of controlling Southern Jing, Liu Zhang attacked Liu Bei and Shu seems more interested in attacking Liu Zhang rather than getting control of Jing province. When I started from Battle of Chi Bi scenario, everything played historically with Liu Bei owning Yi and Jing provinces but looks like the Shu ruler AI became overconfident with ""who needs Wu? We can fight both Wei and Wu by ourselves"" decision going against Zhuge Liang policy of ally with Wu to oppose Wei.

I can give you more examples of how terrible the AI act, even when you play as Wei officers, but the DLC policy by Koei further spoiling what could be a good game experience. If you are a fan of the series who wants good role-play experience albeit with bad AI decisions, I can recommend this game for you but buy only when it is on sale and with Fame and Strategy expansion.

Its pretty much just a zergfest with your cities.  Once you own around half the map, you can literally just nonstop attack until you own the rest.  This is the same way you fight every war.  So long as you have roughly equivalent combat officers compared to your opponent, the one with the most population wins.  You just throw troops at them until youve won.  

The combat itself isnt bad, it takes you into a combat map like other romance games and you fight across a battlefield, The problem is that theres nothing really new or innovative.  Its pretty bland and hugely repetative.  Also, while youre fighting, the overworld map is still running.  This can lead to other nations attacking while youre busy with combat, or your opponent bringing more reinforcements while youre stuck fighting, unable to send your own.  Also, the only time you can actually control the combat itself is if your character is physically there fighting.  Even when youre a ruler, you cant control battle without being physically present to fight.  

Thats a huge step down from previous Romance titles, and the only benefit I see to this is those wanting more ""realism"", in which case I could see it as a large bonus.  If youre wanting realism though, this isnt the game for you, as it takes many liberties with history ect.

If this was even half the cost, Id still only recommend it for die hard Romance fans.  For everyone else, Id say dont spend more than 15$ or youll be dissapointed once you have the mechanics down.


Romance XI is only 20$ for PC, and has much better gameplay (last one to be translated to english before this).

Pros:
-	Beautiful character’s portraits, beautiful game scenes
-	Gameplay is deeper than old versions. I can play as many roles, a historical character or a created one; many things to do, many relationship, many skills…
-	Customization is good
-	Good tutorial
-	Adding some other events such as flood, robbers… is a good idea (PUK version).
-	Adding construct some building outside cities is good idea (PUK version).

Cons:

-	AI is bad, especially compared with NA series: 

o	I can easily trick AI by deploying a small troop at a city near them (for example Xuchang in the game), and they react by deploying many troops (can be double or triple mine) at their cities nearby (for example Luoyang, Qiao,…)  their supply cost much more than me 2 or 3 times, and only after some months to 1 year, they can’t deploy any troop, and I can take their cities very easily. 

o	Besides, while I do like above, they only react like above, not attack me although their power are more than me many times. Easily for me, but AI like that is bad.

o	When in real time combat, AI is also bad. They divide their troops to defence all their wall, instead gather all to the gate that I attack, so I can easily break the gate and defeat them.

	Should fix the AI

-	I don’t like the duel of ROTK 13 much. It’s more beautiful, but:

o	I don’t like choosing 5 option at the beginning of the duel, it’s make me not directly react in the duel. It’s bad, especially when my hero is weaker than the opponent.

o	I don’t like the Viking helm of the characters, a Chinese hero wear a Viking helm ???

o	I don’t like the way 2 generals only stand, look together, show their weapons, and rush in. Duel scenes of ROTK XII or ROTK XI is better, 2 general always fight when not choose an option, with soldiers around (ROTK XII), make me more exciting.

o	There is no way to force enemy to fight a duel, why ? Duel is one of the most attractive function of ROTK, and I can’t join any during a long mission ? It’s too bad.

o	I like to control my force’s generals in duel, but can’t. I can only control my character. A bit sad about it.

 I think the Duel gameplay like ROTK XII is better with the 3D image of ROTK XIII (except the Viking helm), and if KOEI add a function to allow forcing a duel (can add a condition when forcing a duel: WAR +/- 10 for balance, and add random chance to duel with no condition), and a function allow controlling other generals in own force, it’s very wonderful.

-	Wei is too strong than Shu and Wu, it’s not logical as the history. In history, there are many reasons that Shu and Wu can fight against Wei in a long time. In the game, they are too weak, so that Wei can defeat them only in a row of battles. Wei control too many cities, all best special soldiers like Tiger Cavalry, Qinzhou Infantry, Mounted Archer, Shu and Wu control too less cities than Wei, and there is no very good special soldiers for them. It’s very imbalanced.

	Should add some advantages for Shu and Wu (such as Shu can fight 50% better on the highland, or Wu can fight 50% better on the river), and add some other special soldiers for Shu and Wu

-	There is no advantage for mountaineers, riverside people or North West grassland people, while distance of mountainous region, riverside region or North West grassland is more than the plain, so when attacked, it’s hard for mountainous, riverside or North West cities to react. It’s not logical, because it’s difficult to move on the mountain for people from plain, but not for mountaineers, and similar with the riverside or grassland people. 

	Should add some advantages for mountainous, riverside or North West cities (For ex: Soldiers of mountainous cities can move 50% faster on the highland, or Soldiers of riverside cities can move 50% faster on the river, or cavalry of North West cities can move 50% faster)

-	I face crashes, average 1 crash/1 hour, and I don’t understand why. My PC run Win 8, chip Intel core i5-2550k, VGA AMD R7 370, 8Gb RAM, can play game at highest settings, but about 1 hour, the game crash. Maybe game errors, maybe my system’s problems, I’m not sure, and if I save game frequently, the crashed not cause much trouble, but make discomfortable.

	If there are many other players face crashes like me, should Koei check it?

Maybe there are other points about ROTK XIII, but I stop here. Anyway, this game worth for playing, I like it, and hope the series are better in the future. Sorry if confusing anyone because of my bad English.",1515387763,1515388406,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Bought this game first on xbox one to see how it was since i thought it would be like an rts style of empires. come to find out it is and more. now i put 60+ hrs into the game on here and more on xbox one so i really enjoy it.

Likes:
Grand strategy style of romance of the three kingdoms.

like empires you can choose your own path or follow someones in history.

character creation is pretty cool. you can give a person with max everything and still die in battle before your time (learned the hard way).

you can marry and have kids to continue on with your legacy

you can also have comrades which will follow you until you die and stuff. (must be in the same faction as you, no high rank than you so you cant be a regular dude and be comrades with the ruler. but you can vise versa. or you all must be free officers)

you can edit any and everything from creating your own officers to editing historic ones, so if you want a beast cao cao you can.

you can edit your own events to happen in history and also you can edit skills you use in battle.

there is a bunch of different senarios to do from the yellow turbans all the way to Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Sun Quan controlling everything.

you can form bonds with people and become sworn siblings with who you want, you just have to put the time in.

you can creat a family if you want, you can set what year they was born so your character you play as can be old when the yellow turban rebellion starts or just becoming of age (15). they can live to be 100 too if they dont die in battle or be assassinated.

you can creat your own faction from all created characters if you want (max 1k created characters)

there is multiple ways of life you can take from being a loner patriot where you serve no one and stay as a free officer and becoming an assassin. ( if you get to be an assassin random officers will challenge you to a duel because you caused chaos in the land. 

you can also be a merchant which i love so far where you can use money to move the battlefield.
example would be i can invest in Liu Bei when he comes to power so he can grow his troops and stuff and i can turn around and also invest in Cao Cao so he can do the same. if you max out the merchant you can use influence you gained from investing with a faction to either call a ceasefire, force an alliance or to even banish someone.

if you serve under someone you can move up the ranks starting at 9 all the way to rank 1, the higher you go the more privilege that ruler gives you. so you can become a minister (domestic, military, war) for the governor of that city, or the region for the ruler. you can also become a governor of a city and you can appoint officers as your ministers or you can do it yourself. and you can eventually become a viceroy which is basically the right hand man to the ruler and you control so many cities and such. so i became viceroy to Dong Zhuo and i basically helped take over China.


Now for my Cons:

Luckily i bought the game with the expansion so i didnt have to worry about the cost of that DLC but the cost of it is stupid high but it is kinda worth it.

if you Alt Tab out and do something else like music or anything while you ar in the map, the map will turn white and you have to exit back to the main menu (save, duh) and load back in.

like all koei tecmo games price tag is high, game and dlcs.

only happend to me a couple times but the game did crash on me, but as long as your auto save is on i didnt much care.

if you are not a fan of managment or grand strategy games dont buy it. dont be that guy that gives it a bad review because you thought it was gonna be an action title.",1514509189,1514509189,True,46,1,0.826374828815460205,0,True,False,False

I had been playing KOEI games since young from RTK1, Bandits Kings, Genghis Khan, Nobunaga's Ambition, Uncharted Waters, Gemfire, L'Emperuer, to name a few. The quality of their historical simulation series games has always been good. Some are better, some are fine, but generally i enjoyed all of them. KOEI games are unique and you cannot really find turn-based strategy on par with their level of detail.

Before RTK13, RTK5 left the deepest impression on me, i personally consider it the best for hotseat play (played all RTKs except 12). What I feel about RTK13 is that the army troop battalion & personal gold system is somewhat confusing at first, the hero tutorial for learning-wise, is not that great. But gamers who can play this game are smart, many stuff you will figure it out yourself somehow in an actual main game. Some things are contradicting to common sense, compared to previous RTKs. If example, you cant execute a diplomatic envoy, you cant transfer gold from your city to your personal gold even if you are the ruler, gold & food transfer is immediate across thousands of miles, cannot really transfer troops to the frontlines (got pros & cons which makes for a different type of play)

NOTE: I play in Chinese, never played in English mode, so maybe some terms I used are not the same as in-game

But apart from all these minor hiccups, I find RTK13 is the best presentation-wise. If you are new to the RTK history, or new to KOEI games, this game is the best introduction you will get. For gameplay, I am not disappointed, definitely very fun and addicting and feels different from the other RTKs. Overall, I greatly enjoy this and will be eagerly looking forward to get the PUK (Power Up Kit) on the next sale.

More Extensive Review:

I've been a longtime fan of the ROTK series, starting from the ol' days of ROTK IV.  Since I never really played the RPG-style games, only installments that feature Ruler Mode (ROTK IV, ROTK IX, ROTK XI, ROTK XII), my opinion does not reflect the previous ways through which Koei executed this feature.

ROTK 13 requires some micromanaging.  Not nearly as extensive as ROTK XI, and if you're somewhat lazy and don't want to deal with all the frustrations of ruling like me, that might be a good thing.  I loved how ROTK IX felt more streamlined than other entries and ROTK XIII delivers on that front.  Attacks are straightforward, commands/orders are straightforward.  If I want to develop my city's commerce, there's a clear amount of time that'll happen and there's no TP to get in my way.

However, cities with a large staff not only take up gold (like in previous entries), but also cannot utilize this large staff to full effect.  You have limited slots and even when your subordinates (governors) can assign people to administrative positions and delegate tasks to other people, there's a limited amount of slots for them.  A city with over 20 officers isn't going to develop itself faster than a city with 12 or so (from what I can tell) officers.

Granted this was a problem in ROTK 12 as well but hey I'm sure we all expected this game to be a huge improvement over 12.  (Not that I actually hated 12.  To me if it came before 11 and was marketed as ROTK 4 Remastered it would actually have been a better-received game.)

Unlike in some of the other entries, though, routes between cities are fixed and you have no option of developing long-term bases at chokepoints or various areas.  This is a missing feature.  There's also a severe lack of variety for unit attacks that this game inherited from 12, even though naval battles make a comeback.  Frankly, this is a huge point against this game.

Not to mention the price.  Sure Koei has expensive games nowadays and $55 isn't quite as horrifying as $90 but are we supposed to praise Koei for making the price less painful?  Especially when ROTK XI is still available as a downloadable game for $20?

This game inherits terrible stats from previous games, and is a far cry from the more 'balanced' stats in ROTK IX imo.  The likes of Zhou Yu and Deng Ai suffer from this, whereas Zhao Yun gets stat buffs but loses his amazing skill 'Insight' from ROTK XI.

I mean at least Guan Yu isn't quite as OP as before right?  And, hey, at least Lu Shang's vanilla stats are respectable.

All in all, this is still a fun experience and the amount of time I've spent on it so far (and likely will continue spending on it)   ensures that this game isn't quite a waste of money.  But I do feel that it's overpriced especially when compared to ROTK XI, and if you are eager to experience a more traditional ROTK experience then look for the ever elusive ROTK X, or maybe VIII (like I said I never played either so I have no idea), or go buy ROTK XI from Gamersgate now.

At the very least, we now have a ROTK on Steam!  Here's hoping for ROTK IX and maybe, MAYBE the return of Dynasty Tactics!",1469763271,1511414768,True,5,0,0.523647129535675049,1,True,False,False

1st of all : BUY THE BUNDLE.  The expansion costs more separately!  Much more!


So this is a grand strategy game with heavy role-playing elements.  You can make your way through ancient China during the Three Kingdoms period as an Officer working for someone else (even a custom-built character!) or be an existing character from the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms story.  The game follows the historical events of the time period by default, but you can fully customize over 100 characters to be whatever you want and randomize their placement simply allowing characters to act naturally.  This kind of experimentation and satisfying simulation of relationships, war, and choice truly realizes its potential.  Even more so while moving through the world as an actual character; it feels like you're really part of what's happening.  So much meaning and depth comes from the relationships and characters extending far beyond the grand strategy base.  Excessive amounts of content to take in and interact with.

Which brings up another point : this game is VERY complicated.  As long as you're willing to read all the info you can on how the game works (with its in-game list of topics and explanations, no doubt!) then you'll be just fine.  Much of the info you need pops up automatically as you encounter new things such as how debates work or what you should be doing right when the session begins.  Take your time to learn and the game will VERY RICHLY REWARD YOU!

The last thing I would want to say is that I'm OBSESSED with the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms story!  If you love history, china, or the three kingdoms period, you'll love the way the setting is executed here.

I was initially hesitant to get the Fame and Strategy Expansion pack as there are numerous reported crashes and issues about it. However, I have yet to encounter any such issues and I think it is safe to say that it is running very smoothly. 
Now about the gameplay itself: Where do I even begin? You basically get to choose a scenario that can start anywhere around the late 2nd century to Mid 3rd Century in ancient China. In addition you can choose a character to be and live out their life or beyond if you have an available heir. (I have not gotten to that point yet). The game will end in three ways to my knowledge: If the game has reached the 4th Century or if a force achieves unification or if the player character dies without any eligible heirs. 

You can also create an original officer and set their name, lifespan, spouse, sworn siblings, archenemy, abilities, and so much more.

Background
I'm not a novice to ROTK series, KOEI diehards will argue otherwise. 
I have played ROTK since the 10th edition. In my opinion, 11th was the best. 

Review
- One year on, 13th is a semi-finished product with glaring bugs that KOEI has no intention to fix. 
- Ridiculous AAA prices for both base + PUK, barren campaign map, poor content, poor PC optimization, etc.
- Don't get started on console ports, PC customers did not pay AAA prices to get screwed over. 
- 1080p max resolution in 2016/17 is a joke.

For example, the Zhao Yun Side Story tutorial mode for Hero Mode more or less crashed everytime I tried to get past some of the objectives. However, now I have no problems with the game in terms of bugs.  In my view, the technical issues that plagued the game at launch are pretty much gone. However, from the reviews on here, it seems that some players are still experiencing those same bugs. 

The majority of my review will be about the Expansion version, since it's almost essential to really enjoy the game.

The new dueling system is better than the old one in my opinion. Even though it leaves more up to chance, the old system made it predictable, since the higher WAR stat would always win. However, with the new system, the underdog has a better chance of winning, and if you plan it out right, you just might not die against Lu Bu or Xu Huang (in the base game I reloaded a save a bunch of times since Xu Huang always challenged me to a duel and killed me instantly). Sometimes in the middle of a battle, I would get something like ""Guan Yu is dueling Niu Jin, do you want to watch?"" Then, I say no, because obviously Guan Yu will win, but then I get a message like ""Guan Yu was crushed in a duel by Niu Jin"" and it's a welcome surprise, especially when Niu Jin was on my side.

The debate system is much better than the old one, since the old one was the same as dueling from the base game. The introduction of subjects and other things also gives lower intelligences the better chance. It's always embarrising when I'm playing as someone with INT in the 80s but then get schooled in a debate against some random bandit guy from the market whose INT is barely over 50, and then I lose all my hard earned gold because he bumped into me and dropped his stupid cup.

In terms of gameplay, it definitely sacrifices some of the kingdom building aspects seen in the last game of this series I played, which was RTK XI, in order to add more RPG elements. I think it does this successfully, and the Expansion Pack definitely expands upon those elements, adding more quests and the comrade and prestige systems, which definitely added more to the replay value.

The game may seem daunting at first, but playing as a ruler definitely gives you the advantage for a swift playthrough, since as long as you time your counterattacks right, you can definitely finish a playthrough fairly quickly. However, playing as an officer, especially as a lower ranking one, may seem frustrating, as sometimes your ruler will move you around to some of the weaker cities before you even finish building up the one you're currently trying to strengthen. However, it's not hard at all to rise through the ranks, especially if you pick higher goals in your missions, so it won't be long until you reach the rank of governor or viceroy if you started from rank 9. So in my opinion, the learning curve is pretty kind. 

One of the biggest problems I have are the minister recommendations. Sometimes a minister will recommend expanding the domestics of a city that is already in High status, wanting to 100% all of its stats, while completely ignoring cities in their jurisdiction that are still in Low or Ruins states. This means that these extra commands under ministers are completely wasted on already well-off cities, and you end up spending the two commands you have as a ruler or viceroy on those cities instead of your ministers helping you out with more commands. I think if they made proposals to enhance the weak cities, they would be much more efficient at their role in the game.

A smaller problem that I have/had is the balancing of some officers. There are many officers in this game, like Li Dian or Zhao Yan (not Yun, he's overrated enough), that I would definitely give better stats. This was a problem in the original base game, but now that you can directly edit historical officers as well in the expansion, this isn't a problem anymore. I still left the terrible stats for Xiahou Mao though. He deserves it. 

The Event Editor is always welcome, since a bunch of events are missing from the base game. Still hoping for a Scenario Editor even though I know it's almost guaranteed we won't get one. Gotta get them monies from the DLC. 

Still, the game is severly lacking in late-game, 260AD-and-after scenarios. You barely have the chance to see any of the later officers like Du Yu and Sun Hao unless you play the game like a civilian just visiting officers and holding banquets for sixty or more years, then dying and choosing a successor, after which you do that for another ten years or so. And that's not fun at all. Then again, I never tried playing as Yuan Shu on the expert difficulty so maybe that game will take long enough to get to those later officers.

All in all, I do not believe this game is worth getting without getting the Expansion Pack as well. At the same time, I don't recommend buying the entire bundle at this price and suggest waiting for a sale. Still, I think this game gets a lot of flak, and in my opinion it's still a good game, especially if you're new to the series and don't have any attachments to the older RTK games.

Having spent countless hours of my childhood playing pirated versions of ROTK 9,10,11, this game has been hot on my list since its annoucment. Bought it asa it came out, bought the power up kit sperately which costed another $30, no complaints tho as im happy sort of a pay back for the hours i spent on the previous games in the series. 

This game however, is just flat out boring. The number of glitches aside, the compaign map involves just one character moving along preseted routes into different cities, yes you would not find any other travelers what so ever! The strategic side of this game is a lot worse than its previous counterparts, you can only set a handful of your generals to do tasks, and YOU as the leader takes up one of these task slots too. It very soon gets boring as no real satisfaction were obtained besides some increase in numbers.

The battle side of is even more DISASTROUS, it is trying to some what mimic the battles in the Total War Franchise, as your generals each control 1 army, and battle in different terrains and you can set them instant movement and attack orders. But lets say that the battle is NO WAY as strategic and fun as total war games as you can only give ur units a handful or simple commands, and the graphic details of armies, sodiers, terrains etc are non-existent.

Havent touched this game for about half a year now, today one of my friend was asking about it, so i decided to write a review, do not recommand this game, ROTK 9,10,11 are great games and much more fun imo, cant wait till they get released on steam in the next few months.",1505984900,1505984900,False,3,0,0.505289316177368164,0,True,False,False

So first the positives: A lot of the flavor of the source material comes through in cut scenes and art. The game fits somewhere between Total War and Civilization in complexity with the unique element of putting the player in the role of a single individual who must build relationships with other talented individuals to succeed.

Now the downside: The tutorial ""Hero Mode"" crashed so often that I almost gave up on the game before finishing the mode. When it wasn't crashing, there were graphical glitches. This issue is even more frustrating given that the level of in-combat rendering is significantly less than other Real-Time Strategy games. Thankfully, the ""Main"" mode was much more stable. 

Even after completing the tutorial, the game has a steep learning curve. The benefits of various building improvements are not presented intuitively, The Great Farm ""allows you to buy provisions"", the Chicken Farm is ""a place to gain provisions"" and the Granary's effect is just +7. Plus 7 what? The manual doesn't say, and there aren't tooltips to help. The user interface also isn't terribly user-friendly. When events pop up in the log, you can't click on location names in the log, nor can you type in the name to search for those locations in the index to find them. Worse, some small towns share names with bigger cities, so an enemy advancing on Wu could be fortifying a small town in the west or moving on a capital city in the east.

Both the debate and duel systems are modified rock-paper-scissors formats. While the debate system has a novel mechanic that offers bonuses for staying on topic and prevents using the same tactic twice in a row, the duel system gives a significant advantage to the character with higher WAR stat and then requires players to set all 5 actions at once. I've never seen the hero with a lower WAR stat win (even with a skill difference of one point), although the Unbalance option is marketed as offering outplay potential.

Finally, the diplomacy system is very limited, which is a particularly glaring shortcoming in a game that invests so much focus on relationships and so much of the story on coalitions and shifting alliances. When an NPC calls for troops across the nation to join against a common enemy, it's not going to be easy to send troops if you have to pass through other factions' territory to get there. It would make the game much more interesting if a character could make an appeal to their fellow lords to depose the usurper controlling the emperor or to come to the emperor's defense.

Overall, it's an intriguing approach to the genre, but one that has made pretty small improvements in gameplay relative to RoTK 8 released on the Playstation 2 in 2001, which itself wasn't so different from KOEI's original Nintendo game ""Bandit Kings of Ancient China"" released in 1989. Bandit Kings was a good game for what the technology allowed 28 years ago, but RoTK 13 feels more like a game that should still be in beta testing than the culmination of three decades of refining games based on generally the same design.",1504672558,1504675065,False,22,1,0.700223028659820557,0,True,False,False

1) Yes its a really good game once you get into it. It grow harder than Civ 5 over time but is much easier than the old Total War games. 
2) If you aren't getting the bundle, don't bother getting the game at all. Without the expansion the game is a classic Koei money sink, also buying the expansion alone seems to cost 40$ Another joke. The whole buying a burger in piece meme applys to this game well.
3) No is not worth 70$, wait for a sale and get it then.
4) The game doesn't crash as much as it used to, sometimes it crashes when loading the map after you pick a scenario but this is rare. There are some bugs here and there.

Once you get through that, the game features tons of officers available to play, a decely balance grow system ""I recomend you change grows to fast, else is just a titanic grind, even with the settings on fast it feels quite slow but good enough for me.

Events from the books happen on their own as years pass and certain conditions are met. Which may be annoying for some people, as working on developing a city may end up becoming a total waste after the story gives it to another faction.

With the expansion you can play as a free roamer, raising your own faction from nothing, really fun to do.

Many officers lack a unique sprite, I don't blame em for this since there's hundred of them but man, people like Sun Ce should have one at least lol.

Finally the game still feels like it lacks a lot of things from the previews instalments of the series and there is a very annoying and percistent bug which prevents you from opening the Prestige menu, forcing you to restart the game.",1503567392,1503567392,True,21,2,0.686143755912780762,0,True,False,False

However the requirements to rank up in some of these lifestyles are outrageously unfair, namely being a mercenary. The tutorial takes ages to get through, then playing an actual game takes a hefty amount of time. So if you're looking for useful reviews, look for some that have played the game 10x as long as me lol.

For the record, I think the PUK is necessary to actually enjoy the game in its entirety which is a TREMENDOUS downside. Paid DLC should NOT complete a base game. You could defend KT by saying they've been doing PUK's for quite some time, but the older base games were more polished and complete than the base of this one.

I have played this game alot, and have been a fan of this serires for a long time. I got in from 10 and checked out mostly all of thier games I could and I have to say that compared to 10, it is not the best... In asia countries...In the states this almost a god send in the franchise, and a criminally underrated game in the States. After 100+ hours of playing I can say with experince that most of the bugs mention almost never happen, AI is very challanging even when flawed, and gameplay is what you want in a strategy game. 

I never loss progress due to a bug in this game, they fixed most of the slowdown issues as far as I can tell and for fans of the series the even have an editor to make your own cutsceens. Far from perfect it still thier, and concdiering power up kits (as they are called) never reach the states, that well worth the price given if not a pick up during your next steam sell. 
The DLC (like most these days) is thier if you want them with no ""you have to buy"" BS, being more content that is totally optional unlike pay to win games, were time is litterly money if you don't pay cash, or like CK2 were the game changes how you play every DLC release, making it a most get unless you want to get cut out of the content. 
(Like the Power up kit it is not needed to play the game, gives some new stuff but you can play without it.)

Still when I check this page looks of people say they can not play the game, and Temco Koei needs to fix it, it as if they don't even play the game, and have no Idea how the game works and just till people not to play it because it's not like Call of Duty, or a Sports game, or Mario, or maybe even Dynasty Warriors.

Apologies for the massive review. But it is a massive game.

First things first - 

[h1]Techical Issues[/h1]
The dismally negative reviews are almost exclusively due to technical issues. The PUK expansion brings with it serious problems that may prevent you from playing. And KOEI is fixing them at a glacial speed. Fortunately, the two main issues I faced had easy workarounds. I will leave them here, just in case - 

[strike][b]Crash at Launch[/b] - This was fixed by temporarily disabling ""active threat control""  in my antivirus settings. Your antivrius will have a similar module. Try disabling it if you have similar issues.[/strike] Fixed after BitDefender update.

[b]Unable to Open Prestige Screen[/b] - I was able to fix this by reducing the CGI settings to ""low"" in the game options. Game does not look any uglier as the beauty of the graphics lies in the gorgeous illustrations, which remain unaffected.

Other than those two I have not faced any game-breaking technical issues. Now to get to the good bits.

[h1]The Base Game - ROTK13[/h1]
This is a character focussed strategy game. Everything revolves around the beautifully illustrated and dramatic (mostly) historical figures from the Three Kingdoms - their friendships and actions through events. You are also able to create custom characters  and events, and insert them into the game.

You essentially play as a single character - who can be anything from a lowly wanderer to the ruler of a vast empire. The things you can do in this game as an individual are quite staggering - 
[list]
 [*]Take orders from your liege, and give orders to your subordinates. Based on your performance, receive dynamic rewards and merit. 
 [*]Based on merit, rise through the ranks from minor official to the governor of a city, be a minister and control part of the government, then a viceroy who rules over a province. Or forge your own path as an independent warlord.
 [*]Engage in debates against other character to push your agenda.
 [*]Engage in duels against other characters in battles or for training, or against bandits.
 [*]Attend court of your liege. Make suggestions. Debate other advisors to make them see your point of view. As a governor, viceroy or sovereign, hold your own court. Listen to suggestions and set the governance goals for the season.
 [*] Form relations with other characters and end up being friends, sworn siblings or spouse. Support them , and receive support from them, in battles or in administrative tasks. Hold banquets. Give gifts.
 [*]Engage in quests for other characters, or your subjects to win reputation and rewards.
 [*]Engage in administrative tasks, and order your subordinates to do the same. Build up commerce, farming and culture and enable your city / province to grow. Train your troops - cavalry, infantry and archers, from light troops to elite warriors. Patrol to keep the roads safe. Placate surrounding villages to bring them into the fold and boost your cities.
 [*]Engage in warfare. Find your place in the feudal chain of command based on your rank - as sub-commander of a regiment, or as the commander of a vast army with hundreds of thousands of troops. Engage in sea, land or siege battles. Use unique tactics.
 [*]Engage in skulduggery. Spy on enemies, coax enemy officers to switch sides, spread rumours.
 [*]Deal with other forces. Negotiate alliances. Call in favours for reinforcements in war.
 [*]Gain enough power and influence. Then rebel against your sovereign in civil war.
[/list]

[h1]Improvements in ROTK13PUK[/h1]
The expansion makes some significant additions - 
[list]
 [*]Maintain your own ""house"", with private armies, friends and family.
 [*]Have children. Oversee their growth into officers.
 [*]Maintain your own retinue of officers - poorly translated as ""comrades"". They can be your relations, or relations of your relations. They hang out at your house and stick with you through thick and thin.
 [*]Train by yourself, or with others, to improve your stats. Discuss strategies and philosophies with other officers for mutual improvements.
 [*]An RPG-esque ""prestige system"" that lets you choose your own path to fame, as a warrior, politician, merchant etc. Gain more prestige, become famous with new cognomens, get more abilities.
 [*]Discuss battle tactics before a battle. I have not explored this yet.
 [*]Build strongholds along the roads to slowdown invaders, as well as grant bonuses to defending armies.
[/list]

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[b]+ Chain of Command.[/b] You play as one person, and do only what he / she is capable of doing. You are not some abstract divine entity that needs to micromanage every city and army. You command, and not control. This makes the gameplay significantly more authentic than something like Total War, or Civ.

[b]+ Realism.[/b] Realistic time scale, realistic marching / movement times, realistic feudal structure, realistic army sizes, realistic reinforcements, no arbitrary limits.

[b]+ Character Focus.[/b] The stronger focus on characters, and more detailed interactions and personalities makes the game a lot more believable. Much better than Crusader Kings, where people are little more than a random portrait and some numbers.

[b]+ Historicity.[/b] Closely aligned with historical events. Characters and forces try to follow their historical paths. This can be toggled on and off in the options.

[b]+ Gorgeous Soundtrack.[/b] Orchestral epic, that shifts in tone based on where you are and what you are doing. 

[b]+ Lenient system requirements.[/b] Can run on a potato PC, at the cost of production values.

[b]+ Custom Characters and Events.[/b] A fun bonus.

[h1]Mixed Feelings[/h1]
[b]Tactical Battles[/b] are not as detailed as Total War. But at least they exist, unlike Crusader Kings. They can be considered appropriately detailed so as not to bog down the grand strategy part.

[b]Endgame Yawns. [/b] Once your force controls most of China with only a couple of factions remaining, then winning the game becomes a matter of time. Personally, I do not mind this.

[h1]Cons fixed by the PUK[/h1]
[b]Micromanagement.[/b] As a viceroy, you can keep conquering cities. Eventually your province itself can become 90% of your ruler's kingdom - a massive micromanagement burden. In the PUK you now have the ability to give cities back to your sovereign if it becomes too much to manage.

[b]Your sovereign can hog all the good officers[/b] in the main game, refusing your request to put them under your command. With the comrade system, you can form personal relations, and bring them over to your city / province.

[b]Duels and Debates[/b] were simplistic luck based affairs in the base game. They are now a lot more tactical.

[b]Shy AI officers[/b] would rarely bond in the base game. Now you can get them to befriend each other through letters.

[h1]Remaining Cons[/h1]
[b]- Poor Production Values.[/b] The 3d graphics and UI are not much to look at. The 2d art and music are great though. 

[b]- Weak Diplomacy.[/b] Diplomacy and foreign relation elements are barebones. You cannot bargain terms. Or form marriage ties, have tributaries etc.

[b]- Lack of Internal Politics.[/b] There are no options or reasons to work against your fellow officers in the same force, like you can do in Crusader Kings.

[b]- Lost in Translation.[/b] If you can only play the English version like me, you will have to figure out a lot of misleading terms in the UI. Read the manual. The steam community is very helpful as well.

[b]- Technical Issues.[/b] The base game was very stable. But the PUK is causing lot of problems for many people, as mentioned in the beginning of the review.",1498802267,1500101639,True,117,1,0.896847069263458252,2,True,False,False

Well, that, and dynasty warriors, which both ended up getting me interested in the novel, and then I found myself guessing and hoping that the real life Liu Bei for example was as benevolent as he was in the book, but nope. But im getting off track here.

This game is brilliant, and it reaches new heights with the expansion pack, which I HIGHLY reccomend. Even if you dont get it, its still fairly solid, but almost incomplete without the expansion. 

The expansion offers a more personal and in depth experience, and improves relationship systems, and lets you set comrades which allow a more personal experience with each officer. They also have child rearing which, I assume when you have a child, you raise them to be the unit you want them to be (Dont quote me on that). Also, theres different ""Life Paths"" you can go on, and you dont HAVE to be some warlord right away, and you can even be a bandit, rounding up soldiers and ransacking china.

My main issue which isnt THAT bad, is this...WHY CANT YOU MAKE CUSTOM SCENARIOS?
 Seriously, I dont mind the eras we have, but after we beat them all, wouldnt it be nice if we got the scenario editor we were promised? Like, set up each territory like in Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires! But anyways, that aside, heres some minor stuff I would like to see added. Custom battles, like in dynasty warriors where you could set each officer up, and edit each base.

I would also like to do mock duels as well, between two officers I want to duel. But these are minor sandbox features and nothing else.

Overall, my rating for this game, from its awesome gameplay to its great story, is a 7/10 without the expansion, and a whopping 9/10 with it. Its not perfect, but I love it regardless, good job Koei :)",1499491078,1499491335,True,4,0,0.546360909938812256,0,True,False,False

My first RoTK was II on the SNES, more than 25 years ago; and I've managed to get my hands on almost every other one, over the years. I was looking forward to this one after having played out XI over the past 9 years.. but the reviews frightened me and I waited (luckily, I think) for the big update and the summer sale.

It is excellent, except that it turns my old PC laptop into a 200 degree jet engine (wish there was an OSX port so I could play on a newer computer..) Outside of battles, reminds me a bit of the old RPG-ish XIII and X. Maybe a bit too heavy on repeated CGI duel/debate scenes (maybe should have an option just for a simpler/quicker graphic since these are basically just card games). Inside battles.. I can't say much, I've only had time to play a long Lone Wolf game and all I've seen is one unit against groups of bandits - but it seems much simpler (and more tedious) than any previous entry I can think of. But you can't have it all. It's just so much fun to wander around classical China and meet historical figures and screw with history..

The tactical  combat within a battle that you can only control is good.  But most battles you don't get to have any control over if you character is not there.  And almost everything else in the game feels like and annoyance.  

The battles that you don't control can takes weeks to resolve, allowing either side to continue to send reinforcements to a battle - I had one game where multiple years were spent fighthing the same continuous battle over a relatively unimportant port because both sides kept sending reinforcements to the battle.   

A nice aspcet of the game is that there are many different play-style routes that you can go down.  But most of them were rather boring and one dimensional if they didn't involve tactical or strategic combat. 

The interface is not very intutive. The Hero Modes (Tutorial) tries to teach you but it failed to give you a real feel of how you were supposed to accomplish things in a full game.  It took me until I finally got bored with the game before I finally figured out how accomplish all of the things that can be done.

The debate system for resolving conversational confrontations is pretty good, but after the 10th time I felt like it was just slowing down the gameplay for the rest of the game.   The duel system was just stupid, I never found a situation where using the option to ""defend"" in a duel did any good - attack was always the better option no matter what the opponent chose.  The Friendship system was kind of interesting and could make you slightly more powerful, but it felt like it was interrupting other gameplay aspects and it had an unimportant role in most games if you started with a hero with reasonably good stats and abilities (except that you needed to get a few freidns to find a bride to produce a child if you are not able to win the scenario in a single generation).  

Overall I would not reccommend the game.  And why was the default voice language Japanese if the entire game happens in China?  It took me a while to figure out how to change the language to Chinese.",1499030266,1499030266,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of the crashes are due to using the ""HD"" option for graphics, going away completely when you're using the normal option - which also looks almost the same tbh.

The learning curve is steep if you're new to the series (like I was). I know people like to be handheld throughout games nowadays but seriously, you could do with reading the manual (provided by the startup application). All it takes is like 3 minutes to understand the foundations of gameplay.

Is this game buggy? Yes, for me it lags on the ""assign title"" screen. Slightly annoying, nothing gamebreaking.
Is this game+DLC overpriced? Yes, but it is to be expected of Koei.
Is the AI terrible? Yes.
Is the game repetitive? Yes, it will get repetitive eventually just like the other Koei RotK games.

But this game doesn't have any alternative, and it is quite fun for what it is. I give it a solid 9/10 relative to games in the same vein (which is basically none other than Koei's other historical sim). You can skip and not play this game, but you won't get similar experience from playing other games on Steam, because there are no other games that are similar to this game.

Here's some 5 cents from me for all of you dumbasses downvoting this game because it is overpriced or buggy. There is a good fps and a bad fps ONLY because there are multiple fps games in the market, so you can pick the good ones and ignore the bad ones. There is only ONE Koei historical sim conquest SLG at a given time. If you don't buy the game after the english version is out, they won't bother translating it to english next time, so you end up screwing yourself.

What this game does well is the relationship and city building when compared to other titles. You can play as either a ruler, governor, or vassal (though the AI will hassle you repeatedly for remaining a vassal). Building rapport and ties with fellow officers enables greater coordination inside and outside of combat. As you play, the game revolves around building a kingdom with a core group of officers and expanding before enemy forces outnumber/surround you.

[u]Positives[/u]
+ Amazing Portraits with good dialogue
+ Fulfilling game progression (from leading one city to expanding)
+ Epic score
+ Create Your Own Officer! (import portraits as well)

[u]Negatives[/u]
- AI has some flaws [sending reinforcement units 1 by 1 rather than all at once].
- AI will eventually surround + team up against you unfairly on higher difficulties
- Game missing some key elements to make it stand out (waiting on the PUK!)
- If you're not familiar with the history + characters, this will be daunting. 

As mentioned in my last note, the PUK should be arriving in the US at around late April (I think). The expansion brings with it a number of features that will make ROTK 13 the best in my opinion. Only downside with it is that it'll cost an additional 30+ dollars to purchase...

Most games fall into either an RPG focus (where you can be any officer and build relationships) or a strategy focus (force leaders only). This game has the wide range of RPG elements that ROTK 8 and 10 had, plus the real-time battles from ROTK 12. While other games in the series made large-scale, million-man  attack campaigns a laborious chore, this game allows for a lot of automation for both army and city improvement. The ability to rotate the camera and zoom seamlessly in and out really makes the game seem as streamlined as ROTK 9, yet the RPG elements are still in place.

For the record, my ROTK preference is: 9 > 10 > 12 > 8 > 11 > 7 > 4 ...

I highly recommend this entry in the series to any ROTK fan. For anyone who hasn't play a ROTK game before, this is the perfect entry in the series, with the best tutorials out of any of the games.

ROTK 13 follows a similar path to the 8th game in the series rather than the 11th, personally I enjoyed both styles though found 8 to be more unique.

ROTK 13 takes this further and tries to add more detail in places instead of the ability, as in 8, to control multiple characters. This can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. 

My biggest issue is with historical events, unlike some people I rather enjoy their inclusion but am rather put off by how easily a player can derail them. While this is understandable I think the triggers for them are a little too specific at times. The events also cease after the 3 kingdoms are established, so no events leading to the rise of Jin. Other than that the events are integrated well, players can stay in historic mode but turn off events if they want or can go into an entirely fictional game mode; where the AI ignores history.

There are also some elements which can get annoying. Viceroys seems a little odd for the AI to handle, you end up getting most of you Lord's land most of the time as you are doing all the expansion. Except on the odd occasion when the AI decides to launch an attack and expect you to help, sometimes deploying your forces as part of their attack plan. These attacks tend to have little chance of success if you don't send a large support force from your remaining lands. The faction leaders also seems unwilling to ever change their 3 ministers unless one of them dies, even if there are better options. A little more dialogue variety would also be nice as would some more character specific dialogue. Finally, even in historic mode the game can make some small blunders even if left uninfluenced, such as Gongsun Zan losing to his eastern neighbour; though the end result so far has always been the same.

The combat is similar to 8 but with some added units and alterations to the formula, essentially spears beat horse, horse beats bow, bow beats spear. But there are other considerations such as the officers attached to the unit, one leader and two adjuctants, how advanced the unit is and any tactics used. Bows are naturally better at a range and not as good if spearman reach them. Units take greater losses to morale and men if pincered, bowman must melee to pincer, if a unit loses all morale it routs. Routing units remain on the field but take heavy losses until morale recovers a little. Morale is crucial to the combat and its loss can allow a weaker force to overcome a larger, more powerful one.

DLC has provided some more starting points in the main campaign but these are a little expensive, especially given the price of the main game is rather high. If you intend to purchase the game and DLC I would strongly advise, as with most games on steam, waiting for a sale.",1489687383,1489688518,True,5,0,0.553502917289733887,0,True,False,False

Secondly the best way to find out if you will like a game, is to play it!
If you are a fan buy it and try it yourself, review on it, so hopefully they will make a newer and better version.
I have been a fan of the game since RTK2, which I will still play if I can get it to install on my new PC.
Only time game crash is when I alt-tab a few times to windows. I haven't encountered any bug or pc crash during game play. They might have updated the game when I bought it.

What I like about RTK13:
Able to create your own Characters.
Able to roam Free, join a Ruler or become a Ruler.
Able to visit other Cities, meet Generals and buy Things from stores.
Able to make friends with Generals.
Better cinematic graphics storytelling in history mode.
I personally enjoy hours of game play and pause whenever I need to.

What I would like RTK13 to include:
Able to better control the generals army movement.
Able to select different army formations.
Able to select charge or regular attacks.
Able to have a chance to ambush enemies in the jungle.
Able to manually provoke a general to duel, instead of just auto and random duels.
Able to manually recruit/buy troops base on city population.
Able to move troops around cities base on city size and keep their trained skills.

Quick update, the game had some patch and become much better now.
I believe it is much more playable for most ppl this time.
Looking forward to see the powered pack expension.
What? want me to take back the thump down?
No Freaking Way! lol

----------------------------------------------------------initial review below------------------------------------------------------

Reaally? $90? With no English support? And come with a broken release? Seriously? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!
The game was titled ""RPG style gameplay"", yet it has less RPG element than either the 8th or 10th title of the series, (I wanna say ""with the least RPG element"", but I didn't went through all the RPG style titles, so let's stay conservative)
No actual facility interactions, all cities have exactly the SAME buildings, merely no request or mission or anything if you are not hired by a faction.
And the worst part, when you are enlisted in an army as a COMMON SQUAD LEADER, you are FORCED to take control or command or whatever of the whole battle field . WTF? I AM JUST A FREAKING SQUAD LEADER! 

There are some other weird settings in the game , like a man can get three wives; a woman can get three husband; you can play Romeo & juliet in the game coz you cannot hire your own wife/husband from other factions, well, and you cannot hire them if they are too far away either; your son/daughter, husband/wife talks to you like strangers; only you ride horses in the world, other ppl use teleportation or ride horses that makes them transparent; you cannot resupply troops for your army (don't get this) unless you disband your army and gather them again at your home city; your can instantly transport food, money, but not troops (Why? because teleportation technology kills?); shared command point makes most of your generals' battle skills useless in a battle, and many more.

if you are playing as anyone except for the lord/emperor, you will eventually become the general/metro governor. Your lord will give you control of everything except for diplomacy, which means you will have to assign governor for every single city and allocate generals to the cities ONE BY ONE. When some governors are killed or captured in the battle, you will have to assign the governor again! Moreover, since you are in control of everything except for diplomacy, you will have to fight all battles without forming alliances or peace treaty with anyone, you will have to micro manage armies from every city to disband, march, rally, resupply and everything. Something that creates more ""fun"" is when one of your city is attacked, the governor of the city will NOT resist! you will have to command them to resist. It may happen when you get out of one manually controled battle, you find that your enemy has taken control several of your cities with 100k troops in it, WITHOUT EVEN A FIGHT. Even worse, your lord will sometimes order your armies away when your border is under heavy attack lol. A dump lord is definitely a good way to increase difficulty of this game!

This is the WORST RPG style ROTK I ever played! should've gone 3dm or whatever other sites.

OK, I'll be honest, the CGs are decent and playing as lord is playable (better than XII), but that's all.

This game is strongly NOT RECOMMENDED unless the PK version gives this game a complete overhaul!

QA & PS

PS: I read the comments and found that many ppl thought I bought the game without any previous research not knowing it came without English ver., but actually i was fully aware that this game came with no English support when I bought it. I just feel so unfair that it was sold way more expensive in English speaking region without localization. I bought this game with so much expectation, because the ads emphasized on RPG elements of the game which reminded me of ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms X PK"", the recent RPG style ROTK, thought I could play something similar...

well, such a disappointment.

QA
1)
""Due to massively large complains to RoTK 10's stupid ai, Koei decides to let us players taking control of the whole battle field in 13. I don't think this change is wrong.""

Let player take control over friendly AI is never a suitable solution to dump AI. Enemy AI was dump, too, so who's gonna take over that? Making this a multiplayer game?
Plz improve your AI instead of using that as an excuse and let players fix it for you.

Good thing about X is that it is your choice of how you play. As a common general, you need to fix your boss's dump dicisions, it happens when you serve your lord or manager or board ! It also happens that friendly will just leave you there to die in battlefield, maybe coz they simply don't like you! I bet everyone knows this kind of workplace drama!
if you don't like friendly AI, just go play as a lord! You can take control of everything! It is kinda how reality works.",1453993649,1487470478,False,389,79,0.648966431617736816,36,True,False,False

Personally, I think this game is an incredibly good strategy game, having multiple different kinds of game within it, like the dual system, the pretty simple but fun rts style battles and the whole way to get more officers, by befriending them (In a weird sort of dating sim way.)

If this is your introduction to the series, it's a bit difficult to understand straight away, and the tutorials are incredibly wordy if you're just wanting to get straight into the game. However if you have played any of the dynasty warriors games you'll at least vaguely understand the story, and recognise a tonne of the characters, and be able to make your own too, which is always a nice little touch.

But yeah, I can't fully understand why this has currently got a bad set of reviews, because all in all it's a good strategy game, and, in near 4 hours solid of playing I've had 0 bugs/glitches, 0 crashes, and absolutely no real issues.

This version of the game is very different. This game is not the macro strategy game of the past. In this version, it feels more like 'football manager' whereby you start as a lone character who climbs the corporate ladder by fufilling 'Targets'. Once you become promoted to the 'manager' a.k.a ruler of a city, you need to entertain multiple requests and supervise the workings of a city while fufilling more 'Performance Targets'.

It reminds me of the game 'crusader kings' whereby you climb the 'corporate' ladder, befriend as many people as possible so that they will support when you .... eventually revolt and betray your ruler so that you can rule the nation that you have worked hard to build. 

Befriending people is also the strategy to improve your skills if you start off poorly.

I have logged over 40 hours so far. REally trying to be fair to all the game's workings. Frankly, the learning curve has been easy but frustrating. For the investment, I rate it at a $20 USD game. Way over priced for what Koei has put into it. Most of the console games look and play better. Sure if your a PC geek you can make custom portraits. But I was looking more for playability. 

The art work is quaint and well done but far from modern standards of graphics. The redundancy of the graphics, voice actors, annoying redundant play interuptions from subordinates, ridiculous combat control, leaves me wanting half my money back. The translations acutally have typos and the translations aren't even appropriate in content. The voice actors must be maybe 5 of them? Are redundant and annoyingly repeditive. The AI if you could call it that is number driven only. Characters have no personality and battles are just number crunching. There is no real in depth strategies that apply.

I read one review where they stated that as you near the end and think you might take China, the last ruler has endless troops and uses special attacks every 10 to 20 seconds vs your characters of every 5 minutes. That's on easy! 

I can't find a way to win the game. One player suggested the blitz technique of running at the other rulers as fast as you can before they build up their forces. That might be fine if your not playing an original ruler. because you're starting from scratch and the other established rulers have built up already.

The overall interface using a keyboard and mouse combination is quirky but the screen is so busy that clicking on small icons becomes a major task (especially in battles). One missed click and the battle is over. 

The overall idea of the game is fascinating and intriguing and I love the series even having read the oringinal enlish versions of the Three Kingdoms. The History is fascinating. The bits and pieces that the developers chose to animate seem clunky and at times don't fit well (lack of continuity). 

All this would be fine for a free or $10 game but not for a $50 game! 

I have done coding for games myself and understand the complexity of game engines. But the programmers and developers weren't all in the same room when it came to a finished product. The game feels like bits and pieces of programmed game code were jammed together without a real feel for flow of playability and continuity of plot and action.

It makes the console versions of ROTK seem fun and playable, really coudn't they have made a better product for the PC? (besides making custom portaits?) Some variety of items, challenges, riddles, special powers, etc would be endless on a PC format. There were reviews suggesting a version of Historical Fiction that would offer more playability options.

The annoying and redundant voices, play interuptions, espcially during battles should all be player controlled with icons, drop down menus or ??? but the AI runs over the top of the player and you find yourself competing with the interuptions or should I say disruptions? 

The first two thirds of the gaming is redundant farming, building up, etc and hoping that you dont get attacked and ruined before you build up your city. The play as a free agent and hiring on for some warlord is interesting but i could never get on the winning side, no matter which ruler I picked?! Not sure how to go about unlocking some of the characters, items and secret places? There is very little info on the internet about this game, (too new?)

I think Koei Temco needed some cash from the Americans and pushed this less than stellar game on the english speaking world before it was ready. Perhaps they were doing us veterans of ROTK a favor but not this one!

Graphics are decent and the moving portraits cool.  Battles are now more strategical than in the past, but is still fairly easy to take advantage of computer AI.  However not all battles can be controlled manually, only those in which your hero partakes or commands. 

Things I'd still like to see: 
#1.  Ability to build a personal fictional scenario (set up ruler factions manually, select starting year)   This could create untold replayability, being able to customize each game and still follow many of the historical settings (relationships, officer appearance year) while still being an entirely fictional game.  Imagine being able to build a scenario and you can see how this would be a very cool feature. 

#2.  Expanded random encounters / treasure rewards.   Make investigation actions, or random encounters to include more than simply 2 encounters that always provide the same reward: gold.   Why not include hermits, tigers, or situations of peril that can have specialty item rewards.   Simply buying or siezing specialty equipment is kind of lame when some of the best gear should have to be earned.",1483896705,1483896705,True,2,0,0.502271950244903564,0,True,False,False

- The relationship aspect is very good, you need to actively help/gift/talk with the officer that you want to bond with. Some officers are not materialistic so you can't simply shower them with goodies and to talk with them you need to make them grateful to you first. There are other events like meeting in the street etc, it happen much more often than in RotK 10
- Diplomacy is very detailed, networking is very important. It's like when Zhuge Liang tried to confince Sun Quan to ally with Liu Bei instead of surendering to Cao Cao's massive army & ships. At first Zhuge Liang only manage to get Lu Su's support. Then Lu Su introduce him to Zhou Yu (yes, this game have letter of introduction system too!). Zhou Yu doesn't trust Zhuge Liang so there is a debate event first. After winning the debate now Zhuge Liang has 2 supports from Sun Quan's closes advisor. Zhuge Liang then presents her proposal again to Sun Quan with the support of Zhou Yu & Lu Su.
- The war system is an improved version of Nobunaga's Ambition Sphere of Influence. It's semi real time where you can choose the battle speed or pause it anytime to think stuff more carefully
- When you decalre your new country, people who has bonds with you will come & join you. It's just like When Sun Ce freed himself from Yuan Shu, Zhou Yu joined & bolster his forces.
- There is a council that happen regularly to decide the country's direction. You and other officer can propose some plan, then votes will happen, and there might be a debate too!
- Coalition war from Nobunaga's Ambition make a return!

Neutrals:
- The debate system is pretty fun but it will be nice if more option is added to minimize the luck factor. Some debate moves need 0 will, some other need 1, & the rest need 2. So basically you guess what your opponent's next move by looking at how much ""will"" they have. Sometimes the enemy will say something that gives a hint of what they're going to do, further increasing your chance of countering correctly.
- There is a fun coalition system in this game, however it seems that only AI can initate this & when they do there is no option for you to make a counter alliance. 

Cons:
- The duel is the same as the debate, and it's not really work because it makes the battle feels boring & too peaceful? like attack once, then walk slowly while waiting your input, repeats. There is also no option to initiate duel so it seems to be random? I think the best duel is Rotk 11. It's very lively and feels like a real battle since both sides are hitting each other continuously while riding high speed on their horse.
- During the war, duels happens at random and at a very low rate. Duels are usually happen during your daily missions instead in war
- While the music is nice, it's nowhere near the epicness of Rotk 11 & they also kinda lacking in oriental feels too.
- There's not many unit type in the game. Majority boils down to archers, cavalry, & infantry just with different stats. The only unique unit is mounted archers.

Notes:
- People says that you can only have 2 orders max therefore having 2 officers is no different than having 100 officers. This is entirely false because the other officers will still do his works automatically even without your orders as long as you assign governors & ministers, they will have their own initiative & will propose things to upgrade your city, hire other officers, train your troops, etc. 
- People says that it's stupid that troops in this game can't be transfered. This is actually a decision to focus on realism. Yup, can't transfer troops in real life because people can't change their hometown with a push of a button. Soldiers will get homesick because they can't meet their family which result in low morale, running away, etc. During long campaign like Zhuge Liang's northern campaign, the soldiers are rotated so they current soldiers go home & fresh new soldiers take their position. There is a story where Wei attacked during this rotation. The current soldiers panicked because they're afraid that Zhuge Liang will prevent them from going home. Obviously Zhuge Liang didn't do that and stll sending them all back to their home. The soldiers knowing their lords situation changed their stance, refuse to go home & fight the Wei army's first.",1468650794,1483883156,True,8,0,0.608242154121398926,0,True,False,False

Got attacked by Dong Zhou's 1000000 troops reinforcements is not fun. I was trying to go slowly and enjoy the city buildings and stuff so the game drag on for a long time and got over run. I think if you play in a quick semi-quick pace, you should be ok since the enemies don't have time to build their armies as well. They need to put in limit on how many cities you can attack and reinforce from like in RTK 3 where only the adjacent cities can attack not the ones far away. Otherwise, never ending fights and exchausting fights which turn off fun. That is my biggest issue with this game. Now, I need to start a new game and play in a quick pace style to prevent enemies from building their troops too big.
ON THE BIG PLUS SIDE, you can create your own officer images by using the Officer CG Edit Tool that came with the game. Instruction is in the Help menu's Readme text file.

Generally the AI can be very stupid but it had to because a strong AI is almost unbeatable. 

The ai can be quite aggressive so if you don't spend effort in diplomacy and form alliance as soon as possible, you get rushed very fast and you lose the game even faster. Kind of glad why the AI mostly willing to agree to alliance.

The battle is actually fun despite it weirdness, everything happens in real time so you are always on your feet. Sadly, once your kingdom grow, you don't have much time for tactical battles and direct your battles strategically in the strategical map.

The duels and debates are not as bad as some of the reviews make them out to be but I would prefer that the duels should be animated more dramatically.

Finally, for the price they are charging, they should have at least spend more effort in modelling every single historical character instead of only giving it to a few main characters. Players created characters should be allow to chose the right models to represent their characters. I call that lazy for a $90 retail price game. Good thing I bought this at steam discounted price.

This game is trying to be something that it isn't.  It's trying to have a ""manage a city"" as part of the game, but I find it rather limited and pointless.  Like a lot of people's reviews, the dueling and debate are also pointless.  RTK 13 fails because it's confuse at what type of game it really wants to be.  When battling, the graphics of the landscape and castle walls are great but is cheapened on the soldiers and how they move.  

I know that along with many fans, I've been let down year after year with empty promises.  I don't see a bright future with this series.

The makers need to change with time and not milk off the same title year after year.  If they really wanted a great game, they really need to have more of an open sand box style game.  The roads can stay, but allow the players to move almost anywhere on the map they please.  Knowing how RTK really should be, which should be like Total War mixed with Mount and Blade, mixed with Dynasty Warriors type fighting with blood, RTK 13 is quite the huge dissapointment.  I've played as many RTK as I was able to get since back then on Playstation.  The simplicity of those make RTK13 look like crap.

The economic and ""busy"" aspect of RTK has been brought down significantly. Domestic issues are a very small slice of what is otherwise basically a battle SIM. That being said, it's  an AWESOME battle sim. There are 100s (so far that I've seen) of battle maps, each with unique walls, rivers, forts and bridges to hold. Flanking your opponent and otherwise out maneuvering has never been as important or rewarding. Reinforcements from multiple kingdoms and coalitions can enter a battle and cause absolute bedlam. Strategists are now almost as valuable as warriors in combat causing enemy morale to plummet time after time. Small quests appear moment to moment in the battle to cause your morale to rise and fall and turn the tides of combat. It's just really the coolest shit, ever. That being said, if you were into letting the computer handle the combat aspect in ROTK, you will loathe 13. The non-combat aspect of the game is really, really basic and uninteresting.

Yuan Shang controls the emperor at Chang'An and has hegemony over everything north of the Yellow River with a sizable army, and Liu Biao is enjoying life in Jingzhou. No more Cao Cao as Yuan Shao seems to always overpower him in the early scenarios . Sun Jian mati early and Sun Ce ran straight into Liu Bei and Lu Bu instead of whacking Liu Biao.

Gan Shi took all of Shu and Wei's capable generals and letf me with Wu generals. Luckily ZhouYu is still alive and he is leading an attack across Baima towards Ye.

The result? Its not the best ROTK, but at least you can taste a lil bit of everything. One thing to note: The character artwork is very well done to the point of impressive.

Pros:
+ Stunning character artwork, almost all officer artwork is unique and appealing
+ Hero mode scenario is fun to play
+ User friendly UI
+ Duel & Debate feels better compared to any other ROTK
+ There's option to set AI behavior to historical, and they do their best to follow history (unlike any other ROTK where Liu Biao employs Zhuge Liang into their ranks).

Cons:
- RPG elements such as personal relationship, bonds, ranks, etc is overly simple with lacks feature.
- Strategy elements is limited (one route to cities, no ambush, lacks army unit type)
- The world feels so bland, need more touch like ROTK X
- Kingdom management and town development is too limited (max you can assign 8 + 1 officer to develop).
- Battle skills feel so generic and won't offer significant advantage (maybe good?)

Neutral:
- AI is dumb and predictable as you can expect in all KOEI's historical simulation
- Real time battle system (like NA, if you enjoy it)
- Officer creation still haven't improved much since ROTK X & XI

Disadvantage:
- No defense systen (Wall, Camp / Fort, Tower, Port) built-able by player.
- The route is too simplified that all forces ended up running into each other. No shortcut or terrain advantage that player could make use of to select the best battle field, trap and ambush.
- Resource re-allocation is a failure. How could you buy as ton of food when you urgently need in a very short time? Even able to redistribute food and gold amongs city within eye blink. Resource transportation is an art of war. I bet you guy missed it.
- Pike troop type is abolished, to which I don't agree. Spear kill Horse more effectively that Pike, Pike kill Spear, Horse kill Bow, Bow kill Spear/Pike. Even in reality, Sword has certain role in the battle field. Here, we see no Sword.
- Duel? I didn't figure out how to actively duel or trigger tricks, such as confusion, pertube, etc. Without those, you can only win by strong general with more troop count.
- Losing the city = lose that army is not reasonable. As long as the general is still there, troop morale should be reserved at some level to keep fighting rather than dispersed all at once.
- Arranged marriage is no longer valid.
- Marry 3 wifes is a good thing, but having no children with them = senseless point. A leader should have heir by their own, rather than be shaped by historical mode.
- Rare items are cheap in shop, especially be sold mostly in Chang An (a +10 to stat could be bought at 6K - 7K coin). I would suggest rare item found from Search / Investigate. Price of the item should be defined by the Trader, however here the price is equal in all cities.
- Coalition is sensitive to Tyrany is good, however making Ally is way too easy. Sometimes, alliance can never be bought but has already defined in the head of each leader.

There's a million things to do, people to help, friends to hang out with, mini-quests to help the peasants with whatever. This is good because it makes it addictive, definitely has that, ""I just gotta do this one more thing . . ."" aspect that kills your social life for a week or two. 
The bad part of that is that you sometimes get so wrapped up in creating relationships and building up your city that you didn't notice everyone around you went on a conquering spree and then decided to throw a coalition against you (it's really easy to ""accidentally"" become evil just by allowing death in the game, I've accidentally killed a few rulers in battle, once while on the way to negotiating a truce >D HA!). The music is good enough, if not what I expected (was not expecting western style music for the majority of the game, and the ending music . . . AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!! It's awful! >D)

If you wish to micromanage every aspect of your empire, you will be highly dissapointed. The game focuses more on delegating managment of your empire to the governors/ministers you assign. This allows you, as the player to focus on the bigger picture. Taking back control of China. The game is harder than it's previous games and the battle system can be quite a challenge trying to defeat an army or take a town before your supplies run out

The game offers a Hero mode, which is basically a turtorial in the beginning and turns into the story of the Three Kingdoms period. Hero mode is basically a story mode. Nice change of pace. You can play as any officer in the game and have the ability to create 150 generals. How officers become loyal to you and possibly your empire if you a governor or higher, is all about giving gifts creating bonds and achieving goals. There is a new social interaction that lets you create all types of bonds with all the chacters in the game. As your bond increases so does your abilities and their's as well.  Overall the gameplay and challenge is really good. Once you get usto the new managment system, the game really shines. The RPG aspect seems to have potential but falls short. 

The game has allot of potential and hopefully Tecmo Koei will address some of the short comings in the game, at a future date. This game could easily use multiplayer. All the unit skins look pretty much the same, which is just laziness on the developer part. You can't zoom in and watch the units fight, like you can in the Total War Series. There is no way to make other rulers become a vessal state. The bio's of your user created generals can not be auto generated, like in previous games. No english narritive when watching main cut screens. Sign of laziness on the part of developers and a smack in the face to the english speaking fans. Where the game would have truly shine, would have been, with steam workshop. Allowing us to upload our generals and own scenarios to Steam would have given the game, tremendious amount of replay value. 

The current price of the game is a problem. With all the DLC the game comes close to 80 bucks. Not an 80 dollar game. The game is fun but more like a $40 dollar game, with all the DLCS. Wait fo PUK kit and possibly a sale before getting this game, but do get it. It is still a fun game.

For example, in ROTK10 your officer could always take the initiative and work to help his side without orders, but in ROTK13 you must formally ask your ruler every time you want to improve infrastructure or drilling troops. 

The game has the same old problem where nothing really matters except how many officers your side employs, and officer availability is heavily biased in favor of the historically strong factions (mainly Cao Cao). As usual, the relationship system is shallow and undeveloped, and it's ridiculously difficult and time consuming to form strong relationships with officers. That makes it even harder to overcome the officer disbalance, because practically speaking your actions can barely chip away at the pre-programmed character relationships, and relationships are critical for recruiting officers and avoiding defections. If you make a custom character, you almost certainly need to join an existing faction; if you want to found your own faction, you better make a team of custom officers who like each other.

I own it now on a computer, and this has got to be one the most boring games I've played...ever. They have great ideas, and may just need more time to advance them, however it feels as if they are trying to blend a turn based stratagey with a RTS, so you are litterally sitting and watching your icon, which looks like a tiny red kick ball , but is actually a small red portrait of your character that  empties as time goes on, and you get closer to completing your mission. Want to train some soldiers? Awesome, 10 days (game time) of watching this ball drain. 

The best parts of the series are still there. You can visit other officers. Cultivate your cities, build armies, train them, make alliances, ask for supplies, all of the features you love, (I'll get to the wars in a little bit. ) Yes all the features you love are here, however I hope you like looking at that red kick ball, because that is what you will be doing most of the time. Want to form an alliance with the next town over? Yeah!!! Okay watch your horse run across the map for 8 days in game. (maybe a minute or two)Then once you get to the foreign leader be ready for a whole bunch of cut scences. 

The battles have promise. I personally would rather see the wars as turn based instead of  real time that you can pause to issue orders, but this style isn't  horrible, just not great. It also feels as though they may have tried to give the battles a little chaos, if this was their intention however they just didn't hit the mark, and it feels like gears grinding that every once and a while hit a smooth spot. 

If you are like me, and you are a huge fan of the series, then nothing will matter, you'll buy it, and play, and maybe even still find it in your heart to love it. However if you are not used to this series, and you are just looking for a new strategy game to throw down on, just keep moving, you'll hate it.

Finally I decided to buy during the promotion, just to support Koei because if not they probably won't be doing any more RTK games in the future. I was pleasantly surprised by the game and the feeling of being immersed in the beauty of China's history came back once more.

I'll start by addressing the bad feedbacks from Steam which I think are valid. Some of the bad feedbacks are really rhetorical and easily answered with simple common sense.

Ranking system that changes gameplay. like going for a regular officer to governing a city to controlling many of the rulers cities and controlling many armys instead of just your in command.

Has events that are based off what happened in history

You can create your own character and make them excel and not excel at what youd like them to.

Unlockables like special characters and portraits for doing achievemnets

Battles can be pretty big

Cons- Lack of later scenarios

Does not explain alto of stats well.

Not being able to control others in Duels against the enemy can be a bit annoyng

His forces move quickly and decisively.  And now they march for Beihai, as soon as it was ours!  Cao's force greatly outnumbers ours, and he leads many powerful officers.  What to do?  If they take Beihai, our position will be split, and we will certainly be swallowed by the greater warlords.  We must stop the seige and save the city, at any cost.

This was the situation I faced very soon after the start of my first 'real' game in the role of Guan Yu.  Luckily, the three brothers are a force to be reckoned with and can withstand greater numbers in battle.  I saved the game as Cao Cao went on the attack, and had to try three times before I got the battle plan right.  At first, I felt like giving up.  Cao Cao steamrolled my units one by one and my city fell.  The second time I decided to let him get to the city and siege it, closing in from behind with two armies from other cities.  But... I didn't time my march properly and the city fell before I even got there, and my units didn't coordinate and again were crushed.

Finally, I decided to let Cao Cao march past Jibei, a city he had just subdued (before I could liberate it) directly across the river.  I would march one army in defense of the city, and the three brothers would attack Jibei just as Cao was reaching the siege at Beihai.  The plan worked, and Cao marched his giant army back to reinforce his city.  He made it just as Zhang Fei bashed down the city gates.  Unfortunately, we were outnumbered 2 to 1.  Cao's forces were everywhere.  22500 troops against our 12000.  I dueled Xiahou Yuan and won.  His unit was crushed.  Zhang Fei and I crushed another unit.  But brother Liu was in trouble at the base and we fought until our forces were scattered.  In the process we decimated 2 more units and left Cao's army with only 7500 soldiers while we managed a meager retreat.  I didn't win the battle but the local situation had suddenly changed.  Cao is not attacking anymore and his smaller force seems to be sticking around to defend Jibei.  Yuan Shao had an enormous army just watching from the other side of the river.  Scaredy cat.  I hope he turns on Cao now while he is weakened!

Suddenly this game comes to life for me and I realize the tense and intracate web of history simulated by this game.  Had I lost this time, I had vowed to go on with Guan Yu, and if the Liu Bei force was wiped out, we would try to flee Cao or look for our chance to break free again if we weren't executed.  In the history, Lord Guan is captured by Cao at one point.  He serves him loyally, and Cao is trying to win him over.  But when Liu Bei resurfaces, Lord Guan keeps his promise and leaves Cao Cao behind to join his brother.  

If you have extra cash to drop and extra time to play,  I recommend this game.  The day-to-day sort of actions that make up the main game play really only come to life once the battles begin and power starts to shift around China.  Join the winning team, or fight with the underdogs.  Go found your own force in a unclaimed province.  Cao Cao will always be around whoopin ass, but clever strategy can keep the balance and your force can hang in there and try to bring peace to the land!",1469160687,1469160687,True,2,0,0.51313096284866333,0,True,False,False

Even after hearing it was transfered to english, I avoided it because of the things people had said about it. But, I had been a dedicated fan of the series since the first one released for (ehem, yep I am gettin up there in years haha) nintendo. I have always loved this series, not because of Dynasty Warriors, like so many (although there is nothing wrong with that)....Or because of these games, but because I had read the stories of the era if the Han dynasty  already. Yes, I am THAT big of a history nerd. How many of us actually read this stuff for entertainment. But I tell you now, its one of the most interesting collections of historical tales, with more larger then life heroes, then any 100 action movies combined!  I loved them growing up! It had been a couple of years since I read them, when I was later settled down and married... At the time, video games were not really my thing, but my kids loved thier Mario games, and thier Nintedo.And so it was while shopping with my (ex) wife for Xmas gifts for my kids at Toys r Us one year, I saw this ROTK title sitting on the shelf (next to Gengis Khan at that...But this was better lol)....And grabbed it up shocked that they had made a game of Luo Guan Zongs amazing novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms!!!! And it lived up to the novel imo (back then we were impressed by nintendo, LOL wow how technology changes!!!)...from then on, I  pre ordered every 3 Kingdoms game ever released as it came out, and became a devoted fan of Koei, and all of its spin offs.( With the surge of fantasy popularity where the hell is a new Gemfire? Had to ask lol)..The only ROTK that ever disapointed me was 11...And after hearing from several critics that this was a backslide from 11, I dodged it. But out of boredom, I looked up a lets play on Youtube...And man am I glad I did!! This is the follow up to 10 that 12 SHOULD have been, and strides forward, not backwards, from what had come before...Sure, its more of what the series has always offered, but this time, they unleashed all they had been holding back....It has awesome CG scenes, deep and complex mechanics, and for once, the game doesnt assume you are too stupid to handle complexity and a plethora of commands to remember. In other words, they didnt try to keep it simple, but they made a game within a game to teach you all you need in a fun and interesting way through its heros mode!!!

Your first steps will be playing Hero mode....Youll need this, but dont worry, its actually the best done tutorial-game mode introduction any series ever did in this genre! It will take you on a tour of the Three Kingdoms saga, playing through some of the most important events of the Era, which will  be nostalgic for long time fans (or Dynasty Warriors fans) and will familiarize the main characters of the story for you new people to the series. Step by step you will learn all of the optons at your disposal for uniting china later. As you complete each chapter, you will unlock a ton of extras, from portraits to use in Character creation mode, to legendary characters among other things...

Speaking of Character generation, once again you may create 150 male or female officers of your own design. Setting everything from portrait to weapon style to personallity. It even has an auto-create feature for those of you who want tons of new characters but dont want to spend 20 hrs making them....Although some of us do just that, because with every character, you breath a bit more life into an already complex world of loyalty and hatred, ambition and revenge. You can set parents, husbands, wives, and children up, as well as likely friends or sworn brothers and sisters right from the start. Make your own rivals or your own bloodline for a Dynasty of your creation. No two people ever own the same game, thats for sure. It will even generate names for your characters, for those who dont want weird names but would rather keep the immersion solid with Chinese names ( but there is nothing wrong with weird names either lol, its your world after all)....

The artwork is very themed towards Chinese culture of the first century AD, and is done beautifully, and now the portraits show the head in menus, but the whole body on character sheets, and the character portrait art has never been better. Almost all portraits are new, and not rehashed copys as 11 and 10 had....

The English transaltion seems very solid, as all the text and menus are easily understandable, although the voices themselves remain untranslated, but this works well with keeping the immersion going too!

Once you complete hero mode, the gloves come off, and you then set towards your rise to power, either as a ruler or an officer or a wandering nobody bent on claiming the imperial throne from nothing. You have your work cut out for you, but once you have a grasp of all the various game mechanics (and its deep) you'll rise to power through diplomacy, conquest, loyalty, or treachery.....

As you can tell, I REALLY love this title, and I wish I had come sooner but better late then never...So am I recommending this to you? Well, some of you, yes.

These are niche games. You will either love Three kingdoms titles or you will hate them. The names are the first barrier any fan of the series come too. Names like Cao Cao, or Xiahou Dun will seem foriegn, and hard to remember or relate to. But this passes within a few weeks of playing, this I promise.

Another thing you will need is patience, and a mind for slower paced strategy games. If you loved earlier 3 kingdoms games, youll love this one even more. If you loved civilization or 4X games like fallen enchantress, you will probably like this as well (although this isnt fantasy, the over-the-top heroes and villians kind of feels like a fantasy game lol).

Battles are real time with pause. Each character has skills that can be used on the battlefield. Castle seiges and land and naval battles are all here. And even though its real time-pause, I would have prefered they kept it turn based as it used to be. While real time is ok, some games work better with turn based, and these battles are the only thing that falls short in my opinion. Luckily, the rest of the game IS good enough to give this a pass. Its acceptable, but it could have been much better.

Duels and Debates are also back, in which 2 characters compete, using special commands in turn based fasion, only now you need only go 5 rounds, with whomever having the most health winning at the end of it. These are done in 3d, and look fantastic. Dynasty Warriors fans will love these (even though they are turn based) as they are very cinematic confrontations.

Koei has always know these games wont make them rich. They do these for the fans, not the profits. But to keep up with costs, they are ussually expensive titles. But thats ok. Because 3 kingdoms games are not your average cut-paste 4X strategy games. They are alive with around 1000 characters whom all have thier own personalities, strenghts, and weaknesses. Think Game of thrones story on steroids and youll get the idea haha! For what they pour into these games, they deserve what they ask for to us dedicated to the series. Thats the thing about serious strategy game fans though, We may be few, but we are devoted. These games are easy to jump into if you have previous RTK experiance, but for those who dont, skipping the tutorial is not wise
I'm glad Koei didnt give up on this, its flag ship series, and I am more then glad that they remembered us English speaking fans. My way of thanking them, is by telling you, who are pondering this title, the truth about what youll be getting into....A superior chapter in the 3 kingdoms series.  If your a former fan, or looking for an epic, menu driven strategy game will RPG elements such as leveling your characters, and conquering a country....Get this.

The graphics are great, it has all of the good stories that follows the book pretty well (until they get to your created kingdom, of course)  My only grip is with the Edit officers.  It would seem with the naming process, Koei went to ROTK 6 style of naming, i.e. making it rather restrictive.  There are chinese name longer than 6 characters, my friends.

Unfortunately, there have been many unjustified criticisms of the game. I hope prospective buyers will look past those reviews. There are people who complain about the graphics. But loyal fans never really cared much about flashy graphics, and in fact it's an advantage as it means the game runs quickly even on low-end hardware. 

There are those who complain about the price. But how many games in the world has around 700 playable characters - with individual unique portraits (and some characters have multiple portraits!), biographies and statistics that correlate to history and/or fiction ? Many RPGs have just generic characters (eg: Villager xyz)... Nobunaga's ambition may have more officers but they include generic characters / portraits. In RTK13, one can play as ruler, viceroy, minister, governor, plain officer or free officer ... a virtuous hero, a historical villain or someone who was historically insignificant ... And choose different types of characters - a great warrior/general, a brilliant strategist or just someone not great at all ! There's so much replayability.  

Then there are complaints about how RTK13 doesn't have XYZ feature from RTK (insert #). I think the system used in RTK13 is utterly fantastic and encourage new people to play more (see below). For example, some people are complaining they can only utilise resources of one city to attack - which is totally false. 

The main advantage of RTK13's system is that it doesn't suffer from ''big empire syndrome''. I absolutely like RTK11 and think it's a wonderful game. But RTK11 (and others) are often most fun when one controls between 1-10 cities. After that ... It's annoying to see delegated cities underperform, while also annoying to micro-manage every single one.

It is ''cool'' to perform ''stun-locks'' (eg: Spear rush, Cavalry stampede or Perturb with Focus) in (RTK11) to beat massive armies. Using 1 city to beat 10 (or 20 !) is indeed fun - but also means the game is typically ''won'''even when you have a build a relatively small empire. 

RTK13 is based on a hierachy. Normal officers have almost no power/influence and often do menial tasks. Minister (G) and even Governors also have relatively little influence. But once you play well (especially with a decent officer), you can eventually rise up to to Minister (R) or Viceroy ... and lead the empire to victory. Just before writing my review initially, I coordinated attacks using soldiers from over 10+ cities (250,000 soldiers or so), simultaneously in two different groups, to attack two different cities. My officer controlled once massive army group while AI controller the other (and timed it so they arrive around the same time).

Near the end of my game (while attacking the last other force remaining), my character (I started as a new officer in Ma Teng's army) controlled 172,000 soldiers (with Ma Chao, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun etc) directly in battle, while orderering another two massive armies, one led by Pang De (approx 150,000) and the other Gan Ning (approx 150,000 soldiers), plus other smaller armies (30-50k each) - for a crazy total of approx 600,000 against approx 450,000 - 500,000. 

For those who want all the micromanagement of cities and buildings, perhaps they should go back to the other RTK series (and suffer from ''Big empire syndrome''). For those who want a new fascinating experience - I strongly recommend trying out RTK13. Lastly, the main reason why I like the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games series isn't about the particular interface of a particular entry of the series - it's about playing the game to build one's own story within the historical framework and with the fascinating characters. And in this regard, RTK13 absolutely shines

COMBAT
The combat is more balanced as you can't transport your army and easily overpower the AI with sheer numbers. You can still reinforce and gather your army during the deployment stage but that will take time - fair enough. You don't draft soldiers anymore. They will be generated based on a modifier in the game. You can improve the modifier. The generals still makes a difference but not so great anymore as in ROTK11. I think KOEI can make the game more fun by adding back ROTK11's strategies and abilities, e.g. the spear stun, fire arrow and strategist abilities like perturb, blunder, misinform. KOEI should also give the player more control on wanting to duel or not. Some fools lost their lives dueling Lubu and I can do nothing with it.

MAIN CHARACTER
I chose Guan Yu as he is a very well balanced character with great WAR and decent INT and GOV and he belongs to the Shu :). Your first objective is to get enough deeds to be promoted to a 'viceroy'. There is where the real game starts. After you get promoted, you can appoint ministers to get up to 8+1 slots of improvement options, e.g. farming, commerce, training, fealty. Secondary objective is to make 'friends' with others with forte that you can improve, e.g. if once of your starting skills is 'endurance5', make friend with toons with endurance forte. That will improve your toon to 'endurance6'. Also, do make friends with the famous toons.

CITIES MANAGEMENT
You have 2 slots which you can freely control on what to do. 6+1 are rested by the hands of your 3 ministers. They will recommend and you can accept or decline. It's no longer based on action points. Simply put it, the player lacks control. The 2 slots is not enough if you have many cities but if you have that many cities, to manage each and every one of them is a tedious job. So far, 8+1 slots seem to do the job. Personally, I think KOEI should improve this because I want to enjoy the game and not leave the game to the AI.

OVERALL
The game is decent and it has good potential. Not as fun as ROTK11 but still good after the price drop. For example, once you get Ma Chao or Gan Ning, their charge ability is so god damn powerful. Group your forces together and charge at the enemies and you'll see insane number flying up the screen! I think they should put back some ROTK11 abilities into the game, e.g. stampede, confuse, blunder, fire arrows. They should also implement powerful combos, e.g. charge during stun would deal high damage. The power gauge should also be able to be charge up faster if certain criterias are met, e.g. exceptional morale, damage dealt or taken. That would add more fun to the game. REALISM isn't fun at all LOL!

First off its a solo game so no friends im afraid, and they still havent multiplayered three kingdoms, despite trying to make this kind of play in real time.
While you expect a solo game to have many layers, it doesnt have that. The bomding system is decent, but its very limited in how you can create bonds. Its pretty disappointing considering how good they could have made that part? Which seems to be a big mechanic in the game :-(
Battles are ok, but u have to control eachof your units which spoils immersion. ( even if your only a general)
They are also small scale. Its as though they have focused on massive portraits and duels...thats it, but even that isnt even as good as the simplistic but tactful duels in previous games.

Battles require little brain power now im afraid. Just throw loads of officers against them ull be fine.

What this game provides is a simple yet effective way to get into the role of being a warrior/leader/strategist in the Three Kingdoms era. The normal mode procided has been brilliantly modified and adapted to follow the storyline while you worry about your own force. It is simple to play yet is difficult to master, especially in large scale wars and abttles which i think provides an excellent learning curve. 

The addition of this hero mode is absolutely fantastic.

Almost all of Koei's games are either based on the three kingdoms era in China or the sengoku jidai period in Japan.  Now they have gotten off of this track before with games like Bladestorm, but they're a tiny minority in Koei's libray.  They really wouldn't even need to get out of Japan or China.

When a friend asked what it was like, I thought about it and summarized it as a weird mix of Crusader Kings 2, a Visual Novel, and a simplistic Total War. Alone, none of the pieces are anything big, but somehow the way they fit together has kept me interested.

The gameplay is great and classic of the series, with it's unique turn-based strategic game play and it's battle system.

As to why it has mixed reviews?

I don't know how I thought that messing with all the details and ""fiddley bits"" for 30 minutes just to take one city was fun.  I also don't know why it is still so much fun as an adult.

I went the X-Box route, and only recently got back into PC gaming, but as soon as I saw this come out in english, I nabbed it.  

This game is based on relationships.  It is much more in line with Crusader Kings than Europa Universalis, though it is not quite as complex as either. (quite)  Of course, when playing a game based on something like the Chinese equivalent of Arthurian legend, you should expect high intrigue and drama.  This delivers in spades.

The combat is well done, with a basic rock/paper/scissors mechanic at heart, then details like terrain and pincer attacks added in, and exceptions and modifications made depending on the officer's skills.  So in general, pikemen beat cavalry, cavalry beat archers, and archers beat pikemen, all things being equal, but get a 2000 man cavalry unit sandwiched by 2 1000 man archery units, and the cavalry is going down.  Then there are also 3 different strengths of the units based on how well developed their city of origin is... If you delve into it – which you have to at higher difficulties – it gets complex, yet it is still simple enough to be accessible.

The games tutorial is also easy to follow, and if the entire thing is played out, gives the player a solid base to start from, explaining all of the commands an features by placing the player in various scenarios and allowing guided experimentation.

To top it off, it's placed in a world where everything is dynamic and shifting.  Each of the NPCs are given personalities and they react to each other and the player based on their own values and ambitions.  Many of the fan favorites from Dynasty Warriors are here in all their glory, and it is also possible for the player to create his or her own entire clan of 150 unique officers.",1467993339,1467993339,True,6,1,0.537238895893096924,0,True,False,False

The main mode, where we can play as an officer climbing up to viceroy post, is interesting enough, as long as we focus on what the goal of the game is: unify the land. Many routes to choose, chosing right ruler, or change heart at later stage (when your ruler sucks yeah), or revolt? (you can raise flag by revolting against your ruler-to get high prosperity city), or claim vacant city.

Playing as hero: its the same as previous RTKs. Enjoyable at later stages like battle of Chibi and when 3 kingdoms already established.

KOEI steered in right direction to make up for 10 years absence .. however some improvements needed for this game (I believe this could be improved either by update or DLCs):

1. Bring back specific unit tactics for horse, spear, bow: 3 tactics for horse (charge & trample etc.), 3 tactics for bow (shower, fire etc.), 3 tactics for spear (?,?,?). Those were presents in RTK 3?11? They were essentials !!

2. More things to do in hero's capital city:
- Gambling,
- Set up trading of each area specialties, and to do trading to other areas,
- Build a hero's house from spoil of wars and gifts,
- Meditate at temple to gain whatever, recover troops faster etc.,
- Competition for treasures, titles, etc.,
- Quest to secure northern borders/the great wall, from the horde! where is the horde now??
- Prison visuals,
- Visuals for culture, market, barracks can be added and improved!
- Audience with your people! get more troops instantly, receive/give supplies and sometimes hidden treasures, hidden officers, hidden whatever (make it only once a year!),
- Improve the city: moat, fortifications, anti-siege defence, traps.

3. Armor, treasures, alcohol: improve the visuals and effects please! And make them appear in the duel/debate visuals as well. No more generic and budget designs!

4. Duel and debate: improve visuals and no more generic officers. Add 2-3 more scene variations will not hurt, and could always take different backgrounds and officer expressions. And get those armor/weapon stuff in place, no more generic officer drawing!

5. Capturing and execution of legendary officers: add more visuals and get the advisors to propose recruit, or release please! And dont make these officers disappear by cheap executions! (a little of defying history!).

6. Make a list of must-collect armors, horses, weapons, and add more quests to own them!

7. Let us appoint up to 3 main advisors. They add better immersion. Off course not better than Sima Yi and Zhuge Liang!

8. Bring back more children after marriage of officers. More female officers! THis version is already an improvement by enabling us to have 3 spouses. But what if to add jealousy if rapport is not good enough? What about adding concubine?

The war part is just a simplified version of 12 and you do not need to do anything to win a war. The only thing you can do is to use your ability once, then wait for the animation until you have enough points, needless to say the two dual mode. They're just same and boring.

If you duel a bandit or a soldier, it is always the same bandit and the soldier is always the same with the exception of the soldiers uniform color. I like that you can interact with the villagers too, but like nearly every aspect of the game, i would like to see it expanded upon to give more requests and perhaps grant skill or ability experience rather than only gold. I have not tried playing a ruler yet so i don't know what all that entails. Regarding battle, i do like the ability to disband and let the troops trickle back to the city. Battles do lack options, severly lacking tactics in my opinion. Overall i would probably give the game 6.5/10 for how it is currently. I may be biased because i LOVE the series but i think it is a fair rating for how the game currently stands. Western players are going to be pretty damn vocal about anything they consider a negative aspect of the game. The game itself has a LOT of promise, it is my hope that Koei adds more features to the game, it has the potential to be very good and setup a precedent for future releases to be GREAT!",1467839634,1467839634,True,7,0,0.545397162437438965,0,True,False,False

(Don't get me wrong, I love a good Dynasty Warriors game). This game is greatly focused on history and the actual depiction of the 3 Kingdoms story! Right from the start in Hero mode you will find that this game has much more to offer than action and violence (don't worry, there's plenty of that too!). In this game you experience the story of the Romance of the 3 Kingdoms through the eyes of any of the interesting and unique characters involved. In hero mode, you will begin seeing the story unfold via the experiences of individuals like Liu Bei, Cao Cao and Lu Bu. 

You will take part in every day activities like drinking and having discussions with friends. You will learn to negotiate and even engage in the art of debate! The debates are really thrilling and well done! As you progress you will learn about tactics and controlling large numbers of troops on massive battlefields. Strategy will be key to victory in these massive battles, and each of your groups of thousands of troops will be led by yourself and your most trusted generals! The unit troop number is scaled down (e.g. 4000 troops looks more like 50-100), but the tactics are there regardless of unit scaling. They even have an interesting feature that allows you to opt for the angle you wish your troops to attack from as you attack. Cities will rise and fall, but your legacy will be forever!

The options for civil interactions such as negotiation and discussions with friends are thoroughly extensive, and I have been nothing but impressed by this game so far. I have had but a taste, and I am craving much much more of this game already! I should note that I am a huge fan of games with diplomacy and other interactions aside from death and destruction, which is fine too. I would also like to note that the graphics overall are decent-good, the artwork is outstanding though! The graphics do become somewhat sub-par in certain close up instances like debates or negotiations, but they are tolerable in my opinion. Overall I am loving this game and I look forward to updating my review as I continue to enjoy it.

Can't spare a lot of time right now, but it needs to be known that all the terrible reviews aren't NECESSARILY founded. There are some mechanical differences that might take a little coming around to, but it's not nearly so bad as many claim, and there are practical reasons for each change that feel right after about an hour of play.

If you enjoy playing as an officer, this might be the best RoTK yet; at the very least, it stacks up to any other iteration of its type. The roleplaying element feels stronger than ever, with more meaningful speech and popups that make your city feel alive and interactive. Additionally, with each city having an objective for the year that coordinates with your kingdom's overall goals, you feel like you're contributing to a whole even while you sit on the lowest rungs. Your city has an objective to meet and big rewards to gain if it does, and your governor will require the help of every officer in the city to make it happen.

Another big plus for roleplaying is the relationship web, which makes accessing networks of contacts and companions easier and more visually accessible than ever. Relationships are deeper and more complex than simply a 1 to 100 number in RoTK13, and especially within your own city or region, you really get the feeling of being a colleague of the other officers around you. (Not to mention, when you work your way into your liege's inner circle, you feel a great sense of accomplishment!)

It feels amazing to go from a small talent few know about, to a peer within your city's complement of officers, to an indespensible hand for your governor, to a figure whispered in the court of your liege, to a minister for the liege himself. And that's not even the highest you can climb.

I've yet to find an aspect of the game I outright dislike, but above all, if you enjoy the roleplaying aspects of this franchise, RoTK 13 won't disappoint. As someone who enjoys that element myself, I highly reccommend this game.

(NOTE: Make sure you click the play button at the TOP of the launcher and not the bottom! That bottom one runs a complementary copy of one of the first RoTK games. Possibly the very first.)",1467761194,1467761194,True,107,1,0.793040156364440918,5,True,False,False

(Example: on initial release of the game there were no encounters when you travelled between cities; that is now in the game. Also, sovereigns will reward their subjects with items now rather than just rank and money.) I still do not understand Chinese or Japanese but I have taken some time to recognize and understand icons and menus enough to make the game playable, I only struggle to realize when an officer in the same force defects or when an alliance is formed. I will admit that makes the gameplay awkward and frustrating but that might be something we may not need to worry about much longer.

I am the lucky guy that don't seen to have programming issue or error or resolution problem with this game in my computer  . My computer is at least 5 years old.

About the RTK13

Well the campaign tutorial was very exciting game, you learn good amount of how to play the  game successfully, so I recommand go through the campaign tutorial first before you striaght into the normal campaign. And yes I completed the whole tutorial section.

Here is some help on Zhuge Liang campaign tutorial section:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QD05zXvBO8

If you go to play the normal campaign where you conquer everything, make sure you select the option on the start to slow down computer AI- players expansion (it is on one of the tab option on the start) , otherwise the AI just go crazy and keep attacking you. I personally like to expand slowly and found it hard to keep up with the friendship apart of the game going when you have 4-AI armys all attacking me at once.

Pro:
* Good campaign tutorial;

* Good graphic;

* Make sure you get the free officers extension as well, it is good idea to create your own super character to maintain you cities. This game will attack you very quickly if you don't have good officers and you don't have much ally.

* This game feel more like the ""NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION Sphere of Influence"" except it have less city to conquer which is good, because ""NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION Sphere of Influence"" is a bit too much, too many cities to conquer. I like Total War Shogun2 better than ""NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION Sphere of Influence"", just have too many cities.

* Good charaters voice, I like some of the girls voice, very sweet.

* Finally burning cao cao ship in chained ship battle;

Con:
* Why can't I move troop to other city? I mean I do hear many people complain about this as well, and I feel the same, it is simply unrealitic that you cannot move troop. Their is no reason for cannot move troop to you border cities, that is whatevery do in every strategy game. That makes the game suck!

* No ambush, cannot hide in battlefield;

* War-Horse-unit can climb ladders, LOL;

* Game can go very quickly, if you don't know what you are doing and don't plan, you can lose very easily, because everyone will start attacking you for no reason and you cannot fight every direction.

* Game programming error on officer duel weapon, it changes for no reason. Big error!

* No English version. Why can't Koei just make every games to have english as well, suck if you don't know chinese or japanese;

* Game go too quick, need to set up your alliance, otherwise everyone will attack you.

* This game will be too hard to play if you play as a crappy low status officer with little INT and POWER.

* Game over priced $90USD;

* Traditional tactic like ambush, unit position up the maintain to attack enemy on low position, and attak on enemy flank made not be in the game and instead just mainly depand on magic-speical-skill for each officer.

Conclusion:
Good game, but got some programming and techniques error need to be fix.
Need to know how to read chinese or japanese to understand game writing.",1455390266,1455390980,True,5,1,0.530595839023590088,9,True,False,False

I just deleted the game before writing this review. About a week ago, i thought the game developer were greedy and lazy with their game and thats why i was disappointed with the game. But now, i think the developers are retar-ded and the Game is broken. And here are the reasons:

1)This is a strategic rpg, but rpg has zero element in the game, everyone addresses u in the same way over and over. Whether they r your father, mother, siblings, spouse, or friend.......... they all address you the same way. And worse, its like they dont know you some times- For instance, Lu Bu will say something like ""I will cut you down"" while fighting with her daughter when they r on opposite sides?!! Why !?

2) RPG but you can only play as a ruler................ I'm Saying this becuz, watever role you chose from the begining (peasant, low rank officer, city ruler.), it all ends with you Ruling or Running the entire fuking kingdom once you ranked up.I ll explain, you start off as an officer doing some amazing work under your lord. But after 2 yrs you r garanteed to become a fuking General and there arent any options where you can reject it. Do you think being a general is cool? Fuk no, because your king will give you the privilege of running all his cities for him (well, all except one city which is the city hes is currently in). If he has 2 cities, you rule one of them but if u have 55, you rule 54 cities !!!!!! WT F would i want to play under king if i m doing his job? I might as well as just play a lord then....

3) Your AI Boss is retar-ded or the mechanic being a general under the AI King is retar-ded............ continuing from the prev point, after he has given you all his cities. he will never fight, rule or govern shi t. He became non existent in the game.  And this is where the mechanics are really fuked up ------------ > becuz as a general You CANT:
          
          a) you cant award/deward or promote/ demote people in your or the kings army. Meaning, if people that just got recruited but are not 100% loyal to you, they will just continue getting lower and lower loyalty point, becuz you cant award them or promote them to better ranks to gain their loyalty. And the fuking king will do nothing as mentioned before, he just watch his minions leave. In one game, I have half of my officers leaving my power andi cant do shi t.

          b) the King will hold onto the 4 cousel members till he dies and you cant have them change legion between you and the king.  from teh beginning of the game, the king will select 4 of the most elite members to be the cousel members and wen he gives you all the power to rule his kingdom, u were cut off from these elite members forever! Elite! 

          c) cant suggest a redistribution of land between u and your lord. and can only suggest taking officers from other legions but cant give some of your officers to other ranks??? the fuk, becuz some legions are in crucial locations that needs good officers and sometime you have all the good officers becuz you r the one doing all the conquering and capturing enemy officers. One time, wen my lord give me the control all his land , he chose to govern the city on the edge of the map and the closest to caocao with only 5 officers....... fuk this s hit,  i was like - please just take some of my officers to defend ! but nope, after numerous atttack from caocao, my lord was captured and executed.
 

On general note. The game is so fuking easy and warriors doesnt matter alot. Who ever has the most cities will win because its all abt the the number of soldiers you have. you can test this by doing some thing i did......... i created 35 maxed out officers of my own and put them in a city next to liu biao( a b itch that is s hit and considerably weak, and why do i only put them in one city? BECuz there isnt an option to let them govern more than one). and guess wat, they r wiped out in a years time and they didnt even expand becuz they were terrified of the b itch i just mentioned. 

The camera of the game is nuisiating.

you have zero time to do your own stuff and your own mission.

so many people is like ~ ah, the game is so fun , u can marry 3 cute chicks in the game.......... i m like ............. these people must just die if thats their standard of fun. Plus i dont see the point of marriage or brotherhood, they help in battlefield and in politics but everything else is the same as any other officers.

Seriously, I ve been a big fan of koei's work but i will not be one of COD fan boys who support shit products just becuz you r a fanboy. This game is lazy, simple and broken.

There are pros and cons in this game but the cons overwhelm the pros in many ways.

Pros
1.) The largest amount of official and cities in the entire franchise.
2.) The portrait  and the background pictures are more alive.
3.) The technology upgrades for the cities are good to have but most of them are so generic.
4.) The characteristic of the general is new in the franchise where different characteristic will give the kingdom a different benefit. For example, one of the characteristic raises the loyalty of the officers in the kingdom everytime the season changes.


Cons
1.) The ruler AI decision making of the game is bad. Imagine this, your country is surrounded by 3 different country instead of allying with the 1 of the country the ruler just make you march brainlessly to battle which give the opportunity for the other country to backstab you.
2.) Diplomatic mechanic in this series is overpowered. However, the diplomatic option is limited to the ruler or the ruler's strategist. Other than that, the option will only available once the player achieve a rank up on his/her position in the kingdom. 
3.)The AI during the battle is bad. The AI will always leave one unit in the main base and the unit will almost won't march out from the base. Unless, there are new reinforcement for the AI and the player main base is empty. You will see something like this: ALL YOUR units are surrounding their units nearby their main base and that extra unit will help alot in the fight but instead of advancing the unit the AI just make it standing in the base. You can even sometimes see the AI setting fire on their own units who is weak to fire attacks.
4.) Customise officer can't customise their 3D models and most of the officers in the game share the same model with each other despite of them being famous officers.

Lastly, I only recommand people to buy if you truly want to support the franchise. Otherwise, is best to avoid this release until it gets a discount or some patch that improves the AI of the game.

1) Food and Gold can be altered between cities. ie. an immediate transfer of gold and food can be done.
2) As you do not need to draft an army, you can become a military power if you occupy the cities in the early stage. The only issue is if you have enough generals to defend it.
3) You can have a long campaign, provided the cities you conquered have loads of food. By replenishing it every time you take the city, basically you can conquer the whole map (as long as you dont run out of soldiers.

UPDATES: Purchasing certain items will change the weapon type you are using. After playing for 3 hours and battling for countless times... I did not get any change on a duel with any generals. Wonder if there is any conditions to be met.

Kinda tough and messy when the map is left with rulers. Especially when u have a lot of land but not enough generals. Still have yet to complete it. The way my game progress kept me playing. 

=======================================================================

Very simplified.  Nothing much to do as a general besides fulfilling tasks given by ruler. If u do not select any task, u can only go shopping or visit other generals. 

 The war graphics are OK.  But when 2 troops collide, I only see sloppy animations. Rotk 11 animation is better. 

Chances of duel seems low. Only a few options. Just wondering why they only allow 5 rds of fighting. Items do not have special effect on the duel. Rotk 11 seemed better.

Auto replenish army. Simplified game. Too simplified.

Became a regional general. Ruler gave me all the cities to govern leaving one to manage on his own . I might as well take over his place.

On the dimension of fun, simplicity and the historic logics, this work is perhaps the most outstanding one in our decade. On the other hand, its aspect as a RPG game also has more to be explored (comparing to text reading & choosing in CK2). I didn't play the previous of the series, but repeating the same genre to the 13th samsara apparently bores a lot of people...
游戏乐趣、简单性和历史逻辑都相当不错，可能是这个时代我们能玩到的最好的作品了。另一方面，游戏还有RPG内容可供发掘（比P社的CK2那种，读完一篇文章作选择的，高到不知道哪里去了。）我没有玩过前作，但是重复玩同一历史内容的确是蛮蛋疼的=。=。我估计这是导致很多人不喜欢这款游戏的原因。。。

A typical gameplay lasts 10-20 hrs, and it only ends the way you rule the whole country as the supreme leader, the emporor. Taking a start as a subject courtier will make the whole procedure infinitely longer =w=
一盘游戏整个流程大概要10-20小时。通关方法只有一种，就是当上皇帝统一全国。如果从臣下开始，那么整个流程会无限延长长长长长

Agressing too fast would trigger AI countries to consolidate against you... Generally speaking, war against AI is not hard as long as player commands, but at this stage, you will have to outnumber AI troops to win, because the player is only allowed to command the war he/she is participating.
过快扩张会导致AI联盟反对你。一般情况下，手操打AI以少打多很容易。但是玩家不能指挥自己角色没有参加的战斗，所以这个阶段就靠运营、以多打少取胜了。

BTW, this game has started a war between cultural censorship and copyright law affairs in mainland China... Although negative comments are everywhere, piracy lovers have tried hard to access... And after being told cracked games are not available anymore, they chose, well, to evoke people to report Steam of selling games, which are not issued in China, to mainland Chinese Steam-ers. Not to speak of this awful fact, I think their attempt has shown everything.
顺便，由光荣公司和3dm撕比衍生出来正版用户和盗版用户的撕比……尽管好多地方都说这一作很坑，但是到处有人在求资源……本周3dm开始清理下载页面以后，2月5号部分盗版用户……开始发起众人举报Steam违法在中国大陆发售未经审批游戏……抛开成见不说，我认为此一现象已经是在用脚给这个游戏投票了。

Considering the negotiation between Steam and Alipay, a(/the) major web payment company in mainland China, has sloped to the abyss of non-speaking, it is maybe the time to farewell!

Still, I don't know why they are charging import prices over on steam, but some of the complaints about it being too much simply because it wasn't in English is simply unfounded.  I do hope though that Koei will ease up on the prices in the future because it's definitely getting them negative reviews. (Not to mention its a game that has a long history of being pirated, you don't want to scare away first time supporters)

2. 8 Slots (and Simplied gameplay) - One of the other main complaints is that now you have a limit to how many tasks that can be offered to officers.  With this game I feel like I am playing Nobunaga's Ambition SOI which was a lot of fun.  Nowadays the direction of these games seems to sway towards delegation rather than complete control to give it a more lively feel.  I actually don't have any complaints about that, sending people to watch over a city and have them grow it themselves is cool in it's own way.  Officers in this game will seek out their own tasks and will help each other as well.  Internal policies isn't very deep, but it's not terrible either.

3. Battle and AI - I'll admit the AI can be bad, but then again, every other strategy games I have played have had AI doing stupid things, that's just how it is.  As long as the AI is fun to play with and against it's not so very bad, this isn't a competitive game anyway.  So far I am not too disappointed yet.

4. RPG aspects - ROTK 13 marks the return of the RPG aspect that was missing in ROTK since 10.  Officer to officer interaction requires you to do something for them (So they enter thankful or grateful status) you will likely have to hang around in town and wait for them to do tasks and help them out or host parties and raise relations, only afterwards could you further increase relations and receiving training.  Alternative you could help them out in battles such as performing pincer attacks with them, listen to their advice in battle or defeating powerful generals in duels to awe them.

After a certain point (80 relations) an officer will offer you a sidequest for you to do to raise their friendship further,  This is where the language barrier will affect the most because there's a story to each of them.  For example: Zhang Liao wants to repay a friend's kindness but hadn't heard from him, Huang Yue Ying wants to save the starving people outside of our city, to Cao Cao wishing to obtain a special book but instead received something greater, a friend.  There are many and I haven't found a repeat yet, though the actual quest itself isn't like super convuluted and involved or anything, they were cute to watch like something you'd expect from a visual novel.

Other than that, stat increases outside of training with buddies is through daily tasks or on the battlefield.  I honestly don't know why people complain about the RPG aspect it actually isn't that bad.  It's not super involved like RTK 8 where you even raise children, but it's good as it is imo.

Well that's it for my review for the most part.  While I don't think that this game is a masterpiece or even worth the 90$ I feel that this game deserves some credit, it might detract from the norms of ROTK that we are all familiar with, but I feel that it's rather refreshing.  I do wish we get ROTK 11 style duels and debate though, nothing beats those yet.  I mean falling off a pillar to your death after losing an argument?

These people who couldn't review a game properly don't desert any attentions.

First of all, most people didn't play the tutorial because it is long and harsh. The first option and recommend was actually a tutorial than story. It teach you how to play the game from its own aspect.

Now, you start a campaign on your own.
YOU ARE THE MAIN  CHARACTER.  you are looking the whole game from your perspective. What this mean is that if you aren't any part of the battle/politic whatever, you don't have control of it.

Once you expand and go tinto the power, you play as normal last series. the game play is somewhat same as 10,11,12 except, you either take part of the work or your let your grunt suggest them and you approve it as a BOSS.

which seem fair right? since you are the boss and they are your servants. 

Now you can do things and take it into your own hand from recruiting, building relaationships, do quest, to combat or leave it to your loyal subjects. 

You don't recruit army like the other series but you have to work your way on a good reputation to earn the army which is hard when npc is about 3 times larger than yours.

The worse part is the combat taking a TOTAL WAR approach which is sad.  you aren't next to enemy, you can't attack and you can be stuck.

The castles are pretty useless as well.

Combat i would give it a 5/10 really....total war ??? please dont use total war build.

1) The big map system is just a white elephant. Even though it's big, it's 3D, it has hundreds of towns, but you can only travel by the pre-fixed roads. No way to build anything anywhere on the map. How does it differ from a simple 2D map as in San12?

2) The economic system is basically spayed. No matter how many towns/talents a player has, he/she can only assign 2 (or up to 8) to work....

3) It imposes many unreasonable restrictions, like no troop transportation between towns, automatic troop regeneration, no way to recruit people in towns not neighboring to you....

4) I knew San13 is trying to find a balance between RPG and RTS (or SIM), but unfortunately it fails on both ends... The RPG system is so boring and repetitive... NO fun at all!

I really wish I can have my money back!!!

And in terms of the gameplay, I don't think it deserves that many negative reviews. I think people just assumed that it will be similar to 10. However if you played the series all along, you'll find that each generation has their characteristics. And do remember that this is not the PK version. So it definitely will feel ""incomplete"". I'm still exploring the new features but there are already many things that interests me: 

1. There are way way more stronghold points around cities compared to previous games, and they actually play a big way when you are trying to capture a city. 
2. The new army system is actually quite realistic. You can no longer support a 100,000 army in a city with a 20,000 population. And it actually will make the late game less boring, since you no longer need to build your army supply chain and send them to the frontline.

In terms of city development, as other reviews said, there is not much you can do. There are no facilities in city anymore, you just have a few clicks to choose and the city will develop (and you don't even spot the different or people working..). You have no places to visit, and no tasks or events to encounter. You can't even relocate soldiers or generals. Feels like any mobile game would be more sophisticated than it.

In terms of combat system, it's a nice try to go RTS but the AI is dump. You have to micro-manage every unit in a battle or they will not fight the enermy just besides them. Each unit has it own speical ability to use on the expense of skill points, but every unit share the same skill points thus usually only a unit can use the special ability.

So in short, if this game is a webpage or mobile game for free, I would say you can try. But if it is a game charging players for that amount of money, I would not recommend anyone to buy it.

After a few hours' exploration, the impression is that the game is not even completed, although the system has great potential to be improved in the future. Compared to NB's ambition:Souzou released one year ago, the game lacks details
in many perspective, including the rendering of  maps, the battlefield and the interative between people. The battle system is also a simplified version of ROTTK 12, in which very few strategies can be applied.

I still expect the next release of the game and hope that in the coming PK version, KOEI can give us a complete experience with this new engine.

I Getting started. 
1.Yes, the $90 is retarded by western standard. However, just letting y'all know KOEI has been setting its Japanese version PC releases of all their three kingdoms and Nobunaga series at 10,800yen since 1992 (check exchange rate yourself), so this ain't exactly new. 
2. Okay, srsly ppl. READ THE DESCRIPTION......ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOT SUPPORTED.....
what does it mean? well, it's one of KOEI's simul-release, which meant english localization will have to wait, just like the previous nobunaga games. Usually within a year.
3.Currently this game does not have a in-game option to change system interface from Japanese to Chinese and vice versa, the language displayed is based on what version of windows you're running.  Which means if you ain't running one of those two languaged OS, u will not see the uni-code specific chat log displayed correctly, and it can be really annoying, or to the point of unplayable.
4. Obviously, you probably want to be profecient in one of those two language supported in order to play this game, otherwise you really got to have better way to blowoff 90 bucks, i mean srsly.
5. So if you have all of the above sorted out you shouldn't have problem running and playing the game.

II.Game Review
Okay, I'm one of those KOEI OBs which have played virtually all KOEI games since its debut in the mid 1980s, and naturally I've also played all three kingdom games so I'll be reviewing this game based on how it compare to its predecessors. So keep this in mind. It is a classic JP-Grand Strategy Game, abit different and bulkier than the western counterparts made by companies such as paradox or Firaxis. 

Selling Point1. All character play, you get to choose any character instead of just faction leaders, the typical mix of RPG into SLG format. Again, not new, the all character play was first introduced in Romance of Three Kingdoms 7 and again later in the  much improved Romance of Three Kingdom 10. However, they have greatly enhanced inter-character relation with the so called human drama, which is a style of overall character relation map. aha, I see you're learning at last KOEI, someone definetly have played crusader king series, and yes, it's pretty freaking good.

Selling Point2.Massive scale in wars. For a Three Kingdom fan such as myself, Caocao's million strong army has always been under represented in games due to system limitations in the past, not this time. For once, instead of the 5 figure soldier count battles, you get 6 figures, and might even be 7 figure in late game in the biggest military engagement in KOEI game history, and is totally well implemented with a half-real time strategy setting, so for once, it's not boring to engage in countless battles yourself instead of waiting for crappy auto-reslove. Once had 250k engaging another 140k, the immersion factor was awsome,and just when  im about to win, I suddenly realised oops, out of provision......again.....time to reload, totally worth it. 

Bottomline
For once, I felt KOEI didn't just took 90bucks away from me outright. 10/10
