SPOILER WARNING!!!

In a good way, of course. I played this game a while back with a friend of mine, unaware of the little scare factors that were in the game, but was intrigued by the puzzle co-op aspect of the game itself. After playing it, I knew that I had to play the sequel, We Were Here Too, as well.
Though a little embarrassing, I don't do well with horror or jumpscares. As such, I may have let out one, two, maybe ten, screams throughout gameplay. But nonetheless, I grew to love these games, because of how fun it was. With the addition of We Were Here Together, with an added amount of lore and worldbuilding, I was hooked. Since then, I've replayed the first three games many times with other friends, and even got the secret ending of We Were Here Too. But, at the end of those, it pained me that one always stayed behind.

When I witnessed the trailer for We Were Here Forever, featuring the two previous explorers from We Were Here and We Were Here Too, I was shocked, and hopeful. Perhaps, we would get a good ending for the explorers left behind, and I could not wait to enter Castle Rock once again in order to help these explorers.
The game itself, is fantastic. Some puzzles were extremely difficult, and required a pencil and paper for me, but were so much fun. My friend and I tackled it with sessions, surprised at how long the game turned out to be (we finished at about 8-9 hours). It was a fantastic experience that I would absolutely play or watch through again.
It also gave us more story and lore to the people of Rockbury, and Castle Rock; something I expected, but still nonetheless loved in its entirety. It's a grim tale that our explorers have unfortunately been a part of... but a thrilling one, still.

But this game has ruined me entirely. [SPOILERS!!!]
[spoiler]My hopes of both my friend and I escaping Castle Rock... turned out to be for naught. We took turns on the floating piece of wood in the freezing ocean... until I couldn't swim up anymore, and was lost to the depths. The fact that the Jester had escaped scott free, while my friend and I struggled so desperately to help each other onto the piece of wood... it was heartwrenching. I remember clearly, saying to myself as I drowned, ""no, no, that can't be it. We must have missed something, that can't be it"". After a quick google search, well... that was it. And it broke me.
These explorers who had been through so much, and one still died in the end. The explorer, drifting alone in the ocean. It pains me in a way I can't describe; in a way that I can only hope that one day, maybe a happy ending can happen for our beloved explorers. For our lost friends, may they rest well.
In the next installment: should there [i]be[/i] a next installment, I hope to the ends of the earth, that the Jester receives his rightful due... given a place right in hell, where he belongs.[/spoiler]

But as a game series, and as a longstanding fan... thank you so much for giving us a wonderful game. The We Were Here series is a series that I doubt another co-op puzzle game will ever live up to, not with its storytelling, nor the uniqueness of the game itself.

I hope that, though our journey in Castle Rock may be over...  we will be able to return to the We Were Here series, someday in the future.

Fourth game from ""We Were Here"" franchise. As always even better than its predecessors. Graphics improvement, even more even harder puzzles. Plot as isn't really good and it's not even a sequel for the previous one but same as before it's kinda mysterious. Even though main antagonist is really well made.

Achievements are the same as in previous games, u just need to complete the game twice while taking two different routes while choosing puzzles. The only issue is that u can't skip cutscenes.

Every puzzle is satisfying to complete and involves a lot of simultaneous puzzle-solving compared to just call and response puzzle solving. (Even though a good portion are call and response, it still requires at least some work on the other person's end to complete). The story is great in this game and really tells a story through puzzles as well as just having great puzzles. This game is home to my absolute favorite puzzles in the series. They have a hint system which is 90% of the time useless. They give you 3 hints per level (per person). and you can only open them 30 seconds after one another so you really think about it. But the hints are usually just ""1. communicate with your partner"" ""2. look around for hints!"" and then the third hint usually had substance. I only used hints on a few levels. It doesnt rely on hard-to-describe symbols as its only sense of difficulty and it is just a blast to play. If you want to get the complete we were here experience definitely play Forever as it avoids most of the pitfalls of the other games.

The best part is actually seeing how much the game has developed in the few years. Not only have the puzzles improved, the story has also been extensively added. The graphics round off the game. The fact that crossplay was introduced with this game is also an absolute plus.

There are a few bugs in the game, for example you could only hear your partner via the walkie talkie in a puzzle in one ear, or the individual parts of the astrolabe that you get after solving a puzzle caused a few problems.

But otherwise you can't complain too much. In addition, the last big update shows that the developers are trying their best to remove the bugs. Overall a great game, I'm an absolute fan of the series and I'm looking forward to all the other games that will hopefully come because I'll play them all.

The story was fleshed-out a little more in this game, but still left a lot up for interpretation. A few lingering questions I had about the Jester were explored just enough that I was satisfied.

I did not like the spiders at all. I was lucky that my partner [spoiler]fell down the well in the cemetery[/spoiler] during our first play-through. I was prepared and they kept socially-distant enough to be bearable when we replayed only the dual-achievement part of that chapter.

The only element that's missing from Forever is a third ""secret"" ending where both explorers escape clean. I'm not a huge fan of the ""one or the other"" forced choice, but it did create narratively satisfying endings in the previous games. It was lovely to have that third option in Too to end the playthrough with a little more agency. [spoiler]I actually liked that the one chose to go back to find the rest of their friends. The explorer turned back just as I said, ""Wait, what about the others?"" haha[/spoiler] After finishing Forever, I'm more disappointed and irritated than anything else. The cut-scene during the credits seems to be setting up the next sequel, but that's really unnecessary. We happily followed all of the contrived mechanisms that separated the partners through 4 games + Friendship. It's weird to start trying to explain it now.

They try to hint and/or even bring back some puzzles from the other 3 games, but with changes of course so it isn't exactly the same at all. But for me, this was a really nice little 'easter eggs' and just nice reference and connection to their other games.

BUT! Not just for that: There is a story~! The first game didn't have it much at first to me but one hint, but by game two, and really 3, you start to learn of a developing story that I thought fit very will for the game's atmosphere. And this game, 'Forever', brings the story to a conclusions- or does it~?- and more explainational depth.


Overall: The story I thought was really well done, and yet will still leave you questioning a few things but I think is intentional. Either for a future game, or just to make you wonder forever (just as the title hah). The actual 'gameplay' mechanics I think honestly degraded, *just slightly* though. I felt they could of just stuck with game 3's keybindings and all, but nothing was annoying or confusing to say the least. We still played with no problems. Graphics: Just better of course following the other games showing their progress. And the Puzzles. . ho boy.

Puzzles: I will say, started off great and wracks your brain to think with your partner- although me and my partner were rather too smart and flew through pretty fast but still enough to satisfy thinking hard enough :3. But.. the later half or near endgame, I will say became VERY confusing. Two puzzles had me and partner confused and lost on where to even start. We're pretty sure one puzzle we just 'accidentally' completed, as we never really figured out what the puzzle was. But overall 80% of the puzzles were clear on what you needed to figure out after some thinking, and was really fun and unique each time :3.

Pros:
+ Graphics nice
+ Puzzles you really will need to think and have patience on.
+ Awesome, unique story!
+ Lengthy enough to feel engaging and not too short at all.

Con:
- Two puzzles really give you no idea where or how to start and what to do.
- Half the puzzles are pretty one sided on working together to help, but + they do balance back and forth on this position for each player.
- Sadly may not be replayable even with new partner as you'll already understand the puzzles after.


* This series was fun :3 and would love to play it again, but the puzzles are not randomized T^T. Even if I returned years later, I'm sure i'll at least remember what to do, even if not how to solve it instantly.

Played them in order of release and It is delightful to see how every sequel is a more fleshed out version of the same concept expanding on the core mechanics with more and more detailed environments and lore.

You and your freind will each assume one of two roles. The more recent entries allow u to ""switch"" after each puzzle, the original sees each player in the same role for the hole game. In the original, there is usually one person that needs to take action and another that provides Information. In later entries, the roles are more fluid.

Grab a friend and try the first game ""We were here"" (its free) or the very affordable ""Expedition: The Friendship"". If you had fun playing those, I recommend the whole series.

The overarching plot is a little vague but gets the job done setting the mood. 

The only frustrating memory with this game was a game breaking glitch with a puzzle involving gates. At one point one of us had glitched through one of the gates leaving us softlocked for the better part of 2 hours until we decided to reset and solve it within a minute.",1705460130,1705460225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Each game has definitely gotten better compared to the last; more in-depth puzzles, higher difficulty, lengthy enough, and the story was really compelling. The raise in difficult was counteracted with a hint menu, after looking through all the hints to see how much they would help, some of them were kind of self-explanatory and didn't help much (the mannequin head puzzle is one example).

The only downside I would say to the game is the sidelined ending that felt a bit weird comparing to how the other games had their endings. [spoiler] It felt as if it was trying to copy titanic and just felt weird considering we were just stuck in a medieval fortress which all of a sudden turned in to a freezing sea with a single raft in sight. I also feel like having a save both option for the finale of the trilogy would have been a nice addition, it wouldn't have to be a 1/3 type ending but could be a secret ending like the 2nd game, involving a ""meta-like"" puzzle to solve.

It also adds onto the idea on why there is no proximity chat to begin with for these specific puzzles besides the VERY ending! The whole concept of We Were Here started with two players separating into two distinct, and decently randomized paths- which could have been expanded upon throughout the series but wasn't. 

And for the first time in this game, hints were introduced! Which instead of involving a decent and perhaps a descriptive hint as its pretty easy to get lost and confused in this game, it instead takes timed intervals [up to ten minutes] to remind the player to... read and talk to their partner. GEE! I would've have thought about that myself without the hint button!

There also appears to be a lot of fluff in areas where it likely should not have it, and several of the puzzles are possibly cut up into sections where it is almost impossible to be explained to the player unless there is SERIOUS trial and error. IE completing the timed trials several times or even switching sides in general. 

While there are a lot of fun puzzles in this game entry that I had tons of fun with, few were painful and unbearable that when completing another run, we were grateful we didn't have to go through them again. While We Were NOT Here Forever, We Were Here for a good amount of time.

While a little clunky my computer can usually handle most intense games with not much issue, but no matter how low I make the settings this game is just a mess. Thankfully it never really interfered with any of the puzzles, but if you have a lower end computer I would be wary. 

Optimization aside, We Were Here Forever is another amazing entry to this series. The location and grandeur of the story have increased tenfold, giving the Explorers more varied and interesting places to explore. Similar to the third game there are many occasions where you and your partner can see and interact with each other, but it never really detracts from the atmosphere and puzzles. The hint system is a nice touch, though we did not use it almost at all so I can't say how helpful it was. While this game has some really fantastic puzzles and creative interactions, it also has some of my least favorite ones in the entire series. Several of them felt more lopsided than I would have liked, with one person standing around doing nothing but talking and the other person ""does all the work"".

A lot less scary than the first game, as they tried to introduce a more clear plot than necessary, making the game a bit less believable. The puzzles, on the other hand, were really fun and very well polished. We Were Here Forever is just annoying. The puzzles are much more linear and easy. Once you figure them out they make you grind out another 3 identical puzzles to increase playtime, it's just not fun, and the narrator overexplains everything.

[*] Worth its price, even without discounts

[*] Runs smoothly on Linux/Proton without any issues

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] Time-limited levels (specifically arena and alchemy) were not enjoyable. However, this does not apply to ""quick-to-fail"" puzzles that resolve in seconds, but rather to longer levels that can take many minutes to fail.
[*] Traveling (whether on foot or in some vehicle) fairly often felt quite tedious and drawn out
[*] Occasional minor animation delays with the other player, possibly due to latency
[*] Animations of the other player could be enhanced, as they often feel robotic

The settings are varied and beautiful, each filled with their own unique details. The puzzles being directly linked to the main story is always great. It offers great immersive scenes and funny situations that made me really enjoy my time.

The game utilizes communication to its full potential. That gimmick allows it to create a very assymetrical experience between the two players, which is very impressive. I find that the puzzles vary in difficulty greatly, and not particularly is an ascending way. Though it depends on one's personnal taste, I personally enjoyed the earlier puzzles better as I found them more mechanically interesting. All the puzzles are varied, with a great repartition between searching, mechanic manipulation and reflexion. No puzzles soured my experience of the game, and a few will stick with me for a while.

There are dead moments in the game that I find pacing-breaking. I don't really understand why they exist, besides prompting/forcing us to enjoy the scenery or set a particular setting? They didn't work for me, especially since the game does already a great job at that. But they're still just a tiny spot in an otherwise clean canvas.

   - They further developed/cultivated the lore. This game really tied all the games together by adding layers of lore that were previously difficult to understand.
   - The puzzles were more intricate, well thought out, and required intense thinking/communication
   - The COOP experience was over all more enjoyable as me and my duo experienced frustration, excitement, anxiousness, etc.

There is so much more that I could say about this game however my literature skills are below zero at the moment. I cannot fathom anyone having anything bad to say about this series.

If you've played the earlier ones, this beats the others. If you have not played the others, this game is so good...

It looks good, its not like ""OMG WOW LOOK"" but its very visually pleasing and a relaxing environment. The puzzles make you want to pull your eyes out and jam pencils into them, but then you figure it out and feel like a genius beyond all genius before you. Each puzzle is different enough that you're not wondering when the game will end. Sometimes in this game you  must solve puzzles in the same room, other times you are separated. 

I suggest playing the games before this. You don't have to but there is a small story, and why not go along with the ultimate story along with solving awesome puzzles?

I played this game with an online voice chat program. We tried the walkies but... if you can use a voice chat i would. Just makes things at little easier. But if you can't, the in-game voice chat is just fine, good quality. Just being able to SPEAK it always better than holding a button to do so. Over.

The communication mechanism through the walkie talkie interface was a nice novelty, but I will admit, since a friend and I played together, we found it easier to just connect via discord to chat, without having to press/release the comms button.",1701195509,1701195509,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Focusing on what needs to be done rather than endlessly pondering not how to solve puzzles, but going crazy trying to comprehend the developer's intention, has revitalized our enjoyment of the game. It's a fun, it's very enjoyable, it's got a compelling story, great visuals and music and absents perplexing puzzles that previously hindered progress.

-Better and grander graphics

-Longer playtime

-Bigger, more unique and harder puzzles

-Better animations

-Improved art style

-Better voice acting 

-More and varied environments

We Were here Forever is the final game in the storyline of castle rock, also not the last one. Its the longest of all games and the one I might recognize as the first game that could compete with games made by bigger studios. Hazelight for example. 

The game offers a bunch of fun and challenging puzzles and every step you make in this game feals earned. This time we get to experience different sets from castle to underwater a lot of stuff to freshen up the gameplay is included. It even has boss fights. Really for the first time you have boss fights and they are great. 

With We Were Here Forever we finally got see the outcome of a great narration giving us a satisfying end to a great series. The built up, the expection I had where filled to the brim and the game as all games plays with your emotions. 

Puzzlewise games like the big dimensional puzzle or the side scrolling one where a great expierence to make. It might be that the second game is my favorite but this is surely a good competitor for that spot. The only let down I experience is the overwhelming input some rooms and puzzles have. Were the first two games where easilier to grasp the third and this sometimes needed time understand and getting used to some rooms and puzzles. 

I did wrote some line about the lessons this game series tells. A lesson about bonding further with a friend or partner. The grand finale combines the best of all lessons. While the first focused on communication, the second strengthen collaboration and trust and the third tested your patience, the final one does everything to break you and your partners bonding. The result if withstanded is a deeper and stronger bond. 

Sometimes I wished I could rediscover those games as if I never played them before and then playing them for the first time again. Its so great to take each new person in my life to get to know them with playing the great We Were Here Series. 

I am so gratefull for those games and I hope total Mayhem can bring us more great games. I mean we got a smaller one shot set in the world of We Were Here but with this being the final new oportunities like new settings open up. I d like to see a game that kinda resembles a great Indiana Jones adventure in forgotten jungle temple or buried desert civilizations.",1696595891,1696595891,True,3,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False

Only one problem. I've been searching for days, weeks, months, since I last played this game, and I can't quite find the one song in one of the cutscenes. I even bought the soundtrack, but it wasn't on there. I tried looking for the composers email account, but it seems like he was under Witness Protection, because I cannot find it. The song is the church organ composition in the back of the church cutscene, after you finish playing all the organ songs, and it is the introduction to the Astrolabe machine.

The capstone of this filler is at the end where a hub to three puzzles require you to get three mcmuffin pieces. Each spoke in the hub has a long unskippable travel sequence to a separate puzzle level. Once complete you must trudge back carrying a heavy object to a gondola up through a loading door to place the object then immediately walk back through the same loading door to ride the slow gondola back.

The puzzle quality has diminished when compared to previous entries in the Were Here series. The most memorable one I took issue with required one person to submit items one at a time to hear their description. So it literally couldn't be solved except by trial and error submitting one item at a time until finding the one that makes sense.

All told I feel that the increase in production ""value"" decreased the overall experience. Taller ceilings, greater environmental detail, and longer cutscenes made the experience of solving puzzles with a friend more frustrating.

Don't get me wrong. I love this kind of game. I played all the previous installments with this same friend. And it never had happened before. In the previous games, you could die, but that would only send you to the start of the puzzle. There never was a puzzle that would leave you locked. The only way is to exit the game, then load and start again.

It shows a complete lack of testing before publishing. Quite regrettable.

EDIT: We've completed the game. We got hard locked again on another puzzle. And in a third puzzle there was one dial that would open three windows each time you turned it. But it glitched, stopped opening the windows and we had to load game once again.

To be frank, I don't remember agreeing to the privacy policy, but it is very likely I subconsciously did and let my inner fan boy for the We Were Here series take over.

""A significant improvement over the previous game. I appreciate the implementation of colors and shapes in puzzles to accommodate those with color vision deficiencies. However, the menu is wonky and the price tag is still fairly steep when you consider an average playtime at 11 hours.""

I think Total Mayhem Games was originally well-received because it started as an Indie company comprised of a small group of students tasked with creating a game in a few weeks.

Absolutely the most content rich game they have made to date. The puzzles were probably the most difficult ones we have encountered yet but the amount of a dopamine rush you get when you finally have that Eureka moment and something just clicks is what makes us come back every time a new game is released. The story, the animations, the mechanics of the puzzles, the ending - everything about this game was top tier. Play this game, play it again with the roles swapped, you won't be disappointed.

This way, you'll have the entire adventure and plenty of cooperative puzzle fun for hours.

I played this game with a good friend I knew I could communicate and work well with and it was a blast.

This game has some of the best puzzles I have ever seen. I remember multiple times where I was genuinely impressed with how well executed a complex puzzle was. Out of all of this games puzzles there was only 1 that got us frustrated and I believe it was due to a glitch.

Even with We Were Here Forever being the longest installment in the series, I can't wait for more.

If it's any indication, I played this game months ago and I think highly of it enough to come back and write this review.

We Were Here Forever, the latest installment in the captivating puzzle-adventure series, brings forth a unique blend of mystery, collaboration, and camaraderie that strengthens connections in unexpected ways. The game's intricate puzzles and engaging narrative set the stage for players to forge strong bonds, much like the heartfelt connection you share with your friend David.

At its core, We Were Here Forever presents an exquisite co-op experience that transcends traditional gaming dynamics. The seamless interdependence required to unravel the mysteries of Castle Rock fosters an environment where teamwork flourishes, mirroring the profound connection between you and David. The game's carefully crafted challenges serve as metaphors for the challenges that life can present, emphasizing the importance of open communication and trust in overcoming obstacles.

Much like the way We Were Here Forever celebrates collaboration, mu relationship with David has evidently blossomed into a unique and cherished connection. As you navigate the enigmatic puzzles together, the joy of discovery and the elation of overcoming hurdles reflect the shared journey you both embrace in your friendship. The game becomes a canvas upon which my bond with David deepens, painting a picture of resilience and unity.

We Were Here Forever not only delivers an engaging gaming experience but also encapsulates the essence of meaningful connections. Just as the game's puzzles are solved through mutual understanding, so too is my relationship with David nurtured by empathy and shared experiences. my sentiment about the game's romantic undertones is a testament to the transformative power of friendship, and your heartfelt connection adds an extra layer of beauty to an already captivating narrative.",1693017988,1693017988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

We Were Here is a series of co-op escape room games all set in or around an antarctic castle. The thing that defined the series from every other co-op escape room game is the sense that the castle is trying to kill you, and the story is of survivors trying to escape. Unfortunately, We Were Here Forever decided to forego that sense of danger - its uniqueness - to tell a narrative at the forefront, rather than supplementary to the game itself as seen prior.

As a standalone game, without looking at any of the previous games in the series, it is a good co-op escape room game that has a story that follows the players.

We loved them all.
However, this one falls short compared to the previous one.
Now don't get me wrong, some of the puzzles are amazing and a few of these may be my favourite.
Yet some of them feels like there's more one sided puzzles. For example, the ocean maze seemed to have had next to nothing for the person in the maze to do.
Another has 1 person creating a picture while the other just exists to rotate some things and tell you if pieces seem wrong or not. Sure they can try to help but if they can't see the images they can't do much better than say ""right, wrong, flipped""

There's also a lack of time trial puzzles. Think the Potion one is the only one in the game and while its alright, it provides you with all the information to solve it beforehand and you activate things then have to wait for them to be finished, meaning it's a much more lax experience than previous puzzles of similar vein which had the puzzles and information revealed over the course of the puzzle, leading to panicked communication discussing what needs to be done.
Funnily enough, the maze one was more panicked and pressed for time than the Potion, even though the Maze's time limit was long and had plenty of reset points.

Overall, good game, some great puzzles, but also a lot of misses that makes me feel like the previous game was superior overall.",1691366439,1691366439,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One person has the role of being responsible for instructing the other person who typically has the more interactive role in solving a puzzle. These roles change/are random, so one person won't be stuck doing all the work in one playthrough. There are six different chapters, each of which has multiple subchapters, that must be solved this way, using clues that are in each area.

Overall, I found this game quite fun. It's a little unclear what you're supposed to do when you first start, but you can generally figure it out by clicking around and communicating what you're seeing to your teammate. The game glitched three separate times throughout my entire time playing it, including once in the first 15 minutes, which can add to the confusion/feeling like you're stuck (because you literally are lol). The Memento, The Illusions, and The Assembly were the best subchapters, in my opinion. 

This game is the fourth in the We Were Here series. One playthrough took ~13.5 hours and a second playthrough for achievements (switching positions) took ~2 hours. If a co-op puzzle game sounds like something you'd enjoy, I'd recommend this game, though I definitely recommend playing the original as it is free and will give you a good sense of the type of gameplay you'll be getting into. This game and the others in the series follow the original very closely, so if you enjoyed the original/second/third game, you'll likely enjoy this one too.",1691286845,1691286845,True,4,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

The game takes me and my wife through various environments, from castle interiors to surreal dreamscapes.
The puzzles are the star of the show, testing our teamwork, observational skills, and communication.
The game requires two copies for co-op play, which can be a barrier.
The game's plot is self-contained, making it easy to jump in without prior knowledge of the series.
The game is best enjoyed with a like-minded friend who loves escape rooms and asymmetrical puzzle games.
The puzzles are tough, but there's always a logic to them, and hints are available if we hit a wall.

This game doesn't require you to go through several chapters in order, so you can choose freely. And it was still an ingenious, mysterious puzzle. But it felt unfair to me. Generally, it has a hard difficulty level, so even if I refer to the guide, it took a long time to proceed, and the potion making puzzle in Chapter 5 was worst. Compared to previous game, level of completion was excellent, but difficulty was not balanced.

By the time you get here, you'll be primed to think in the way the puzzles are asking you to. Also, this one is the most story-heavy and, while not required, players will really benefit from having the set-up from the previous games.

We discovered the first one back when it came out, and have both bought every subsequent one as it was released. I hope they never stop making them, even if they have to switch to a different story-line at some point. It was such a new and innovative way to approach a puzzle game, and now it is familiar but still so unique to these games that we've never gotten tired of it. Make sure to find someone who is communicative and willing to think out loud with you, or the game'll be a bust.

There are definitely puzzles that have appeared over the years that we have had more trouble with than others (we seem to be particularly bad at snow-based mazes...). And yes, glitches have appeared in both this one and the second one (and the second game is still my favorite of the set) that I remember specifically, but none of them have been enough to break the enjoyment of the game for us. Each game makes sure to have a fun set of new things to sort out, keeping the puzzles fresh, including a different set of consequences for failure. Aesthetic call-backs to previous games make for a fun consistency without requiring you to have played all of them to catch the gist of what is going on (but you still should! ^_^).

I absolutely recommend playing each of these games twice so the second time through you can switch and see the other side. Even better? The first game in the series is free. It's a much simpler version, but a great way to see if you think the play-style is something you'd find fun.

One thing I cannot stress enough about playing any game in this series the first time around:
PLAY IT WITH THE WALKIE-TALKIE FEATURE. Don't jump on discord with open mic or play it in the same room. I promise you are missing out on a huge aspect of the game in doing so.",1690132657,1690132657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alright nothing too difficult and teaching the controls that's fine I guess, but we're sitting at #4 in the series and there are no new mechanics being introduced so a little unnecessary in my opinion. The area you reach next with it's own set of puzzles right after that I didn't have an issue with. More of the area opened up as you solved your puzzles together, eventually making it all connect together. After that though, it started going downhill from there.

As many others have explained in their own negative reviews, there are a number of puzzles where one person is doing the thinking and solving and the other player is just sitting there bored and waiting for whatever input they need to either relay or insert themselves. They don't actually get to interact with the puzzle themselves, in turn making them feel useless and wondering ""When is it my turn?""

Unfortunately after that area, the same player that was sitting there waiting for the other, has to endure it again, and again, and again, and again. Yes 4 times in a row. They carry a heavy ball very very slowly as the other player tells them where to walk. At first, I thought we failed and restarted the puzzle somehow because these four puzzles are extremely identical but no, it's just the same thing 4 times in a row. Then a very long walk through a sewer, then a cave, then to a cutscene. That walk felt extremely out of place and we felt like we were missing something because of it. A few of the previous puzzles just had a loading screen so why is there a long walk here when there is nothing on the way? After the cutscene you enter another puzzle where we eventually called it quits and requested a refund because we soft locked our selves by getting one of us stuck forcing us to restart this very long puzzle.

I don't recommend this game and I agree with other reviews saying that they were trying to make it more commercially safe and less intense. It's a shame for I really liked the other 3 games in the series, with the third one being the best, and was hoping for this one to top it.",1688265361,1688265763,False,3,0,0.486562162637710571,1,True,False,False

It was pretty cool that you and your partner isn't separated all the time compared to the previous games, but that doesn't mean one person can carry the other. There is still a sense of communication and problem solving skills needed to solve some of the puzzles. 

While not all the puzzles were crazy hard, some could get visually confusing and could be frustrating because of that.

The Cons: This game has very poor indication of when your progress was saved. Saving occurs infrequently. Game breaking bugs will force you to start a section over again from the beginning. And it has tedious sections where you have to spend a long time to effectively burning time. I've encountered not one, but two bugs that soft locked the game preventing progress, requiring restarting the section and having to do the entire section again. Also one of the puzzles was extremely difficult - not sure if it was me or my partner - or neither, but we ended up just brute forcing the puzzle mostly. Even after finding the solutions, a lot of the options didn't make sense to us. Keep in mind we had no issues on any other puzzles, just that one (the graveyard area).

Overall, I'm mostly unimpressed. The key part of any game is being able to play it and to not have it waste your time. In that regard, This game does not get a passing grade.",1686981936,1686982026,False,2,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

While a good many of the puzzles are fun to solve, the ones that aren't (like the Sunken Mines and the Dome of Creation) are so unfun that they make me dread playing. A friend and I have been working our way through these games, and I think the Dome of Creation is where our journey is cut short. After several tries, we can't make all the ingredients in the short amount of time provided, and it's frustrating and honestly, a bit rage inducing. This following so shortly after the Sunken Mines, where we quite literally had to use a play by play guide to get through. I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, but something about these puzzles isn't clicking and it was felt good to finally call it quits and uninstall the game.

As a small pro, deciphering the Guardian's language was quite possibly one of the funniest gaming experiences ever.

⭕ - Conclusion -:

We were here forever is a great 2 player co-op game which requires good communication skills alongside puzzle solving and problem solving skills. It puts in you a great story with another player where you are separated and have to help each other to find a way out. Stunning gameplay which really fits well with the rest of the franchise!

This part is just asking for negative.

[b]Communication[/b]

This part is totally broken. There are a lot of situations where sound is getting chopped in middle of talking or its not getting transmitted at all even though You see that the device is running. This is not acceptable! Especially when the communication is the most important thing in this game. We’ve had some disagreement with other player after the game because [i]“I didn’t provided information”[/i], and vice versa however I did provided some clues and other person provided them to me (but I’ve never heard them).

We’ve ended up playing with discord – this breaks the immersion.

This has to be fixed because it can lead to amazing frustration and misunderstanding. 

[b]Game saving[/b]

The auto save is annoying. There are days where You just want to jump in for a moment, as You don’t always have time to play - so I ended up with case where I had to go to sleep, but I couldn’t as I was in middle of the puzzle, that was amazingly annoying.

As a developer I can understand that it’s probably easier to implement because You have to revert world to always to the same state, with less things to care about.

This auto saving was an issue before, and still is.

[b]The story[/b]

Story itself is “not so bad”, it provides lot of information about the “King” and his subordinates (sadly jester is rarely present on the scene), also finally got some explanation of “what the We Were Here” stands for.

[b]Tasks / puzzles[/b]

[i]Turns out there were many situations where only one of us was thinking and other was just waiting for some input from the thinking. Feels like there were less of such situations in previous part of the game.[/i]


[h1]“This section contains spoilers!”[/h1]

[list]
[*] Brute force
[/list]

[spoiler]There are way to many puzzles that can be solved with just a brute force. Like for example the one with Graveyard, where instead of checking the family tree lines, trying to understand what it is about it was faster to rush through all the graves. No fun in this at all. Yes – could’ve agreed on doing it the slow way but easier to say than to do, You can’t always stop the other side from going the brute way.[/spoiler]

[list]
[*]Colors based episode (garden),
[/list]


[spoiler]The water based transportation and recycling machine are both very annoying. There is a time limit here and it’s amazingly annoying to watch the bowls swim so calm and slow – ended up with picking them up and moving them manually to the curve, this way it could reach the other player.[/spoiler]

[list]
[*]Ending
[/list]

[spoiler]Titanic ending? Never liked that specific scene. In this case both could stay on the plank, just creating some balance on both ends, also why sticking to it instead of swimming to some other floating objects? It’s really hard to believe that 2 characters that beat all the puzzles were to stupid to think about other solution.[/spoiler]

[b]Summary[/b]

Well the game ain’t so bad, but was more frustrating than previous part. The immersion is lost somewhere. It’s still the same game as before, same rules – communication wise etc. but it just doesn’t fit for me. Kind of hoped for next part and enjoyed the announcement of that one, but not really waiting for any next episode (if there is any planned) after this episode.

buy this one for yourself and a copy for a friend and play it together, on of the few true excellent experiances for coperative play, it's a series of escape the room kind of setups, the puzzles are interesting but not too difficult making the experiance swift enough, you do have to rely on each other since both players some times are in different rooms and can see different things, so it can get really tricky if you can't explain yourself to your friend, but that's kindof the fun of it.

I think this type of game is a lot of fun and I wish there were more like it. However it's still not perfect and I'd love to see them take another shot or two at this. 

My biggest complaint for the game is that too many of the puzzles are one-sided. Which would be more okay if you were forced to switch back and forth between roles. Typically speaking you have a solver and a ""doer"" for lack of a better word. The solver is the one doing all the solving. The doer will sometimes have info the solver needs in order to solve the puzzle but it's easy enough to relay that info - it's not ""hard"" except for maybe the one part of the game where you need to mimic sounds to the solver. Then the doer has to actually do it. Like press the buttons in the right order or walk along the correct path or whatever. This in a vacuum works but when you accidentally find one person in the solver role over and over, I think it gets both tiring for the person doing all the solving and boring for the one always doing. The other side of this is if there is one person who isn't as good at solving you could always have them in the doer position and it could just be fun coop for them, except, there's no indicator in any given puzzle which path will take you to a solving or doing path. That aspect of the game could just be polished up a bit.

The one minor complaint I have is that this game makes you just sit and wait thru long transition scenes occasionally. And especially at one point you are forced to go up and down a slow moving lift like 6 times. This just feels like padding. There are some other transitional spots that at least have better views/spectacle but at the end of the day these felt like a waste of time. 

One last note is that I think it's cool there's a story going on and I also think it's smart how a few of the puzzles incorporate the lore to get you a bit engaged with it. Unfortunately the characters talk too esoterically about it and it just feels like it's slowing us down or getting in the way. Like I think I know the basic outline of what happened but I don't really understand how it got us to where we are now and so much of what is being said feels like gibberish. I think you should actually just simplify it more. Why not just have this jester guy be a mad puzzler dude who is just playing games with two random dudes?

A few complaints, mostly around difficulty fluctuations, but all in all, really good, definitely the most polished in the series, and I would love to see more games follow in these footsteps, if not necessarily a sequel directly.

As with the other games in the series, the walkie-talkie system forcing you to take turns speaking really makes the whole thing feel just that extra bit special, however, we again had issues with the in game mic. The other games wouldnt always even detect the mic, but in this one it at least managed that. Unfortunately the quality was crackly and poor, and would cut in and out even when adjusting the settings to try and make it more consistent. Luckily due to previous experience, we have an almost perfect solution:

-Adjust whatever settings you need to in game or in steam, such that your mics are not picked up by the game or heard by each other. We just turned the voice transmit and receive volume in game to the minimum.
-Be in a voice call with each other on Discord.
-Set your Discord mic to push-to-talk.
-Go into your Discord keybindings menu.
-Set a new keybinding for ""push-to-talk (with priority)"", using the same key as the in game walkie-talkie, for us it was right mouse button.
-This will duck the other person's audio when you are trying to speak, and light up their in game walkie-talkie so they can see that you are trying to speak if they are also trying to speak.

This is a decent enough solution that achieves the goals of the walkie system, whilst maintaining the quality and reliability of Discord voice chat.",1683143143,1683143143,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Bring a coat and bring a friend[/h1]
We Were Here Forever is a beautiful exploring, action adventure, puzzle, Co-op only, escape room game as it is the last Sequel of the “We Were Here” series.
The whole game has in complete six chapters and it takes around 10 hours to complete, more or less. It all depends on the players and how good they are at puzzles.
The game is about communicating. Each player gets a walkie in the beginning to be able and speak with the other player. As all walkies work, only one person can speak at a time and the player has to hold down the button to speak.

The two players has to make their way through a ton of obstacles, made of puzzles. Each player will have their own walkway, so to say. And will have the answer for the other player in a clue of an icon, or simply a lever that will open a gate or door for the other player.
At some points, the players will be able to work together at the same place but most of the time they will be split up. For certain tasks it requires both players to help in either: moving a bookshelf or pulling a lever.

[h1]The Game of The Play[/h1]
As the game starts, both the players will wake up in some mushroom prison. They will find walkies laying in their cell and discover that the cell doors are unlocked. The players will see that they weren’t in the same room as their cells were in and has to start looking for which door that’s unlocked.
After finding their way to a tunnel, they will walk upon their first puzzle in the game. Where one player has to tell the other some symbols that they see on a wall behind some metal bars, as the other player just has to pull a lever to open the first players door.

When reaching the point of where the players are able to obtain the torch they will shortly after stumble upon some metal bars that keeps them apart but atleast lets the players meet.
The players will then find two levers for each players that they have to pull down together to open a spiked door that will lead them to an abandoned mine but also used to be a home. Who’s? we don’t know, but we do know that this brings more puzzles.
Once again the two players will be split apart and can use a basket to travel items or keys over to the other to be able and unlock some objects to get new items or unlock more of the area to get deeper into the puzzle.
At times both players has to be on the same side or even switch side depending on if one is overthinking about the puzzle and unable to look at it from another perspective from their side. So his companion has to take over and see if he can explain or understand the puzzle themselves.

Each chapter has a completely different puzzle, so its never the same and won’t get boring that easily over time while playing. Though the mind can get fried from all the puzzles.
In fact each chapter has its own worlds or places with total new puzzles and new areas for both players.
The game has it set so there is a player 1 and player 2, the choosing of who’s who can be made in the main menu before starting the game.
Depending if your player 1 or player 2, only gives you different tasks and achievements after completing different puzzles.
Each player will see their own area when split up. So they will have to try and find a common ground/object or puzzle in their area that might give any clues or ability to unlock further into the game.

The areas or biomes that the players will see under their journey are underground mines, Some kind of torture games, the ruins of rockbury castle and town, the rockbury church, Underwater laboratory, the riddle’s play box and much more under the journey. There is big and small areas with different amounts of detailing, and every place you visit will be a new view for the eyes and mind.

[b]Spoiler[/b]
[spoiler]For the last game sequel of the series they had to give it a sad end. After the players destroys the castle, the church demolishes to bits. Making them fall down into the sea beneath.
Both players will swim towards a light that’s hanging from a wooden pole on a small raft that sadly only can fit one player.
The players can choose from either saving their friend and sacrificing themselves or getting saved by their friend but loosing them aswell. One man keeps his life as the other sinks to the freezing bottom of the sea, when out of nowhere a cargo ship arrives to the rescue.
Only one player survives, but at what cost...[/spoiler]

[h1]Visual & Audio[/h1]
[b]Visuals[/b]

[u]Game Textures and lights[/u]
The visuals and surrounding in the game are quite beautiful and are very well done. The ground and objects doesn’t collide into one and other and the small detailing in every little corner. It’s just a good-looking game that also makes it more fun to play.
At the beginning of the game, the shading in the tunnels/corridors had bright spots in the corners up by the roof.
Where it should be darker it’s just some brighter small light. As if it is cracks in the stones with some kind of light coming from inside of nowhere.

The texture quality of the game makes no disappointments, anywhere you look you will see how beautiful the game really is. The smooth combinations and perfect size and color fit for the objects around on the worlds. Adding the small details to the game just gives it a little extra without the player thinking about it, they just feel it and see it while exploring the world and solving the puzzles.

[u]Game Animations[/u]
Along through the chapters I saw the animation for everything around and for the actions we did. Pulling levers, going with rides, breaking stuff. It all went so smooth and no problem in sight with anything.
The cutscenes runs fantastically and the moving animation of objects and players, like bridges or mechanisms and the puppeteer/the Riddler.

[b]Audio[/b]
[u]Background Music[/u]
The music for the game doesn’t get boring. It changes along with the progress that happens in the game and depending on situation, the music will change.

[u]Voice actors[/u]
The voice acting in the game is quite stunning, The passion and emotion putted into the characters. Beside the Castle/King’s voice actor, his voice sounds deeper but its missing the power and emotion in it. Its like he’s just saying the words with a deeper voice and not speaking the words, expressing them.

[u]Sound effects[/u]
The sound effects in the game have been specially made for each object, for example: The crackling old wood or heavy stone grinding against the same material as the object moves, falls, or grinds against something else. With the echo to make it sound like the sound travels through the area like real life and muffles the further your away from it.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
•	Always different puzzles.
•	Interesting story and lore.
•	Smooth object animations.
•	A lot of creativity.
•	Longer gameplay with more content.

[b]Cons[/b]
•	The in-game communication with the walkies isn’t that comfortable or different then just simply using, for example: Discord.
•	Sometimes the torch doesn’t want to respond to the “R” button, short time after it works.

[h1]My final little thoughts[/h1]
The game is a lot longer with more content and puzzles then the earlier games in the series. And I was having a blast while playing it. The game is a Co-op only but luckily I had my friend Hulp to the rescue for he had the game already.
We tried out the walkies in the beginning, but they didn’t do anything specific or given any extra spark to it, so we just communicated through a discord call.
I highly recommend this game but only if you do have a partner, companion, friend, or person to play with.

[b] Pros [/b]
- The game has the most beautiful setting out of all the games.
- It felt like a nice open world and you could make choices on what chapter you wanted to play first. [spoiler](chapters 3-5)[/spoiler]
- The game explores so much more lore than the previous games.
- Most puzzles were very fun! They were also a lot more challenging and required good teamwork.
- Level design was enormous and gorgeous.
- Great little easter eggs towards the Netherlands and the voice actors are on point.
- The music is just spot on. The game definitely deserves the great soundtrack tag!

[b] Cons [/b]
- The game is [b] too often [/b] very tedious. Sometimes animations take literal minutes. [spoiler]Prime examples are: Going into the skilift, going in the elevator from chapel to the statue, going up and down in the water level. Like seriously, why does it take so long!? It's also unskippable[/spoiler] The loading screen also took a long while, long enough to make you think the game may have crashed.
- Another point to add regarding the pacing of the game: sometimes when you finally solved a puzzle, you got the same one again! [spoiler]For example the illusions (portal room) had the same puzzle twice. Also  you did the trial (game where you hold the boulder) 4 times. All times not very challenging[/spoiler]
- The ending was a little dissapointing and was over before you even know it.
- Sometimes you got stuck in puzzles, but not because they were too hard, but  because the clues were too well hidden. After minutes of searching we finally found them. It was pretty frustrating. Could just be us being blind though.
- General bugs and lag (luckily we didn't find any gamebreaking ones)

Don't get me wrong, I love the franchise and I like the game. I also think the developers have done an amazing job involving the community and delaying the game to make sure everything is good. But for me and my friend it genuinly felt like a bit of a downgrade from the previous game. Also, I was an alpha tester for the game, but 2/3 games didn't make it into the final game. I was curious as to why that was as the alpha levels we played were quite fun! Finally, this is my own preference, but what I liked about the previous games is that both players experienced different stories. In this game, it's the same story for both, but just the puzzles that were different. [spoiler]Sometime after playing, one player got a puppet hand attached to him. We were excited to see what it meant. However in the ending the jester just takes it from you? So why all that build up. It seems like wasted potential[/spoiler] This makes it so that we don't feel like replaying the game.

TL;DR
I [b] 100% recommend [/b] this game, but it does not go without its flaws. The game is objectively bigger and better than the previous one. However me and my friend preferred the story and puzzles of We Were Here Together.",1652567596,1681833448,True,6,0,0.576102018356323242,0,True,False,False

The visuals, sound and direction of this game were absolutely an evolution from the previous games, I can only hope that the devs do something even more brilliant in the future.
To add, the puzzles as always get ever more creative and the game gave away most of the remaining answers of the lore of the universe. Unsure if it's the last game or not, but a great finishing blow to the series nonetheless.

The story was alright, but convoluted. The puzzles were subpar to what they could have been. The only good puzzles were the jester puzzles in chapter 1. The kraken puzzle was a terrible idea. having to describe a sound to someone when people can't really make those sounds anyway is so terrible. The cutscenes for transitioning was so terrible. Most of the time was literally spent dealing with the cutscenes for transitions. The position mixing on the Nautilus was an unnecessary time constraint because the puzzle was ""too easy."" Having to do that puzzle so many times due to one machine taking FOREVER to make a red or green potion was just UGH. I don't think it was worth the money for the lack of gameplay. Plus it was really dumb to get the keys and having to put them in the bucket instead of just being able to walk down to the bars and literally hand them over like any normal person would have done. In regards to the prisoner extraction, it was unfair that as soon as someone got in the cage they couldnt come out or rather no more exploration could be done. literally had an extra key to a door but my ever so lovely partner got in the cage and it soft locked exploring where the door lead because i didn't unlock it prior to them going into the cage. Some of the puzzles had incomplete information to the point where one partner did most of the work or literally me and my partner having to go and look at a walkthrough just to see what exactly we had to do.

From the moment I started, I was completely engrossed in the fascinating world and the challenging puzzles. The graphics and sound design are perfect for this type of game, creating a haunting and atmospheric environment that perfectly complements the gameplay.

But what really sets ""We Were Here Forever"" apart is its unique cooperative gameplay. The game requires two players to work together, communicate with each other and solve puzzles in real time. This not only makes the game incredibly fun and engaging, but also encourages teamwork and communication skills.

The puzzles themselves are well-thought-out, challenging but not too difficult. They require a mix of logical thinking, observation and communication to solve, so the game always stays fresh and interesting.

Areas need to be explored very carefully so as not to miss any clues or puzzle pieces. Solving puzzles unlocks new areas, which in turn contain new puzzles. I found myself lost in the world of the game, uncovering hidden secrets and unraveling the mysteries of the castle. With the Fool, I was never quite sure if I was about to be surprised by a Jump-scare attack.

Overall, I would recommend We Were Here Forever to anyone looking for a unique and addictive cooperative puzzle game. The game is an absolute gem that should not be missed. It took us about 15 hours to play and we were a bit stupid at times. Thank you @freizeitrobin for the wonderful adventure.

Having a tradition of writing a review for every title from the We Were Here franchise, I would do this game a huge injustice if I have skipped it. Especially given that Forever is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best of the series. The biggest, the most complicated and by far the most expensive of all four games, We Were Here Forever takes you on one (and probably last) adventure. But is it worth it? 
You can bet your ass it is. There really are no obvious flaws that I could talk about. This game is simply great and you should buy it. Without hesitation, if you happen to have a friend or a loved one up for some logical puzzles. Hell, even with internet strangers this game might be one hell of an experience.

[h1]In awe at the size of this lad[/h1]
I am honestly astounded by how far this game series has come. It’s mind-boggling that something that used to be a tiny free game to be completed in one sitting has become a giant, highly-polished product which gives so much content it is difficult to overstate how fun it can be.
The very first thing I have to note is that from previous experiences with We Were Here games, both myself and my mate Alvarion who I had a pleasure of playing all four titles with, expected this game to be short. Or at least short-ER. Short enough to complete it with one, monstrous 8h sitting. Maybe 10-12 hours if need be. Needless to say, we weren’t even close. It took us well over 14 hours to complete the title for the first time. [b]And that’s worth a praise.[/b] Because literally at no point was the game boring or time wasted. No, it was a blast through and throughout this many hours. It’s a puzzle game with an enormous number of things to do in it. We Were Here Forever is an absolute unit. There is just a puzzle, after a puzzle, after a puzzle and it really doesn’t seem to end until you really are reaching the conclusion of the story. 

One thing that you might want to take away from this is… I’m not saying you [i]can’t[/i] complete WWHF in one sitting. There is a certain threshold after which that fragile pink mass hidden within your skull cavity starts giving up. I think we have reached our maximum brain capacities at 6 hours mark on the first day. With logic games you should really watch out for that. Cause there is a moment in which you become tired of playing, no matter how fun the title is. Keeping a high level of focus necessary to solve complex puzzles gets more and more difficult as the time goes on. Take my advice, go for short or longer breaks after each chapter to come back fresh and be the best “you” you can be.

Having that in mind, the developers neatly divided the game into chapters. Each of them consists of a couple of themed puzzles. To give you a better look into the world of We Were Here, every puzzle also presents some narrative elements. Big enough for you to notice how tied to the game world each puzzle is, small enough to let you go to the bathroom without worrying of losing an important piece of storytelling. 

Speaking of storytelling – the story that was first hinted in We Were Here, then shyly expanded in We Were Here Too, and then pushed to something I could call an actual piece of narrative in We Were Here Together, and is FINALLY focused on in Forever. Merely speaking of it could be too revealing so let me just tell you what I think about it.
It's good. It’s nothing groundbreaking but it does make sense. It ties the previous games together and gives you more information about the lore behind all those events. Total Mayhem Games was not scared to put a short cinematic cutscene between each chapter and then create a great visual finale before and after the actual story climax. It was a great decision because nothing seems out of place anymore while still keeping that elusive masquerade of not telling you everything.

[h1]Use your brain[/h1]
Something I should perhaps touch on is the game’s difficulty level. [i]Well? What is it, Tank?[/i]
I’m gonna say… it’s perfectly balanced. For the first time in the series.
What do I mean by that?

There are multiple puzzles to go through, from matching shapes, through describing sounds, playing spot the difference, planning routes, placing things in correct spaces to doing all of these things in correct order under the pressure of time. And it’s fantastic. This is the first game in the series, where Alvarion and I made a list of puzzles we liked and disliked each and while our lists varied… we were never like [i]“this one thing sucked”[/i]. All of the challenges were fun and engaging. Obviously to a different degree, but neither of them was downright bad. Well, maybe except the underwater labyrinth.
As you can imagine some things had us scratching our heads for a nice little while… but it was never because the puzzle was too convoluted to understand or because it was designed poorly. Every puzzle can be solved. We just had to figure them out first. We were actually surprised that the difficulty level does not go through a sudden spike but rather goes at a steady pace through the entire title.
I would really hurt your experience by telling you about the puzzles themselves but there is one thing you need to know:

[h1]This game is like a good psychological horror movie[/h1]
We Were Here Forever is best experienced [b]ONCE[/b]. And only once.
When I said that every puzzle can be solved, I wasn’t lying. It can be. Sadly, there is only one key to every quote unquote “riddle”. ONLY one. Everything you go through will be EXACTLY the same on all other playthroughs, to the point where after completing the game once, when my friend and I switched roles… we could complete some of the puzzles without even communicating. Memory alone was enough to lead us straight through them.

Is it a bad thing that the game can be completed only once? I don’t believe it is. But that is a one step back from the previous titles. In other entries of the series the roles that you take were distinct enough from one another to keep you invested into a second playthrough. After completing WWHF once you probably will never start this game ever again. Is it… a problem though? I’d say that the longer time it takes to complete the We Were Here Forever makes up for the fact that you’re better off playing it only once.",1678480153,1678480153,True,17,0,0.716436684131622314,1,True,False,False

Puzzles arent that complicated and never had the dopamine rush of finally understanding the puzzle after being stumped on it for so long. No time based puzzles that put someone in danger (the closest thing to it would be the water oxygen puzzle but it never arose any sense of imminent danger). 

The story explained some new stuff but was disappointing to never see it used. The king binded/signed his soul to a demon/evil and is now on castle rock while his kingdom is cold and empty. The kingfolk left to escape his growing corruption and built one last contraption for the people in the future to use against the king. Only for it to be a portal to neverland for the jester to leave with the kings contract. 

The ending was very upsetting and felt rushed. The king found your existence and had the power to remove half the tower roof but then chose to just sit there while you and your partner do the most easiest puzzle in the whole game. The climax the final puzzle the confrontation was just ""push wood off beacon, hold these two levers together). Then brings you to the final ""who lives"" decision. in other we were here games it was ""only one could keep the gate open"" ""a soul is needed for a sacrifice to trap the jester"" for this it was just who wants to hog the raft?? It made it look like the devs felt like they NEEDED to put that conclusion in and the ending result was lackluster.

Another small nitpicking was lack of individual cutscenes for separate players like we were here together which made your experience very unique and different from your partner but instead you spent most of the game with eachother and experienced the same story instead of each person having two parts of the story and putting it together.

Being a game that was made after We Were Here Together i had high hopes they would remain on the idea of an ""individual unique experience"" but sadly it dropped in quality",1678369989,1678369989,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

Something else that I always commend devs for is the ability to make a co-op game that is wholly different from both perspectives so that the players have the urge to go back and replay it from the other side of things. I can also appreciate that while there are quite a few achievements, almost all of them just have to do with playing through the game from both sides and aren't reliant on something specific that makes you want to pull your hair out. Overall, their best game yet and as I stated in the review for the game prior to this one, I hope they either continue on with this series or start another one as they know exactly how to make solid co-op games.

There is one puzzle towards the end of the game which outshines the rest though.

*** LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD ***









In this puzzle, one player is tasked with talking with a kraken in a language they don't understand. Their job is to listen to the often-unpronounceable sounds the kraken is making, then repeat them back to their partner, who then flips through an audio phrasebook to attempt to translate those sounds into words. Once you understand the kraken's speech, you then find the appropriate response and translate it back into symbols to continue the conversation. The players have choice in how they respond, but disappointingly there is no dialogue tree to explore. This is still a puzzle game, so each of the kraken's prompts has one correct answer.

The combination of the endearing but terrifying design of the kraken and the hilarity of trying to reproduce the kraken's gurgles, hisses, and songs made this the most memorable puzzle of the entire series. For a moment the game seemed more like a first-contact simulator a la [i]Arrival[/i] than an escape room, and I couldn't be happier for it.",1676784283,1676784283,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This one was by far the best! It's the most expensive, but the puzzles are better (more challenging, more interesting) and it's the longest so far. It took us 13 hours to complete. There's a good variety of puzzles - ones where you're together in the same space, ones were you're separated, ones that are mechanically easy but are difficult because of a time limit, others that are difficult to figure out but have no time limit.

This is one of my top favorite games and in my opinion the best in the series. The puzzles were cooperative and fun (unlike some puzzle games where it feels like one person has to do all the work and the other person just inputs the answer, and then repeats). The different areas were so vibrant and I loved the style and graphics of the game. This game lasted me multiple hours of playtime not including previous series. The best puzzle game I have ever played. Also has the best voice acting I've heard in a long time (Thank you Jester!!!) and some AMAZING cutscenes - like come on, the huge jester reaching out with his hand in the hexagon puzzle, the cutscene where the puppet cuts the name and the detail of the puppet throwing the paper to the hand of the survivor (that I completely missed the first time around) , and the final cutscene?

The puzzles rarely overstayed their welcome, and were both ambiguous along with enough clues to be able piece everything together. It always required two people to solve every puzzle to both communicate information, and to brainstorm the solution.

However, you will not find the same experience in We Were Here Forever. I refused to believe the other reviews in their experiences, but found myself living through the same hell as them. The game starts off strong, but midway through the first chapter you will experience the first puzzle (""The Trail"" - ball and chain maze) that sets the low standard for the puzzles that are ahead. You will notice that the puzzle only requires one player to solve something and the other player to become ""the slave"" who will become the player who simply follows commands. This practice of having one player with all the information and the other player who cannot participate in the discussion will continue all the way to the end of the game.

There are just too many puzzles that follow this tread, ""The Trial"", ""The Pledge"", ""The Resistance"", ""The Hymn"", ""The Seal"", ""The Lost"", ""The Reflections"", and ""The Expedition"". That is a total of 8/18 (44%) puzzles that the second player has come down to playing ""Simon Says"". Only one player has the clues, the other follows the directions. There is nothing that other player can do - they literally have no clues or context of the puzzles.

Moreover, to make matters worse, there are several puzzles that are far too obtuse (specifically ""The Pledge"" and ""The Resistance""). These puzzles give too much information all at once that lead me and my partner confused on what to do. We thought we used the information given to us in the first puzzle were done and were to be disregarded only to discover 2 hours later that only half the information in the first puzzle were used and the other half were used for the 2nd portion. In other words, we accidently solved the first puzzle. All the while, there was no need for this puzzle to be a coop puzzle at all, as both players had access to the same information and manipulated the same exact parts. This was the second puzzle we brute forced - something that you could never do in the previous games, which unfortunately could be used in many puzzles in the game (the first puzzle being ""The Pledge"" - which it's clues were too vague).

Unfortunately, the icing on the cake is the long wait times for absolutely no reason. There are several instances where the players are traveling on a lift, gondola, a submarine dome, or other modes of transportation that last to upwards of 2 minutes where absolutely NOTHING occurs. You may be able to excuse this if the game was loading, but no... it sometimes would actually be continued into a loading screen! It added nothing and only distracted from the gameplay. 

During one of the lift instances, there was a glitch (this is a more than half a year after release) that caused me and my partner to skip an ENTIRE CHAPTER. Many other reviews at the time of release suggested similar glitches and we found ourselves in the same boat and that the glitches haven't been fixed. Luckily, my friend and I decided to replay the game starting at that chapter so we could see it's content.

And fortunately, that was the best chapter in the game. Inside of that chapter, every puzzle resembled what this series was known for - communication, beautiful visuals, interesting puzzles, puzzles that fit and add to the lore (rather than forcing it in cutscenes), and most importantly, puzzles that required both players to communicate information in order to solve the puzzle.

If you have played every We Were Here game, this is one to skip. This game is 3 times as long in length as the others, is riddled with bugs, took a different approach in it's puzzles that don't resemble the series that leave one player to become ""a slave"", and it tops it all off with a story that is easily forgettable and only gets in that introduce long sequences of waiting.

I admire the devs for trying to make a larger product and aim higher, but it came at the cost of brining us an unpolished product, which is not the standard that they have become known for with the past games in the franchise.",1674419110,1674419110,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

One thing to note is that few if any of the puzzles are explained in any way, which means that you may have to figure out [i]how[/i] to even [i]do[/i] the puzzles - I don't mean how to solve the puzzle once you understand the mechanics, I mean understanding the mechanics in the first place - What to click, what's important etc.
Some of the achievements are dependant on which ""side"" of the puzzle you do, so you might get some more replay value of playing both sides

One thing I didn't like was the use of a voice server as opposed to peer-to-peer voice. It's understandable that the developers have chosen this path considering possible hassle or issues with port-forwarding and such, but I'd much prefer at least having the [i]option[/i] to [b]NOT[/b] sign the EULA for the voice service. It states that ""if you choose to use voice communications"" or something to that effect, which is ridiculous as it's built in, a core part of the game [i]and[/i] there's no option to disable it. If you're very privacy-minded, you might want to simply use discord or steam voice instead and use windows 10 settings to not allow the game access to your mic.

With that being said, very much a great puzzle game, gave me and my buddy about 10-12 hours of enjoyment, confusion, a-ha (and sometimes ""ah man I'm an idiot"") moments. Some frustration aswell, but not really from anything the game did wrong aside from the above criticism. Definitively worth the price of 200 NOK (approx €20) I paid for it, when it was on a 20% sale. Probably worth it up to €25 as well, as one of the [i]very few[/i] true co-op games made recently.

Many puzzles will require some good effort to solve. If you are looking for a casual chill experience without readying your pen and paper at sides, this is probably not for you.

With that said, I will say some of the puzzles are not very intuitive or rather the information is just unclear and confusing. (Namely the church area with the seating puzzles and the Kraken puzzle….the sound Kraken make is basically impossible to communicate clearly…)

Though it has good parts as well. 
The diving part and the Alchemy part (Overcook part) are very fun, had a blast.

Overall good game to play with your friend, but being stuck on some puzzles for hours only because of confusing information is pure suffering…..",1672823989,1672823989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game itself, if you can get past the bugs, is quite mediocre. The puzzles are inferior to the ones in the previous games and very poorly balanced - it's usually one person doing everything while another one is left to wander aimlessly between remote locations just to keep them busy. You have to carry stuff for long distances too which prevents you from running and your partner just has to wait for you which is no fun at all.

In addition to that the world is a lot bigger and prettier than I expected(or in their previous games), and it is a lot of fun to explore as well. Highly recommend this one, if you enjoy co-op puzzle games.",1672196358,1672196358,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it looks like it's the best game of series, while it's surely not

Pros:
+ [b]AMAZING new experience with voice puzzle with Kraken[/b]
+ [b]AMAZING first person Overcooked puzzle[/b]
+ Interesting (due to visuals) underwater labirynth puzzle
+ Interesting puzzle with dioramas where you need to use logic, not just comparing symbols
+ Quite interesting lore

Cons:
- The main problem: here I met a lot of WORST puzzles: here is tons of situations where one player just have to run where the second one says. I mean, you can just be silent most of the time while solving some puzzles coz 90% of the info has another player: (all puzzles with sits/organ, puzzle with graves, puzzle with mirrors). Honestly, I had that feeling for ~4/6 chapters
- No random. So getting 100% achievements requires second run, and if were playing on ""passive"" role, there won't be change, coz on second run you will just answer by your memory.
- Bug with disappering entities (walkie-talkie, torch)
- Bug with lost character animations
- Bug with door in church, where one player can't get out
- Bug with door in church, where one player can not get an achievement if he was loading while you put detail
- No drama with ending, it looks really comedic [spoiler] coz it's just copy of illogical Titanic ending, and you can fall one by one like total idiots xD [/spoiler]
- No secret ending (Whyy? It was a great solution in prev part)

The gameplay makes you think and work with your partner, the story is engaging, and the game generally looks beautiful. 

However, one of the gripes I have for this game was the ending. The ending was EXTREMELY disappointing. After everything you and your partner go through, and then...that happens. I won't exactly spoil it, but I felt like it was extremely disheartening, especially after all of that work that you had to go through, just to essentially lose. I am curious if there will be another game that covers what happens after this ending, but I do not know if this is the last game of the We Where Here series or not. Another gripe I have was the gravestones puzzle. The hints my sister got were very confusing, and eventually I just randomly guessed which grave in each mini graveyard was correct until I got it right.

Game has asymmetric gameplay, puzzles are based on communication between you and your co-op partner as each of you has only half of the puzzle. You need to let other know what you see and can do to figure out the task and help each other to finish it. And believe me, devs tried to make puzzles as challenging as it was possible.

Compared to other co-op room escape games this one focuses more on your coordination. Puzzle itself could be not that hard, but explaining to each other what you see and combine knowledge to solve the problem is a tricky part.

Compared to previous games in this series puzzles become noticably harder and require more talking to explain and making sense out of hints. Game also lost a lot of replayability as more puzzles have scripted solutions instead of being randomized. Appearance of several timed puzzles which require coordinated timed input from you both also added to the level of the challenge. But everything was possible to figure out, so we greatly enjoyed this ecperience.

Technically game is also better optimized than previous ones in the series. There were no crushes this time and ""surprize"" levels where fps dropped to zero because of additional details on it.

Yes we had fun, we lost our freaking minds, and it was an absolute treat for the co-op and puzzle lovers like myself, who have played the previous games of the series! 

The game had a HELL of an improvement. The visuals, models and environment had the biggest glow up of the century, and I dare to say specific locations are really breathtaking! The soundtrack was really good, I have two favorites; the voice acting and animation is all spot on, making the cutscenes and game very immersive with the classic We Were Here feel. They did a great job tying up loose ends from the previous games too (for the lore lovers). Finally the secondary characters have a face to be associated with, and they went all out with the antagonist and player models and animations, we can even see our own feet.

I think this is THE must-play of the series, as overall it is the coup the grâce (really wish they'd continue) and THE LONGEST yet, so obviously worth the money. The rest really depends on you, the synergy between you and your partner! Try to not lose your minds much!

In terms of performance and bugs, this game has performance issues, it needs some optimizing and loading caused some hiccups but not that much annoying cause it will pass. As in terms of bugs, we encountered multiple bugs that I feel some of them were related to connectivity (since me and my friend live far near 200ms ping) that caused us to restart sometimes.

They tried to build more story to it this time but it didn't feel that much interesting or important to the game.

Ending wasn't well thought in my opinion, it could be done way better and I felt like whole ending part was rushed.

Edit:
The whole series might be a little pricey if not on sale, especially if you think about the short time actually spent in the games and replayability, which is also a critique of mine.
But the 10 hours i spent were real fun! Me and my Buddy are quite the sweaty gamers and, of course, big brain, so the 10 hours we needed for this may not be representative.
You should play the whole series! Maybe start with this, because it is quite a special experience, or the first one.

The previous games established much of the basic premise and puzzle structures, but were clearly still unrefined and had a lot of things that detracted from the nicer aspects. But We Were Here Forever fixes all of those detractors and more.

This review will not contain spoilers, but if you want a TL'DR; the game is superb and an example of co-operative puzzle games and instantly one of my favorite puzzle games period.
Regardless, time to get into the nitty gritty.

---- Visual & Audio ----

Put simply, I love the design of this world. The art style and level design are not only incredibly beautiful, but incredibly fitting thematically. The world feels simultaneously magical like straight out of a fairytale, but also still makes total sense to navigate and explore. The detail in designs is fantastic and the variety of areas and environments is diverse and at times breathtaking. Visually the game is a master class of using effective design decisions to showcase the story and the world as you navigate it.

Levels are unique and feel refreshing to look at, while the puzzles are integrated organically into the surrounding world. With lighting and use of props the world highlights what it needs to to make navigating intuitive, and also does an effective job of conveying emotion and tension.

The sound design is clear and beautiful. The music of the game is gorgeous, and the voice acting of the characters has no right being as good as it is for a puzzle game. The Jester's voice actor in particular brought their absolute best, and I was continually impressed by their performance in various parts of the game.
If it were up to me, they'd get an award.

The use of cutscenes and animations, while subdued and not excessive, is very effective. And the visual and audio design of those cutscenes is fantastic and truly left an impression on me.
All of this combines into a style that I truly think will stand the test of time and will still inspire joy in people years from now. And all the kudos to the artists and sound designers, as well as the voice cast.

---- Puzzles ----

The puzzles are plentiful, and yet incredibly unique. The puzzles didn't repeat themselves past their welcome, and were always intuitively designed to fit into the environment and to be easily approachable and understandable. As well as requiring you to move around whilst doing so, making it feel more kinetic and memorable than simply staring at a piece of paper or a machine. Offering a nice variety of both difficulty and type of puzzle means that you're not likely to get bored at lack of new things to try or puzzles to figure out. So if you want to be truly tested on various kinds of puzzles, this is the game for you without a doubt.

The communication between co-op partners is intuitive and encourages you to learn to communicate more effectively. The puzzles are designed in a way where you can describe the situation very well once you wrap your head around it, and all it often takes is for your partner to say one thing to set the light bulbs off in your head. In addition to this many levels involve changing around the perspective between you and your partner, as well as converging your paths only to separate them again.
This all makes for a far more organic feeling and free environment, making it feel less constrained and boxed in than previous We Were Here titles, or many other puzzle games.

Communication in-game is done through a simple but effective voice chat system incorporating a walkie talkie. (Though granted I played it with a friend over Discord, but it's nice to have for those that don't have that option or want the extra immersion.) Communication is key, and this is a good way to practice how well you and a friend can sync up and learn to convey information.

The puzzles never got on my nerves, though you might of course be different in this regard, but I was simply enjoying my time far too much. And overall the puzzles are fantastic and deal with so many unique concepts and gameplay methods that I can't help but applaud the developers.

---- Gameplay ----

Playing the game is incredibly intuitive, navigating is easy and straightforward and the game does a fantastic job of introducing the environments and puzzles to you. The tutorial the game begins with is very effective at conveying all the basic skills you'll need to get started, and once the game proper begins it's a steady curve of improvement and challenge from one location to the next.

The gameplay is solid and functions as expected with the exception of a few slight bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking as far as I or my friend experienced. The controls are responsive and the way you interact with the environment or the puzzles are all simple to grasp on a technical level. The levels are designed in a way to make them quite easy to wrap your head around and figure out where everything is, with clever uses of memorable landmarks as well as good use of lines of sight.

This also extends to your partner, and locating each other is usually not too difficult. And if you have trouble figuring out where you are, just describe what you see and turn on your torch and finding each other is quick and easy. The co-op aspect of gameplay works without issues and I encountered no problems that prevented us from progressing during the entire duration of the game. Connection seems a non-issue (though that's to be expected) with the only slight desync happening for some animations.

Overall the game is very accessible even if you're fairly new to first person games, and wrapping your head around the ordeal won't take too long to figure out.

---- Technicals ----

The game runs flawlessly, with one notable exception. Transitions from level to level often cause lag and choppiness for some amount of time as the levels load in. However, it subsides quickly and once the game has finished loading everything in, all problems are gone. Performance is rock solid beyond these load moments, and I had no issues playing the game what-so-ever.

The controls are responsive and the menus are a vast improvement over previous titles in the series, and the UI is well designed and clean allowing you to take everything in properly.
A lot of people kept referring to a bugged puzzle in the graveyard section of the game, but we encountered no bug in said area. Not sure if we simply got lucky, or if there's something else going on. But overall there was no real hindrance at any point to our playthrough or enjoyment, and overall the experience was pretty flawless.

---- Closing thoughts ----

Ultimately it comes down to one simple fact. Do you like puzzles?
If you do, then this game is undoubtedly worth checking out, and a great way to spend some quality time with a friend. However it is worth noting that as a co-op only puzzle game.
I would recommend either bringing along a friend, or finding suitable players on the community page or through other means. Since it definitely is a commitment, albeit a fairly small one.

Overall We Were Here Forever is one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. Up there with games like Portal or Talos Principle. A unique and refreshing experience with beautiful designs throughout, a fantastic style, absolutely stellar voice acting and audio, and some of the most breathtaking and varied environments.

The developers have refined their talent, and have put out a game that truly is one of the best of its kind.
And the amount of love and effort put into every corner of the game is undeniable.

The name of the game is incorrect, since we were only there for a couple evenings. But the game certainly makes a compelling case for why I would want to be there forever. Since it was truly a wonderful experience made with care and love.

We Were Here Forever is a great 2 player online co-op puzzle game that relies on communicating with your partner.
The storytelling has been improved with cinematics. While there is an overarching story, this game works as a standalone because the focus on the story is about setting the mood for the next puzzle.
The idea of puzzles that have no given rules, until you figure them out, and the necessity for describing sights and sounds that the other player may not hear or see strengthens bonds and gives a good laugh. We Were Here Forever allows the player to get hints.

You can tell that the creators/developers have really listened to the fans of the series and have refined the game-play each time. It's moved away from the earlier frustrating puzzle types but kept up the level of challenge. They're more skill-based and logical now than simply stumbling alone trying to work out some vague or arbitrary associations. More thinking and execution, instead of abstract solutions. In this, paying attention to detail and your surroundings will serve you all the better, not to mention honing your communication skills (knowing the way your partner thinks definitely helps!). And as a result, each section is all the more rewarding when you complete them.

If you’re not familiar with the We Were Here games, they are coop puzzle games, think escape rooms but in video game form. 

The graphics have improved, I think they are way better in this title, a lot of attention seems to have gone to the atmosphere, lighting and details.

One of the biggest change is that roles are not assigned from start to finish anymore ! Anytime a puzzle splits you up, it could have been either one of us on each side. And moreover many puzzles allow you to just switch with your partner mid-puzzle. I also like the fact that we spend less time without seeing each other at all even if separated by a barrier of some kind.

I also would say the quality has improved overall, we encountered less bugs than in previous titles.

We still chose to use discord rather than the in-game voice, but at this point we’re just too used to not using the talkies.

While the story of the game is better than the previous ones, I didn’t like the ending of that one. [spoiler]It felt rushed and gimmicky.[/spoiler]

This game is again a bit longer than its predecessor, sadly that maybe because of the “walking simulator” parts of it where you just need to get from point A to B with nothing much happening.

Even if it can still be improved on, I want to reiterate this is the best We Were Here game to this day and I hope Total Mayhem Games keeps making more !",1668126073,1668126364,True,13,0,0.68660968542098999,3,True,False,False

The environments all look really nice and the atmosphere the game makes is very sort of Halloween-y, NOT horror, but kind of tongue in cheek spooky stuff. A bit like the haunted house at your favourite theme park I imagine. The game is fully voiced and the voice acting is excellent.

Pretty much all the puzzles heavily involve both players and you'll need to communicate a lot in order to solve them and find your way out. Most are very satisfying to solve but there was one puzzle sort of early on involving see-saws making bridges with a player on each side and we didn't really like that one due to poor visibility.

The puzzles in this game ranged from pretty simple to pretty tough, but they were almost never unintuitive. Perhaps their greatest aspect is how well of a job they do dividing tasks between players. Neither party is ever sat doing nothing more than relaying info/flipping switches on command, which is what tends to really make or break a game of this type.

Besides that, the game looks pretty good. The performance overall wasn't great however, even after reducing the game's graphical fidelity. It struggled to keep a steady 60 in the outdoor areas. That, and not every puzzle was amazing, but in a game with so many of them they can't all be winners.

Easily the worst in the series. From bugs to stuttering, to a convoluted storyline that tries a lot but does nothing.
[hr][/hr]

[h1]The bugs[/h1]

I like puzzles. [i]I also like playing them in a somewhat steady frame rate[/i]. Each time elements of the game world load in, there is this horrendous frame rate drop that turns your game into a slideshow. I am not one to complain about frame rate drops here and there but f*ck me, the game sh*t the bed so many times I might've missed half of the f*cking cutscenes.

Some game elements were also f*cked. Around mid-game, for some reason, during [spoiler]the boulder pushing thing, after the thing was done,[/spoiler] I remained locked.... like actually locked, my character wouldn't do jack sh*t, I couldn't move, I couldn't look around, all I could do was get f*cked and spam the walkie-talkie. I had to restart the session. During the [spoiler]potion making thing, for the forgery, for some reason, I wouldn't get the prompt to pick up the star-square-circle things after I would craft something. At first, I thought I was just being ret*rded because I didn't have a bowl to put them in but no, it would bug out and the only fix I could find was to spam sh*t like I was weapon spamming or pick another empty bowl[/spoiler].

[h1]The puzzles[/h1]

Why? Why would you put some of the most autistic puzzles during the first 3/4 of the game, just to end it with the [spoiler]Candy Crush equivalent of the Titanic[/spoiler]? When I say autistic, I don't mean neither good nor bad, I just mean.... weird. Don't get me wrong, they were good but I feel like this game became something far more complex than it should've been. From [spoiler]translating whatever a f*cking kraken looking a*s squid was saying[/spoiler] to [spoiler]piecing togheter a f*cking ray gun like it's a zombies map from Black Ops[/spoiler] it just felt weird man.... It's just not enjoyable when you tease me with the [spoiler]jester box platforming thing with teleporting doors[/spoiler] just to castrate me with the f*cking cringe a*s [spoiler]sitting of the puppets puzzle where you put 100 f*cking clues for 100 f*cking riddles, all at once, so good luck, f*cker, in figuring out who the f*ck asked[/spoiler]. Quantity over quality is all I'm saying.

[h1]The story[/h1]

A Brazzers show with Johnny Bravo, Johnny Sins and the newly announced Scooby Doo: The ballad of gay Velma would've been far more enjoyable than that God awful [spoiler]Titanic welcome to the Fortnite metaverse rip off[/spoiler].

It's just painful to watch a story devolve so dramatically, from intriguing to confusing to ""what the f*ck is that DiCaprio?"". The ending was so unnecessary man, atleast give us an alternative, some secret ending, something that makes sense. [spoiler]And what happened to the king? Where the f*ck did the jester go? Why can't we obey him? Why is the king such a little b*tch?[/spoiler] Why is there so much downtime? Why do I have to [spoiler]ride that f*cking platform back and forth just to get TWO CUTSCENES IN HALF A FRAME PER HOUR out of.... 6 trips?[/spoiler] Why is the [spoiler]chairlift ride so... meaningless? You make me spend so much time for a wannabe cutscene to see some fog and some mountains, just to end the game on a rushed Titanic soap opera[/spoiler].

So much potential wasted. From the [spoiler]mysterious jester[/spoiler] to the [spoiler]good king gone mad[/spoiler] to the [spoiler]plot by the ""families""[/spoiler] just to get an ending that.. just doesn't fit.

[h1]The goods?[/h1]

The game makes huge improvements on the foundation set by previous titles. Puzzles got more complex (in my opinion, this damages the game more than it does good), visuals are gorgeous, controls feel sturdy. It really pains me to give it a negative review but I had to go through a roller coaster of emotions just to be greeted by f*cking [spoiler]Leonardo f*cking DiCaprio. You're laughing but that's what it is. It's literally the f*cking scene from Titanic, except Rose is replaced by my f*cking buddy who doesn't say jack sh*t except ""farewell"" as he drowns like a f*cking c*nt and I keep saying ""nah, it can't be. It can't f*cking end like this, that's cringe"" but the game actually ends, credits roll and all you have to say is ""Jesus f*cking Christ"" because the f*cking boat that could've saved you both just keeps blasting that f*cking horn, almost mocking you for thinking the game would end well[/spoiler].

[h1]The other ""We were here"" games are good though. Please make another one, this can't be the last one, it's just cringe[/h1]",1665703440,1665703612,False,16,9,0.553731262683868408,0,True,False,False

 If you are looking for cooperative game play with a spouse, partner or friend... look no further because this is the one! Ultimately, this game is all about working with your partner to solve puzzles and riddles.  You have to rely on communication to advance through the game. Your characters are often separated, and naturally, information that you need will be accessible by your partner while the information they need is accessible by you. 

You will need a microphone to relay the information back and forth to each other, or if you are in the same room you can talk to one another. Try not to look at their screen though, that's cheating! ;-)

Some of the puzzles and riddles are hard to get through, but be persistent! The developers have made the game pretty straight forward... meaning, you can't progress without doing things in order. If you're stuck, retrace your steps and see what things in your surroundings you can manipulate or interact with. That will often jump start something and get you on the right path to solving the puzzle. 

Overall, be patient, talk clearly, be kind to your partner! and enjoy this amazing game and franchise. 

Best of luck!

Story:

Like the previous three We Were Here games, it puts you into the shoes of two explorers who awaken deep underneath Castle Rock. Suddenly you're freed from your cells and this begins your journey to escape, but you find that the stakes are much higher than ever before.

Even though there's much more story this time around, it again takes a backseat to the puzzles and such. However this time around a lot of the puzzles have lore written into the puzzles, so while you're solving the complex enigmas thrown at you, it tells you the story of the castle and what led to it's downfall. However a good chunk of it is information that we learned from the previous games, although with added explanations. 

The only major negative is that the story ends on a very sequel bait ending which feels incredibly abrupt considering the journey to the end is much longer this time around. The fact that we're likely pretty far away from the next entry, I feel like they should have went with something else.  

Graphics

From game to game the graphical leap has been impressive to say the least. What started as a simplistic looking game has now turned into a really visually stunning game. The environments you visit throughout are grander in scale and in visual fidelity.

Some of the moments you witness are actually jaw dropping and the developers have totally outdid themselves. Of course there are still a few minor issues like some textures being re-used from the previous game and some of the models looking low quality, but they are so minor they do not detract from everything else.

Audio:

Out of a game full of strengths this is probably it's biggest weakness. First of all let's start with the music. The music throughout the series has always been pretty weak for me and I'm glad to say that this one has the best soundtrack hands down. There's plenty of great new tracks that help build atmosphere, get your blood pumping etc. 

However I've noticed that quite a lot of the games sound effects and even some minor tracks have been re-used from the previous games. Again since the development team is so small, I feel like I can excuse this, but I wish that they wouldn't rely on re-used assets as much as they do. Also the tradition of so bad it's good voice acting is still here front and center.

Gameplay:

We Were Here Forever follows the same basic formula as the previous three games in the series. You and your co-op partner have walkie talkies and use them to communicate to solve increasingly difficult puzzles. So let's talk about the puzzles. 

The puzzles start off simple enough, but quickly become incredibly complex. The scope of the game is much larger in scale and because of it, the puzzles seem scarier before you comprehend everything that goes into solving it. That's not to say that they are simple, they range from simplistic, to pretty difficult. 

There's not many puzzles this time around that can cause death, but they are traded with more puzzles that take longer to complete cause they force you to walk around a large area, flipping different mechanisms. For some these puzzles might seem much more tedious than what was in the other games, purely due to the size of them, but I felt like that was one of this games strength. 

My biggest gripe with the puzzles is the a poor difficulty scale. It felt like each puzzle in the previous games gradually got harder and harder with some minor breathing room puzzles, Forever has puzzles that are incredibly difficult, followed up by incredibly easy puzzles and vice versa, however since basically all of them are incredibly fun to solve. 

Verdict:

The fourth entry in the series is by far the most complex and fun. Every game has been a vast improvement over the previous and if there is a number 5 I can't wait to see what crazy puzzles will the devs come up with next. If you want to play something with a friend and have nothing to do, you can't go wrong with these games, so go and check it out.

Final Rating:
9/10

Pros:
+ Puzzles are the best yet
+ Visuals are stunning 
+ Interesting lore 

Cons:
- Difficulty scaling is all over the place 
- Ending is sequel bait

Story wise it's def. the best out of all the we were here games.
Puzzles were sometimes quite a challenge and both players didnt always have to understand the riddle in order to complete it which was kinda sad. - ofc you sometimes need a big brain or just some time to fully think about everything but at points it was just super frustrating - it's like they always came back with a next fun riddle tho.

It was much longer than the others, and i felt like me and my roommate got a lot more choices as to where we were going in the puzzle dynamic (as in the previous ones they'd have the clues and i'd be in the field so to speak) 

The puzzles in this one felt really good to solve and the logic was sound! The first game in the series where we didn't need to look at any hints or a walkthrough, which felt really nice! 

As for others saying they wish there was more tension, i honestly felt like the puzzles had enough tension and wasn't any unnecessary tension like the third game. I feel like timed puzzles are fine but too many just makes it too stressful and i honestly liked that there wasn't as many in this one

The Jester is an amazing character with a lot of depth, to me the story made perfect sense. [spoiler] I got interested in the Netherland paintings very early in the game (I think it was at the ceremony), but I didn't think it was important, it cracked me up that it actually was a little clue to the story! :D  [/spoiler] The voice acting is awesome ♥ 
What we really didn’t like were the hints.It’s like the devs didn’t really know where the players could get stuck or what could go wrong - like [spoiler] we were stuck at the ceremony and never figured it out (had to google the solution), because we misunderstood that men and women cannot sit together.  [/spoiler]
The audio is great, sounds are really good, graphics are the best from all games in this series and some of the scenes are soooo pretty ♥ Cutscenes were very well done, they were at the right places, maybe some smaller ones (like looking at each other while opening the portal (which we had to do several times) makes it unnecessarily long. There is a room for improvement when it comes to animations.
Overall we found one bug (and I am still not sure if that was a bug or if the place I needed to click is just really super small (while trying to dig at the graveyard).
Most of the puzzles were super fun (my personal favourite is the one with the Kraken ♥). It got a little repetitive when we got separated in the prison cells [spoiler] it was always that one is trying to describe a path for the other, and even though the puzzles themselves were different, the princip was always the same - one person (and it was the same one for the longest time) is creating/describing a path for the other.  [/spoiler]
This game is worth every penny, it is an epic end to the whole series and I certainly recommend anyone (who wants to play a game with a friend) to try it ♥

Trust me, it was worth the wait for release! It's puzzles are far more diverse to the others in the We Were Here series, which is always a good thing. These puzzles are creatively made to show how we go about solving and understanding them differently to our partner. It's lovely how communication is vital in puzzles to complete this game, and plays on your trust in one another.  Its visuals are stunning, storyline & lore is a strong addition and well crafted in comparison to their other games. It is a beautiful game to play and definitely my favourite puzzle game I've ever played, and even after the game has ended, it leaves you with more questions than what you began with. 

We only experienced two bugs in our entire game of playing, they were minor and did NOT affect our gameplay whatsoever. (eg, the script that was on my partners arm, and the next day it was on mine. It didn't affect the story). I have seen many reviews saying they found many bugs that did not allow them to play the game without disruption, however we found none of the sort.

This game and series, as well as it’s developers, deserve way more hype and far more popularity and this game is very cheap considering how incredible it is, for me personally I believe it should be worth much more! It is clear Total Mayhem Games has put so much effort into this game and I hope they either conclude this series or continue with the amazing work. 100% would recommend!!",1652541331,1662062114,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a bit longer, so there's more game. Some puzzles are really good and interesting, but as with the other entries in the series there are some that can be quite annoying, most notably the time based ones (making potions for example, ugh). It's fine overall though.

It’s a game where you truly cooperate, not just play together with your friend and do your own thing. In order to solve the puzzles, you need to communicate and describe to each other what you see or hear to get the whole picture of the puzzle.

It’s very entertaining. All puzzles are different from each other so it never feels repetitive. This is also amazing because even though it’s already their fourth We Were Here game, they can still come up with new fresh ideas for great puzzles.

This is not a game you want to watch before playing. For the best experience I recommend going in knowing nothing about the puzzles and solutions. I also recommend starting with their first game We Were Here, which is for free and is very short. This way you will know if you like this kind of gameplay and then you can decide if you want to buy the rest or not. 

There might still be bugs in the game. We experienced one during our playthrough and honestly it was very hard to know that it’s unsolvable. We were lucky to find out before we started pulling our hair out.  

I made a short spoiler free video review of the game - StingeReview. It’s also showing the bug we encountered in case you want to check it out. It’s probably still not fixed by now. It starts at 3:33 in the video.

The ending of the story was nice, It can lead for the next game and our characters successfully reached their goal by destroying the king and setting themself free. But... that titanic scene... It was so cheesy, like there was tons of wood piles going around, one could jump the other, or they can hear the sound of the ship, wait couple more minutes in water, or they could switch for some time. Tons of ways to survive in that situation. Please dont get me wrong, I didn't hate the idea of; ""one survive & other sacrifice"". But It was so empty and cheap, After a story like that, devs needed to came up with a better idea, not some ending like titanic. I rly hated that kind of sacrifical ending.

Y'all have made a very fun puzzle world to play around in for four games in a row and that's awesome! I very much look forward to what y'all do next.

I'm writing this after one play-through of the game. This game had some incredible moments (all of the puzzles in the Jester chapter were incredible.) The aesthetic, the world, the story... there's a lot of great opportunity for all kinds of moments. That said, upon finishing my first play-through, I think this game was too big.

There are several moments where the momentum of the game completely halts (no spoilers):
- As you travel from location to location, you're almost always on some kind of ""lift"" machine, there's almost nothing to do while you're travelling and there's barely anything to look at
- Sometimes even after a minute-long hurry-up-and-wait travel sequence, the game still fades to black so it can load the next area instead of using the travel time to load the next sequence
- The frequency of slow, nothing-filled travel is frequent enough to become tedious and a drag [spoiler]especially when you're travelling to and from the church. That is so slow and there is no good reason for it. Another example would be the hot-air balloon vehicle that takes you back to the town square: the player is stuck in a chair for almost a minute while the vehicle is almost completely dark, a siren is going off, and you see vague lights outside. Why have it be that long? Why have it be that intense if really all it is is just getting back to the main area?[/spoiler]

The game had one game-breaking bug:
- Not sure if this was a technical issue on our end, but my friend and I experienced a bug in the [spoiler]Nautilus[/spoiler] section that cost us a full 45 minutes because [spoiler]the pipe junctions were bugged such that the visual orientation of the junctions didn't match to what the game engine thought they were. So we'd send air somewhere and it wouldn't go the way things looked like they did.[/spoiler] When we finally gave up and looked at a walkthrough and saw we were doing everything right, we reloaded the game and everything worked again. This may not be a developer issue, but it shook our confidence in the game from that point onwards.
- While this bug isn't game-breaking, it was very odd: In the [spoiler]alchemy section[/spoiler] there was an audio glitch where the player's voice chat became a directional audio signal. Nowhere else in the game did this happen and there was no puzzle reason for it as far as we could tell.
- This isn't really a bug per-se, but there are a lot of areas where the animations were very obviously not present. There are some times where, as the players are transported from area to area, the full animation doesn't play; instead the screen fades to black, fades up in a new area, and play continues. Some wheels that need to be turned don't have animations for the characters to place their hands on the wheels while others do.

The story and the execution of the story have some issues:
(I know, this is a puzzle game primarily, but TMG has done a great job setting up a world with lore and have done a decently good job of developing that story throughout the first 3 games. This game lacked in some areas like the others hadn't)
STORY SPOILERS:
[spoiler]
- In general, these following nit-picks can be summed up as follows: Approaching story with a ""and now this happens?!"" approach leads to a weak story that is obviously cobbled together to get to some puzzles. That's fine, but it's mediocre and could be an area of improvement. I'm not saying We Were Here needs to become a story-based game, but when you've taken the time and effort to develop a world with central characters, I would have liked the story to be more strong.
- The king not being able to see anything outside of his castle but also somehow being the lord of the whole domain seems inconsistent. Why give him any ability to affect the world outside of his castle if he can't see anything? Why take away his sight of the church and town so he's ""forced"" to send the Jester to hunt the players when he can clearly send lightning and wreak havoc on the town?
- The Jester's motivations don't line up with his actions. If the Jester hates the king and wants him destroyed, shouldn't the Jester be helping the player to open the portal at the end instead of antagonizing the player or waiting idly? It seems odd the Jester would hamper the players' progress by trapping them in his music box if he secretly wants the players to succeed. (btw, just want to add another note that the Jester's puzzles were the best in the game by FAR. Absolutely loved this section, just commenting on how this seems to go against his motivations.)
- The squid was a very odd character to through into the lore. The puzzle with the squid was very unique and super fun to work out. But this is sentient squid! That's fascinating! Why is it here? Why does it hate the king, too? The story didn't really explain this. It just kinda threw in a new character with a ""and now this!"" kinda attitude purely to set up some loose context for a puzzle. And that's fine... it's just also kinda lackluster and empty from a story perspective.
- The king's daughters had zero impact on anything. There was absolutely nothing the king's traitorous daughters did to affect the plot in any way and therefore they had no impact at all on the puzzles. So throwing in a detail that they sacrificed themselves to lock the king away forever didn't really seem all that important or incredible because we never learned about them, never understood why they needed to do this, etc.
- Also... where did the Jester go at the end? It was my understanding (and I could be completely mistaken) that the realm was controlled by the king, so if the king dies, the realm dies with him. But then after the final fight, there's a boat that comes and picks up the surviving player? Where did that boat come from? Is this realm bigger than we thought? Is the king not tied to the realm? Instead he's just kinda loosely tied to the area around his castle? Was the portal not to another dimension but instead a portal to another area on Earth?
[/spoiler]

Nearly all of the above culminates in the final ""puzzle."" This, honestly, was the most disappointing part of the game. This wasn't a puzzle, it was a linear sequence of steps with a inferred time limit on it. Nothing was happening to actually communicate a sense of urgency. The ""puzzle"" was just ""go over here and flip this lever"" then repeat like... 8 times. For the climactic puzzle where [spoiler]we're supposedly killing the king[/spoiler], this left a TON to be desired. This also wasn't nearly as fun a puzzle as literally any other puzzle in the game, so to have this be the last one was a confusing choice.

In summary, I acknowledge I've written a novel here. And I've brought up a lot of things that aren't really core to the ""puzzle"" element of this game. I'd like to think I'm critiquing this hard and this much because I really love this series. WWH has become one of my favorite co-op puzzle games right up there with Portal 2 and It Takes Two. I want it to be amazing and while this installment in the series was fantastic in several ways, it was equally as ""un-fantastic"" in several other ways.

I wish the studio well and can't wait to see the next thing they do! I just hope they either take on an equally-sized gameas WWH: Forever but take the extra time to really polish that big of a game or cut out the weak parts of the game and make a smaller, but excellently executed game.",1660320031,1660320031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although, that doesn't say much on its own given the relative lack of such games. The [i]We Were Here[/i] series has quickly cemented itself as one of the premiere franchises in the genre over the last few years. Each game has built upon the last, further exploring the largely untapped designed space of co-op puzzle games. The original was essentially a prototype, with the third being closer to a full game. 

Essentially, if you liked the other games in the series, you will enjoy this one, as it evolves more of the same qualities of the previous entries. However, it is also noticeably different in some ways.

What can you expect from [i]We Were Here Forever[/i] compared to the other games in the series? The first thing you will notice is how absolutely massive the game is in scope and size compared to the previous games. This is by far the longest game in the series. It took my very experienced puzzling gamer friend and I about 11 hours to get through, and I think that's on the quicker side of things. Each puzzle is longer and has more stages. The graphics and world design are at their most beautiful. And the story is at its most developed. The amount of development time and the growth of Total Mayhem Games certainly shows in this game.

None of that necessarily makes for a good game on its own, but it'll certainly be a welcome change for fans of the series, and should be comforting to newcomers worried about getting their money's worth in playtime.

Fortunately, [i]We Were Here Forever[/i] matches its increased budget with some of the best puzzles in the series. It also has a high quantity of puzzles, which unfortunately means not every single one is a hit. While the pacing is generally good in terms of giving the players breaks between lower and higher tension puzzles, I did find the middle of the game dragging a little bit with some less intuitive puzzles. The last third of the game, however, is absolutely pristine in puzzle design and pacing. 

It should also be said that this game has some of the most unique puzzles of the series. For those wondering if the game might start feeling repetitive after playing the previous three, Total Mayhem knocks out of the park in terms of coming up with new and inventive ways to play with the mechanic of co-operative communication. The asymmetric design lends itself not only to replayability but also one-of-a-kind puzzles. Although, in its weakest puzzles, the asymmetric design can leave one player feeling less involved, but never for more than a few minutes.

Overall, this game is a smashing success and a shining culmination of the franchise. If you're a newcomer to the franchise who isn't super sure about how fun the core mechanic of the game is, then maybe start with a shorter earlier entry to the series. Otherwise, this game works as a great starting point for anyone wanting to hop into the puzzling fun.",1659407513,1659407513,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:
- Bold, innovative puzzles, which don't suffer from the same ""slight variation on a puzzle from another game"" that plagues the genre
- Provides an enjoyable sense of learning and discovery as you uncover how each puzzle works
- Similar to The Witness, We Were Here Forever often takes a similar ""here's a basic puzzle, OK now that you understand how that works, here's a more complex version of the same puzzle"" approach. It works just as well here as it did in The Witness.
- A large amount of content, worth the asking price. We took ~14 hours at a fairly relaxed pace
- There is a story, but not much of one. I'm listing this as a ""good"" point because the story really only needed to be there at all to hold the puzzles together, and it does that well.

The not-necessarily-bad-just-suggestions:
- The ""only one player talking at a time"" mechanic doesn't add anything to the experience except frustration. We ended up switching to Discord after one of the rooms had a bug which allowed both players to speak at the same time and we realised how much better that was. I would have a different opinion if the game did anything interesting with the mechanic (e.g. one of the players drops their walkie talkie where it is audible but inaccessible, communication becomes one way only, puzzle design allows players to come up with a way of communicating in the other direction through visible responses to interacting with puzzle elements?), but there is nothing like this.
- While most of the puzzles are quite innovative, this can be a double edged sword. For example, the way you're supposed to solve the puzzle in 
[spoiler]the Nautilus where you talk to the seamonster[/spoiler] is so difficult to do with accuracy and different from any solution in a puzzle game we'd seen before that we came up with the right approach, tried it, and then discarded it saying ""no this can't possibly be it"". It wasn't until half an hour later when we gave up and Googled it that we realised we had the right approach, but were just so bad at doing the thing the puzzle required that the approach seemed infeasible.
- There are multiple puzzles which will be difficult or impossible for certain classes of users. E.g. [spoiler]the Nautilus sea monster translation[/spoiler] for anyone who is hard of hearing. [spoiler]The Nautilus alchemy puzzle[/spoiler] will also be difficult for those who may not be able to perform actions quickly enough, and felt out of place given that there are no other puzzles which require such high levels of interaction in a limited time throughout the game.",1659308704,1659308917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all I really liked all parts of the We Were Here series. This one was the far most interesting one with a nice story and good effects. It makes really fun to play it and to solve the puzzles. Even when it is sometimes difficult like [spoiler]  describing octopus sounds or some symbols. I always wonder how other people would describe some puzzle parts xD  [/spoiler] but without difficult parts, i wouldnt be a good puzzle :P so all in all I think it is a really nice game to play with a good friend and iam really waiting forward to play the new games, you will make.
Keep up the good work!!!

It's not a terrible game, but it is a regression from the previous titles in nearly every way except graphically. Credit where it's due, this game is the best looking one in the series and the team clearly put a lot of effort in. The Jester area with the gravity shifted platforms was a real highlight for me.

But graphics alone does not a good game make and it seems like the team kind of lost focus of what really made the games enjoyable. (Spoilers from here on in).

The first thing my buddy and I noticed was several bugs on the main menu.

* Changing your region in the settings is basically cosmetic. Every time you restart the game it defaults you to Europe no matter what you've actually set it too.
* The Steam invite thing bugged out quite a few times and forced us to restart.

This was our first impression on the game, and this being the forth in the series, one would expect that such basic issues would have been addressed before launch. And after you get past the title screen into the game, we still ran into a bunch of issues:

* In every new area, the game chugs HARD. I'm talking 10-15fps for up to a minute or two upon entering a new area. This is strange given how much transitional space is given. You would think the game would use the downtime to load stuff, but that doesn't appear to be the case. (I'm using an SSD by the way, so it's not a slow disk).
* If one player has even a momentary internet issue, their character model either becomes invisible or just stands in one place for the other player. This happened a lot in our playthrough and since many puzzles need you to see the other person, it was a real pain.
* There are a few softlocks in the game, one of which is in the graveyard. The person below can ""pickaxe"" through a wall without having the pickaxe and be stuck on one side of it.

However, we can lay that all aside if the game was excellent. Bugs are one thing (and some of them may be fixed by the time you read this), but how is the game?

Unfortunately, it's just lost focus. I mentioned before that there were regressions from the previous games. Let me name a few:

* Lengthy periods of ""dead air"". There are several points throughout the game where you're doing nothing but walking around. Even worse, there are parts that seem to just be wasting your time. There's a ski lift that takes you to one area, and it's enormously slow for no reason. There's nothing to look at, there's nothing to do, you just wait. There's also a big lift that you have to go back and forth on four times to deliver parts for a big machine. There was some story stuff mixed in, but even so it just seemed like a huge waste of time.
* Many puzzles are very one-sided. Most of them can either be brute-forced without much effort, or otherwise solved by one person while the other just kind of goes around and does what they're told. There were some great puzzles like the aforementioned Jester area, as well as some others, but there are a lot of not great puzzles in the game. The ""arena"" one stands out as a particularly lame one since one player has to lug around an iron ball and just be told where to walk. 
* There are no ""life-or-death"" puzzles. These were always exciting to me because you have one person yelling that something is going to kill them unless they figure out the puzzle fast, and the other person standing in front of a bunch of complex machinery. 
* The final ""puzzle"" is a completion deflation and not worthy of the climax. You can ""solve"" the puzzle basically without knowing why you're doing anything. The music and scene are supposed to make it epic, but it's just not.
* Still trying to push the ""lore"". This is probably the most subjective part of the game, and where most people will likely disagree, but the story/lore has done nothing for me throughout the entire series, and despite the effort to make the story parts more impressive, it just falls flat. The entire story is that the Jester corrupted the king, but then we help the Jester escape? The lore was much better when it wasn't the main focus. In fact, one of the early games (the first or the second, I can't remember exactly) had a sort of light horror feel to it, and some genuinely creepy moments (putting on a play while the black figure slowly gets closer and closer). I would love to see a return to the horror-ish feel with a more subtle story, but that doesn't seem to be the direction they're going.

Overall, it's not a bad game, but it just doesn't reach the level I would expect these games to have hit by the forth iteration.",1657884999,1657884999,False,4,1,0.493611693382263184,0,True,False,False

We Were Here Forever... partially follows that rule? About half of the puzzles, both members share the same physical space, with very little not shared, which robs the game of the joy of having to communicate and translate information back and forth. While there are a few puzzles like that, they are not the rule, which is a shame.

Is that enough to not recommend this though? No. This is definitely the highest quality game in the series— every puzzle and area has new assets and visual spectacle far beyond its predecessors. The puzzles are more diverse than ever, for good and bad. It also has the best puzzles in the entire series, with the entire Nautilus area being the peak. Timers are largely gone, with most puzzles having a 3 strike system that means you're not just free to cheese the puzzle.

There's actually a very nice sprinkling of lore both directly and indirectly that gives the story more context, which is done very well; you'll do a puzzle on the families that created a secret rebellion to fight the king, and then later, visit their graves. It's not extremely important, but it's nice. 

There are a few bad quirks in the game, like lugging the machine pieces back up to the tower, but it was never enough to ruin the experience.

Look— the co-op puzzle scene is [i]very[/i] small, so it's nice to have something to play with a homie, no matter its strengths and weaknesses.",1657758948,1657758948,True,3,0,0.546191215515136719,0,True,False,False

There are multiple parts where you just have to sit still (and play rock paper scissors). This killed the mood pretty badly for me and my friend. There are also some parts where walking to the next puzzle seems slightly pointless.

The puzzles themselves were ok but some are repetitive and very inferior compered to the puzzles in the first three games [spoiler] Ball carrying and the ending ""puzzle"" [/spoiler].

I have only two complaints. One is that like games 2 and 3, this doesn't support VR. I do wish it did as that was a lot of fun in the first game, which ironically is the game that is free as well. While this issue is by no means game breaking, it's more of a wish that they would further support VR. I'm sure they have good reasons for it, but still something I wish they did. 

The other is that the roles don't really seem to be unique from each other any more. It's more of who got into the cage first, or who decided to go upstairs. Otherwise the roles only seem to come into play based on loading the game. Which made for a bit of confusion when suddenly my friend and I switched places from where we left it at. 

All in all, I'd say the story is strong, the puzzles are fun and challenging, and There is likely a hidden ending that you have to do everything right/find everything, to get. 

Either way, if you love puzzle games, and working together with a friend. You will like this. Especially if you liked any of the previous installments as it maintains the same spirit of the other games.
 I give this game a 9/10 [spoiler] Would let my friend drown again like Rose did to Jack [/spoiler]

In case the devs read this, One thing that would be really cool, not sure how feasible it would be for you, is to mimic a feature that the sequel Silent Hill games had. At least some of them, and that is to allow variable difficulty for the riddles. Which would change the riddles making them harder or easier. As well as different. You couldn't play it on easy riddles and then go to hard and expect the answer to be the same. It changed it up making it more difficult as well as different, which added additional replayability. By making the game have more puzzles, that were based on a difficulty bar. Thus if you aren't very good at puzzles you could put it on easy and still  enjoy the story of the game without cheating, looking up guides with all the answers, and feel more fulfilled knowing you solved it. And then if you wanted you could play the game again with higher difficulties instead of just playing a different role.",1657221843,1657221843,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

- Since it is a half open world maybe there shouldn't be chapters but instead make the players feel they are progressing through dialogues (which you are already doing). 
- The chapters counter made me feel like there are more 5-hours puzzle chapters ahead and that can be discouraging (especially because the chapters only goes up to two). 

Anyway, I really like the music box puzzle; the puppeteer personality and animation is absolutely amazing. And the final choice feels a lot more real than the previous ones. Great Job designers!

First of all, this time there was more story to discover than in the first three games. You can tell they tried to not only give you the puzzles one after another but they tried to cohesively bring them together to achieve an end goal. The attention to detail was present in the visual aspects of the game (esp. in comparison to the older parts of the series) but also in the lore (even though its still confusing af). Very intense and moody atmosphere, nice music, strong voice actors. The gameplay itself (movement and interactions with each other etc.) was really smooth this time. 
Now for the main part: the puzzles. The basic principle of each puzzle stays the same of course: you try to solve something with your partner. This time they added new twists to the puzzles though, e.g. there were sound-based puzzles which not only challenged us to think differently but also resulted in very funny moments as you try to mimic the sounds. 
The only negative aspect of the game is that there is some buggy content which sometimes restricts you from solving the puzzles. After you lost all your braincells (and nerves!) trying to figure everything out and start retrying all the 'solutions' you've already tried before you finally realize the bug and eventually solve the puzzle.

It might be confusing for new players(especially if they don't follow it that much), but for fans, like us, it was really innovative and intriguing. The puzzles felt longer and more creative, combining aspects the previous games didn't have. Last but not least, [spoiler] we are both hyped that the story did not end!(Hyped already for the next one!!!) [/spoiler]

TLDR: If you have a pal and you would like to play something that combines an amazing story with a lot of background and creative puzzles that do not bore, this is the game you are looking for! Just make sure that you play the previous ones first, so the story makes sense. Trust me on this, it is TOTALLY worth it!",1656799136,1656799136,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is there if you are interested, though only the third game and this one had a whole lot of story to them. Before that it was little bits and pieces here and there.

We Were Here is no longer about working together to solve puzzles and escape. The focus is now on finding more and more convoluted ways to tell a story. The focus is about creating cryptic scenarios meant to be confusing because you don't have all the information. The focus is on story elements that have been blown so far out of proportion that the gameplay, puzzle design, performance, and overall experience have been sacrificed.

The puzzles are where I'll start. WWH 1 and 2 has some fantastic puzzles that were creative and engaging, providing challenge, intrigue, and a unique cooperative experience. I fondly remember struggling, and overcoming, the lava staircase, the king's play, and the minecart elevators from the previous game. These were moments when, step by step, my friend and I worked through the task we'd been set and succeeded. But these new puzzles are sedentary, and come off as exceedingly arbitrary. You'll find yourself in a room, you'll stay in that room until the puzzle is done, and once it is done you'll pop down the lane for another puzzle, because this game series has become a puzzle fetch quest. This makes each new puzzle a chore to be crossed off, not an exciting, mysterious trap left behind in the ruins of a crumbling kingdom.

This doesn't even touch on the performance issues. Some areas are nigh unplayable, with serious frame dropping and hard stuttering. You're telling me my computer will run Elden Ring without a hitch but your rip-off Donkey Kong pirate dock level is too much?

It's obvious how much the developers love these games because of all the heart and soul that has been put into improving each one. We Were Here Forever is the fourth installment and by far the best for many reasons which I will detail below. 

1. Playtime: It is the longest game in the series from my partner and I's experience, as we finished our first run in approximately 9 hours. Of course playtime can vary depending on the person you're playing with and how fast the two of you figure out the puzzles, but from playing all four games with the same person, We Were Here Forever took us the longest.

2. Puzzle Quality: Each puzzle in this game was an absolute blast to figure out. I love how complex the puzzles were, and how there were often so many more layers to the solution than originally anticipated. I've always enjoyed the puzzles in this series, but in this game they were definitely a cut above the rest. I won't say any more on this for fear of spoiling, but trust me, you'll be blown away by some of their designs.

3. Graphics: The graphics in this game are the best in the series by far. This is the only one of the games that I actually took screenshots in because of how pretty some of the scenes were. Overall it looked very polished while still keeping it's original feel and style. Due to these graphical updates, the experience of the game was very enhanced.

4. Achievement Hunting: As an achievement hunter, I love the way that the We Were Here games are designed when it comes to Steam achievements. Some puzzles have completely different roles, visuals, and deduction for each person playing, so the developers split the achievements for those puzzles into two separate ones. This encourages people to replay the game to get all the achievements and see all the puzzles from both sides. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING THIS FOR EACH OF THE WE WERE HERE GAMES. It's so cool to see each side of the different puzzles, and so much heart and soul was put into each one. I am glad that they did the same in this game, especially because each side of all the puzzles is a drastically unique experience I wouldn't want to miss.

Of course, as with any game, there are a few flaws that I wanted to mention in case the developers are looking for some constructive feedback:

1. Optimization: While the game has fairly simple graphics and I have a decently robust computer that does not struggle with graphically heavy games like Witcher 3, for example, the game lagged a good amount. It was usually in areas where things were loading up in the background, but the lagging was quite substantial. If the game was optimized a little better it might make the overall experience smoother.

2. The Lore: Honestly, even though I've paid attention to the lore in each of the games, by the end of the fourth game I am still extremely confused as to what is going on. There are a few details I am solid on, but most of it is pretty confusing. In saying this, I did enjoy the more story-based scenes in this game. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend the We Were Here series, especially We Were Here Forever. I'd recommend playing the other games first, in order, to get the full experience, but I just had to write a review for this game because of how much I was blown away.

Pros:
The graphics are gorgeous compared to some of the oldest titles, the world feels cool and immersive. I enjoyed the vast majority of the puzzles, which often had more flair than previous games where you would describe symbols to the other person over and over again. You can also steal stuff from your friend, as there is more choice in this game as to who goes where, and you get to spend more time in the same area than you did in previous titles. I really enjoyed being able to play rock paper scissors and make crude gestures at my friend.
Cons: 
Some of the cut scenes are egregiously long and frequent. Additionally, there were moments where you have to carry these big heavy things around for no reason, and they make you slower. The only plus here is you can steal it from your friend, so you just mess around with it for a long time rather than getting anything done. The ending was also a little disappointing in its unrealistic outcome, but it is a minor problem.

Overall, a great game. Biggest gripe is the wait time for cut scenes I don't care about, biggest plus is more freedom in who does which portions of the puzzles, something the other titles didn't have. 8.5/10, would recommend.",1656013358,1656013358,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would offer issues with gameplay but, sadly, the game doesn't even play as of writing this. Initially we made it to the second area of chapter 1 but encountered a game breaking bug where an important mine cart threw me out (and randomly my partner as well) so we could not go to the new set piece and progress through the puzzles. We tried many fixes and reached out for help with some limited feedback, repeatedly being sent a doc of common bug fixes, none of which seemed to apply to the in-game problem. Regardless, I decided to follow through with all their advice. Good news is I no longer have to worry about falling out of a mine cart because the game doesn't even open anymore. So that problem is technically solved. Upon opening the game, it now white screens and crashes, every time. 

I know making games is really difficult and this is a very recent release and I hope these issues eventually get addressed but there are just too many problems currently for people to play this game. Your ability to have a functioning game at all seems to be based on random chance. If these problems are solved and I can play past chapter 1, I'll be ecstatic to move on with my friend whom I kept needling to buy this so we can continue to enjoy the franchise.

This is the 4th game in the We Were Here series, and they just keep getting better. A friend and I made a series out of streaming Too, Together, and Forever, and I think we might need to replay this if TMG makes more of these games.

For my brain, this really is the perfect blend of puzzle-solving. I love games that encourage talking -- co-op games are fun because they’re social, after all. We Were Here Forever understands this, making both players independent and codependent in equal measure. But always together, solving big puzzles, where each player holds a unique piece. 

Ultimately, it’s a game about listening and sharing. 

The presentation is really well done too. It feels much more cinematic than the previous titles, just with how set pieces and puzzles are married. There’s some proper storytelling and themes baked into them too. There’s urgency. There’s moments of both awe and dread, as you figure out the scope of a task; suddenly understanding how all the moving parts fit together. 

Highly recommended if you enjoy co-op games, and have a partner at the ready.

There is too much time spent simply waiting through cut scenes, or having to slowly walk while carrying some random heavy objects. This is doubly frustrating when replaying for the achievements, because none of it can be skipped. The puzzles themselves are also grossly unbalanced. All but 2 of them felt like only one person was actually solving, while the other person just stood around waiting to press a button or place an item.
The story is shoved in your face, as your camera is literally dragged to follow whatever event is happening. This gets increasingly frustrating when having to redo a puzzle, or even just to try and replay the game to experience the other side.

My partner and I loved the first 3 games. The puzzles were unique, exciting, and both sides felt like equal participants in finding the solutions. They missed the mark on this game though, padding the runtime with unnecessary running back and forth and sitting through long dialogues. And the ending is equally unsatisfying, having no choice but for one of you to just sink after a certain amount of time. It would have been more enjoyable to have a secret way to both survive, since this if probably the last game of the series.

I would only recommend getting this game if you wanted to ""complete the series"", but if it's your first time playing these coop puzzle games, I would suggest playing through any of the previous games in the series. You will almost certainly have a better time with them.",1655584696,1655584696,False,16,1,0.492250710725784302,0,True,False,False

The game has some really smart and fun to play puzzles which I adored despite some minor bugs and confusion. Some of them remind me a lot of Alice Madness Returns stuff which I'm not sure is purposeful but feels quite nostalgic and the puzzles have pretty brilliant mind-bending twists to them as well. We've had lots of fun figuring these out with my partner as far.

There is a serious downside at the moment though. The game's graphics, interface and the slower character moving speed seem to have been designed VR style for some reason which is cool (maybe possible future updates?). However, the puzzle areas in the game are quite enormous in size which makes walking around and thus also solving some of the puzzles >incredibly slow<. And then some of the puzzles are also designed so you need to test different solutions before getting them right, which takes long too. Connect that with the bugs and it'll sometimes take you over an hour to solve a puzzle that'd otherwise take you max 15 min. That's very frustrating and can be a terrible waste of one's time. 

Don't get me wrong. I love the epic big scale environment designs and I can see what the devs were going for. But personally I think the mechanics and walking patches within that could be designed much better to save us walking long ways around same place multiple times.",1655043030,1655575762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a game I was looking forward to for a long time. The hype was real and I worried the game might not quite live up to it. However, I was wrong! We Were Here Forever completely lives up to the hype and is absolutely worth its full asking price!

That is, if you have a friend. Just one friend, that's all you really need. Keep that in mind.

Like the previous games in the series, We Were Here Forever places two players in the boots of arctic explorers trapped in a mysterious castle, taunted by a wicked jester and wondering what dark tale might have revolved around the mad king and his ruined, snowbound realm.

Communication is key, as the game requires players to talk, relay information and guide one another through the various puzzles and challenges the game presents. I won't say much on the puzzles, other than that there is a wide variety of them. Any player will probably like some more than others, and I can think of one puzzle I particularly disliked myself. However, no puzzle overstays its welcome too badly, and thus has no chance to sour the experience, as the next puzzle then takes over and the players get to move on to new adventures.

Communication is also made a little more challenging and thoughtful by the radios used in the game, as when one player is transmitting, they cannot hear the other, and if both players transmit at the same time, they block each other out and cannot communicate at all! Now, sure, you could work around this by using voice comms outside of the game, but I'd recommend against such a workaround, as it will remove a key element of tension and challenge from the game.

The game has evolved from its predecessors in pretty much all areas. The tech, the visuals, the sound and music are all improved with each iteration. The odd accents (Dutch, I think, maybe?) of the voice actors might throw you off, but this is easily justified by the story and locale of the game. In some places, mostly around are transitions, even my beefy gaming PC started to experience some slowdown, but this also remained brief and never took place in areas where time or precision was of the essence.

A key note I can't help but reiterate, though: this game is good, but it can only be as good as the connection you have with your co-player. There is an option to play with random strangers, but personally this does not feel like a good method for playing a game such as this. Find a friend, grab a radio and get puzzling!

[b] what i like: [/b]
[list]
    [*]variation of puzzles, and more hours of gameplay
    [*]atmospheric environment
    [*]damned legendary well-made dialogues
    [*]best ending in the series (in my opinion ofc)
    [*]consistent fps (but low) though sometimes it has drop issues between new areas
    [*]it had some unique and nice puzzles
[/list]

[b] what i dislike: [/b]
[list]
    [*]poor optimization, and yet i feel we were here together had better graphics
    [*]low fps
    [*]some puzzles are totally bad, like the worst in the series, and sadly there are quite a few of them in this game
    [*]the game has kind of two roles with strict rules, explorer and library guy (aka the one who explains how to solve the puzzle), and the problem is when you are the explorer, you rarely got anything to do if the the library guy didnt understand the situation. i feel like i didnt explain it well but long story short explorer was way much better in previous games.
    [*]in the previous sequences, especially we were here together, sometimes you kinda chose your role, and sometimes it is already chosen for you (which is nice for variation) but now it is more like either 50% chance or your freedom to choose, which i feel isnt suiting the game.

First half of the game (up until the moment you have to go to 3 different places to get parts for the machine) was great, amazing even. Definitely the best this series ever had to offer. Puzzles were interesting and level design was great. 

Then you had to get those three parts and the quality of puzzles just drops drastically. It seems as if their goal in puzzle design turned from ""Engaging puzzles requiring cooperation"" to your generic logic puzzles.
 
First one on the cementery wasn't terrible, just kind of meh compared to the previous ones.
Second one in the mountains, again just worse compared to the previous ones.

But the third one in the nautilus was just god awful. Underwater walk was just boring for one player who barely got to do anything. Both pipes and that underwater garden can go fuck themselves. And that god damn kraken. I've spent so much time on that kraken and finally decided to look up how to solve it. And wouldn't you know, I've been doing what you're meant to do but the game just doesn't work properly. You literally have to look up the solution because the game is bugged and you cannot do it properly.

Besides that in game voice chat was bugged like hell. And Ending was really disappointing.

I really don't want to mark this as ""recommended""  because you can't get passed a certain point on your own due to a bug, but that first part of the game was really phenomenal enough to justify the price tag, so I'm gonna do anyway (Just know what you're getting into)",1655159558,1655159558,True,1,0,0.479452043771743774,0,True,False,False

Some interesting puzzles in this one though I have to say, some of them were painful to get through. This game felt like it has so much filler cut scenes just to get from one place to another and not for the sake of loading. 

Constantly having to carry something back and forth for no particular reason was so draining. The only thing we found entertaining when locked in these cut scenes was to use the emote wheel which I'm thankful they had. There's something so funny about pointing to your teammate during serious voice acting.

During the grave digging puzzle, we had to reload the game several times as it kept bugging out. There were numerous bugs during our playthrough and my friend also stopped getting any of the achievements for whatever reason.

The portal puzzle in particular was really fun and different. The potion making one would have been better without the time limit in my opinion as it took a few frustrating attempts. The mirror rotation was fun to put together. The majority of the rest were just painful and I honestly think we finished them out of spite.

Tons of fun, didn't notice any bugs, and the game looks and feels great.
I got annoyed at two or three parts of you walking or riding a ski lift for a prolonged amount of time, but it doesn't happen too much, so you'll get back to the action soon enough.

It feels somewhat shorter than the previous one, most of time was spent in cut-scenes.  The design of the game is amazing and very well made.  However me and my friend do like some challenging puzzles, were you will have to sit and think for awhile, or racing your heart out due to the timer running out and you are about to die and fail your perfect streak for that zero deaths achievement you were working on. 

So puzzles were way too easy. Also they were not changing when you failed and had to do  it again, so one some of the puzzles you could just press each item until you knew the correct 3, as the game were never changing the correct one up. So was pretty boring in the end.  

 Were expecting it to get harder and harder the further in the game you got, instead it turned out to be the the other way around, with some puzzles you barely had to think as you already had the obvious answer in your head. 

Also was expecting a grand final, with a pretty hard puzzle, instead you got to a room where you did not have to do anything except a few short tasks,  so the room was completed is less than 3 minutes or so.

I hope the next We Were Here game will be a lot more challenging and also way longer, we mostly finished it the same sitting and both came out rather disappointed. We both wanted a way more challenging and longer game. 

So to sum it all up,  the game was fun and looks gorgeous, but way too easy to play and not long enough.    3/5  stars",1655027652,1655027867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a real mixed bag, the art has improved greatly over each game, but the story has become more annoying, puzzles range from great, to something I never want to touch again and the game actively wastes time to pad the runtime. There is also a number of bugs that you will come across. 

I am glad this game exists for the 2 player puzzle genre, it's great to have it as an option but at many times this game has been infuriating to play through. Sometimes, the puzzles are obtuse but generally it's traversal and story that really weigh it down. EG. There is a collect x amount of this and place it elsewhere section of the game and it is so slow to do so, it felt like a waste of time. This combined with transitional cut scenes that take far too long make the game really drag.

Also there has been a large amount of bugs, for example, I've finished the game but stopped getting achievements after half way through - the result of another bug earlier in the game where lack of clarity and bugginess, forced us to reload, sequence breaking what was meant to happen. Another example, I stood in front of my partners exit point and it broke their cut scene, forcing a reload because it locked them in place even after I moved.

The puzzle gameplay itself was very solid, a rather broad array of different puzzle types that combined logical and spatial thinking as well as rudimentary problem solving skills all combined for a rather enjoyable experience. 

That said while I do sing the games praises I do also admit that it has some flaws that could be improved upon. There were three particular problems I had with the game as a whole.

1 - The general pacing of the game. Once you hit the ""free roam pick your path"" segment it feels like the game wastes a fair chunk of your time with excessive travel and transitions. Like, come on, a five minute gondola ride through terrain that was basically identical the whole way?

2 - The final puzzle in the water section. [spoiler]While I do understand the concept behind this puzzle I think it would have been much better to just have both players up front being able to hear sounds and work on the translation together instead of one person trying to replicate sounds. We weren't able to get the creature sounds to come through the walkie-talkies so we ended up resorting to just some screen sharing to have sounds shared between us. The idea of the puzzle was great, the execution not so much.[/spoiler]

3 - The ending, god the ending. Big spoilers here. [spoiler]The final tower puzzle was fun and felt frantic (even though there was no real time limit) and it was an interesting way to see the story concluded for the King and the Jester. But did you really have to go for a Titanic in the section afterwards? It felt so arbitrarily forced and pushed that only one of them could survive on the little raft. Both of them could have clutched onto it or one sat and held the other steady or something and let's not forget that in the underwater section one of the survivors will have been in sub-freezing temperature water for a good ten to thirty minutes for the mines puzzle. Overall the forced death in the finale left a very sour taste in my mouth. It sincerely felt like after this long, perilous journey together we would finally get a happy ending with the conclusion of the story, only to have it very cruelly ripped away from us for no real reason.[/spoiler]

Despite my complaints though I would still recommend this game for those of you who are looking for a good co-op puzzle adventure. If you're going to play this I seriously recommend that you go back and start with the original We Were Here and work through the entire series to get a better grasp and understanding of the overarching story.",1654527526,1654527526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ending sucked. Just like....again? I get that it's a theme for the franchise that one of you dies but after everything that goes on in the game and the increased contact for the people you'd expect a way to both get out alive, especially as the only thing keeping one of the players alive at the end is basically a door. Which there were plenty of that should be floating about. Instead it pulls a Titanic where one must die cause the door is too small. Which...it isn't really.

Each title grew on the experience of the puzzle escape room-esque environment and, in my opinion, got better each game. I must say my initial views on the franchise as a whole were bleak but this was well before i stepped into the world - a classic example of not judging a book by its cover!

This next one in the series was just wonderful. From the start backtracking through Castle Rock through new environments and puzzles all the way to the end of the final chapter we were encapsulated. I also loved the 'ah-hah' moments we had coming into each puzzle. Overthinking was our biggest flaw, but the game didnt punish with 99% puzzle completion resets or deaths. Instead we were encouraged to rethink our position, read the clues multiple times, swap perspectives, and come to the conclusion together.

Bugs we experienced in this game to this end: During the final sequence of the Underwater section of the Nautilus section (encountering the creature) after a failed attempt, and then a role change, the console which imitated the sounds bugged out, stopped displaying the codes all together, and also played the same sounds for every dial rotation. Fortunately, since this was the second time we played this section, we remembered the questions and were able to answer correctly, but others may not be as fortunate.

I am extremely excited to have read that there may be more coming, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to immerse myself in this franchise. Keep up the wonderful work guys and thanks for keeping this series running!",1654417959,1654417959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that said there were some small issues I had with the game. I have seen a few mentions of these things and wanted to reiterate them because they were kind of annoying from a player perspective.

1. There was a lot of walking or travel from puzzle to puzzle. It felt so unnecessary. It was long for the sake of being long and it really ruined the immersion. You couldn't do anything during these times so it led to picking up my phone or changing screens till the game decided it was ready for me. Some of these times there was story line which felt much better but usually it was just silence.

2. Some puzzles felt very lopsided. While I enjoyed some of these puzzle a great deal others left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Some were so one sided that if you weren't the one solving the puzzle there was nothing you could do but sit and wait. It was a bit annoying when all the information was with one player and not split between both in a way that was fun for both.

That said I'm glad I bought this game and it was well worth the wait from the last one. I really did enjoy it overall and the little things weren't enough to make me dislike it in anyway.",1654310155,1654310155,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the pacing is absolutely awful. All of the cutscenes that move character between areas take 3x as long as they should, and a lot of the game feels like they artificially extended the playtime through pointless walking and waiting.

And second, too many of the puzzles had an imbalance of information, to the point where one person was doing 90% of the thinking and problem solving, and the other person was just bored waiting until they could test the possible solutions.

Lastly, the optimization was terrible. I have a VERY solid PC, and the underwater level was still a permanent ~20 fps the entire time we were there. This is pretty unacceptable from a studio that has already released multiple titles.

Overall, it was still a decent game, but because of these issues it left a bad taste in my mouth and so I feel the negative review is warranted.",1654053578,1654091276,False,65,6,0.597814738750457764,9,True,False,False

This happens when we are playing the ""spin-your-room"" puzzle, where we have to rotate our room to create a portal by matching icons on the two sides of adjacent rooms. In the second part of this puzzle chapter, there exist two versions of world: Outer world (with key, egg, sun rooms, etc) and inner world (with bird skull, moon room, etc). 

When the players approach the end of the puzzle, player A will find himself in the clown-wand room of inner world and he can get to the key room of outer world with the help of player B (Note that the player B is currently at a ghost-mask room of inner world). Then player B goes to the crowned-grenade room by himself. Now player A should help player B to get to bird-skull room, and then player A goes to egg room WITHOUT the help of the other. Then, after a few steps, the puzzle is solved.

The failure of the game design is: When player A gets to the key room, he can go to egg room and then to the final room by himself. Imagine that you are the player A and you quickly get to the key then to egg then to final room by yourself, but then the other player says ""hey I still need you help"". Then you realize you should help player B to get the bird-skull room before you entering the egg room. You want to get back but you cannot because there is no way out in the final room. In this situation, you and your friend are hard-locked in the game. You are locked in the final room and your friend is locked in the crowned-grenade room. This is a big failure of design and you have to start from the very beginning of the first part of the puzzle with pentagon rooms. 

I have to doubt if there exist any other design failure that cause hard lock or soft lock of game process. If the developers think this is not a failure this is a feature, then I have to give a negative review.",1653972766,1653973571,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

As the games continued, I got more immersed, the story got more intriguing, more sweet yet haunting. There were some really frightening moments, some moments where I felt control torn from me entirely and yet it all was fascinating.

I have played with him all chapters from the series and I have to say that a lot has improved, especially the graphics. The team behind this series of games is very passionate and competent. 
My only criticism is that sometimes the game can be a little bit glitchy.

Also, not being able to jump on objects can be a little frustrating.

With previous installments in the series, knowing that you were set on one role made the game feel as though it was one sided. Through the first two games in the genre, you would either be one role of telling another player what to do, or you would be the other role of explaining the puzzle to the one trying to figure it out. And through the third, they had tried to branch and even out the roles where both players are working through a puzzle together, and gave a good short story to add on top of it. 

The forth game has been an amazing summary of the positives in the series to date. Working through a problem together instead of a explanation-solution is extremely satisfying. The puzzles felt really enjoyable to solve and work through, similar to the third game in the series, and trying to replicate and explain noises to a friend for one of the puzzles was extremely hilarious and makes me want to experience more of these kinds of puzzle co-op adventures. I think the story is fantastic, and makes me wonder if the next game in the series will be called ""We Were Here Forevermore"".

If anyone hasn't played through the 3rd game, I would highly suggest going through that game before trying out this one. I would say it is about an hour or two less in length, however it still has a similar format to what I've talked about above. This game has a great story that builds upon the third one, and I feel as if the 3rd and 4th game in the series was a great turn into massive improvements on the series as a whole.

Puzzles? Fantastic!
First playthrough time with a friend? Almost 10 hours (The 3rd game in the series was around 6-7, I think.)

Very well constructed puzzles, relying on communication, but not saying so, often hinting at this requirement for such puzzles. Never punishing for not meeting the time constraint, only taking a portion of your time to reset as opposed to having to reload from a checkpoint.

All the puzzles were visually stunning, and the story element was amazing! The fluid splitting of puzzles, flowing between being together and being apart while dividing up tasks was very well handled.

Some of the control handling such as inventory felt very slightly clunky, but not problematic (it would flick to the end then the start when using a mouse wheel)

Overall a very nice story leave off, even if it was a bit short compared to the other games, but 7-11 hours is not bad for a series finale which has a good track record (except for we were here too, sorry), BUT it still has a cliff hanger to it...

I was expecting both characters to survive due to the standard endings of the other games ending in only one making it out, however this ending was very obvious. However, the game play was interesting and the puzzles were very different to the puzzles we had seen previously. I wouldn't expect them to make another game, but I do hope they release some sort of final cinematic to see the POV of the surviving player. This would be a welcome addition to the series as I feel it would fully conclude the mysterious lore.

The We Were Here series was never a technically impressive series of games but this game was a vast improvement over the previous entries. However, my friend and I have experienced a few technical issues with the game.  Between hitching, player collision with environment, and a soft lock, it was not an environment I wanted to explore, as frame rates would decrease greatly depending where I went.

It is worth noting that my pc is on the lower-end and while it is entirely playable, I would expect a game with a simpler graphics style to perform better, especially with how many loading screens the game puts you through. (With lowest settings, I averaged 60 frames, dropping to 30-40 in some areas.)

The story is more or less easy to follow, the animations and voice acting giving much life to the player characters and the Jester.  However, as this is a co-op game, it is hard to follow what is going on with the story as you banter with your friend, sometimes overlooking what the story may be trying to say.  

The puzzles are the best in the series, avoiding many of the pitfalls of the previous games (particularly the decreased usage of ""symbol-to-symbol-to-action"" style puzzles), instead focusing on a mixture of physical movement and brain teaser style puzzles.  However, with this experimentation, we found that some puzzles were much better than others.  Notably, there is a part of the game where you must relay sound to your teammate, and he must be able to interpret that and give you something in return.  While unique, it was so difficult to relay that it resulted in me just putting my headphones against my microphone for him to actually hear the sounds.  I could not imagine this experience with someone who was deaf or hard of hearing.

Game design was overall good with some odd decisions.  In a part of the game where you are given the ability to choose the next area, you are told to bring back several objects back to an area to progress the plot.  However, to bring these objects back required both people, one of which was slowed down by carrying the object.  It was then followed (several times) by a 50 second sequence of waiting, putting the item where it belonged, and then going [b] back [/b], waiting another 50 seconds, which finally ended with starting the next area.  At certain points we just wished to get to the next area and move on.

There were also several points where we were just sitting in a cut scene of sorts for minutes at a time.  The worst instance was a 3 minutes wait where there was no music, no dialogue, or anything intractable.  They were infrequent but noticeable.

There was, however, a remarkable puzzle that really brought out the best in the team's capabilities.  I won't spoil it, but you will know it when you get there.  There were quite a few enjoyable puzzles that, while frustrating at first, had good payoff as we slowly solved it.

TLDR:  Great game.  Playable, but poor performance on lower-end machines.  Story is good, but nothing revolutionary.  Puzzles and interaction with friend alone make this game worth it.  Occasional, odd game design that you will sometimes just have to ignore.

The level designs, specifically Nautilus and the Music Box, are all incredible. And the fact that you meet up with your friend and stick with them for large portions of the game makes it all better, and more emotional at the end of the game. I've truly never had a game make me sad before. Nothing in story got me so invested as this game did. When I woke up the morning after I finished the game with my friend, I decided to watch the ending scenes again, and I just cried when I saw them. If you are looking for a puzzle-solving, emotional, and overall fantastic adventure with a friend, then the we were here series is undoubtedly the best series for you.",1653662721,1653662721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

END OF EDIT

I would recommend this game if you enjoyed the previous games, however I will warn you that it's currently kind of buggy, or at least needs so level of clarification or refinement of some puzzles as presenting information to one person ""sometimes"" is less helpful than not at all.

[spoiler] the kraken section, the player in the main section of the pod is unable to hear the kraken consistently (sometimes he'll hear one or two parts of it, sometimes he'll hear none of it (at not point is he able to hear all of it)) expecting people to mimic or describe audio presented is unrealistic) 

The section after that has directional audio for the radio for some reason causing it to be really hard to hear each other when farther away. (also the radio suddenly became two-way, in other words when both people held down the button both were able to hear the other, not sure if this was intentional.

 There was also the bug where the digging the snow areas wasn't possible

After countless restarts and re-invites it just sometimes starts working again. Will give this game thumbs up once mic sound is fixed to be more stable (My Discord and mic sound works fine in any other application, also tried closing all other applications that use the mic, does not seem to help).

[b]The actual review[/b]
We were here forever continues in the same way the previous games do, you use the walkie talkie and guide each other through puzzles that require both parties in order to succeed.

The environment is nice to look at but mostly static and the only thing you can interact with is the puzzles, the game can sometimes feel a bit slow as the music is slow and some of the puzzles leaves you in the same spot for maybe a bit too long.

So, for good parts:
[list]
[*][b] Puzzles [/b]
All of the puzzles are unique and fun to solve. Some puzzles can be tricky, but in a good way (wwh:together had some confusing puzzles, that just felt easy, but long to solve because of lots of back & forth)

[*][b] Story[/b]
Also this game has content as all of the previous parts combined and even more! Story, that you have seen unfold in previous chapters finally came together. Yes, the story is not that compicated, but still a really solid one. You understand much more about the lore, all of the characters that had some roles in the background and now are seen as real characters and not just dudes from paintings or such.

[*][b] Music [/b]
It's simple good. Not something that you will listen outside of the game, but it's great in settting atmoshpere of the scene.

[*][b] Graphics [/b]
Okay, graphics are great. Some of the locations are stunning to watch [spoiler]like under the sea[/spoiler]~ 
But... bugs 
Yeah... this game only came out, so it was expected. So, hope optimization will be fixed in some of the next updates. From the good side, most of the bugs still didn't ruin the gameplay, so yep

Story seems great, puzzles are decent, but due to bugs and performance issues this is not a worth buy until patches come out.

There is now a current bug that many people are experiencing in which infinite invites are sent to one person, not allowing them to properly join most of the time, and when they do... the invite screen is permanently stuck so they cannot click or play anywhere outside the window when the game launches.   Therefore barring my friend and I continuing our play-through or really playing the game at all.

I understand the studio is small and has a lot on their plate right now, but realistically just wait until you release in order to have a decent product... Sorry if this is harsh but just upset with how enjoyable and clean the 3 other iterations in this series felt in comparison.",1652410781,1653520860,False,4,0,0.481830418109893799,0,True,False,False

The game is expensive for what it is.

Side gameplay:
The first half of the game is nice, but many puzzles suffer from a problem: Only one player solves the puzzle, the other just follows. It's annoying to be the second. Small mention of the jester's universe that we liked.
The other half alternates between puzzles that are as boring as possible and require the description of complex images (The city, I think of you and your shitty projector...), elevator phases without cinematics, loading to put an object and then going back through the same loading...
The vault is nice, but the sound of the revenants is HORRIBLE, the nautilus is fun (really) but the phase with the sounds was a purge (unless you can transmit the sounds with the talkie, I do not know, we used discord)

Scenery:
The scenery is either in near total darkness or forgettable. Except for the Nautilus, we really liked these sets! To a lesser extent, the jester's world is an honorable mention, but nothing crazy either.

Lore:
The little story we experienced fits on a postage stamp, while it was developed over almost twice as long as the previous one. I personally also find it hard to make the link with the previous opus.

Bugs :
Quite a few bugs. Cinematics that get stuck, white screens that stay 2 centuries during some loading, interaction that gets stuck... We honestly had a hard time finishing it.

The end:
[spoiler]Why did you make this stupid remix of titanic? We spent 5 minutes pulling each other out of the water and not understanding anything before the game decided I had to die. It's stupid, why would you want to kill one of the players? And why couldn't we just stand two on the damn board?! In the previous games, it added drama, betrayal and all that... Here, it's just ""nope lol"", the game is over, the kingdom is destroyed, we'll never come back for sure, what was stopping us from just fading to black after helping our colleague to get on the raft and hear the ship? I don't understand this ending.
Not to mention the final mission that had absolutely EVERYTHING that indicated that we were in a hurry, the king getting angry, the epic music, the tower being ripped apart by the king... But nothing. Paradoxically, it was the easiest puzzle of the game since it was almost exclusively about pulling levers. In fact, there were only levers. It's kind of like in ""We were here Together"", at the end, the jester looked at us while we were doing the knight puzzles and decided who was going to be sacrificed.

By the way, is it just me or is the jester technically the protagonist of the game? When you think about it, he manipulates us during the whole game to assemble the magic ray, HE uses us to carry the piece of contract that he HIMSELF put on us, and we're not even the ones destroying the castle. Basically, he don't even need us, since he basically do whatever he want and speak privately with us without the king noticing.[/spoiler]

The scale and quality of this game is amazing. Shame that it kinda worked massively against it.

Ignoring all the bugs (which can make some puzzles unplayable; like the sound wheel with the kraken just not working or the puzzle pipes actually giving us the wrong pipes (the 1st puzzle gave us 3 of 1 and 1 of the other. We both thought we were missing something, but it was just the game not working)) and some parts being very slow to load. Or that you have to do sooo much walking. Like, why have the ski-lift be so long for what reason? Wasting time? Like this game did? Even ignoring that the story builds up to nothing having the jester this big threat, and then he says ""Darn you foiled my plans"" after trying to stop you once...

No, the one part that really fails this game is the puzzles. It does have some fun puzzles but half of the ""puzzles"" in this game are not puzzles at all. The last part where you aim the laser is just flick switches in order with no real fear of doing anything wrong. So there are two problems that occur in most puzzles. It's either very one sided, where you never really feel like both players are working together or you have puzzles that are very linear with no real way of messing it up.  This game tried to make the scale huge, and in doing so, they lost the ability to make focused and planned puzzles. 

Some examples:
The Laser ""puzzle"" at the end - It's just find the switches and flick them in order. No fail condition if you somehow did anything wrong here
Piano puzzle - The guy with the cards solves everything. Piano guy just waits for inputs
Graves - The puzzle never changes. You can brute force it with ease
Scuba diver - The scuba diver is in a ""maze"" with like no way of not going the right way. Does nothing than just let the other guy do all the work
Resistance leaders - I like how this gives the answer to the previous puzzle for no reason. Anyway, you can just look from above and easily use logic to get the answer",1653507315,1653507315,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Total Mayhem Games always manages to blow my expectations, I mean sure the Game is not perfect, has some flaws like missing animations when you turn a wheel with your Friend and look over to him or no step and landing sounds when you keep jumping repeatedly, bad FPS and performance in certain Areas (which i think already got fixed), but if you can look over small things like that you will have much fun playing this Game.
I really love the overall Atmosphere and the Way they present It to you in all those different Parts of the World.
For me, my favourite Part was when [spoiler] the Jester locked you in his little Box and especially the Part where you were surrounded by all the different platforms 360 degrees around you, playing with your perspective [/spoiler]
The riddles were far more varied than the ones in the previous Games, some where easier and some really had you thinking for a while.
Overall, I think the Game was a great success and my friend and I are already looking forward to what might come next, we are 100% going to play it on release :)

I've been disappointed. It's got a great theme, and it can really immerse you with its story, but the puzzles themselves broke our immersion, and sometimes broke our game. WWH's core mechanic does follow in this game: a ""librarian"" who holds all of the information, and an ""adventurer"" who follows instruction and explains what they're seeing. It is, however, impossible to tell which you are going into before you enter the area with the puzzle.

This can lead to many one-sided puzzles where one person is telling the other person what to do the whole way through. Not all puzzles were like this, but there were enough that it left the adventurer bored staring at one thing while the librarian did all the thinking.

There were 2 instances in which something malfunctioned, and we ended up being unable to progress because of it. And no, it wasn't because we missed something.

This fourth game is substantially longer than the first three games, and the world is beautiful, the scenery much more vast and immersive than in the previous games (although WWHT was gorgeous too) and the puzzles very diverse and entertaining. A few were absolutely unique and made for a wonderfully frustrating and challenging experience.

I definitely missed the pressure, too; in this one no lava slowly rising to the grate you're standing on, no winding steps slowly giving away beneath your feet.

Things I appreciated in this installment include the change in and variety of puzzles. We overthought some puzzles, we easily destroyed others, we were happily challenged by yet more puzzles, and we discovered I am not great with visuals. Between this game and the previous ones there has been a nice decrease in the number of times I had to describe three similar looking squiggly lines with excruciating details or ask the pivotal question ""What color is his hair, though?"" only to determine I might have a touch of colorblindness. Even if I did not love every puzzle, this game has a great medley and, very happy to say, we generally felt successful after solving each puzzle instead of confused as to what we did to win.

I will say that on a few occasions, and maybe this is just my experience, it felt as though I encountered the majority of the ""sit and wait for the other person to solve the puzzle for you"" problem. In previous games, this was fairly well balanced in that the person with the answers switched back and forth regularly. With players choosing their own path frequently in this game, it may happen more often that find yourself waiting patiently for your partner to solve the puzzle while you twiddle your thumbs. Again, this was purely happenstance in that I happened to pick the path that lead to being the errand boy while my friend solved things. In general, I felt happy knowing I had some amount of choice in where to go and what to do.

Finally, let me admit the story falls flat for me. While I would need to replay each game in succession before solidifying this opinion, I do not see much solid connection between the previous three games' story and the conclusion of this one. Honestly, the story contained within WWHF seems oddly disjointed at times, or at least rushed and ill planned. The story does add to the overall experience of the game, something the game can't do without, but the plot does not integrate with the story the way it does in games like the Myst series, where Myst almost explains why the puzzles exist in the first place. In the WWH series, you get story, you get puzzle, but you rarely see any relation between the two elements (rarely, because there is sometimes a connection, such as the play at the end of the first game). [spoiler] PLUS THEY SHAFT YOU ONCE MORE AT THE END FOR GOOD MEASURE NOT THAT I'M BITTER. [/spoiler]

All in all, great series if you have a friend to play with who also enjoys puzzles. I genuinely will miss this series if this is the last installment, but will 100% keep an eye on this publisher.",1653355973,1653355973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Upscaling/Lag
====================
 - The devs try to make the areas ""bigger"" in this game, which made everything very laggy when loading in new sections (Which happen as you play, no loading screens). Most of these open areas are just filled with walkways on the way to the next puzzle. However there is one section that was laggy even after loading; The Moonlight Section. This part would lag if you ever faced the direction the light was coming from.


Puzzle Imbalance:
==========================
- This game has too many puzzle that have one player actually doing a puzzle and the other standing around, waiting for input or to update the other player on color/noise/symbol changes. While the other games had puzzles like this, due to players being forced onto certain paths, the developers were able to balance out which side of the puzzle each player was on, but in this game, you and your partner are always together so there's no knowing which side of the puzzle you'll be on. If you're as unlucky as I am, you will be stuck on the waiting around side of puzzles more often than not.


Buildup to Nothing: SPOILERS
=============================
 - There is a moment halfway through the game where one player gets a scrap from a satanic contract strapped to their arm. With how the other games played out, my friend and I expected this to play a major part in the finale of the game, but it's only for a cut-scene at the end and plays no other part.
 - There's also a moment where the king commands the jester to come attack the players before a three way split to different sections that we would be doubling back to in order to complete each section. We expected the jester to start coming after us and put more of a time trail on the puzzles going forward, getting increasingly harder after each section, but the jester never shows up.
 - There's also a few puzzles early on that have no consequence if you fail, but when you when the Jester says something along the lines of ""I didn't expect you to get through that one alive."" This made my friend and I think that there was going to be a Chapter 3 to the game in which the Jester takes over the redoes the first puzzles but makes them more dangerous or have some sort of twist to them. But these puzzles never show up again.


The Good Bits:
=====================
 - The Music Box was a really fun series of puzzles that had the players working in the same space, having to communicate and do things together in order to solve the puzzles.
 - There's a brief puzzle with an orange and blue light that had both players sharing an inventory of pipes and using logic to get the lights to the correct output.
 - The Potion-Making puzzle was very fun in how we had to deal with such limited resources together and a time limit. It requires the players to take a step back and plan out their moves before restarting.
 - These types of puzzles are what this game sorely needed more of. More puzzles of both players using logic, strategy, and planning to make it through different areas.",1653318122,1653318814,False,1,0,0.491071432828903198,0,True,False,False

-Game freezing making the players jump so far in the air getting them stuck behind structures or making them fall from the map
-Opening doors pushing the players inside the walls
-Bug making the player fall through the gap between the bridges (i think it was in the 1st chapter in the maze part), making it impossible to complete the level
-Getting softlocked in the jester's dice puzzle by allowing one player to cross the portal to the purple doors while the other one is stuck
-Game not giving players enough pipes in nautilus level or giving them the wrong ones making it impossible to complete the puzzle without the reset
-Disappearing sounds in the nautilus lvl (the translating of the kraken sounds). It randomly makes one of three necessary sounds every 30 seconds. From what i've read people say on the forums it's clear that's a bug. It's possible to complete the lvl without the reset but it's extremely annoying.
-Bugged voice chat (found it in the level after the kraken one, but can probably be found in any other part of the game), making it so both players hear the other one only in one headphone and also both players can speak simultaneously.

However the devs were really onto it and fixed everything as soon as they could, I know my partner wasn't taking any of the shit the first few days but then we both realised something in our hearts. We are the smartest, and the funniest, and the best, and the only ones who should be together in such desperate measures.

The best part about smashing out a game so early is that there is no walkthrough, meaning that everything we did was legitty on our titties, which leads me to believe that our brain patterns have been altered, what if we are both genetically engineered to begin with?

I remember playing the first game several times and not knowing about how deep the lore actually went, but when my partner came along for the first time, the one I was destined to be with, I just knew that the one I had been waiting for had finally come, and I opened my eyes for the first time to see how good the lore actually is. As I write this review, I know my partner wants more of this, whether its part of the same series or not, as long as we keep getting more.

I have a bad feeling however that this is the last game of the We Were Here series, they say that all good things must come to an end, however I do know one thing is for sure. This door closes for me, but it has made way for another one to open, the path that I must walk with my partner. And I know that I definitely won't be treading off this path, no matter how long it is I will always stand by my partners side, this series has prepared us for the toughest obstacles that we can now face on our own.

I was asked several times by a few of my friends, ""Who is this mysterious partner you keep referring to? And why are they so perfect?"" Perhaps one day I may reveal this partner, however all I can say for now, is that my partner was a very unlikely one, and that I would have never foreseen being with them like this.

Just the thought of me and my partner having been through so much together, seeing each other leave one behind, as one of us turns our backs and keeps walking, getting separated and coming back to each other. I do know that if I was ever met with a choice similar to the series in the real world, I know what I would pick. But I would not think of them as the ""Worst Friend Forever"". After all, I was always first to get left behind or die each time, and I don't plan on changing the outcome.

All that matters to me is my partners happiness, but how can I make someone happy when they are faced with such a difficult choice? If the time ever comes, I hope that my partner will understand what I have done, and that everything I did was to make this special someone happy. I do know that our ups heavily outweigh our downs, and that is enough for me. I sleep easy at night knowing that the choices I have made for my partner will keep a smile on their face.

To think that in the little time I had with my partner, it feels like we have known each other for years, decades, centuries, hell even eons. There will always be a place in my heart for my partner, whether we drift apart in the future, or if we end up staying together. I know damn well that I prefer the latter of that sentence, but I will keep this up as a memory, so that I may never forget the amazing times I had with my partner. We will tell everyone indeed that We, Were, Here.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This sucks to write due to the fact that when the game works, it's fucking amazing.

BUT, it is basically unplayable in its current state. Spoiler warning ahead:

My partner and I have to play this in multiple sessions due to time constraints. This was working perfectly fine until we progressed to the graveyard level. Every time she tried to load into that level she would be met with a black screen. We tried all the fixes in the book and they did not work. This meant that we had to progress without saves. Seemed to be working fine, we finished the Graveyard section and placed the part in the.. gun? We then progressed to the Kraken puzzle. We ended the session there and then started again the next day. Once completing the Kraken puzzle I was locked in the room and we were unable to progress as the doors to the control room shut too fast. We restarted and then the levers to finish the Kraken level did not work. We restarted again. They worked that time and we progressed to the potion making. We finished the potion making and got the next part. Upon reaching the gun where the part goes in, we noticed that that part we previously had gotten from the graveyard level no longer existed. We then went back to the Graveyard level to try and complete it again and apon falling into the well, I was unable to pick up the pickaxe. Meaning we can not progress again. Not only that but the host is the only one who can hear sound effects on the graveyard level?

The puzzles are AMAZING and this is by far the best We Were Here game so far (I have played them all).. BUT.. it's basically unplayable in it's current state. We were fine with quickly re-playing the level but we are blocked again and again by bugs in the game hardlocking us into a restart.",1652665480,1653271249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

pros: the co-op for these puzzles actually feel needed, sounds weird to put this here I know but my biggest grip with the last entry was this exact problem so figured it would be good to put it here. the other big grip of previous titles they fixed in this one is that the story actually feels like it happens throughout the whole run time, while in previous titles its felt like its all loaded into the last chapter

moving onto more generally notes, the puzzles all have fairly fun and unique ways of going about them, with 1 or 2 outliers that I'll talk about in the cons. the sound designs pretty great in this one as well as the visuals, with the story being fairly engaging.

cons: for starters the biggest con is those outlier puzzles I was talking about, there puzzles that end up over staying there welcome or just have frustrating design in the first place, which if me and my co-op partner hadn't already played through the previous titles probably would have left at them [spoiler] devs if your reading this please in future titles stop having sound based puzzles like the guardian puzzle, like how the hell do you expect me to explain 5 different kinds of whale noises to my partner [/spoiler] then other than that maybe could use with reorganization of puzzles as a few late game puzzles felt quite easy to have been so far into the games progression",1653257019,1653257019,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are some pointless time wasters(riding on the lift, walking through long random corridors) and a few of the puzzles feel as though one person has all the information/tasks and the other person is just chilling for a while thinking, 'I wish my partner would hurry up.' Ultimately though, I didn't notice those much because I was having a great time with the puzzles. There's a bunch of innovative weird solutions. The storyline was interesting, and more goal oriented than the other installations, where you are just trying to escape through a bizarrely circuitous route through the castle.

They have outdone themselves regarding visuals, puzzles and mind boggling solutions. Of course you can also play this if you havent played the previous installments but its suggested to understand the story a little more and maybe get a feeling for how these games are played. 
Chefs kiss at the jester again and his voice actor. Just cant get enough of his cackles and giggles. He's clearly the best character of the series.

The only thing, that really makes me pull my hair are the bugs in its current state. If you run into the blackscreen/whitescreen bug at any time, you have to continue without the proper save function. Which means, if you reach chapter 4 and dont push through till the final, you might be stuck in a somewhat loop of having to repeat the puzzles every time you start up the game. There are also bugs where you get stuck and have to restart a chapter.

I honestly hope the devs will fix all of these issues before the bad reviews hit the games overall ""very positive"" review state.

Don't expect the game to take your hand tho. The solutions are there but aren't always as obvious.

If you like puzzles, escape rooms and a playtime of 10-16hours or more if you switch roles to get all achievements, then this is for you!

The atmosphere and design of this game were on point. You can see that a lot of effort has been put into that, which I appreciate enormously. It made everything even more immersive. The communication between you and your partner was vital and got pushed up a notch to solve certain puzzles (I won't go into details, I don't want to spoil). The puzzles were not too tricky and not that hard to solve either. Some of their visuals blew my mind. 

I love how the two characters are together for most of the game. I felt a great sense of freedom due to it. In previous games, it was pretty set who had to solve which part of the puzzle. In 'Forever' it depends on who walked first or opened something first etc. I love the little breaks between the puzzles (where you had to travel from one place to the other). Those made it more immersive for me. The break allowed you to play rock, paper, scissors, talk about your environment or share ideas about what you think will happen next. Were the puzzles gave me a more dependent feeling on each other, the breaks gave me the sense that we were in this together as friends.

Therefore the end hit even harder than in the previous games... It gutted me.",1653228783,1653228783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

after playing the other 3 We Were Here games, this one definitely had a lot more polish in its presentation and ambition in the amount of content included in the game, especially taking into account that replaying the game allows for (mostly) different perspectives and interactions with the various puzzles.

The only gripe I had with this entry of the series is how during some puzzles, one of the players merely provides information to their partner, while the other player is the only one actually interacting and solving the puzzle. It did make the game a bit boring at times having only the option to reexplain information and wait for the puzzle to be solved, an issue not present in any of the previous games iirc (both players used to almost always interact and contribute to the solving of their parts of a level to complete the puzzle)

4/5

+ *MOST* of the puzzles were improved over the previous game in that both players got to do stuff versus player1 reading a single book and player2 doing all of the work. Both could advance the puzzle

+ Otherwise all the rest of the real puzzles were fun except for the 1 musical organ bit because it felt incomplete without the 2nd menu-hint; we probably could have figured it out with more time but my mate couldn't unshackle his mind from his musical-background-brainwashing.

- No TORCH puzzle? Missed opportunity..

- one bug in the crypts required us to restart the lobby, the checkpoint teleported us to the correct spots because we 100%'d the puzzle but a door wouldn't open.

- This one IS longer but there was definitely too much fluff which didn't need to be included
-- ^ including the FINALE bit which was a big waste.. It wasn't a puzzle at all as much as just jogging around flipping a few switches

This game is a major step-up in quality of puzzles, story-telling, and environment compared to the first three, especially noticeable upon entering maybe the most amazing / mind-bending puzzle room I've ever witnessed.

One or two of the puzzles are noticeably worse quality / harder to follow than the rest, made worse when it felt to us that the puzzle had become bugged (maybe it hadn't, though) BUT the sheer quality of the remainder of the game is high enough that these few experiences aren't enough to tarnish my overall experience.

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
We Were Here Forever the final(?) entry in the series has finally launched but is it as good as the previous ones? No, it's much better! It's a fantastic puzzle-focused coop game and we need more. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Level design and the environments.
+The puzzles ofc.
+Much better story-telling than previous ones.

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Minor bugs that made us restart an entire chapter.
-Some puzzles like the final one were super easy. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
If you played the previous ones, you know there's some story about a king and how he did some bad things and some jester but it never made much sense. Luckily the story finally becomes much more focused and clear as there are finally story cutscenes with dialogue and everything. 

You are back at Castle Rock trying to go through the Jester and King's endless puzzles but this time something changes. You manage to escape and find yourselves outside the castle where you find the plans of some rebel families that stood up to the King. I won't spoil more but this time around it feels like there's some actual lore behind everything as well as a proper ending, well except for one minor thing which I did not like at the end. Don't think there was an alternative to it. 

In any case, this is not some story that will blow your mind or make you emotional, the series was never about that, but I appreciated that they did gave us something better than previous games in this regard. 

Story rating: 7.5/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Just like the previous games, We Were Here Forever is a coop puzzle-focused adventure game where you and your partner have to progress through really tough puzzles in order to escape Castle Rock and its vicinities. 

You'll have parts where you can switch back and forth puzzles with your partner which helps in figuring out certain puzzles but there are also parts where you are both stuck on your selected side and you'll have to coordinate via voice on how to advance forward. 

Most puzzles will require you both to really think hard but there are a few such as the final one where they are extremely easy. The last puzzle was a bit disappointing, I was expecting something much more with an ompfh. Overall as I don't want to spoil you with what the game will throw at you in terms of puzzles, there are going to be some path-blocking ones, there's a cooking simulator one, and so many more. They are all unique and different from each other, not once will you get bored. There's also a hint system tho it's mostly useless as it only tells you how to start figuring out the puzzles which anyone with an average IQ will do.  

Fun and tough game and I'm curious what the devs can cook up next, assuming they'll still do coop/puzzle games. It's a rare genre so more is always welcome. Perhaps something sci-fi next time such as Portal 2 coop? 

Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Ah, voice acting, finally you won't have to look at weird cutscenes without a voice and surprisingly it's really well acted. 

The soundtrack is great, no complaints here, and I loved that there was a music type of puzzle as well as one with figuring out words out of sounds. Really well done. 

Other than that, the sound effects such as the atmospheric ones and whatever else are generally quite good, no complaints.

Audio rating: 8/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
I'll start with the bad real quick which were some bugs that forced us to restart an entire chapter but the devs said it had to do with servers so who knows. There were other minor ones as well but nothing worth talking about. 

What's really impressive this time around is the scope of the levels and their design. Long gone are the days of small rooms with puzzles, this time around everything around you feels masterfully crafted like a huge metroidvania-like map filled with puzzles, minus the backtracking. The way the levels and the puzzles are placed and how they work well with each other is perfect. They outdid themselves and I can't wait for what they do next.

As for the game performance, it's a bit iffy at times, frames can drop even on a high-end pc to 50s but overall it runs smooth.

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 8/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you're a fan of the series then I don't have to tell you to go buy it and if you're new I suggest playing them all tho not mandatory since We Were Here Forever can be easily played even as your first game.

Most of the puzzles were unique and fun to solve. Some of them required a decent amount of thinking while others you needed good team coordination/communication. There was one puzzle that we thought was troublesome. Maybe we're just stupid but we thought the clues provided weren't very clear. Also it was the first time we used the ""Hint"" feature in the game and they were literally the most useless things ever. One of them was ""try to use deduction if you don't know where to place these"". Yeah thanks for telling me a basic human problem solving skill. 
Personally I found some of the puzzles kind of boring. It just felt for a few of them that 1 person didn't have much to do.

The story was decent. Just the same stuff that's been going on the past few games. It does go more into depth of what's happening but I didn't care much for it.

The biggest problem in the game for us was all the waiting. They make you ride on like a snow lift multiple times that takes a solid like 20-30 seconds for no reason except the 1 time there was a cut scene. There are other instances too where it just takes too long for the game to take you through a pointless ride.

The graphics were great and a step up from the previous game. Soundtrack was fine, didn't really stand out at all. I only encountered one bug where I couldn't see the images on the buttons I was pressing. Quick restart fixed it though.

The final puzzle of the game was super easy. I'm pretty sure this is the last game in the series and for a final puzzle that sucked. Nearly every other puzzle was more difficult than the final one and kinda disappointed.

Despite all the negatives, it was still an extremely fun game and I do think it's worth full price.",1653066461,1653114700,True,10,1,0.635270774364471436,0,True,False,False

Managed to soldier through it just because at that point it was kind of funny how many bugs we could encounter and something else always managed to go wrong when trying to redo a stage. Honestly, contemplated a refund multiple times, but got the end, which was kind of abrupt itself.

One, I played this with a friend and we used Discord to communicate, which means I can't evaluate the matchmaking or in-game communication system. Two, it's May of 2022 and this game is still new and definitely has a lot of bugs. None of them were game-breaking for us on our playthrough, but we did have to restart the game once to clear a softlock and we ended up glitching the ending cutscene out pretty badly.

As a part of the We Were Here series, I'd say it's on par with the previous entry (We Were Here Together), but for different reasons. This game is visually more impressive and has a greater emphasis on story, and there's less consequences for, shall we say, taking your time in solving the puzzles. However, WWHT had the superior puzzles and more polished gameplay.

Recommend playing the other games in the We Were Here series first if you haven't already, and then picking up this game after it's been out for a few months and the developer has had a chance to patch some of the bugs.

Best part of the series yet! The storytelling has been improved with cinematics. While there is an overarching story, this game works as a standalone because the focus on the story is about setting the mood for the next puzzle. The puzzles are less abstract, more intuitive and there are more of them. This doesn't mean they became easy, there will still be plenty of moments where you are stuck trying to figure out a puzzle, but they won't be as frustrating to solve. As usual, the puzzles work by exchanging information with each other and figuring them out with logic, some of which reset after a few attempts or by the timer running out.

The game currently has some issues that should be easily fixed. At the end of the octopus puzzle, I was still stuck in the chair while my partner could progress to the next puzzle. Loading up the save for the next puzzle gave a black screen to whoever was hosting. Luckily we could work around this by replaying the octopus puzzle because of the nice chapter select. In some of the bigger puzzles, the FPS takes a big hit, not just on my mediocre PC, but on my partner's beefy PC as well.

Overall, this is a fun time, it's more and better!

I won't call it bad - you've got your two player puzzling and it works - but for the final(?) game in the series, the one with the longest development time and the one with the highest price tag, it feels a big step backwards from its predecessors.

It's hard to nail down exactly why, but I think it feels too tame, as if they approached this one with the mindset of really making a commercial game (the original was a student project IIRC), and were worried of scaring away players. There's no tension of having to solve a puzzle before you die to some encroaching hazard (increasingly-panicked chatter on the walkie talkies that can't both receive and transmit at the same time was genuinely one of my favourite parts of the previous games), and the puzzles are so self-contained - no more running around trying to figure out what you should be doing, instead you're typically sealed in a small area with only the puzzle elements, leaving the experience feeling overly-curated. ""Here's the next puzzle, solve it using these parts,"" goes the game, ""I'll be waiting to escort you to the next puzzle.""

On top of that, the puzzles themselves feel worse than in the previous games. Too many of the puzzles have both players simultaneously interacting with the same elements, leading to most of them ending with one person figuring it out and dictating everything to the other player. They feel more like single-player puzzles where the second player only exists to physically enter their half of the solution and maybe answer specific questions about details you know are there but can't see the exact details of.
The few asymmetrical puzzles beyond that seem to blitz through the interesting asymmetrical puzzle solving and go straight to the execution. Rather than collaboratively working out a solution you tend to see what you're supposed to do straight away followed by however much time of just repeating information back and forth, or worse one player is left really bored as their half just has so much less to do.
Really, the asymmetrical part of the co-op puzzle solving was what made the series unique, and to see it stray away from that feels like they've squandered what made the games what they are.

The game's longer than the older ones. There's more story as well, which may be hit-or-miss. I couldn't care less for it as it was the series's mechanics that held my interest, but the friend I played through them with was interested in the story. Either way, the individual puzzle quality has suffered for both. There were a couple I came out of thinking 'that one was pretty decent', but there's nothing memorable in there.

As I said at the start, I can't outright call it bad, but the development time and the price point both set expectations that the game consistently failed to meet. For half the price I likely would have been satisfied with the experience, but at full price it's just too bland.",1652825991,1652826262,False,123,4,0.620441317558288574,8,True,False,False

It would actually be a good game, if not the best of the We Were Here series, if it didn't have game-breaking bugs. At some point in the game you have to repair a machine where you need three parts that you get in three different levels. But every time we finished a level and got a machine part, the previous machine parts were reset. After we had the second machine part, the first machine part was reset, so we did both levl again. Then we got the third machine part and the other machine parts were gone again now we have to do all lvl all over again and they are not short.We tried reloadig our savegames etc. but nothing worked 
Conclusion: It would be a very, very good game with very good and fun puzzles, we really had a great time...so far...I would  not recommend to buy the game until the bugs are fixed, otherwise ur enjoyment on the game quickly turns into frustration.But who knows maybe we only unlucky.",1652816676,1652816676,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

somethings that I really like about this game:
- Nice variations with the puzzles. In the end, co-op puzzles are just me telling you the missing info you need and vice versa, but there's a nice variation to it.
- good level of cooperation required
- good asymmetry (good puzzle design overall)
- Incorporation of time limitations

Somethings that irks me with this game: 
-game breaking bugs that my friend and I have to restart our games to fix. Like items missing, critical interactions that aren't there/happening, etc. 
- puzzles were fun, but I totally lost track of the story. Story was forgettable and not captivating. 
- Starting the game turns out to be part of the puzzle too. there were a lot of issues in the beginning setting up the lobby/session, syncing to steam cloud issues that we have to fix by restarting steam. 
- game load time was very long for someone with an older PC too.

I'm not sure if we needed to redo puzzles to gather these pieces for some canon looking thing. There was chapter hopping (went from 2 to 4 to 5 then 3 where we might have been glitched, not to mention when we select the chapter to get back, we probably have to redo the others since each chapter had other percentages done. So our ""56%"" goes down to like 20%-30% when we need to go back to chapter 3).

Some of us had crashing issues too (don't spam your radio for the hell of it), we also ran into some bugs where one of us was glitched under a bridge and the other couldn't use a switch to move it since the person was ""on it"".

I REALLY LOVED IT


very minor spoiler ahead: but i also felt the ending was kinda cheap and or lazy, but i hope its just setting us up for more games, and if so.. it was fine.

One caveat: I felt like this game was overall much more forgiving and easy than the previous entries in some ways. Harder in some others. Visually and presentation wise/cinematics etc far above the rest. Story was a bit confusing despite having played all the previous games twice and watched lore videos + chronicles of castle rock.

Game is an excellent addition to the We Were Here series. For those looking for a fun co-op game to play with a friend, look no further than this series.

As far as criticism's go, my only major one is that the game runs just a tad too short, was really hoping after seeing the cliffhanger at the end that you'd follow through it and continue for one more area, but it just ended and left it open for yet another sequel/or DLC.

Overall puzzle quality is a slight step down from We Were Here Together, which had the best puzzles of the entire series so far.
I do understand the developers decision to forgo almost any time based puzzles for the game due to the whiny gamers that left bad reviews on the last game for having them. But time based puzzles bring a tension to some puzzles that makes them very interesting and memorable after you've solved them. Sad to see them almost entirely gone.

Also a number of bugs in the game that can softlock you and require you to reload the game in order to progress.",1652636623,1652636623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A few different takes compared to the last 3 games, like the slight ""open world"" touch, the fact that you are not separated from your partner for longer than a few puzzles, and the absence of timed puzzles that kill you if you are out of time.

I do recommend this game because of how well it's designed, no doubt there was a lot of thought put in and a great job in every aspect. however there are some frustrating things you should take in count before playing:
-bugs. you will have to restart chapter because items won't spawn/work/exist as intended, or the map itself doesnt work.
-fps drops, i had my game most of the time on 90fps, and some areas i was perma droped to 10fps.
-game starts with great puzzles that get harder mid playthrough, and then don't challenge you anymore. it's like at the end they gave you some timing mini games to fill up the story with mostly no effort put in.
-unexplained puzzled. imagine entering a room with 20 different buttons and levers and 0 hints or explanation whatsoever on whats going on, and you keep on trying just to fail and keep on guessing until something works.
-game doesn't focus on story. of course you'd usually have to play first games to understand what's going on, but either way there was very little story presented and it felt as if it was there just to give the game a visual subject. you finish the game still wondering what is the story.

Hands down the best in the series, though the first game is a close second.
The puzzles were difficult but not frustratingly so like it's predecessor. 
We did get have to quit and retry one puzzle because we did something we should not have been able to and locked the puzzle in an unsolvable state, but did not experience any glitches.


Playable with proton experimental as of May 15 2022.
- Cannot use the in game voice
- The intro movie (audio +  video) is fucked up, but the subtitles play correctly so you don't miss any vital dialog. All other cut scenes + videos played correctly.
- Some lag (3-5 seconds of stuttering) when you load into new areas, though this may not be a linux only thing.",1652594969,1652595132,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

What a phenomenal game series. I loved every second playing these games and I'm sad because Its over now. If the developers read this please don't stop here. You guys have so much potential to make more great games and we've really seen you develop as a company with this game series. I look forward to seeing future releases and supporting you.

This game (out of the four of them) has the best story telling and the best ending in the entire series. With the past three games ending similarly to each other, I was not expecting this game to end the way it did. 

Only one major complaint is that my friend and I had a bug where the host would get a black screen when trying to load in from a game save. It was no big deal since we could start a new checkpoint at the same point we were at, however we quit later and lost all of our progress.[spoiler] We lost our pieces to the telescope thingy and had to get them all again. [/spoiler] We had to repeat puzzles quite a few times however I have no doubt that this issue will be resolved with haste.

Other than that, if you are someone brand new to the series, I highly recommend that you play these games in order from start to finish. I wish there were more CO-OP story driven games.",1652594515,1652594515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You don't [i]need[/i] to play the other games in the series, but there is lore and it ties in fairly well with the other games. I appreciated the voice acting and cutscenes in this game: they didn't feel out of place or unnatural in any way. As for the storytelling delivery, it's always a joy combining the lore with the puzzles. Especially in Chapter 2, there were some nice touches to understand some characters.

The puzzles themselves were great. Very interactive (which is good given the type of game). Sometimes you can't guess when you'll split up with your partner to go off on a co-op puzzle which I really appreciated. Some of the puzzles were a bit long, but it never really [i]felt[/i] long: I spent more time thinking about how to solve the puzzle than usual.

I recommend the entire series. 10/10. I did only play with a friend and never jumped in a random queue, so I can't comment on that.

Played all the previous installments of We Were Here with a friend and we were really excited to see this game get released, however currently there are too many bugs and performance drops to enjoy it. Certain areas were so laggy that I was getting nauseous just playing the game and had to take breaks. We made it almost to the end of chapter 5, and then encountered a bug which stopped us from progressing (had to pull two levers but nothing would happen). Restarted the game, and from that point the save was bricked and whoever would host the game would load with a black screen and be unable to do anything.

We decided to load from a checkpoint instead, which didnt set us too far back. Had to repeat a couple puzzles but knowing the answers already we got it done relatively quickly. We proceeded to finish chapter 5, and collected the final piece of the 3 piece contraption... however returning to the location to install it the pieces for chapters 3 and 4 were no longer there. We cant progress with replaying two whole chapters, and even from the chapter select the finale isnt unlocked. 

Sadly, unless we find a way to edit the save file and unlock the final chapter I dont think we will be finishing this game. If anyone knows how to do this please let me know.

It has a far more ""open-world"" feel, with the need to go back to previously explored spots (I'll keep it at that to avoid spoilers). 

There are certain things about this game that are missing compared to the previous games (which personally is to its benefit). There are infinitely less ""mix and match"" puzzles that require stupidly detailed descriptions of symbols that make no sense. These puzzles were designed with the intent to make both players simply learn, and once they've learned the trick, they can figure it out and finish. That design choice is intuitive and goes a long way to support the pacing. The game does not need to constantly separate you to make a puzzle difficult, which is refreshing. The moments of separation actually matter, and is not just an expectation. Your partner FEELS like your partner, because you're consistently with each other, playing rock paper scissors, or just doing some other silly thing.

It's longer than any of the previous games in the series (took us 11hrs to do first run), and the quality is higher. Puzzles are varied and never too difficult. There does appear to be a way to find people to play with, but I would highly recommend grabbing a friend.

I do have some criticisms:
* The game forced us to accept an EULA. I don't know why that is necessary. Because it shouldn't be.
* The game has an account system - god knows why, but at least it's optional.
* Performance is certain parts, most notably the underwater part is quite bad
* Some of the puzzles require one of the players to do majority of the thinking while the other player got not  much to do, which kinda is a problem
* We had some connection issues mid game, where my friend simply could not connect to their proprietary servers. It would appear the game does not support Steam P2P and requires some bullshit online servers. What happens when the developer decides to shut them down?
* The potion puzzle having a time limit is anti fun.
* There are some inconsistencies in quality. Some loading screens are ""live"" where the game still has things happening, but most of the time it's a black screen.

They're very creative. Also, the exploration has been expanded ever so slightly from the previous games. I would love to see the exploration expanded on a bit. I really enjoyed taking in the scenery. Maybe adding some hidden collectibles in the next game? Only a few puzzles felt too easy, quick or otherwise not interesting. Everything else was a blast and they are all designed well. Also, I liked how some of the puzzles force you to learn the lore/plot, lol.

If you have someone to play this game with it's worth it. I recommend going back and playing the previous two games first, or at least the game before this one. Not required though.

Only negative - there is no accessibility mode. The puzzles fundamentally require you to be able to hear sounds and see colors accurately. If you're deaf or colorblind you may have an issue finishing this game, as your co-op partner cannot help you with these things, but actually relies on you to communicate these things to them.",1652568476,1652568751,True,10,0,0.638667285442352295,0,True,False,False

Favorite puzzle is the puppet head/matching the scenes puzzle. It requires the players to learn who the people are without doing a massive lore dump. Its a very creative way to for us to learn about the world in order to solve the puzzle.

I highly recommend the series, although be careful if you get too frustrated with puzzles.

I didnt see anything for accessibility, and I can see some puzzles being incredibly difficult if you are color blind. Keep that in mind as some things would just be harder or even impossible.",1652568437,1652568673,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you haven't played any We Were Here games, buy ""We Were Here Together"" instead, cheaper and better.

Bit of a disappointment, definitely a downgrade from the last game. If you're a fan of the WWH series then would probably still recommend buying it.

Twice as long (approx.) as its prequel, about half as good.

Played We Were Here Together around a month ago and can remember most of the puzzles.
Played We Were Here Forever a few minutes ago and have forgotten most of the puzzles.

That said, the rest of this review is a comparison between this and the previous instalments of the series.

The good:
- Best audiovisual quality in the series.
- Longest game in the series.
- Richest backstory in the series.
- The We Were Here formula we love.

The bad:
- The script of the playable story feels not so good as does We Were Here Together, the previous instalment of the series.
- Some puzzles (and even the narrative) seems not as asymmetrical as expected from an We Were Here game.
- Constantly regrouping with your partner loses the sentiment of being by yourself and lost. It also leads to poor checkpoints, which affects the replayability negatively. Describing the environment to your partner used to be a big part of the journey, but it's less present in this game.
- The music box puzzle will make you literally sick. 
- Sometimes the game controls your camera, which is as annoying as it can be.
- Launch week bugs and performance issues.

- Updated ranking:
- We Were Here Together
- We Were Here Forever
- We Were Here Too

The game briefly treating us to proximity chat however, did make me wish that this was possible throughout the game, as the priority system makes it difficult to banter while puzzling, for fear of silencing the other.",1652537851,1652537851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros :
[list]
  [*]Art + atmosphere : It’s been a long journey since the first game (less than 1gb of storage space overall iirc). Beautiful.
  [*]Story : As for Art + atmosphere this game series has come a long way since the ""We’re stranded in a snowy mountain, let’s take refuge in this castle"". We Were Here Together was already a step in that direction but Forever is really going in the more ""Outdoor experience"".
  [*]Co-op puzzles : I know it’s the main theme of the game but there’s not enough games like this one where two people have to cooperate in order to solve puzzles and progress through the game.
[/list]

Cons : 
[list]
  [*]Too short. That’s also how I started my review but it just leaves a bad aftertaste in my mouth after we played the last chapter. I was half joking about a DLC/season pass on voice but it really felt short. We finished the game in 3 night sessions. [spoiler] 2h15 for the first evening (1st chapter), 5h for the (2nd and 3rd chapters), 2h for the (4th, 5th and 6th chapters).[/spoiler] We then launched a new save of Together because we craved for more.
  [*]Straightforward puzzles : You don’t have to guess what you should be doing in order to solve the puzzles, you just solve them. I was able to solve a few puzzles with almost no active interaction with my friend
  [*]Passive/active puzzles :  There's quite a few (enough to be noticed) puzzles where there’s someone solving the puzzle and the other one listening to the instructions of his/her partner. You can’t choose either so we know that if we play the game again (prolly in a few months in order to ""forget"" most of the puzzles) we'll have to b careful before ""going our separate way"".
 [*]Lift waiting : Some areas where you don’t do anything and just wait for the lift to transport you were really too lengthy
  [*]Technical issues : 
  [list]
    [*]Black mass of pixels trying to engulf the host (it was only me and I thought i was a game feature at the beginning)
    [*]Fps drops in some areas
    [*]Audio bug for one of the puzzle [spoiler] where I couldn’t hear what noise the kraken was producing[/spoiler]
    [*]Subtitles issues : We played in a non English language so we used subtitles. Most of the times it was good but in some areas when I was mouse hovering over some text, there was no carriage return for the text to start a new line when it went over the ""translation box"" right side.
  [/list]
[/list]

My pros/cons list seems to tip on the cons side [b]BUT[/b] I will [u]still recommend this game[/u] because of Co-op puzzles. I really crave for this type of games. It’s a big bias but this kind of games where you have to work as a team of 2 to move forward is a really nice feeling for me when I'm playing a video game. I understand how it must be difficult to come up with new puzzles for 2 people to solve them together but so far the job has been done. I wouldn’t mind less story for a longer/more difficult 5th game.

TL;DR Game is good but short. We (my friend and I) need a 5th ""We Were Here"" game already.",1652529562,1652529758,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The first one is the frame issues. Some areas KILLED my fps to the point where it hard to move, let alone enjoy. Thankfully it went away after the initial load or if I didn't look in a certain direction in one area but it did ruin the experience a bit.

As for the second part it was because of a phobia. I won't go into details cause the area is spoilers but all I want is the option to hide them or change how they look in some way.

- There are some really uneven areas / puzzles throughout the game. Sometimes you'll get puzzles that are very easy and you'll storm through an area, whereas some other times you'll spend more than 1h in the same area.

This happened twice during me ad my companions playthrough. In the end we were not able to finnish the game from graveyard due to the game forcibly switching our roles and me not being able to load into the game (just a black screen) From a fully released game that I paid to play I have to say even though having enjoyed the game, I expected more.

All together, We Were Here Forever stands to this date my favorite puzzle game and I am excited to go through it again!

One of the three puzzles paths that you get to choose which order you do them in (has no impact other than order) is pretty awful for the most part in terms of enjoyment. Where only a single puzzle in that entire path was actually enjoyable (the path leading to the right).  Overall the We Were Here Series is still one of the best available co-op puzzle games and a real blast so there really isn't anything like it to want me to change my review to a no.  It's just that my enjoyment peaked really fast.  It might not be like that for you, but it was for me.

I also think the ending was kind of abrupt.  Without knowing if they plan to make another game in the series, I think that they should probably do a paid (let's be honest here and admit that their work is worth paying for - I want them to produce more and am willing to pay for it, shocker.) DLC to change the ending sequence with more puzzles involving -spoilers- because I think that would be really cool and would A) feel better as a whole or B) make it obvious that another game is possible if they felt like continuing the story which I feel isn't wrapped up in a way that gives closure.  If you've played the other games or have read the description for WWHF then you already know how these games go.  So not sorry if you feel like I've 'spoiled' something here.  I don't feel like 'we won' when the credits rolled.  The part that actually matters isn't spoiled by reading this and you aren't even given an idea of what I'm talking about.  You just have to see it for yourself.

I feel like this needs to be in caps.  THE GAME HAS PLENTY OF ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE PUZZLES AND IS WORTH THE MONEY!!  With that being said, I have complaints about a small handful of them.

Fairly major (and some minor) complaints below that I can still live with enough to rate as a recommend.  *Spoilers*

**SPOILERS BELOW, LAST WARNING**

Major complaints. (Flaws with the design itself)

The town. after being thrown out of the castle.  One player is mostly just sitting around waiting for the other person to do something with what they have on their side.  I was literally just standing around waiting for a large portion of the time spent there.  I would describe a quick scene and then it was just me waiting.  They had books to read, and objects to interact with.  Once an object was given to me, it was really obvious where it belonged.

The chapel.  Again, mostly just sitting around waiting.  All I had to do was explain what I was looking at and then wait for the other person to do everything else, which took way too long for how much I had to do on my side (bad).  There wasn't really any active involvement on my side and I firmly believe that both players should have something to interact with at the same time, or there should be an active timer ticking away so that the act of describing stuff feels important because its literal life or death (see previous WWH games).  Only a single puzzle in that building required *active* (good) communication between the two players to solve, and it was the last one there.

One of the puzzles in particular down that right path (mentioned earlier) expects too much from the players.   It involves both information overload and a lot of the interactables being useless & confusing bloat, and then on top of that expects the players to be able to either recreate or accurately describe ""noises"" that are required to solve what's happening.  My friend argues that they think it was a bug that I couldn't hear the noise for myself, but I argue the developers made it the way it was on purpose because one of the core 'mechanics' for lack of better word is to explain what is happening on your end so you can solve puzzles.

-gap so it doesn't look like one big wall of text-

So while I disagreed with my friend about it being a bug, I think that puzzle would have been better received if both people heard the noise.  They failed to describe the noise to me even after my mentioning of a machine on my side that as I claim ""makes random noises"" at me when I pull a lever on a machine with symbols on it.  We swapped places and I immediately notice that the symbol is obviously paired with a noise, but that wasn't enough to convince them to begin to describe it to me.  We swapped back and I was just given a screen-share with audio for the puzzle.  We were both tired and running low on energy and did not even want to begin making ""noises"" at each other in order to solve it.  The enjoyment and time spent was simply not worth the amount of effort required to solve that particular issue and we both agreed to the screen share solution.
A previous WWH game did something similar with matching the noises a clock (iirc) made and that was perfectly fine but that's where the idea to match noises should've stopped because that puzzle was simple noises with very easy to make real world comparisons like ""a singular thunk on wood"" type sound.  The previous entry example was enojoyable.  This game's was not.

Minor complaints. (Things that could be a problem because of how I played)

The underwater section on that same path was brute forced.  They wandered off while I messed with the stuff in my room and it worked by the time it was relevant.  We literally didn't have to communicate with each other aside from one time they got to a symbol before I had it lined up.

The light puzzle on the left path was solved REALLY FAST largely due to PURE LUCK of how I had already placed the puzzle objects.  This was an ""oh, okay...that could've been more fun if I didn't accidentally do the puzzle correctly by pure chance"".  It was solved properly with a few rotations after I had everything in place but could've easily been a whole ordeal.

On the same left path, the traversal ""puzzle"" didn't really feel like it was testing our noggin's in a meaningful way.  Felt like padding.

So yeah.  Even after all that I would still say this is both worth the money and the time to play with a friend.  It's good, for the most part.  And I look forward to more.  Please...Please give me more.",1652352747,1652352747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then my journey with a friend began, we went through the first 2 chapters and ended up at a crossroads in the middle of the city. The biggest mistake was that we went to the right into the underwater world. It turned out to be the 5th chapter right away, and everything would be fine if there were no bugs in the game that lead to a black screen that remains even after a restart and you can’t play further. The only fix is ​​to launch the checkpoint from the menu (bypassing the save), but in this way the progress of the game is reset, because we accidentally skipped the 3rd and 4th chapters and started the fifth one right away (at least hang a sign). Now every time the game crashed, we had to replay half of the game to reassemble the damn telescope.
Question to the developers - why did you make it possible to select chapters out of turn, if this leads to broken saves and the need to go through the same thing 3 times?
Thumbs down for optimization - when loading a location, even on a high-end PC, the fps drops to 10-15. Wow
