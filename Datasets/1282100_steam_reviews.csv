As much as I would like to give this game a thumbs up, I simply can not, even given the amount of hours i have in to it because as the old saying goes, three's a crowd. 

For most of the 70 hours I had into Remnant 2 before this review I only had two gripes with the game that could be sort of overlooked due to the fun i was having
1. The games performance is not the worst ive seen, but given I have a rig well above the recommended requirements(radeon 6700xt, 32gb ram, ryzen 7 5700x) i did not expect to see so much stuttering, especially playing with my favorite class the summoner. No matter the settings i put the game runs very choppy, and the demand on the my resources is not warranted. Using 50% of my cpu  and 85%-90% of my gpu on low settings while still being very choppy, is just a joke. Especially considering the resident evil 4 remake only uses 20% of my cpu and 40% of my gpu and runs WAY better.

2. Being a souls-like genre you expect there to be a refinement to the movement of the characters, and your inputs to the characters. However, since the start of playing i could never shake the feeling there was a weird delay in the dodging and sometimes the switching of guns in the game. and sometimes that would mean the difference between life and death. now there are traits that directly influence those actions, however even after leveling those skills up to the max, there is still a delay in the inputs. This also, is not an internet issue because even offline both me and several other friends experience this issue.

But even with those two things in mind, i was , obviously able to overlook them because i was still having fun. However, the third reason for the downvote is the most unforgivable of reasons.

Finally after 70 hours of having fun and perfecting the build i wanted to fight the final boss and try to min/max everything i could to my liking and have the best shot of winning. they present me with the most non souls-like, insulting to the genre final boss i have ever seen. 

The final boss COMPLETELY nullifies any and all preparation or strategy reminiscent of other souls-like games and turns it into a IWBTG knock off and super over bloated length of a boss fight that almost leaves you with an epileptic seizure of an experience. IMO, the final boss completely makes the other 70 hours of  time i invested into the game feel useless. To make a game that is built around almost an ARPG level of building a character and then the final boss of the game throw that out the window, seems like a poor choice.",1708901361,1708901361,False,3,0,0.537111222743988037,0,True,False,False

Like the first gamet this game is not a shoot and loot game. This is more shoot and scavenge game. That means most gear you will get by exploring and discovering secrets.

There are some new mechanics and boss fights are better than in first game but essentially this is the same game play as it was in first game.
So treat this game as huge expansion and updated game play of first one.

Difficulty:

Short explanation: Apocalypse difficulty is for meta builds and on every other difficulty any build is ok.
Long explanation: When it comes to game difficulty almost all of them are well balanced except for the Apocalypse difficulty where if you ask me they went over board with damage scaling. Even in first Remnant game enemies did not hit this hard but then again we also could upgrade armor back then.
On Apocalypse difficulty it comes to two game play styles: dodging all the attacks or wearing heaviest armor for damage protection so that you don't get one shotted.
On Apocalypse difficulty even a little mob will take more than half of your HP or almost all.
So if you want fair challenge and use what ever gear you want or build Nightmare difficulty is where most of us casual players will end up.

Co-op:

Do not know why but multiplayer runs better in first Remnant game if you ask me.
There are a lot of ping and lag problems that will mess up your timing for dodging enemy attacks if you are not a host.
At least they finally implemented region lock that you can select so it helps with the lag and ping.
Solo play is just easier for me then multiplayer with random strangers. Special on higher difficulties and since difficulty also scale up with how many people are in co-op.

DLCs:

1. The Awakened King:
The new random world map for Losomn is great.
I finally have feeling when I am traveling or looking at World Stone map that I am actually traveling the land and not just loading from area to an area. Hope they will do more maps like this in future.
We also get 20 more trait points and new gear.

Performance:

Keep it in mind that some people are experiencing performance problems.
Personally I have no problems with the game performance but it may be different for you depending what kind of PC you have.

Conclusion:

Putting performance aside this is a good game and an improvement from the first game in some game-mechanics and boss fights at least for me personally.

HOWEVER, we were stuck using our starter weapons and armor for the entire game because all of the real items are hidden behind puzzles that have absolutely no hints.

All of the decent weapons are hidden behind puzzles that you would never know exist aside from googling them.

For example: ""Destroy a certain painting in a secret room in the counsel chambers to unlock the weapon"".

Imo this would make getting certain traits and items much less tedious, and increase replay-ability a lot, if I can guarantee a play through is going to be completely different, that's going to be way more engaging than hoping that I don't roll a bunch of the same dungeons/world starts.

-Not going to lie, going back to Yaesha was super disappointing. Both Losom and N'Erud felt very well fleshed out and interesting with their own self contained stories, but Yaesha felt like a complete retread of the first game, and not an improvement on it either. The possibilities are literally endless, so it just feels super lazy to visit a world we've already been to.

-Another location complaint is Root Earth, the complete lack of any story besides [i] root [/i] was super disappointing, and honestly felt really half baked. It's the last little bit of the game, so I can give it a pass, but the game definitely doesn't end on a high note.

-Having more scrap drop from the destructible environment set pieces than from the enemies you kill feels bad and definitely needs a rework. Don't get me wrong, I love to break stuff in the environment and get goodies, but when it feels wasteful not to break every little thing in an area because it will literally net you triple what the mobs gave you and you're constantly strapped for scrap then there's an issue in the design. 

-The main story is bad, teenage writing level at best. This would be a much bigger detractor, except it's mostly just an excuse to get you to travel to the different worlds, and the storytelling of each of those(minus Root Earth) is significantly better.

-Melee isn't really viable like the first game, too many bosses are completely impractical to hit. At the same time tough, if that's the cost of better boss fight designs then I can't complain. 

-Final boss phase 2 hurts my eyes/brain. This is probably just a me problem, but any time the screen is 95% red for more than a couple seconds I start to get a headache, and Root Earth's whole grey-scale + red leading up to it was not doing me any favors either. 

None of these complaints are worth me not recommending the game, but it sure as heck would be a much better experience with them being improved, so one can hope!",1708725952,1708725952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 Enemy Design:

Enemy focus seems to be quantity over quality where you get the same kind of enemies and constant elite spawns when trying to venture around the map in certain areas. I know Yaesha was very bad with the elite spawns and it was the first map rolled out in the campaign for me. They were bullet sponges and I found myself running out of ammo. There were other areas where the enemies were a little more diverse but it does get monotonous when you have to replay in adventure mode to explore all the content.

Items:

There were a lot of different mods and weapons but good luck gathering all the scrap needed to upgrade your gear and buy new items. Resources take a long time to gather for new weapon upgrades, items etc. and that's even with the amulet that gives you double scrap.   The farming spots are hardly even worth the effort. Better to just re-roll adventure mode and playthrough an area again. 

 I did however enjoy the different variety of weapons to try later on in the game and some of the other mods. 

Boss Design:

 Whew, they definitely don't make them easy. There were a fair amount of bosses I really enjoyed fighting against and felt the mechanics required to fight them were fair. I also liked that there are a fair amount of mini-bosses in the game as well. Other ones, what really made things frustrating is that you have a limited field of view to see what is coming at you, damage sponges,  and the few that can one shot kill. 

There was one boss that almost made me quit playing the game which was Labyrinth boss. The worst thing is this boss is near the beginning of the campaign and its not even a real boss fight. Just a really gimmicky puzzle that forces you to memorize the walkway patterns and jump around between platforms.

 Combat:

 I have to give this a big thumbs up as there are a lot of different classes, builds, and fighting styles to choose from.  You get to spend points leveling up your different traits, learn new traits as you progress, and automatically level up the class you picked. You get three different skills to choose from, a special ability, passive skills, and other attributes that are upgraded from the class leveling.

 On top of all this, you level up a secondary class on top of the first class you picked to make a hybrid build for your character. Adds a lot of variability to the way combat works.

Maps:

  I feel like there is a fair amount of exploration but only if you roll an adventure mode story with your on-going main story campaign. There is some cool designed areas but the problem is, you find yourself going through the same areas over and over just to explore other parts that were undiscovered. The side areas in the maps all have very similar design along with the enemies being monotonous with too much quantity. 

Story:

 Not a whole lot to write home about. Got kind of bored with it and didn't really follow everything.

Graphics:

Another game that is poorly optimized. I was shocked at first because I was only getting 20 to 25 fps with all the graphic settings set to low/medium until I turned on a setting called ""upscaling"". That was the only saving grace to the games graphics but it came at a cost making the game look more grainy when it was set to performance mode. The game most of the time was holding 60+ fps majority of the game and a few areas around 50-60 fps.

Crashes/Bugs:

 Didn't really have a ton of issues personally with this. The game has crashed on me a couple times and thankfully did not delete any saved data. The game cannot run MSI afterburner or it will crash. I have heard others have major issues with the game crashing.

 The only other issue I had was the map rotating around when using a controller, and a couple menus which was pretty annoying at times. I'm not sure what the issue was as none of my other games have stick drift happening from the controller.

This game does not play well with 13th/14th gen CPU's (mine is the 13900k). It constantly crashes with low video memory errors and low level fatal errors - particularly during shader compilation when your CPU is pushed its hardest. There are threads for this everywhere on steam! (just type in low video memory and see for yourself...). Same issue persists with Robocop Rogue CIty, Lords of the Fallen 2023 and even Banishers Ghosts of New Eden.

If you plan on buying this game, then you will want to accept that you will very likely have to underclock your CPU to avoid crashing... You have been warned...

My Fix (thanks to a lot of online advice): Download Intel Extreme Tuning Utility. Then change your performance core ratio back to 53x (or even 52x if your having ongoing issues).

Constant crashes. Can't play for more than 5 mins, though more often it is closer to 20 seconds. Only negative review I've ever left. 

I've looked online and it appears to be a common problem, especially with 3080 cards it seems.

I became a fan of this franchise with their first remnant game and have been anxiously waiting for the sequel. But as we all know, more often then not, the original is always better than the sequel.

They stayed close to the original blueprint but changed it enough to be like a fresh breath of air. Only reason I would tell people to play the original is for plot sake only. This game is genuinely a ton of fun and I found myself often being so zoned in that I have't noticed two hours have gone by already. The design where the map is changeable and gives everyone a unique experience is so smart but doesn't change it so much that you can still use guides for certain achievements is amazing. Basically a dark souls game but with guns. Super fun game play with a decent story. Multiple weapons that give you the choice to play however your heart desires.

The campaign is relatively short, about 20 hours and takes place over the course 4 different acts, each with their own unique and beautiful world to explore, dungeons to find, puzzles to solve, secrets to uncover, and enemies to overcome. There are several different classes to choose from and Remnant gives you the freedom to mix and match classes on the fly to fit your play style or circumstance. There are plenty of weapons to find and create and you can equip mods to them which is the equivalent to an ash of war if you've played elden ring; Mods give your weapons various abilities and most of the boss weapons have mods that are specific to that weapon. There are also a variety of accessories and armors to collect as you explore the world, some much harder to come across than others. Although the campaign is short, replay ability is high because certain parts of the world are procedural generated and you may experience a new layout or mini boss than in your previous playthrough; I've done 3 or 4 playthroughs now and I'm still finding things I totally missed and with a heavy emphasis on co-op you and your friends can run dungeons for hours or play through the entire campaign together. Also there are definitely illusory walls in this game so stay sharp! If you're reading this because you've been thinking about buying this game or it's currently on sale and you decided to check it out, do me a favor and do not hesitate, just buy it and get the deluxe edition; you're going to want the dlc, trust me.

Honestly this game reminded me of the secret world more than anything else I've played and yeah, I definitely see inspiration from dark souls scrattered throughout but Remnant is it's own game through and through, I appreciate the vision the developers had for this game, and they have definitely made a loyal fan out of me",1707876380,1707876380,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Remnant II is the logical next step that keeps most of its working formula the same while fine tuning and improving parts that were lacking. 
Multiple difficulty levels allow you to adjust the experience to your skill level and willingness to put work into it.
It's a also a game that will hide large parts of its content if you are not playing through it paying attention, with some things so obscurely hidden that it's figuratively impossible to find them out without looking something up. But that also means there is a lot of replay value and rewards for putting in the time with it.
Admittedly this can be a double-edged sword, though, when the item you know you need is hidden behind multi-stage RNG world rolls that do not make it difficult to get, just time consuming.

It's a great soulslike when you play it solo and good fun while keeping up the challenge for the most part when playing in Co-op while adding the layer of party composition on top of the build composition.

The dual classing system and absolute ton of gear guarantees that you will find a build that appeals to you. Even just going off the gear that is for sale in the hub, you'll be able to get yourself a decent setup.

The biggest issue I have with this game is the weapon and archetype unlocks. If you just played through the game normally, you'd likely be disappointed with the amount of new weapons you unlocked. This is because they have intentionally made these unlocks so obtuse that you would never feasibly find them without a guide.

For example, there is a weapon that is unlocked by clearing a pipe then waiting 90 minutes for the room to flood. Another involves completing a world, then backtracking the level and jumping off the map to teleport to an extremely well hidden path. There's an archetype that involves running into toxic gas that covers the perimeter of the map to find an item hidden out there that you cannot see from a safe area.

Check out how to unlock the Archon class for the absolute epitome of what I'm talking about here.

-Story is very focused on and flushed out compared to Remnant 1
-Dozens of RNG-Based gear spawns that vary from world to world, as well as bosses to provide variety across numerous runs
-Pretty straight forward game play mechanics, easy to pick up and know everything if you've played the first game
-Unique world bosses that some times have two different fight scenarios and rewards based on how you approach them
-Each of the three worlds that you visit along your play through have completely distinct environments and challenges, in terms of what monsters you face as well as what plight they need your assistance with
-Different classes (Archetypes) for you to choose two of to mix and match to suit your play style, with some being hidden within the game or locked behind special scenarios

Cons:
-Feels like they focused more on the story than the actual game play aspect of this game compared to Remnant 1
-So many RNG-Based things that some times you end up spending an entire day just to get the one piece of gear you want
-Almost no armour sets in this game compared to the first one, and none of them provide any set bonuses at all. They completely removed that fun mechanic that they had in the first game
-Rings? Oh, it's got rings... The base game has 145 rings and the DLC adds another 20-25 rings to the game, 75% of which you'll *never* use, and with no way to sell/store gear it just clogs up the inventory
-The guns are almost too unique, with there only being three or four that don't seem like they were made for a very niche scenario, so unless you want to switch weapons every few minutes your options are rather limited if you want just a decent all-round weapon
-Did I mention how many useless rings there are? Could have easily just brought back armour set bonuses from the first game and gotten rid of over half of the rings

TL:DR; 6/10
-First game, Remnant: From the Ashes was *so* much better compared to this game that it almost seems like a downgrade when you compare the two. If you're really interested in trying this game out and you have not played the first one, I sincerely urge you to just buy the first game instead. The story in that one isn't as flushed out as in this one, but man does the game play of it just feel so much better, in both terms of both (re-)playability and variety of gear.

Story is soulless and generic, environments are drab and bland, combat feels boring and repetitive until you grind through enough gameplay to unlock actual gameplay elements which is again, odd design direction considering almost every other looter shooter makes you enjoy playing the game initially, rather than making you feel like you're playing a character with no abilities, Parkinsons disease, and a worthless pea shooter for a gun for 30 hours.

Once the game scales any weapons you find that are below the weapon in your inventory enchantment level cannot be used effectively until you level them up to the same level effectively locking you out of trying new weapons. 

The optimal play is to NOT enchant anything but your weapon skills until the final level  because the the game rolls the power level of an area when you load it for the first time. So the game punishes the player for engaging with the system. Games like this is why  automatic level scaling has a bad reputation. This is almost as bad as the Last Remant.

Oh, just like last time, the game is filled with a bunch of moon logic puzzles with rng elements that if they don't happen you cant FINISH OR START the puzzle with okay rewards. You have to reroll the world in adventure mode and hope you get the triggers/scenarios and you don't know until you get to that map/area.

If you liked Remnant 1, this is an a must buy. If you like souls games, this is most likely an easy purchase, especially if you used ranged or magic builds.

Even for those who are shy of the Souls-like genre, this game comes with a ""Normal"" difficulty that has less challenging enemies so you can get used to the gameplay loop and turn the difficulty up later if you want.

I started the main part of the campaign in Losomn on survivor difficulty in the Beatific Palace story line.  I proceeded to die no less than 20 times trying to get through the first main door.  Normally, I would give up at that point saying to myself the game wasn't for me, but I was really intrigued by the possibilities of the game.  So, I kept trying and I am so glad I did.

I have only played solo and have since beat the game on Apocalypse multiple times and also beat veteran mode on hardcore difficulty.  I have leveled every archetype to level 10, except for invader.  I explored a huge majority of the game and obtained a huge majority of items as well.  I have geniunely enjoyed all 3 worlds and the labyrinth.  I have enjoyed the dungeons and boss fights.  I enjoy the item hunt and making builds.  The overall gameplay loop is very satisyfing.

General Gameplay - 10/10
I really enjoy shooters and this one did not disappoint.  I enjoyed learning how to dodge and weave in damage between dodges.  The overall gunplay, abilities, and mechanics are responsive and satisfying. 

I enjoy the world being broken up into larger overworld maps and lots of dungeons.  I can pick this game up and play just long enough to do a dungeon or I can go for a several hour session and both can be fun.  I don't feel obligated to play for a long time, but don't get bored of it after a short time either. 

The game has just the right amount of stress and release.  I can play an overpowered build and just mow through dungeons and bosses to release the stress of the day.  Or, I can up the difficulty or change to an experimental build and raise the heart rate a little.  I did my veteran hardcore run to get Savior after over 200 hours in the game.  Going through Root Earth on that character got me as close to the stressed out feeling of the original Halo when I was first introduced to the Flood as I have ever felt in a game in over 20 years.  I was stressed and scared, but in a good way.  And it felt great to finally beat the last boss.  Just like it felt so good to finally be above ground facing the covenant instead of underground with the flood.

Items & Builds - 10/10
I haven't played another game that got me hooked on the item hunt as good as Remnant 2.  Various gear pieces can have a wide variety of impact on how you play the game.  They can be as generic as small constant damage bonuses to something that drastically alters how you play the game.  It may not have the depth of customization where spreadsheets are necessary, but there is still a lot of customization that make theorycrafting, hunting for items, and executing an experimental build very enjoyable.  

Although I haven't fully leveled invader yet, I can say that the archetypes are well designed.  They each offer different ways to play and provide synergies and build opportunities.  There is a lot of build diversity available and so many fun choices.  

Exploration & Aesthestics - 10/10
I really like art of the worlds and just wandering around in them shooting things.  My favorite world by far is N'erud.  The whole atmosphere and aesthetic of that world is amazing, especially the skyline.  I also think that N'erud has the best story of the three worlds.  I also really like the stark contrast of each world as they are very different from one another.

Performance - 10/10
I have had no performance issues playing at maxed settings.  For reference, I have an i7-12700, 64GBs DDR4 ram, RTX 3070 graphics card, and nvme 4.0 ssd.

In closing, I cannot recommend this game enough.  It is an easy 10/10 game in my opinion.",1707645627,1707645627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There were multiple times we asked aloud: ""Hang on, does X make sense to you"" or ""Does that look right?"" and often times it was something secret or was involved in a puzzle. so be on the lookout for anything out of place as you go through :)

The game has so many items and different combinations of stats/builds that it's bordering on excessive for how much actual game there is. Exceptional atmosphere accomplished by good visuals and music with great care put into it - i found myself stopping and listening to certain pieces in N'Erud and i was honestly in awe.

The story is... happening? I dont know it's just going on during the game. It makes no sense. And its pretty weak.

The gameplay feels really grindy and empty. 

A few game mechanics aren't fun as well. Like the death punishment sucks that you have to run back to a campsite to spawn. You should just be able to spawn when there are no enemies in a group. You should also be able to view your character card when you are dead. Its pretty boring watching allies fight. 

Finally. You are really screwed if you dont run a medic in your group. Which isnt great because the class is super boring. If you are going to force people into these roles, at least make the game four player.

The areas and monsters are really well designed and the difficulty level was always just right until the very end where I got schooled by final boss and needed to work on gittin gud some more.

Getting the game with the DLC is very much recommended. It really adds a lot of variety to your playthrough and it's great standalone experience as well. The game has three major areas to explore, and the King DLC is one of them.

The end game can be a hit or miss depending on your tastes. It kinda implies that you can spend a lot of time re-rolling the areas to get different layouts, events, and a chance to make different choices. It also lets you get more of the best gear, level up additional skill sets and get to your perfect build, but I'm struggling to motivate myself to keep going further without some major goal.

One upsetting point is the lack of armor selection or an upgrade mechanic. The premium edition came with some of the best armor in the entire game already in my inventory, so the whole mechanic became pointless. I was also very much short on cash most of the time, which means that I could only invest into upgrading one set of weapons.

They did add a potato graphics setting, which gave me an additional 10-25 fps depending on the area, but the game looks like PUBG Mobile with it. There's no way I'm going to recommend this game to anyone if they can't even give us a stable 60 fps when the game looks like a mobile game (this was even with FSR on performance).

My PC is not that great (1070 Ti, Ryzen 7 3700x, 32 GB) but I can run other games that look way better just fine:
- Cyberpunk 2077 on highest settings (FSR balanced)
- Updated The Witcher 3 on highest settings
- DOOM Eternal on highest settings

There's no reason my PC shouldn't be able to run this game at a stable 60 fps without it looking like a bad mobile game.

The game has performance issues all across the board, and the upscaling makes things blurry. Mine crashed more times than I know, somewhere in a range above 40-60 times for seemingly random reasons. 

When the particle effects get dense, it can struggle and still maintain a playable framerate, but your inputs get a significant delay. 

The introduction is very grating and out of place seeming in the established universe.

The main story is questionable, and as your protagonist is now just a side character in someone else's story, it would play out the exact same way if you never played it, which is a baffling decision and makes it all wrap up in a way that feels meaningless.

The guy in charge of balancing From the Ashes allegedly quit the company, and it feels like the publisher drove a lot of strange design decisions that really alter the feel of the game. 

The release and 3 day access state wasn't great- a number of weird bugs and promised content that is either missing or in one case spitefully hidden by the developers because someone allegedly 'almost found it' in testing. The developers apparently are mocking players in the official discord as well, and combined with the spiteful last minute change, that makes for some major red flags in my opinion.

There are more 'things to do' to make your build, but every single aspect of it is nerfed. Your character can end up feeling much weaker than they should, as enemies scale faster than you. A specific note on jank- Upgrading your weapons directly levels up enemy HP and the damage they deal to you. This is similar to Remnant 1's system, but is really out of whack here. Enemies scale faster than you this way, and also scale in ways your character cannot balance out. 

It still has a similarity to from the ashes, but they shifted focus from all the characters you grew to know. Ford literally just disappears (assumedly to a future DLC?) in the first 10 minutes. The protagonist you went with through (potentially) Chronos and Ashes just disappeared. The returning shopkeepers just feel like a token nod to the fact Ashes exists.

It's fun to mess around with, but I think I'll only play from here on to make me feel less bad about purchasing it, and I can't recommend it unless it's on sale, they actually put all the content in, they fix the standout bugs, eliminate the causes of at least half the crashes, fire the devs doing weird stuff, and take a step back and look at the more bizarre design decisions, like putting one of the gear types into a gacha system in town.

The music is good, but it's all in short snippets unfortunately, and they added an unnecessary inception BWOMMMM stinger on top of the miniboss intro/outro from Ashes, which was perfectly fine as is. 

It's actually really disappointing to see the game like this, as I was expecting to have a lot of fun with this.",1690373422,1707159717,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Boss fights were 90% pushovers, but i think thats build dependant. Items and synergies were fun to play with. The replayability is great, cuz im still interested in playing it despite beating it. And i think the devs added a ton of quality of life things they didnt NEED to, that make the experience better. (Killing yourself, crystals at the end of dungeons, the ability to downgrade weapons you upgraded for a near full refund ) 

I think the class system is cool, but kinda obtuse. On one hand its cool cuz you have to actively pursue classes, but its usually in a convoluted way that basically requires googling the directions. 

The seeding is cool. Everyone starting with a different world/zone and minibosses/loot being randomized within those random seeds makes for a real unique experience. 

The last boss was really interesting. I think the [spoiler]glitching[/spoiler] was awful to follow at first, but you kinda get used to it. It was a hard ish fight, i think easier with my build since it auto targetted+as a duo that helped take some threat away.

I played the first Remnant, and my only issue was the short length of the game. Provided you were able to beat all the main bosses on the first try, it would likely only take you 3-4 hours to beat it.

With Remnant 2, this issue is hardly in view with the expansive worlds and huge selection of items. However, every single ""bug fix"" patch that Gunfire Games has released has also resulted in a slough of new bugs being introduced. i-frames were added for a slight amount of comfort, but it also felt like attack windows were extended as well. I've been fully locked out of multiplayer after their most recent patch; my mode would be stuck to Offline mode no matter what I did, and I eventually just had to get lucky with an inconsistent pattern of reinstalling the game and restarting my computer and router. Graphical issues seem more apparent as the game keeps getting these fixes as well.

The game is an absolute blast, but it feels disappointing to experience more bugs as they keep getting ""fixed"". I would recommend waiting a couple more months for the fixes to actually mean something before purchasing this.

The story is just as terrible and uninspiring. I'm 13 hours in and being bombarded with tedious, generic cutscenes that attempt (and fail miserably) to humanize the cast or provide context. I couldn't care less what is going on with the story or who the characters are, I don't give a s*** about their backstories or ""personalities"". I'm bored out of my skull on that front.

They also somehow made the scaling mechanic even worse than the previous title, making it actively detrimental to level your guns unless you enjoy mindlessly breaking furniture or some other droll farming method for hours for the currency you need whenever you find a new weapon you'd like to try out, all because they decided to scale enemy health with your level and weapon with the highest upgrade, which has the side benefit of making you constantly feel just as weak as you did when you started. Oh, but wait! They also scale enemy damage while removing the ability to upgrade armor as you could previously.

TLDR; The more you level and upgrade weapons, the more flimsy your character is and the more damage spongy your enemies are. Sounds stupid and doesn't make sense? It is and it doesn't...

- We think Remnant feels more player-accessible than Dark Souls is because dark souls ""locks"" players into an animation with nearly every action in the game, and Remnant does not. In Dark Souls, when you swing your sword, you can’t dodge-roll until after the animation is complete. In Remnant you can dodge roll at almost any time. This small design decision has made a monumental difference for us, making Remnant feel entirely different and fun. This does not make the game ""easy"" though, if you play on higher difficulties. 
- The sound stage is incredible. The music is epic and wonderful, artfully designed to match the world or zone you are exploring. But what stands out to me especially is the addition of enemy attack audio cues. Of course, there's still the pre-attack ""big windup"" animations, but Remnant also makes innovative use of attack-sound cues unique to almost every enemy in the game. I did not realize how much my game play had grown organically around the brilliant audio cues until my headphones came unplugged during an encounter and I felt my world dissolve into chaos. Well done Devs, I have a whole new appreciation for sound design. 
- The ability to multi-class, the variety of abilities offered, and the variety of weapons break the ""Tank/DPS/Support"" mold in innovative and fun ways! 
- Most of the writing is wonderful and thought provoking. Each world you travel to has multiple stories you can play through (only one story per play through). Stories are told through NPCs with fun dialog options, and writings if you want to spend time reading. Usually the writings are well worth it, and my wife enjoys giving dramatic reenactments. Not sure what happened with the main quest... but the others are great! I’m hoping they release a DLC that revamps the main quest because its sadly lacking. 
- The game play loop is different from other action games because of the addition of puzzles. The Action//Puzzle variation is very cool and fun. If you don't want to solve the puzzles, go ahead look up the solutions and get the reward. We have tried hard to solve them ourselves and have loved the experience. Some of them stretch on for quite a while, and there are some very... obscure secrets... which we have avoided looking up solutions for so far. I can tell something is there but... still trying to puzzle it out. 
- In my opinion, Remnant has the perfect mix of ""Hand Crafted"" and ""Randomized."" The zones are built from different hand-crafted tiles each time they are re-rolled. The game fits together like a beautiful digital Lego set. The campaign is designed to be played through multiple times, and each time you will get a different handful of Lego pieces. Some of the puzzles stretch across multiple Legos, which can make solving them very challenging. I love that character progression is persistent, only the world changes. You can have multiple characters although I'm not sure why I'd use this feature because they introduced the ability to save ""builds"" in the equipment menu, which is appreciated. 
- The difficulty settings are challenging for a lot of games to get just right for players. We think remnant devs have done a great job. We started out on ""Medium"" until we got used to the gameplay, and then raised the difficulty. We did have to restart the campaign to do this, which was ok! Restarting the campaign does not reset your character progression. Now we are playing on ""Hard"" (the highest is ""Very hard"" but you need to beat the campaign once to unlock it). Full disclosure, we ended up spending 4 hours trying to beat one boss over two play sessions. Beating it was immensely satisfying, and we loved the experience. Before playing Remnant my wife would never have wanted to even play a game where this was a possibility, but this experience was well crafted and we both loved it.
- I love that for me, who plays games more often than my wife, I can still play solo because its easy to avoid playing content we have not experienced together. When we can play together, every new area is a mystery to us and we love exploring, looking for secrets and solving puzzles as a team. Enemy and bosses are clearly designed to be synergistic with coop play and are challenging but fair. 
- The Devs have been responsive to player feedback, making changes and upgrades. 
- Truthfully I am confused why the player ratings on steam are not higher than 90%. This game rocks, especially coop.

Long version:
1. The Crashing
I've managed to reduce the crashing by deactivating GPU overclocking and similar stuff all over and cranking the graphics all the way down to the ""Potato"" setting (real nice to have my tech insulted in the menu btw). So for me it's playable now, as long as I reboot the machine before playing.

But I shouldn't have to reconfigure my whole rig in service of the whims of a single game. The state of this thing is inexcusable. I'll revise this review if they ever fix the problem. At time of writing the game's been out for 5 months, so I'm not holding my breath.

2: The Randomized Looter Shooter
If you liked Remnant 1, you'll probably like this. The procgen stuff is pretty well put together, but gets samey, as procgen stuff tends to do. I don't mind that. I think it's a cool idea to have your looter shooter come pre-packaged with its own randomizer.
And the looting and the shooting are excellent.

3: The Scaling
The Scaling problems from Remnant 1 are still here, but lessened, if I understand it correctly. I'll try not to make too firm a statement, because all I know about how it works here is second-hand knowledge. If you're gonna play this, I urge you to look up how the game scales its difficulty.
The short version is: only upgrade your weapons when you need it. Overlevelling your gear is dangerous.

4: The Story stuff
I had kinda hoped they'd learned from their severe writing missteps in Remnant 1, but it's pretty much exactly the same. The good stuff is still good and the bad stuff is still so, so bad.

Spoilers for Remnant 1 but not Remnant 2:
[spoiler]In Remnant 1 there is the world of Rhom. It's a nuclear wasteland populated by aggressive mutants. These mutants, though, are clearly sapient. They are, essentially, people, despite appearances. They are also extremely xenophobic and will attack outsider on sight. The result is that you spend a lot of time rampaging through their villages, shooting absolutely everybody and ransacking their homes. Not to put too fine a point on it: To progress through the game, you have to commit acts of genocide. The Rhomites being xenophobic jerks does not justify this kind of response.
There's also a particularly fucked up bit in Reisum where you find a cage with Urikki slaves. When you fine the key you can open the cage, but you will find that the slaves don't leave. You can't interact with them in any way except murder. And in fact, what you're supposed to do here is pick out the one that has a prosthetic eye and kill them. To get the eye. What. The fuck.[/spoiler]

Spoilers for Remnant 1 and 2:
[spoiler]In Remnant 2, you eventually get to the world of Losomn, which is populated by the Fae. To progress here, you will, again, rampage through palaces and city streets, just gunning down everybody while the Fae (and the Dran) scream at you to get the fuck out. Further, the lore asserts that Fae are inherently chaotic, murderous creatures, naturally driven towards murder for sake of entertainment etc. Essentialising a whole people like this is obviously very messed up and honestly I should have seen this coming. It doesn't really matter that they're trying to make a point about libertarians (I swear they do, it's not subtle), but it's really undermined by how they justify feudal tyranny to do it.[/spoiler]

As an intermediate-level gamer with a penchant for challenges, I've always been drawn to titles that push my limits and keep me on the edge of my seat. Remnant 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the original masterpiece, has not only met but exceeded all my expectations. It's a game that has taken me through countless failures, only to emerge victorious in the end, and it has become an addiction I can't resist, especially when played with others.

Remnant 2 is a testament to the art of relentless persistence. From the very start, the game makes it clear that it won't hold your hand, and that's exactly what I crave in a gaming experience. Multiple missions have left me cursing my decisions, scratching my head, and questioning my skills. But let me tell you, every failure was a lesson learned, a battle scar earned, and a challenge that only fueled my determination.

The combat system in Remnant 2 is a masterpiece. It's fluid, intense, and unforgiving. You'll need every ounce of your skill to prevail against the diverse and menacing foes that lurk around every corner. The game doesn't just pit you against cannon fodder; it throws complex and unique enemy types your way, each requiring a different approach and strategy. The sheer variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal adds an extra layer of depth to the combat, allowing you to tailor your playstyle to your liking.

What truly sets Remnant 2 apart is its co-op experience. While the game is exhilarating when played solo, it reaches a whole new level of enjoyment when you team up with friends or other gamers online. The synergy of different character builds, the coordination required to overcome tough boss fights, and the shared triumphs after countless defeats create unforgettable moments of camaraderie. Remnant 2 teaches you that teamwork isn't just an option; it's often the key to success.

The visuals in Remnant 2 are nothing short of breathtaking. The game world is a meticulously crafted tapestry of post-apocalyptic beauty and despair. The attention to detail in the environments, the eerie atmosphere, and the subtle storytelling through environmental cues immerse you in a world that's as captivating as it is dangerous. The dynamic lighting and particle effects add another layer of immersion, making every battle feel epic and intense.

The replay-ability of Remnant 2 is another factor that keeps me hooked. The game's procedural generation ensures that each play through is unique, with different maps, enemy placements, and loot drops. It's a game that encourages you to explore, experiment, and discover new secrets with each run.

In conclusion, Remnant 2 is a must-play for gamers who relish a challenge and are addicted to the thrill of hard-earned victory. It's a game that rewards perseverance, strategy, and teamwork while delivering an unforgettable gaming experience. With its breathtaking visuals, deep combat system, and co-op magic, Remnant 2 has firmly cemented its place as one of my all-time favorites. It's not just a game; it's an adrenaline-fueled journey that you won't want to miss. Grab your friends, sharpen your skills, and prepare to embark on an unforgettable adventure in Remnant 2!",1706547107,1706547107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Remnant 2 has bosses and encounters that i cant help but think were made with mainly co op in mind. Such as the dreaded CUBE!!! boss. Many bosses have either attacks that will down you in one hit or expect you to have someone else to take the heat off you. Leading to a feeling... almost like your missing something. But it goes beyond just bosses. The moment to moment fights in Remnant 2 are as in the first very well done and a great take on souls like with guns, but its everything else that gets in the way. Most times after i take down a few rooms of baddies i'm greeted with a puzzle that puts a dead-stop to the action and combat. Depending if you enjoy puzzles, the first time you see them you might enjoy them. The problem is they can either be a roadblock or in some cases downright punishing. For all the hard locations and hidden walls in Elden ring I never felt like a puzzle was shoved in my face with a gun to my head. This on top of the bosses makes the game feel like a chore to push past rather than a challenge to overcome.
There are a few more things i could talk about, weapons, locations or lackluster story but i think all of those are minor issues that most people could look past. For me its the core of the game that doesn't click. I cannot recommend it for anyone who was like me, looking for another difficult and engaging game to play solo, or looking for more Remnant 1.",1690553876,1706496732,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

co-op is drop in/drop out style, you get to keep all the gear you find, really the only issue I have with it is the fact that the game is graphics intensive and that can actually cause you crash when playing co-op.

as for the game play, I've actually never played Dark Souls. so working with Dark Souls style fighting was new. it feels very fresh and honestly they did an amazing job meshing those I-frame mechanics and the gun play. beating bosses is not at all straight forward and easy unless you have a solid understanding how to play the game but it is so extremely satisfying when you do.

everything in the game is a roll of dice, there's 3 whole other worlds and each has 2 (and now more with the new DLC) story arcs which are your first roll of dice. from there, it rolls which dungeons you'll have in these worlds then stitches together the overworlds of each realm based on those dungeons. THEN EVEN FURTHER DOWN there are different tile sets that can appear in dungeons (dev team calls them ""Injectibles"") and further change how the world looks. every time you play, the world is different.

aside from all that, the game does seem to crash more often on my now aging system(cries in gtx1060) but the game is absolutely stupendous about auto saves and along with it, has excellent cross experience for loot drops (if you grab it, you keep it, specific game mode does not matter not does story restarts, it's yours, Queen :D).

Very stuttery frames, and requires upscaling to be playable at all, which undermines the whole point making a game with good visuals and super detailed worlds/enemies, as all that detail is lost when upscaled. On top of that the graphics settings are very basic and don't offer any real compromise in quality to give you better performance, though that wouldn't help much with the frame stuttering.

Baseline gameplay mechanics so far work well and after a short familiarity phase has become pretty natural. Although, I'd say the tutorial is not great: Enemies move fast, and trying to get used to having to aim down sights to shoot (which slows your movement) while dodging enemy charges and projectiles all at once makes it feel harder than it is. This, I think, is mainly because the tutorial is basic movement, then an enemy swarm, then small sporadic mob attacks with 3 NPC helpers, then a boss fight. The combat ramp just feels uneven in the tutorial.

Also the tutorial doesn't explain multiple mechanics, which I only learned through loading screens: Shift while aiming swaps shoulder view, Alt crouches, Mouse Wheel OR X swaps weapons, Hold Left click without aiming to charge a melee attack... mechanics like that. By no means are all of these breaking, but rather annoying that they don't explain it directly despite the utility (it teaches X is swap weapons).

Bosses, aside the tutorial boss, have been difficult but manageable and generally fun. Except the Altars that summon poison spewing/exploding adds in waves for a melee weapon, that is pretty bad design (cramped quarters, tanky mobs that constantly drop stagger causing poison bombs, large numbers). Other than that, the boss fights have been pretty cool, with mechanics that can be figured out without looking anything up but not ""bland"". Boss runs after a death have been minor as well, and not really losing anything on death makes it feel more like ""Oh, yeah I gotta hide behind the pillar for that mechanic I think, let's try that"" instead of ""Oh fuck that bullshit, now I've gotta do all this shit again"".

The main hub definitely could use literally any indication who all the merchants are. I found the weapon merchant (who you talk to as part of the tutorial, but he doesn't show his shop at that time) about 7 hours in during coop, on accident. The Armor merchant I found just because I decided to talk to the weird looking guy.

Also, you are tied to a character from the start of the game, Cass, who comes off as fairly annoying. But this is because they don't establish her connection to you well; opening starts with you two walking and chatting, and your character apparently knows her for a while. But the player doesn't, and they don't really establish her to the Player... like, at all that I can see. She becomes a merchant and will scream at you constantly in the ward to talk to her during various story parts, which again just makes her super annoying because to the Player she's just a random other NPC. Like, seriously, you the Player know her about 10 minutes longer than the Weapon Upgrade guy (who from intro scene thought was the Medic Supplies guy) or the random Mayor dude that I don't think I interacted with beyond opening hub cutscene.

Anyway:

Game is pretty fun, definitely feel like a Souls-type game with a tweak on the combat structure. Bosses are good, areas are interesting, views are great, weapons are pretty neat, and so far build variety (that are... ugh... ""ViAbLe"" hate that gamer term) seems pretty open.

I imagine replayability is moderate at best, since areas are fully randomized, but it seems the order of appearance, availability, and occurrence of like... uh, side event(?) things is somewhat random so there is enough room to vibe around with friends doing random stuff I think.

The intro is clunky, and the way you acquire your first Archetype feels rushed and unsatisfying, but everything after that shines. 

Once you get into your first area map, you immediately feel the tension. This world is out to kill you, and lets you know you better take it seriously. From the jump, the combat is stiff and unforgiving, and has that Dark-Souls edge that I'd been looking for in a 3rd person shooter. 

The gun shots have weight and impact, and the melee weapons have a solidity to them that gives some bone-crunching feedback that feels great. Side note: there are so, so many cool weapons peppered throughout the various procedural maps, and it made me want to keep coming back for more. 

The level designs can be grueling, and playing them solo never fails to get my heart pumping. You don't know where the next save marker might be lurking, and dying before you reach the thing will send you back to where you started. True that loop can get a frustrating, but the elation I felt when I finally cleared a section made it worthwhile. 

The area bosses are seriously demanding, and you need to understand your load out if you're going to survive. And while I didn't always like some of the timing and telegraph decisions the devs made, I was able to learn them and slog through nonetheless. I will say that the mini-bosses and rank-and-file enemies were often more interesting to me (or at least more fun?), and I definitely had many heart-pounding encounters that stuck with me, and left me craving more. One minor grievance I have, is that this game sends sh*t flying at your from every angle, but doesn't have the best auditory cues, so you have to keep your head on a swivel when you're in the sh*t...

2) The aesthetics! It's hard to describe how beautiful the game is - it's a dark, apocalyptic, otherworldly and surrealist dreamscape - even across environmental ""genres"", from gothic to sci-fi to nature

3) The music is unbelievable and fits so well with the *feeling* of playing this game

4) the combat feels dire, gritty, and visceral; there is a ton of flexibility and creativity when it comes to play-styles and builds; exploration and attention to detail is meaningfully rewarded; the puzzles are genuinely engaging, intellectually and mechanically

Overall a very good experience, much smoother than the first game. Reommended to other co-op players.

- 4 very different worlds with their own lore
- Actual story campaign
- Actually worth replaying, as you can get entirely different main quest lines per world
- So many secrets, gear, build options
- Overall love to detail
- Challenging

The Bad:
- Some co-op bugs. Most severe: If one player picks up loot while the other player is dead, the dead player doesn't get the loot. I missed out on some unique items this way. Also, there were some disconnects but those were rare
- Lore mostly as (well spoken) dialogue. Co-op friend can't see dialogue option which the main player chose. Hard to follow as second player. No option to listen to lore while walking around - standing around can get a bit boring with two players.
- Impossible to discover some of the secrets without looking stuff up online (not too many fair hints - easy to miss). Often you're unknowingly making a decision which determines which item / weapon / ring you're getting out of it. If you want to get it, you'll need to re-roll the worlds, play again and hope you're lucky.

If you are a destiny refugee, this game will scratch many of the same itches that destiny does. There are some things you NEED to know before purchasing this game though:

1. As previously mentioned and stated in the tags, this game is a souls-like. That means there is no first person view and dodging attacks is very important in this game. Only very specific builds can get away with not needing to dodge attacks. 
2. Some of the items you receive in this game are broken. The fixes they release end up breaking more stuff. There are so many different stats and modifiers to those stats that this game will probably never be bug free. (Get A QA department Gunfire, seriously)
3. This game runs on the UE5 and 99% of the time it looks great. However, I need to mention that I have experienced some graphical glitches when it comes to terrain in certain areas. It is by no means game breaking and happens very rarely
 
That's out of the way, lets talk about the good stuff. 

Remnant's campaign is procedurally generated. Yup. You read that correctly. The overall story is the same across every campaign, and there are 2 worlds that will always appear as the 2nd and 5th world in your playthrough no matter what. I will not explain why because that involves spoilers, though the game's main story isn't much to write home about anyways. The other worlds you will find yourself on are generated randomly. The game has tiles similar to a warframe mission, but it uses that method to construct the worlds you will explore and the dungeons you will fight through. It is worth noting that not every item, dungeon, and boss you can encounter will spawn on a world. You will have to run through a world multiple times to encounter everything. 

Remnant 2 has 11 classes (currently, expect more) and you can equip 2 at a time. Some classes are built around taking damage, some are built around dealing damage with your guns or status effects, some are about healing, and some are about using mods (mods explained next paragraph). All of these classes are unique and equally viable.

The buildcrafting in Remnant 2 is very intuitive and easy to pick up. You have armor, which affects your damage resistance (DR) and how fast you can roll. You have a primary weapon ( a long gun like a sniper, shotgun, ar, lmg, and the rest), you have a secondary weapon (revolver, sidearm, smg, etc), and you have a melee weapon. Each normal gun has a mod slot, which gives the weapon an ability that recharges with kills that can add acid onto your bullets or create a fire tornado. They also have mutator slots, which affect the guns behavior in some way. Think increasesdfire rate, critical chance, etc. You have a relic, which can be used as a health potion or can grant passive healing or can grant defensive buffs like shields. Relics have 3 slots for relic fragments and relic fragments give small bonuses to almost every stat in the game. 

Then you have trinkets. Oh boy. You have 1 amulet slot and 4 ring slots. These grant powerful bonuses that will define your built once you have enough to start crafting one. They are too varied to explain here but trinkets are very important. Last but not least, you have attributes. You have 85 attribute points that you can put into whatever you want. Want to dodge with the heaviest armor in the game? Go for it. Want to passively regenerate health and have life steal? Go for it. Want to make your dodge faster than your sprint? Its possible. You have to unlock attributes though. Some come from reaching the max level in classes but most will come from completing challenges or secret puzzles in the worlds. 

Bosses in Remnant are top tier. The final boss of the game is one of the best boss fights I have ever played, though having a good build in the late-game trivializes everything. The bosses are certainly not as difficult as other soulslikes but they are no cakewalk. Most worldbosses are incredibly cinematic.


I may be forgetting some stuff but I have completed 100% of this game (and at the time of writing I intend to 100% the DLC's to come). I have every item, every weapon, every mod, every achievement, and have beat every boss on every difficulty including HC. I obviously like the game very much and believe it is worth buying and playing. Hope this was informative :)

The game has a lot of variation in enemies and surroundings, which makes for fun gameplay. The graphics and sound effects are good and makes for a fun time.

Unfortunately the game also contains several very frustrating elements. Throughout the game, you won't find any new weapons or armor, but will find huge amounts of rings. 

You are expected to upgrade your existing starter weapons, which you do by gathering crafting materials and using those materials to increase weapon damage ever so slightly. If you are lucky and find the right crafting materials, you may be able to purchase a single new weapon, before completing the game.

Gameplay often requires you to heal or reload your weapons to stay alive. Doing so makes you vulnerable for the 5 second duration it takes to complete the action and dodging or jumping, to avoid getting killed, will reset that duration. 

If your weapon overheats, you are forced to finish for the overheating animation to finish, before being able to either change to another weapon or use the weapon again. During those 5 seconds, you can't do anything except slowly walk around.

If you get hit by an enemy, you will often get stunned. While stunned you have to wait for the stun animation to finish animating, before you are able to control your body again. If you get attacked during those 5 seconds, you will get downed again or get killed.

The game heavily evolves around boss fights. Bosses will continuously hammer you with melee weapons, which has a 50 meter range and if you don't dodge the weapon at the exact right time or if you run out of dodge/sprint power, you will get hit and you will be stunned. If you dodge, you won't be able to see where you are dodging to. Dodging into a deadly pool on the ground will stun you or damage you, making boss fights even more frustrating.

The game would be greatly improved by removing stun mechanics, removing the required wait duration for animations complete, reducing boss melee attacks to melee range, massively speeding up reload, heal and special ability action durations and adding some new weapons and armor drops to the game.",1706188815,1706188815,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Positives[/h1]
+I love that you can wear 4 rings at once, most rings are impactful, and this is where a lot of build variety comes from (along with amulets).
+Dungeons have a lot of secrets and cleverly hidden stuff. Some dungeons also have different layouts yielding new secrets and items.
+There's a lot of places to explore and things you can do.
+The couple bosses I beat were actually fun and challenging. They also significantly toned back the regular enemies bosses spawn compared to the first game. However it's still lazy design for almost if not all bosses to spawn regular enemies.
+The map is amazing and properly shows the terrain as well as where you haven't explored yet. Makes me think of Metroid Prime. Why don't more game do maps like this?
+No penalties for death unless you're on hardcore obviously. This takes away some of the frustration of the BS in the game.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
-I don't feel in control of the combat flow or how things unfold. When you're getting swarmed dodging doesn't do anything except let them get closer because you're not shooting. And your backwards pace is slow, nor can you sprint backwards with the camera facing forward. This means elite melee enemies combined with other enemies spamming ranged shots at you equals an unfun time. So try to sprint away and put distance between you, but then they hit you with their own ranged attack. No I don't want to be forced to use the neutral backstep dodge, that is awful gameplay design forcing that on people.
-The above is exacerbated by the fact that enemies can and will spawn behind you. Lazy design, and clearly meant for co-op.
-Melee elite enemies are cancer and should not exist in a game where you shoot 99% of the time and have limited escape options. There's only 1 archetype that is melee focused. The rest of the time you're shooting, and as previously discussed your options for disengaging melee combat are extremely limited.
-The AI is dumb and doesn't seem capable of acquiring new targets. I cheesed a melee boss because my handler dog was blocking the doorway and the boss was completely ignoring it and trying to get to me but failing. So I let my dog chew on him for a minute getting his health almost gone then I finished him off. Why did the boss not start attacking the minion? You see this other times when a melee elite is chasing you as several of your minions are slowly whittling away its health and it completely ignores them.
-Archetypes aka classes are boring. You can level them up and get some minor bonuses but once they are leveled to 10 there's nothing else to do with them. Each archetype has 3 active skills you can alternate between at any time, but that's it. no skill trees or anything to make this stuff unique, nor is there any kind of real end goal. It's very basic and shallow.
-The overall gameplay loop is also boring. There's not much to it besides hoping you find rings/amulets that fit with your playstyle. You find them... and now what? There's not really anything else to do. You're killing the same enemies over and over to get resources to upgrade your weapons so you don't fall behind the level scaling, but otherwise your gameplay and how you do encounters remains the exact same. 10 hours I played the game and absolutely nothing changed with how I did combat.
-Armor is super boring and has no special effects; just damage reduction and status resistances.
-The puzzles are dumb and boring. Most of them seem to come down to figuring out the correct symbols and then inputting them. Riveting. I was far more impressed with the secret passages cleverly hidden behind pots and things like that. Also there's secret walls, but to give them credit they make a distinctive sound and when you get close you can see the texture moving. You can then simply pass through them. No Dark Souls 1 BS here. But there's other puzzles like traps that instakill you, and invisible walkways. All this stuff slows down the game and draws you out.
-Encounters are formulaic and dumb. People in the forums are telling the truth when they say each encounter feels the same, because it does.
-That girl you start the game with is extraordinarily annoying, but it's obvious the devs expect you to think she's cool and strong. She's not, she's rude and a capital B. Thank goodness she's gone from the story after the tutorial and becomes an unimportant merchant.
-Speaking of I don't really care for any of the characters actually. They're all generic and boring. Although those aliens are kind of interesting.
-Going off that the story is boring and uninteresting, but at least more effort was put into presenting it than your usual Souls-like, although I hear the payoff and reveals are disappointing or plain bad.
-Weapons aren't all that interesting and the mods you get for them which add a special ability are ok, but not enough to hold interest. There is a shooting range to test your weapons and see the dps, something the vast majority of Souls-likes bafflingly don't do.

Ultimately I don't feel that sense of player skill progression that I do in melee-focused Souls-likes such as Lords of the Fallen (2023). In those the melee never gets boring because you are constantly improving your tactics against the various enemies. In Remnant 2 there's not much more to do than stand and shoot at things. We needed skill trees and real build variety like an ARPG.

So if you're still interested, it's not an awful game, it just may not hold your interest for long especially if you're a solo player. Wait for a heavy sale if you must get this.",1706163281,1706163281,False,1,0,0.44951137900352478,2,True,False,False

Of course, this wasn't guaranteed and if I'm honest I kind of like the original a little better.  The problem is that while the sequel has a lot of changes that are genuinely for the better, it still *feels* very much the same and so I don't really compare mechanics so much as atmosphere and I liked the places in From the Ashes a little more.  I think it's because they were fresh and new, and so even if places like Yaesha look great here, one can't get away from the feeling of ""been here, done this.""

It's kind of a small complaint but maybe the most real problem a sequel can face: the plot isn't quite as interesting here, I don't feel like we really get some payoff we might have liked from the original, and while I don't think Remnant ever had a particularly strong cast of characters this is a place where, at best, Remnant 2 hasn't improved things.  So it really is a mechanical upgrade for the most part and while you have more development options ... I'm also not really convinced they matter all that much.

Let's not kid ourselves or anything.  Remnant has stellar combat feel and gunplay.  This is why I like it, this is what has always gotten me hooked.  But class development, upgrading your weapons and whatnot, it's nice to have but I can't say that I *genuinely* feel it in the moment to moment gameplay.  I often find myself ignoring special powers and mods because I don't really need them a lot of the time.  This, again, speaks to how good the core combat feels by itself, but it's why I can't be quite as enthusiastic about the sequel despite what appears some fairly interesting upgrades.  You can now dual-class, you have more mods and mutators for your weapons, and of course there's even more guns to choose from!  It is a solid game, but it's an okay sequel if that makes sense.

Still, the play time is no lie: the game is still fun to play.  There are still interesting stories in these worlds to find.  I may not be quite as enthusiastic about it as a sequel, but as a game Remnant is fun and engaging.  I can recommend that pretty easily.",1706156593,1706156593,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The level design is pretty good, but the standout to me is the enemy design (in terms of combat flow,) I did not get bored fighting any of the enemies in the game, they did a good job with giving you stuff to shoot, even the bosses are generally fun to fight.

There is a lengthy list of downsides that go along with the praise though, the story is worthless, it's basically there to excuse the ""starting over"" mechanic, unfortunately this does sort of retract from the ""do I care"" aspect about this game, because generally, no, I don't really care about this game and I don't see myself sticking with it for very long.  However that's not a terrible thing, I definitely feel that I got my money's worth (bought it on sale) and I do enjoy it.   The other major downside I don't mind whinging about boils down to ""the game is stingy"", specifically with upgrade materials/money. I'm constantly broke and I only really have one set of weapons that are leveled up at any given point, this is strange since you get so many different weapons to try, but I guess the devs envisioned you'd play this thing for 900 hours or something....no thanks.

Exploration-wise there's an awful lot of stuff I know I haven't seen or have missed, some of which seems very obtuse, for example if you kill a certain animal in one of 4 different ways you can miss out on some (better than what I got) loot.

Now, I'm going to make this review extremely personal, and as such, I do not recommend this game. However, I wouldn't call it a bad game, I'd say this is a 7/10 I did not like.

While Remnant 2 offers an interesting blend of genres, in my opinion, it is dragged down by an extremely repetitive gameplay loop, very low enemy and gameplay variety, generic visual design and an extremely uninspired and uninteresting story and universe. 

The game starts fun, and its procedural design shines at the start. Levels are complex and have several secrets. However, even as far as the first large zone, you'll start seeing the dreadful enemy variety, minimal AI in the enemies, and repetitive visual design. This whole game is basically held together by competent shooting mechanics and a compelling difficulty curve that can be hard at the start but is rewarding to dominate.

The final third of the game is also the final nail in the coffin. The repetitiveness of scenarios and enemies, uninteresting level design, recycling of content and a seemingly endless gauntlet right at the end became nigh unbearable. The final enemies are quite challenging, but you can do it with some practice. I got to the final phase of the final enemy of the game, until basically boredom was intolerable, and I had to drop it. 

Please note this is my experience as a single player, I have not engaged in multiplayer, which I suspect could be quite fun.

Overall, as I said before, this is a game that starts on a good note, but never fully capitalizes on its strengths and plateaus rather quickly, only to never peak, and drop into a swamp at the endgame. The story is also completely forgettable and is unlike fromsoftware games, lacks a potent hook of mystery to lead the player forward.

On the technical side the game isn't nearly as pretty as it is demanding, and Unreal Engine 5 isn't utilized well in my opinion.

7/10. Competent, but definitely didn't like it.",1705900858,1705900858,False,3,0,0.513533949851989746,0,True,False,False

I wish to god I could recommend this game. The gameplay is amazing and it runs at a very solid 100fps with almost no stutters on medium/high settings for me. My single, dealbreaking issue is the fact that I cannot make it even 10 minutes without crashing to desktop. I've tried everything from altering game settings, game files, PC settings, compatability, administrator settings, underclocking my GPU, and even monitoring my system's performance using Lasso. My rig has ZERO temp or voltage spikes, but the game simply dies. I have no issues with any other game I play and this is apparently a known issue since release with the internet absolutely flooded with complaints about the same issue I'm having. I have very little hope the devs actually care about making this a priority with it being released in July and this still being an issue in January.

There is also a HUGE amount of build variety which makes this game very fun to come back to time and again. It is also very easy to reconfigure builds and character stats without loses anything so the game encourages you to try new things and experiment.

My only criticism would be that a few of the puzzles are WAY too obtuse and obscure.

THE BEST BOSS FIGHTS IN ANY GAME EVER. Can't even put to words how the last boss fight felt like.

[*]One of the best co-ops ever (the overall co-op experience can be a bit rough with randoms because of the lack of in-game chat, but with friends its awesome)
[*]Good room for trying and coming up with new builds that each play differently and have unique characteristics;
[*]I wouldn't play for the story because its a bit shallow, but gameplay makes up for it. This can actually be a pro if you just want to have some good time without having to worry if you're missing stuff or don't wanna bother with meaningless lore. That said some of the world building elements and npcs you come across set the tone of the adventure pretty well.
[*]Exploration is rewarding without being tiring. There are numerous secret/hidden puzzles and passages, some simple, some clever.
[*]Great replayability, as the campaign is ""procedurally generated"".

This game is nothing short of a masterpiece, combining elements from its predecessor with stunning innovations that elevate the entire experience to a whole new level.

The gameplay mechanics are nothing short of revolutionary. The combat system is fluid, dynamic, and responsive, providing an unparalleled sense of satisfaction when taking down hordes of challenging foes. The addition of new weapon types and abilities further deepens the strategic aspect of the game, keeping me constantly engaged and on the edge of my seat.

The level design is a true work of art. The world feels interconnected and alive, with hidden secrets and challenging puzzles to discover around every corner. The randomized elements ensure that no two playthroughs are alike, adding significant replay value to an already content-rich game.

Probably the only two downsides which are worth mentioning are the limited allocatable trait points (capped at 60 for no reason), and the dodgy performance across various systems. As the devs stated, they designed the game around the use of DLSS/FSR, but the game still could have used more manual tuning of which according to the devs will happen with upcoming patches / fixes. So at least it seems that they are listening to the community feedbacks, and trying to resolve the issues as fast as possible.

In conclusion, if you liked / loved the first game, you can't go wrong with this one.

Update as of 2024 January the 20th, and after 100+ hours of gameplay:
With the release of the DLC they increased the trait cap to 85, and added the Loadout function, therefore with these additions the game offers much more variety, and with the Loadouts we don't have to manually change our gear anymore, which is a great plus, especially if you're playing multiple builds, or just simply want to experiment around with various gear. The performance somewhat improved, but there's still a lot of room for improvement. Especially with the new DLC map, there are still ongoing issues with fps spikes, and stutters, and playing in coop sometimes makes it worse. They released some Hotfixes however to mitigate the performance issues which are mainly derived with the release of the DLC, so the situation is not as bad as it was before, but still needs some obvious fixing.

I'm a dead man walking! :)

It is hard, especially in the beginning. As you and your character get stronger the difficulty curve eases out. Then you encounter a hard boss and your wind is kicked out of you. You practice and strategize and over come it. You beat the game and you go again with even harder difficulty. The gameplay loop works really well and every run can present something new still after 65 hours. You have quite a lot of freedom fleshing out your character build and you can unlock many different classes. Tons of things to find and upgrade to refine your build. On top of this some tracks on the soundtrack absolutely slap.

There are some bugs in the game like the map not working correctly sometimes and AI getting stuck. In some areas the performance drops noticeably (labyrinth is the most obvious). Some puzzles and secrets are impossible to solve or find without a guide (at least for me). Even ones that are necessary for driving the main campaign. Still these are minor things if you can look past these!

+ Top tier co-op game.
+ Awesome character build options.
+ Fun gameplay loop.
+ Atmospheric.

Just use Intel upscaler if you are on AMD GPU it works (somewhat) better. There is a lot of minor bugs that can get annoying over time but nothing completely game-breaking in my case.

Now with bad stuff out of the way... this game is really good. The gunplay feels and sounds extremely good. There is a lot of options for the player to create a unique build. Classes feel pretty diverse and unique. 

The main story is sort of meh. However the individual worlds that you visit have some interesting lore and characters.

Bosses are interesting with challenging mechanics and usually have two variants which change how they fight dramatically.

The loot from enemies in this game is mostly upgrade materials and ammo. Most of the equipable items are found in the overworld, made trough crafting or doing some hidden ""quests"". 

Remnant 2 has so many cool hidden ""quests"" and challenges but some of them are very hard to complete and you are forced to use a guide and a 3rd party software to see if your world roller in a specific way.

The final boss is one of the worst encounter designs I have seen in ANY video game.  It is a flurry of particle effects that ruin any joy in the encounter.  How miserable the last boss is massively changed my opinion of the game.  Previous bosses were 'pretty awful but whatever' - The final boss was a masterclass in what not to do at every...single...choice.

ill start off by saying this: i played the hell out of Remnant FTA, i played it until there was nothing left to do, and nearly 200 hours under my belt; when Remnant 2 was announced, i was over the moon! it looked so awesome with the addition of classes and the abilities they came with, multiclassing between them for cool combos, i was just excited for more Remnant gameplay. with that in mind, i was very disheartened to see what this game turned out to be, and i wanted to like this game SO damn bad. and trust me when i say this, my disappointment allong with this negative review comes from my love for the first game, and how this one just doesnt measure up by far in my opinion.
the first thing i want to touch on is the worlds, Yaesha is cool, i honestly liked it for the most part and it was cool to see the non-rebel Pan, even if it was kind of lacking in terms of their story and such. the labyrinth was super cool, im glad that they made it more of an explorable area and even had weapons/armor you could get there, the block bois are also super cute. the next 2 worlds i find are polar opposites, Ne'Rud i find to be very, very cool in terms of design, the lore and overall feel; however, it is super ass to play. everything looks like nothing, its a big open, neverending wasteland with very few visual....anything, except for the custodians house. the enemies here are mostly fine, except for the density is pretty annoying, mostly because you'll be struggling to find anything while constantly being attacked by droids or zombie dudes, and god forbid the meatball, what a crap enemy that thing is. in essence, the area is kinda just a chore to play. on to Losomn, this area feels great to play in, the enemy density is just right, it is relatively linear without being too hand holding, the visuals are nice and you can actually spot landmarks; but like, it just doesnt feel alien, at least the first half and even kind of the second half. its just 18th century England with vampires. everything is human here, they tell time the same (big clock tower), they have human tools, human buildings, human weapons...everything. they even speak english, not as in they know it, english is legit their language as far as im aware (could be wrong and willing to be). it just doesnt feel alien, its like being on slight fantasy earth, which i feel like that defeats the purpose of travelling to different worlds.
next ill get on to gear and such starting with the weapons, the guns are mostly fine, i did find that some of them are a little too weird, like the ghostly finger rifle; but thats just personal prefference. melee weapons on the other hand i believe could have been a lot better, and should have been. most of them dont have a unique trait, and if they do its pretty mid. it basically just boils down to the damage number and moveset attached to the weapon, with moveset in mind, i found that the melee movesets were also kind of lacking, in the first game, there was a different attack for just about every different movement option in the game (running, dodging, backstep, etc) in this the same attack is used in multiple movement options, and most of the weapons only have a 2 hit combo, whereas in the first game, all weapons were at least 3, and the charged attacks felt a lot better and usually came with a different animation; unlike in 2 where its the same animation, just with some more effort in it. and as a big fan of unarmed melee builds in the first game; i felt personally attacked when i discovered that unarmed builds are basically not a thing, even when using accessories that boost unarmed effectiveness. speaking of melee builds, sure you can do them but i find its really only viable when your playing challenger and using juggernaut, otherwise you just get overwhelmed by surprisingly small amounts of enemies and promptly defeated. which i think in general is pretty lame. 

On to armor now; i think it was a really weird decision to make armor un-upgradeable, coupled with the fact that enemies do incredible amounts of damage in this game, most regular enemies will 2/3 shot you no matter what and even with the fortify trait and Leto's you can basically take an extra 2 hits if your lucky and it'll just be like this for the entire game; it basically leads to using armor for the looks rather than what it does. speaking of ""what it does"", they no longer have armor traits, they tried to replace this with the mutators and such, but they just dont measure up to the armor traits from the first game in my opinion, either too small of a bonus, or the bonus should have just been a trait.

On to accessories: i found that most of the accessories didnt offer a big enough or accessable enough bonus, not saying they need to be goated, but a lot of them were just ""okay"" and nothing that you could synergize with other rings or make builds out of; they were basically weak add-ons. and some were hard to access actual usage out of, for example i remember me and the bois found a bleed focused one, but never saw a bleed weapon for a looooong ass time or even another ring/amulet to make enemies bleed through normal means. i could be wrong about the accessories, but thats just the short of how i felt about them.
Lets talk about traits now. idk what the heck was going through their heads when they made this system, but it is easily the worst part about the game. in the first game there was 100 traits, in this one i believe theres around 30 or so, bearing in mind that the first game has DLC there are still far fewer traits even at launch by comparison. further than that the trait cap is 65. this leads to some big issues; one being that there is no grind to get all the traits. trait grinding is easily a lot of my hours in the first game and just some fun bonus to get along the way while trying to get other things, such as more traits or hard to get gear which there was a lot more to go out and get btw. second, some traits are just must haves, which means that builds become too similar and other traits are just never used, such as area traversal speed. the trait system being the way it is, really kills the game.
Lets look at the bosses. the bosses, save for a select few (looking at you abomination) are pretty good. i do believe having an insta kill move doesnt really add anything to the game, mostly because of the main problem; nearly every boss has the goon squad on back up for the whole fight, and its just tedious. im all for having adds in boss fights, but when the difficulty of the boss is prevalent only because of the adds, its just mediocre design. and im down for a difficult boss, ive been around the block with video games, i can do difficulty; but artificial difficulty, coming from adds, semi-quick insta kills, tedious boss design, or outright cheesy ""hah got em"" garbage thats just unfun to deal with; is just extremely boring to me. all that to say, the bosses are good, but some of them are tedious/boring, and others are downright unforgiveable. in contrast to a lot of the playerbase, i found the final boss really fun btw.
ive probably forgotten some points i wanted to make, but this is getting long. all this to say, i dont think this game is all the hype people seem to think it is. in my eyes, its everything the first game was and less. in some big ways and small ones. it takes too much away wthout giving enough back, its not equivalent exchange. some things are good, but a lot of things are far from it or uninspired. like it said in the beginning, i wanted to love this game, and never in a million years did i think i would write a negative review about it; but it let me down, pretty hard. theres barely replayability, no grind, less items to get, few good items to obtain. its just alright. and i believe it should have been better.",1705731067,1705731067,False,16,0,0.514422774314880371,3,True,False,False

Good challenge. It's a difficult game, so expect to die a llot, but it's never felt cheap. 
Visually impressive
Great soundtrack and sound effects
Good mix of skills and builds
Seemingly endless replayability
It's been relatively stable... I think I've only had one crash 
Lots of secrets (but see the ""CON"" component of this


CONS:
Although the secrets are cool, if you are a completionist, you might find it annoying that you'll have to roll the dice and rely on RNG to get what you need. Some of the secrets are so obscure that they were only discovered by data mining. Though that's not necessarily a bad thing, it means that you need to have a browser window open for YouTube videos and the Wiki. BTW, the WIKI leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe I'm just spoiled being a Warframe veteran... that's a Wiki that sets the gold standard. Not completely the devs fault, obviously.... though a smart studio would partner with content creators to make sure a game like this has a good Wiki. 

As cool as the build options are, there's no way to store  loadouts, so it's a real chore to switch between them. Plus you'd have to reset your trait points to fully min/max a build. Doable, but it costs resources and takes a lot of time. I hope they add this... frankly I'm shocked it was not there to begin with.

Man, this game needs some optimization. As many others have noted, good luck running this on a budget gaming PC. I have a 5950x/4080/64gb ram and I still get frame dips below 60FPS.... and I'm not even maxing out settings. Replace ""can it run Crysis?"" with ""Can it run Remnant 2?""

A joy after beat or toy around those bad dungeon design from 6 years old. If you like kind of feeling, it's quite good. 6.5/10 good on sales.

I'll be honest here first. I'm not good enough for great player. I'm average player try to be cool in hard game. I die a lot in each soul game. I enjoy overcome those obstacle. I do recommend R2, but...

You ever heard IWNBTG or Mario Neko? R2 pretty much like that, but turn down by half. It's a trial and error fest slap with soul-like and LEVEL SCALING THAT EVERYONE LOVE AND MUST HAVE IT. (Even with difficulty selection, adventure mode, minimum level to use as balance..... GG DEV ISSUE.)

I don't hate trial and error. But I don't think its work here. Mistake are mean to learn and overcome it. But most of my dead in R2 never make me feel like I just miss it or want to learn why I die. I just ... WTFox? like sometime get OHK from 100% but try again and hit for 40% or wow .... you just doing this cheap? its keep happen almost all the time.

I'm pretty sure that Dev feel like if they can make player suffer for unfair, they WILL do. (for non-boss encounter only) and let's everyone cast git gud magic to those who fail instead of try to make it interesting, fun and enjoyable fight moment. Seriously, I never find random encounter with a cool moment in R2. Unlike other game that some how I just give a thumb up for how awesome or clever trap/encounter it is.
(Script one like Alchemist stone is another story.)

I also disappoint how small pool of world we can explore. Even DLC is still on the same old world! (with the same BORING story) In this kind of world travelling. You can expand a lot of world, even make it shorter but require more to explore. Those variety greatly improve replayability and make it more interesting. You want to see more of this game can offer. 

A lot of QoL/function are missing that make R2 less enjoyable... like text chat in co-op, unstable netcode, kick to main menu when disconnect, not share ammo drop, scaling system, boost up power level when someone join, buff to much HP/dmg when co-op, hit register on host side include projectile from other player, low scrab, etc. Seriously, this is pretty much on par with Payda* 2 without mod to help fix it back in ancient age.

Well, I do hope dev put more effort to improve the game and release better dlc. Cuz right now its half good with huge mass. It's really sad to see this much potential go to N'erud.",1705545396,1705545396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Neither me nor my coop friends had any technical or hardware issues. Game ran pretty smooth across our range of rigs and the coop experience also worked well, no connection issues, desyncs, lag etc

Clearly a lot of work into this game. But I cannot recommend it for two major flaws: 

1) Every enemy encounter is an ambush. So it is impossible to be tactical with how you approach a battle, when enemies spawn randomly 5ft behind you. It makes battles feel cheap, when you are fighting then suddenly new enemies spawn behind you out of nowhere. It ruins any strategic gameplay. 

2) Enemies always out-scale you in progression. So what is the point in progressing, when enemies are always 1-3 levels above you? Seems pointless to me; no souls game does this.

The guns feel good to use, I like the class system, the ability to have two classes at once is cool, the two new worlds are interesting and the stories that revolve around them are interesting enough.

but there's a lot I really don't like and it overall ruins the experience of the game for me

While i do like the new class system the overall character building feels like a downgrade from the first game, The traits are very squashed down and you are now limited by the number of points you can spend overall and the types of traits you can get I.E. what they do, it feels more limited in how you make a character because there is just an objectively few good traits you will always run. 

The armour has changed to no longer have perks or buffs assigned to them now it's just Armour, Weight, and resistance, which means much like the traits there is just objectively a correct few sets to wear, giving you the best Armour and Resistance to Weight, so again it takes away for choice when building a character.

Now the builds overall can be very fun, but now the games have been out for some time I've watched as a lot of the more silly and gimic build have been Nerf or removed which is bonkers to me, in a purely PVE non-live severs game why the devs felt the need do this is mind blogging, now i hear the argument, ""oh it made the game to easy or it wasn't intended to be used like that"" AND? let me say again this is a 100% PVE game, who cares if the game is too easy? if that's what you find fun then congrats Devs you made a fun game, if it was PVP or a bug or exploit then i would understand, but as it stands its just falls under the mindset of ""this isn't how we wanted you to play, your not having fun the way we intended"".

Unlocks in this game are unnecessarily hard or convoluted and with no indecision on what to do or how to do it, this is a game where replaying the worlds and making new runs inbuilt into the core of the game play and that's fine, but when i need a wiki open just to understand what i need to do for even a change at something, not to say anything of a third party tool just to make sure i don't waste 2 hours in a world that doesn't even have the one thing im looking for that bad game design, saying nothing of the whole ass class that people NEEDED to data mine for because there was no way of find out the info otherwise 



Now for the worst bit in my opinion is the story, the Main story to be precise, no sugar coating it, its hot garbage, some of the worst, confused, cut-together writing I've ever seen, the cuts in the main story are so clear that it's painful and the plot holes are miles across, some of my Favs
-Cass is cured of her Root sickness (How? When? Just because we got to ward 13?)
-Ford has a magic Cube (why? Who's this old friend who gave it to him? Where does he go?)
-Clementine has magic ""anti"" root powers (didn't explain from the first game, doesn't here)
-The Keeper in general (Starts as an Eye, turns into a more human shape, not explained, and apparently has developed a relationship with Clementine over the game, ah yes all three times we see them)

 Oh and [spoiler]we're in the matrix now[/spoiler]

The real nail in the coffin for me was the name of the final boss, it just showed me that no one on the writing really cared about what was going on here a damn shame as the story of these games is pretty cool and has a lot of chance for good writing

a lot of what I've said here was taking into how I played the game, as of writing I've beat the game on all but Apocalypse, and you could make the argument of saying ""oh but i don't care about the story or the grinding for items i just want to play a run"" OK that's fair and valid, but do you really think its ok paying $60 for four hours of gameplay? because that's how long a single run takes, if you are great, more power too you, but this game very much wants you to do multiple runs and to do that grind 


Over all and at the end of the day did i have fun playing this game? Yes it was fun with friends

So if your looking to buy it, wait for a sale and make sure you have friends to play with, it makes the whole thing a hell of lot more enjoyable

The visuals are amazing, the archetype-skillsets are pretty cool and every single one of them is useful - there is no way one says ""This or that archetype is bullshit and useless"".
I loved the riddles that were to be found, it took us quite some time to figure them out, honestly sometimes we had to google just to realize we were pretty much stupid. Yet to achieve the ""Carnage in C Minor"" achievement was horrible. We did indeed google it because it would only have been trial and error for us. 

The endboss took us several hours and we didn't even play on the highest difficulty at that time. It was unique it its level-design. Definitely hard to beat alone, I'm glad we did it duo. 

Sadly The Awakened King DLC is required to get it to 100% achievement-wise, unless you have a friend that plays with you who hosts the lobby and has the DLC. I'm not too sure if the DLC is required to craft the Ritualist-Archetype, but you only get the item from the DLC-content. But since you cannot use any dropped items from the DLC-content if you don't have it,  I assume it works the same with the Archetype-material.

The game is offering you the opportunity to re-roll levels in the adventure-mode, yet you have to pray to the RNG-God when it comes to the DLC, because some achievements took us a lot of time, because we didn't get the biomes we needed, so we ended up playing longer than we should have because we just weren't lucky (or we weren't praying enough lol).

After a classic 9h session on this game (yes we need a life), the game crashed 1 - 2 times due to frozen screens. I play with a RTX 4070TI and a general good setup, and it took roughly 90% of my GPU.

okay see, its shit like this. it is shit like this. mantagora. a boss that is not hostile and it flies around a huge skybox and avoids fighting you. fucking 70 minutes of running around this stupid ass map guessing where the fuck the boss is, because it 'disappears and reappears', you cannot follow it because it despawns and respawns depending where the player is on the map. 70 minutes of chasing this fucking moron and on my 23rd lap of the fucking map and i die from falling off the map.
so much tedious bullshit in an otherwise great game, just let me fight the fucking boss dude, why the hell do i have to chase this bitch down when it doesnt even follow the laws of nature. it's an atrocious time waste like a bunch of the other content in the game. just make shit not tedious and not a time waste. how fucking hard is it.",1704361311,1705208629,False,0,5,0.402684539556503296,3,True,False,False

When you die, there is no punishment. You see loot, it is little scraps(the games currency). No sense of accomplishments at all when finding a chest. All the chest and even the gold ones contain very little scrap. You are stuck with the same armor throughout the whole game and you get the best weapon so early on. Where is the sense of prevailing and overcome? The games gun mechanics is nice and tight. The melee is okay, just wish there was a locking system to the targets.

That being said I have played Destiny, Destiny 2 (2k plus hours), Dead Space, Diablo 4, every Halo entry, COD and a variety of other notable titles. I will heavily compare and contrast this to Destiny 2 being the most prominent game I've played. 
     Gameplay.
     So, as a shooter goes, it feels very intuitive and input friendly. I started on M&K but switched to PS4 input fairly early on. Both input methods felt approachable and relatively easy, given the assumed difficulty of the title. The hit boxes seem pretty clean both offensively and defensively. The movement range is a nice even pace, leaving only timing and mechanical understanding to be the gates. The Archetypes, weapons, relics, mods and various equipment are very well described and easy to utilize. Having played FPS's primarily it was a pretty easy transition. I would like to add that similar to D2 it seems ranged and melee damage types have fairly balanced capabilities in regards to their ease of use and efficacy. Suffice to say, you have a lot of flexibility in how you decide to deal damage.
     Buildcraft Potential. 
     I, in my infancy with the game, see this as having sustainability long term in regards to the various ways you're able to play. 4 starting Archetypes, granting a second along the way and a number of ""secret"" ones help to flesh out your unique gameplay loop. There doesn't seem to be a limit to how many types you can acquire, or level on a given account, so the world is yours to seize. Combine this with the elemental affixes and jewelry and you have a large pool to pick from. I would argue that this game is less redundant in this sense than D2 because of the uniqueness and power fantasy of each Archetype. 
     Loot. 
     The loot is great. A bunch of super convoluted secrets hidden away in normal activities for those willing to spend the extra time. You're not bogged down by a bunch of trash gear or gold sinks, just new unique items to fit into your build. The resource scarcity is just enough to make you thoughtful about what you upgrade, but ultimately doesn't hinder your ability to play the game. There is a nice combination of obvious regular upgrades and hidden ones to please both the casual player and the completionist. I enjoyed not having to sift through 100 rolls of the same item only for a marginal upgrade. Each piece offers something unique and otherwise unattainable.
     Environment/Sound.    
     Stellar environments with significant differences between worlds/biomes. Not incredibly interactive but not static either. Visually pleasing on high graphical settings and very immersive. My PC defaulted to ""high"" settings but upon manually moving them up to ""ultra"" I didn't notice any significant performance issues. The sky boxes are very well rendered and represent the best of what I appreciated about D2. 
     This game has some of the best sound scoring I've heard in a game. Atmospheric, peaceful, haunting and tense. It's hard to equate it to something, but essentially it doesn't distract you from the gameplay. Once you notice it's very agreeable, especially in patrol zones or open world. I would argue that it has the most insightful music to environment pairing of any game I've played. 
     Final Rating.
     At the time of writing I have 27 hours in. Not a long time but enough time. Given everything I've previously considered I would personally give Remnant II a 9/10. To some it may be generous, to others underwhelming, but given the depth, content, replayability, diversity, design and sticker price, I think it is worthy of the score. Think of how Diablo 4 launched. At $70 USD.... This game has content.

The idea of hidden classes you can unlock is also awesome, although this ties in to a negative I have of the game.
Gun play solid as ever, loved in Rem 1 and love it here, better melee options and mods seem similar but better here.
Awesome that now you can wear armor not for a perk bonus set but also as a fashion statement now.
The introduction of different hear relics and modifiers make the game have way more varied and interesting options.

The only two negatives I have for the game is the amount of ""Secrets"" that get annoying. The secrets seem to have secrets and are not always that well explained or even easy to find. 
The last boss phase is a nightmare as it switch from one to another and there are too may unnecessary effects that make it a visual overload, made the fight cheap and more difficult than it really needed.

It plays very similarly to the first game but with more focus on class roles versus just general equipment. With your classes determining your playstyle and ability, it makes for some very interesting combinations. At first I was extremely disappointed I could not don the full cultist set and spam the bubble shield with hunters mark, but as I progressed I found the many minor perks you gain from your classes more than make up for the lack of armor bonuses. As I entered the lategame a plethora of options opened to me, and my build became genuinely fun to play. This game starts off like shit, I won't sugarcoat it. The story is contrived and the voice acting is decent at best, but the actual gameplay is where it shines. The addition of a wide variety of dragon hearts is quite a cool touch, but somewhat lackluster when you consider 90% of them are niche at best, and genuinely unusable at worst. I feel Remnant 2 plays smoother and more diversely than the first game, in terms of build quality and abilities, but certain ""improvements"" feel rather lacking. The minimap is god awful, bugging out and looking like shit; occasionally it decides a portion of land simply does not exist, or to get stuck at max zoom despite my efforts to move it out even slightly. Certain items are locked behind getting lucky with multiple layers of RNG tied to the main campaign, which I am not a fan of but begrudgingly grind out regardless. The final boss fight, however, was an experience to be sure. It has mechanics that I personally quite enjoyed and would place in my top 10 coolest boss fights solely because of 1 mechanic, ignoring the visuals included. I loved every second of the fight and it was truly a grand battle to finish out my journey. Unfortunately, the final boss of the DLC was a complete pushover. A friend and I with half-completed builds (we swapped off DOT builds to preserve his hammer for an alt boss kill reward) managed to beat the One True King first try on apocalypse difficulty. He had perhaps one threatening attack, which was quite literally just a massive AOE with maybe a 0.5 second windup. The gun you gain from killing him (alt kill where you don't break his hammer; yes that is genuinely a challenge it just takes damage as he uses it) is probably the coolest weapon I've used in both games, featuring an auto homing mode. That being said, it is close in terms of DPS and general playstyle/build to the Chicago typewriter (my beloved).

tl;dr Remnant 2 is not bad, but certain aspects hold it back from being a direct upgrade from the first game. I'd encourage picking this game up if it's on sale, but I cannot bring myself to recommend it at full price. Hopefully future DLC and updates will bring more content and potentially fix the more glaring issues.",1705026990,1705027374,True,18,0,0.656418502330780029,0,True,False,False

I feel like the talk around this game and hype was completely unjustified. I remember a lot of streamers and youtubers claiming this was basically the best thing since sliced bread, had a lot of content and felt really good to play.

Honestly, what a crock. Gunplay was so~so to the point I would say even Mass Effect 1 had better gunplay. The issue was there was zero impact behind your shots. You may as well have been mimicking shots with a stick to replicate the way this game treats shooting. Didn't matter the weapon, didn't matter the power it all felt like throwing a wet beanie bag at your target.

There's only three biomes outside of the intro, hub area, intermission area and final zone/boss area and they all felt very linear and uninspired. One of the two zones was essentially copy pasted from the original game with not much changed in terms of aesthetics. The story was downright terrible and the characters were incredibly bad. The ending also gave zero closure or explained anything at all that was going on. I won't go into it for risk of ""spoilers"" - if you'd be able to spoil a game that quite literally has no story - but it was crap.

All in all, taking my time, this took around 20 hours for me to beat mostly solo(I was probably AFK for around 6-8 hours at one point over the holidays). at a certain point, around 6 or 7 hours in I felt like I was still in the prologue only to realise I was well and truly in a decent chunk of the game. I thought there would be many more than just three biomes and was very surprised to find that there's only three biomes in the entire game which felt less than the original game.

Replay value? So, apparently each biome has around 2-3 different ""stories"" which is supposed to give ""replay value"" but the reality is it's just the same tileset randomly generated with different ""overland"" map layouts depending on the biome. It doesn't feel different and the randomness only feels random in terms of the dungeons you see at set points on the ""overland"" map. Honestly, why bother playing through a second or third time to ""experience"" these ""stories"" when the stories are so threadbare, uninteresting and literally have zero impact on the entire area save the boss fights you come against and a few layout changes to the map. It's not great.

Graphics are ""okay"", nothing great. I've seen better five years ago. Boss fights range from pump and dump kind of ""fun"" to ""This is just bad design"". The boss fights are never engaging, fun in and of themselves and only ever tend to be a pump and dump engagement with a few dodges here and there.

The DLC is a waste of money. It's not a new zone, it's the same zone but with a handful of ""dungeons"" included that can now spawn in the biome randomly and has a ""story"" but pretty much just uses the same or very similar layout.

I would give this one a miss unless you want to pick it up on the cheap for a quick 20 hours to waste. Otherwise, just watch a series instead. It's not a great game. If this were any more than 40 bucks the general consensus would be that the game isn't worth the money.",1704909693,1704909693,False,1,0,0.455477803945541382,0,True,False,False

I mostly followed established builds, but the mechanics aren't hard enough that I can't do it without. Many times I riffed off an established built just to try a new mechanic.

During my play through of this game, I fell in love with the lore. It practically forced me to play through Chronos:BTA. I wasn't really a fan of that, but I love how it's structure is seen in Remnant 2. Also now playing Remnant I solo.

The only real pain point was how to join/unjoin multiplayer. Jump in my game, then go to crystal to join their game, then jump back to menu to leave their game, then load up mine. My friends had to do all that to join mine.

Elden Ring, Sekiro - no thanks. Even in AC6, which is even further from a Soulslike, I generally disliked bossing. But in Remnant 2, I am absolutely hooked on all three elements.

At first I wasn't sure about the game loop, but I just cleared the last boss in the campaign, and I gotta say I'M IN for the ride. Rerolling the worlds, exploring every inch of a tileset, and getting rewarded with sick gear and weapons is addicting AF. Every reroll is a unique RNG adventure with new maps/bosses, like a quasi roguelite. I don't actually know how to stop playing. It's bad.

The secrets are wayyy to secret. You need a guide, no matter how good you are at sleuthing. I want a challenge that I can realistically solve by myself or I would at least like to have a hint as to where to search for clues. If there was some kind of index that gives you a vague sense of how many secrets are undiscovered in a given area; that would go a long way to solving the playability issue. 
One spot that the game really excels in is the massive arsenal of unique and fun weapons. It's a shame your confined to only two at time. You can switch relatively quickly but with so many interesting tools it seems the two weapon paradigm is unnecessarily limiting. Lots of games let you have four or more weapons at the ready without any cost to smooth gameplay. You reach the capacity for max weapon upgrades early on so it becomes a tedious exercise of saving up resources to fully upgrade a new weapon before trying it out. I much prefer Warframe's model of leveling up weapons with usage to Dark Soul's resource investment. It encourages a great deal more experimentation and opens up the long term goal of mastering individual equipment. Were I the developer, I would consider a hybrid system. 
I like the low-level of storytelling, even though I love story games, sometimes you just want gameplay. This may be the one thing Remnant 1 does better than 2. In the first one, the entirety of the story came from scraps you pieced together while out exploring. Here, there is a lot more presentation (ironically in contrast to the discovery of secret areas and items). The world stories never seem to come to anything. You enter a world, find out who needs killing, do the killin', then hit the old dusty trail. The formula could use a good deal more subtlety and complexity and it has room for it considering how interesting the characters and entities are.

An intriguing story, a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, and incredibly detailed worlds wrap a game of intuitive mechanics, interesting puzzles, and punishing bosses.

It succeeds as a co-op where other games such as Diablo become a grindingly easy loot-grab. We are some thirty-hours approximately into the game and haven't experienced any bugs.

Gameplay is undeniably brilliant, Venom, Annihilation and Nightweaver are some of the best Git Gud moments on higher difficulties. Yet balance is just out of the window in the late game. Far too many rings and amulets are straight-up Walmart/Wish versions of similar items that just clog up your inventory. Sidegrades and meme builds add to the fun, but not items that require situational activation but perform worse than the general version in like 95% of the situations. The sad part is that this applies to weapons as well, so many outlandishly stylish weapons are being neglected because all you need is Enigma and Krell Axe.

Build diversity is also extremely limited in apocalypse unless you are an utter masochist who can stand prolonged fights where you may get one-shotted at any moment. You either go medic tank builds with Leto or you go full glass cannon with elemental Ritualist, HUGS or Archon mod spam, maybe spectral blade bore build if you're feeling edgy.

Gameplay is smooth but uninspired, bunch of weapons but you are discouraged from experimenting due to resources being so limited and only getting part of them back when you reset a weapon to level 1 instead of everything.

Story is eye-rolling, very uninspired. Most of the bosses are out of melee range so I don't know why they gave you a fleshed out melee upgrading and ability system when it's rarely useful when it matters most. RNG .0005% increase to primary weapon damage after firing for x seconds on a Tuesday type gear upgrades, looter shooter garbage.

Just isn't worth a buy, I'd say $15 is the most I'd recommend paying for this. Nothing in this game ""needs"" to be experienced for someone who enjoys videogames.",1704663823,1704663823,False,3,0,0.537815093994140625,0,True,False,False

""Remnant II"" emerges from the shadows as a sequel that not only lives up to the expectations set by its predecessor but boldly carves its own path in the darkened realm of gaming. This game is a testament to the evolution of a franchise, showcasing refined mechanics, gripping storytelling, and a pulsating atmosphere that immerses players in a world teeming with danger and intrigue.

One of the standout features of ""Remnant II"" is its commitment to preserving the core essence of its predecessor while introducing innovative elements that elevate the overall experience. The gunplay, reminiscent of a well-choreographed dance, feels even more satisfying and responsive, offering a seamless blend of precision and chaos as you navigate through hordes of otherworldly foes.

The storytelling takes center stage, weaving a narrative tapestry that unfolds in captivating layers. The world-building is meticulous, drawing players deeper into a lore-rich universe where every corner holds secrets waiting to be unraveled. The characters are more than mere NPCs; they are companions on a journey, each with their own stories and motivations that add emotional weight to the overarching narrative.

Environments in ""Remnant II"" are a visual feast, showcasing the developers' attention to detail and artistic prowess. From desolate landscapes to eerie dungeons, each locale feels meticulously crafted, creating a sense of immersion that keeps players on the edge of their seats. The dynamic lighting and atmospheric effects contribute to the overall sense of foreboding, enhancing the game's dark and mysterious ambiance.

Cooperative multiplayer is a standout feature, offering an experience that encourages teamwork and camaraderie. Facing the challenges of ""Remnant II"" alongside friends is a rewarding endeavor, as each encounter becomes a strategic ballet of gunfire and abilities, culminating in shared triumphs and the thrill of overcoming formidable adversaries.

The question of whether I would recommend this game to other players elicits a resounding ""Yes."" ""Remnant II"" is a shining example of a sequel that not only builds upon the strengths of its predecessor but also pushes the boundaries of what a cooperative action RPG can achieve. Whether you're a fan of intense gunplay, rich storytelling, or challenging cooperative gameplay, ""Remnant II"" stands as a beacon in the darkness, beckoning players to embark on an unforgettable journey.",1690693362,1704660144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can solo the game but soloing it for me has lead to an experience, that when I am not walking through the same area over and over again, I am dying to easy bosses from poorly designed mechanics. This review is written from the perspective of a single player.

The level and world design, while visually striking at first, ends up feeling extremely monochromatic. The level design lends itself to replayability first and foremost, but it comes at the cost of having a single unique environment. In fact, you will get a sense of deja vu as you encounter the same corners of an area used multiple times. Something about this felt particularly futile. As I walked through the 2nd or 3rd world with a unique art set, it just felt completely hollow to me, like I was in an infinitely repeating maze....because it was.

The combat mechanics I found often were unfair on veteran mode. So many times the boss I was fighting would create added enemies from every direction. If you turn to face one set of adds, your back will be to another set and your side will be to the boss. Better yet, some adds come from above too. There are so many threats at once that for a single player to take care of that mistakes are inevitable, and they made no effort to rescale the game for single players aside from health/damage changes. I will note though that adds are necessary because they drop ammo. But that doesn't make them fun.

What is even worse, is that one attack can lead to your death at almost any point in the game. In dark souls, for example, if you get attacked so hard that you fall down, you are immune from attacks for a moment until you can get up. In this game, if 3 enemies attack you at the same time, or one enemy has an animation that does 5 attacks in a row, you are going to get stunlocked and go from full health to 0. And you cannot dodge role immediately after an attack, and even if you do manage to roll away, the enemies push you aggressively to where rolling doesn't often create much distance and recovering from a scenario like this is very difficult.

These are my major gripes, but there were a lot of other small frustrations that added up, and I think being a coop game primarily, the solo experience itself almost feels like you are grinding an MMO doing repetitive tasks and gaining minor stats as you go, but you are ultimately playing an MMO alone which is one of the most soul sucking experiences I can imagine.

So this game isn't that bad, but I absolutely do not recommend it for solo play. It's unfulfilling without friends and potentially very frustrating depending on the areas and class you role. Some may ask why not play online with randoms. My game was set to public the entire time, and in 12 hours I was only paired with 3 different people. Trying to join a public game took over 5 minutes so I gave up on that idea, so I wouldn't recommend relying on the public game experience.",1690484922,1704657981,False,2,1,0.493901163339614868,0,True,False,False

I had more fun playing the first Remnant.

I would still highly recommend this game, and there are many things Remnant 2 does better than Remnant FTA. but the following issues are what plagues this installment of Remnant:

[h2]Performance [/h2]
From Low FPS numbers, to stutters, to straight up crashes. It does not matter what is your rig you will face issues, if your rig is latest gen you will get crashes, if it is not then you will get ~60fps and still crash every now and then.

Read about the dev updates or other reviews for more details.

[h2]Difficulty [/h2]
While Remnant 1 mostly used a bunch of ADS to increase the difficulty of bosses (Not the best game design), it did also have some amazing boss fights which were both fun and challenging on Apocalypse difficulty (e.g: Ixillis )

Remnant 2 on the other hand, handles apoc difficulty by simply adding a ton of health to the boss and enemies.
This [i]DRAGS OUT[/i] the fights much longer than it should, and we end up having so many easy bosses with long looong fights. This makes [u]Apocalypse difficulty NOT FUN[/u] 

[h2]AI can't keep up [/h2]
Due to all the verticality added to this game, [u]the enemy Elites became so easy to beat.[/u]
Simply jump around from one platform to another and watch as the single digit IQ AI takes a moment to comprehend the [i]amazing trick[/i] you have pulled, or better yet, climb up the 1 meter platform and watch as the AI slowly starts the climbing animation while you empty the entire magazine into his nostrils, only for you to simply jump back down soon after.
Repeat this a few times aaand he's dead.

[h2]Weapons aren't as fun anymore[/h2]
I'm gonna name a few guns which are either not included in this game, or have been butchered unfortunately.
[list]
[*] Hive Cannon
[*] Beam Rifle
[*] Alternator
[*] Devastator
[*] Repulsor (Unique mod completely overshadowed by the Stasis Beam Mod)
[*] Spitfire :(
[/list]
Notice something? Every weapon that had the ability to do elemental dmg by default was changed. Spitfire was SO much fun, switching between a fully automatic weapon that FELT like a main weapon and a FLAMETHROWER was life man.. I never cared if it was the best side weapon, I still picked it every time. its replacement in Remnant 2 is so depressing I actively avoid unlocking it.
That's the thing about Remnant 1, it had way less guns but they all felt [b]Unique[/b]

Now let's compare this to remnant 2,
Wtf is the difference between a western classic, a silverback 500, and a service pistol?
the difference between a wrangler and a rusty lever action?
A sagittarius and a Royal hunting bow?

I know they have different stats but [u]they FEEL the same, why would I switch between weapons when my experience does not change?[/u]
There are exceptions like the cube gun, Enigma, Sorrow, etc.. but they are the minority in this game


[h2] The Good [/h2]
Overall I would still recommend this game, My review is coming from a remnant fanboy perspective which is why I'm so critical.

Everything mentioned below has been vastly improved upon in remnant 2 imo. They include:

[olist]
[*] Classes, an amazing addition
[*] Way More Items
[*] Puzzles are more fun
[*] Visuals
[*] Map design
[/olist]

The settings, the bosses, the variance of items and weapons and how those allow you to fully customize your gameplay are all spot on. They also knocked it out of the park with the replayability, both in terms of offering multiple difficulties and in how the procedural generation works. It massively rewards exploration, there are so many delightful secrets to find and there's almost always something new to discover.

Regarding loot, this doesn't randomly generate stats on the items you find which is a major plus imo. It's incredibly frustrating to find an item you've been hunting for in a game like Diablo but it had a bad random stat distribution. Here, if you find the item it's exactly what you expect and the same for everyone, making it much better balanced for how it's used in builds and easier for you to create the build you want.

Also, the co-op in this game is fantastic. It's very easy to drop in and out, and persists in a way that just lets you focus on having fun with your buddies.

With the Labyrinth as the main story line (also as the only important story line) other levels/Realms are not important. You might as well MOD this game without buying the DLC to add more Realms. This could have been the Zelda:OoT of our time. 

But someone thought the story can be replaced by trowing more enemies on the player and making the bosses harder. 

This game (Remnant 1) was about exploring a universe of different realms with their own Laws of physics that bend our minds and challenge what we experienced and of course besting fantastic beasts in them.

But it became a bad copy of diablo 4. (how do you even do that?).

Is that lazy story telling? = Yes 
Could they make it better= Yes
Do they want to= Probably not. 
Will there be a remnant 3 for this exact reason= No

Verdict= Good game if you have 50$ to burn, your money is spent better elsewhere.
If you focus on the main campaign and don't explore you can speed run this and get a refund with 2 buddies that already have the best gear. Shame really with some tweaks to the story this would have been an instant classic.

[/b]Starting at the first world boss, this game blossoms like crazy. The weapon and archetype gameplay and designs are super unique. The weapons feel very similar to Warframe however the combat is very in-line with souls-like games.

The Campaign was very solid. I did my first play through on Veteran difficulty and I very rarely felt like I was being cheaped out by enemy design. My biggest pain point was with very specific enemies with very unforgiving weak points or just enemies flat out overtuned (yes I'm talking about the green and blue sewer shits). However, the game does allow tons of freedom when it comes to tackling adversities so I never felt like I couldn't find a build that would significantly help with certain boss fights or enemies.

All the boss fights in my first campaign were pretty incredible but I have to shout out one boss in particular [spoiler]Venom was one of the most insane skill checks that this game had and was totally unexpected. This boss is arguably harder than Annihilation and was so unfair (in a fun way) at times that I really pulled every punch with my build just to delete this guy.[/spoiler] There were also some boss fights that were just horrific but usually those had a much smaller health pool and didn't have to really stand out too hard. 

The one key thing about Remnant is your story choices matter. You will get different rewards based on what options you chose. This is a key component to the entire campaign of remnant. There are two ways to mitigate FOMO: Adventure mode and Campaign re-rolling, both of which carry over all weapons and stats on your character. Adventure allows you to do a self isolated run of one major location (which again is going to be randomly generated and different on repeat playthroughs) whilst re-rolling the campaign allows you to do a fresh run. I am currently on my second campaign and am super surprised how fresh the game still feels on repeat.

In terms of artistic direction, Remnant 2 might just be one of the most visually stunning games of this decade, on par with the likes of Elden Ring, which is especially impressive considering R2's significantly lower budget and shorter development period. 
Gameplay-wise, R2 retains the most attractive elements of RFTA, namely its item balancing and build variety. There are more enemies, more weapons, more build possibilities, more mechanics, but one would be mistaken to categorize it as an RFTA expansion -- R2 is a spectacle, in a way that RFTA never tried to be. Even the UI shows this: in RFTA, the fast travel screen was a drop-down list of a handful of locations, while in R2, the UI has been overhauled into an intricately designed map with points of access. 
Small changes like these hints at a fundamental shift in GFG's creative vision with this game: they don't want to be a casual looter shooter anymore, they want to be taken seriously. However, some problems I have with this game also arises from this shift. 
From the impossible-to-find secrets to puzzle boss fights like the labyrinth sentinel, it seems that R2 takes itself too seriously at times. It demands so much energy and patience from the player that I can see many potential fans being driven away, but even when you commit your full attention, there is always that sinking knowledge that you're missing out on 80% of the game's content by not checking the wiki. That, to me, is the core issue with R2, even more than the scaling system that everyone hates.

You did EVERYTHING right!
You have achieved something truly special with Remnant II.
The gameplay is smooth and nearly bug free.
The graphics are top-notch.
The lore is engaging and everything smoothly continues on from the world of Remnant - From the Ashes.
The replayability... I must say that the unique combination of procedurally generated and randomly rolled modular encounters containing multiple outcomes and rewards truly makes the game feel endless,
Wrap this up with a price-point that puts triple-A title products of similar ilk on notice that THIS is how you do it and show the gaming audience that you have them in mind.

Review : 
The game is exactly what is advertised. A soulslike experience with guns that is also really good in a co-op format. The bosses and enemies all seem to be quite well designed exactly for a co-op experience which is ,in my opinion, the most important thing seeing as co-op pretty much trivializies a lot of soulslikes. 
I will say however enemies and bosses being designed around co-op doesnt necessarily mean they are challenging or difficult. I do wish some of the bosses and enemies were a little more engaging.
The Areas are fine with some being better than others, but Ill chalk that down to personal preference more than anything else. 
Music is also quite enjoyable, a rather generic orchestral score for most of these, a staple of the genre. Alas, it serves its purpose kinda well.
One thing to note is that the game is, atleast to a certain degree, procedurally generated, which means aside from the general aesthetic of some areas and aside from the most basic of enemy variants you could do a playthrough 3 or 4 times and never encounter the same boss in the same spot. This does wonders for replayability but if you get unlucky with your rng regarding bosses and their placement you could be left enjoying the game less your first time around than if you dealt with the bosses in the backlog.

[spoiler]The final boss is super challenging and its pretty much the only boss in the game that had me and my friends die more than a handful of times. It is also the best boss in the game in my opinion especially due to the very very unique design of said boss fight. If you arent won over by the game I urge you to stick around until the end atleast with your first time. Its worth it. [/spoiler]",1704390282,1704390282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a long time Souls fan with over 1k hours in Dark Souls + Elden Ring combined. This game did not hit the spot for me, for a few major reasons which I will list.

1. Lack of graphics options and poor optimization. Game runs fine mostly when playing on the absolute lowest settings but even then, in actual fights the framerate can tank to really low numbers. This is on a 1080ti and i7 7700k cpu.

2. The voice acting/story is really, really bad. It's like a bootleg TV show from the late 90s. I couldn't put up with it. I wish I'd skipped more of the scenes and turned off the dialogue because all it really did was break my immersion.

3. It's blurry. The game uses upscaling because the devs didn't spend time optimizing it so the game just ends up looking somewhat blurry. Not a fan.

Obviously having only played a few hours of it I'm not equipped to review the entirety of the game but I played enough of it to confidently say that I do not recommend it to most people and that I will not be continuing to play it.",1690693085,1704384861,False,2,1,0.497676670551300049,0,True,False,False

If you can aim-and-shoot, as well as dodge - you will beat the game.  I don't need to use class archetype skills.  I don't need to upgrade my relic or use any shards in it.  I don't need to use or upgrade mutaters.

The only thing you need to do is upgrade your weapons (so you don't run out of ammo).  But you can easily use the beginner weapons to carry you through the game!

Do NOT use the cube gun as it conflicts with picking up loot.  Cube gun doesn't use ammo, so you can never pick up 'secondary ammo'.  But 'secondary ammo' always drops on the very top of loot stacks, so you can't pick-up any loot below the secondary ammo.  You need to switch secondaries, fire off rounds, reload, then pick everything up, and switch back your secondary.

Also MOB behaviour is extremely disappointing.  It starts very fun and engaging in Yeasha (first zone) with mobs spawning behind you, flanking you, flying at you from above.  It's a great start and leaves you eager for more.  All later zones MOB behaviour is simplified, linear from the front, and super easy compared to what you experienced earlier.  It feels like two different company/teams worked on different levels.

Early game - linear levels with fast paced engaging combat.  Mid and late game - maze levels with way less and much simpler combat.

Yes, the gameplay loop, combat and world building is top notch that will entertain you especially if you bring friends. The negatives are mostly the laughable ""story"" and optimisation issues.

[b]Long and Detailed review then;[/b]
The Positives:
*The gunplay and class system is interesting and really incentives build experimentation.
*World exploration and building is another thing that's done really well (for the most part), some of the world specific stories  are really well done and captivating.
*A lot of hidden secrets that (for the most part) are logic based, or based on exploration. Some of them are just pure bs and random with no clues given.
*Most of the bosses are also done splendidly, a pure spectacle with tight mechanics that will test your skill and response time.
*The end bosses of every world are amazing and have different forms and battles depending on dialogue or story options you've made throughout the world's run. With different rewards depending on what boss or what form of the boss you've killed.
*Replayability is the name of the game, every campaign is randomly generated with tilesets, items, specific end bosses of the worlds and dungeons. The story of the worlds can even be different depending on which one got spawned in. Hell, even the starting world is random between three options. I cannot stress this enough, if you enjoy a game with a lot of replayability then this might be the game for you.

The Negatives:
*The main story is so a laughably bad, you can ignore it completely and please do ignore it. The ""main"" characters in the central hub world are also not anything to write home about. I have played Remnant 1 and even I was still confused on who they were and why they were at the camp.
*The game's optimisation is atrocious, it's the worse I've seen in recent years. Everyone I know meets the recommended requirements with flying colours, have the game installed on an SSD and all of us are forced to play the game on low to medium settings. And still we get awful stuttering, horrific frame drops and crashes.They bring out patches and updates that fixes the optimisation issues, but the very next patch throws out all of those fixes and introduces even more problems. The games optimisation is awful and I blame the AI upscalling for making game devs complacent with optimisation, because why fix it when AI will do it for you?
*Though the games worlds have amazing exploration, there is one world that just drags the entire experience down to a grinding halt. N'Erud is the worst world to run through by far, it's nothing but a grey desert with roaming packs of enemies with dungeons scattered all throughout the very edges of the map. N'Erud's overworld maps would have to be reduced by half to make it an enjoyable experience, because as of right now, it just takes forever to go anywhere and do anything. It's a shame because N'Erud's story, end boss and world building is amazing, but the gameplay experience is just awful.
*Final thing I'll mention is the boss design, though the majority of the bosses are designed really well and are punishing but fair. Some of them are just cancer. Slipping up one mechanic equals an instant death even on the lower difficulties, oh and if you're playing 2 player co-op, then goodluck in trying to find an opening to revive your friend, because the boss is going to pound you into the dirt where you belong.I believe a Youtuber said it best. Remnant 1 feels like Dark Souls, but Remnant 2 feels like Elden Ring.

I would also like to point out that the balance of the game can be a bit wonky at times as well. Specifically the games balance around the amount of players in a world. If you're playing the game solo then it's fine, it's a test of skill and patience. If you play in a three man group then it's fine as well, if one of the party goes down, one can distract the enemies while the other goes to revive. But oh damn, the game was not balanced around a two player team. If your friend goes down and there are enemies nearby, or a boss is currently beating your ass, just let them to die and try to kill the enemies yourself. I was forced to always have a specific build equipped in order to revive my friend remotely, because if I ever got near him, the enemies or boss would just instantly attack me, forcing me to either dodge spam and try again over and over again, or they'd just kill me outright.

I know I've said a lot of negative things, but thinking back on the game, it's mostly the optimisation that's a major gripe that makes me want to never play it again. Playing the game and discovering the plethora of secrets that are hidden with a full group of friends, has been some of the most fun I've had in a long while though, and would recommend the game based purely on that aspect.",1701123898,1704355343,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The initial hours of gameplay in this looter shooter are quite enjoyable, showcasing a decent experience. However, the game falls short in terms of enemy variety, with only noticeable diversity during randomized boss fights in different zones due to the map's randomization. Unfortunately, the majority of the gameplay involves facing a limited pool of 3-4 enemy types.

The level design is intriguing, featuring some engaging puzzles. Nonetheless, the primary issue lies in performance, rendering the game practically unplayable without DLSS/FSR, even on high-end graphics cards. The end-game zones are worse, as the game frequently crashes and is riddled with bugs.

(as of now, I am unable to progress in my campaign because the game crashes at a certain area and resets progress every time )

Despite introducing interesting classes/archetypes, the developers imposed a cap on traits, compelling players to alter their builds periodically. However, the grind for these builds becomes tedious, as players are constrained to repetitively face the same 3-4 enemy types for leveling up and experimentation.",1704351130,1704351130,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly, it sticks to its procedurally generated worlds, and they are by far the worst thing in this game if you ask me. I would much, much more prefer a crafted world to this nonsense. It’s so easy to get lost, and rerolling worlds to get new bosses is just a chore. I loved Remnant 1, and even though this game probably is better I prefer R1 more because it was a bit easier to find your way and less rerolling.

Doing a run on ""Survivor"" right now, and I like the challenge without dying every five minutes.

The graphics are OK, but appear slightly dated.  Not bad by any means.  Just not up to the level of other modern games on PC.

The Gameplay: Feels smooth, feels like the first one with a few improvements...the best part of this game to me is the fact it doesn't feature wall hugging/cover animations which sometimes can make the game feel clunky or restrictive during combat and in some instances a crutch. The game features a class system which is a big improvement over the first game where it only affected your starting loadout. This new system makes solo gameplay better and group play good as well. The 2 biggest selling points however is the puzzles/secrets within the worlds which are plentiful and well hidden in some cases. The other would have to be the items I won't go into detail but the items in this game are outstanding and really spice up build diversity and the amount of items is insane compared to the first one....to not spoil anything, for instance, in the first game you could not change your ""Dragon Hearts"" in this game you can and there is a lot of them.

Graphics- Fantastic if they ran well and I could use them. 
Puzzles- Tricky and out of the box especially the secret areas

Story- The story is acceptable but not where the game truly shines.
Combat/Gameplay Very Unique Fun and extremely Re-playable 
Level Design- Fun and repayable  Customization Like Crazy hundreds of hours of builds/classes/combos/gear/difficulties 
Cons:
VERY poorly optimized in the early access its like its running ray-tracing to the max but its not. My PC can run any new game on Ultra Graphics at hundreds of frames but I cant even run this game with a smooth frame rate over 60 without an Upscaler on which makes the game look terrible.

Overall – Remnant II is unfortunately a great marker for the trend that PC gaming had during 2023. Developers would release an incomplete, broken, game and then stop supporting it shortly after. This game has an insane amount of crashing issues with some of the best hardware on the market. Fortunately, Project Lasso allowed me to play the game, which wasn’t half bad, until we got to the final boss.  There is a bug where sometimes the boss will despawn during the fight, this wipes your group and when you reload in, the boss does not respawn. I checked the steam forums and reddit for a fix, there wasn’t an official fix from the developer, but some fellow redditors had a solution that involved changing some backups save files. I was able to load in and beat the final boss, but this issue was unforgivable for me, how has the developer not patched this? I wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone. Not Recommended.

More accurate would be ""Dark Souls with guns but without the controls to make that work, or any consequences for failure and really messed up progression"". Essentially, if you are here for the guns, progression is over as soon as you walk in the door - with the exception of one pistol in the first dungeon, you aren't going to find any other guns in this game. Bows and magic scepters galore, yes, but no actual GUN guns. And this by no means holds you back - by all means, upgrade your starting gear to the nines, it WILL carry you through the end of the game. Assuming of course you don't get bored before the end of the game, because with no consequences for death, and no incentive to explore, the game's threadbare story gets boring very quickly - especially when the writers would rather say (almost verbatim!) ""shut up tho"" when questioned about certain aspects of the story. There's also no real challenge, as you don't lose any resources on death, and cash is only used for upgrading weapons - you gain XP separately. Boss fights aren't that great either - a lot of them are just bullet sponge versions of normal enemies, or hordes or normal enemies. Attacks are not particularly well telegraphed, and even on light equip loads, rolling feels extremely clunky, and has far, FAR too many recovery frames. Sprinting is awkward and slow, and while it's not so slow you can't break off enemies, it's so slow that it FEELS like you can't actually escape. Which is of course a big problem when your primary combat is ranged, your melee options are lackluster, and the shitty dodge roll leaves you with 0 good tools for close engagements. 

I'm sure if you co-op this with friends shit-talking each other over voice chat it's fine (also there's friendly fire, so don't try to melee things when someone is shooting them), but as a single-player experience there REALLY isn't a lot here. Heck, even as a co-op experience, with no gear to seek out or character build objectives to hit, I struggle to find a reason to get a group of friends together to play this.",1704082300,1704082300,False,1,0,0.509385645389556885,0,True,False,False

Interesting boss design but ultimately not worth playing because of stun-lock combos, canned animations limiting player input, and horrendously boring gunplay. All enemies in all areas use entirely swarm mechanics, frequently if not always spawning and teleporting behind the player. Hit registration is entirely unreliable as ""Vulnerable"" spots just either randomly count or don't. Enemies are visually interesting but because of their overly busy design you can't track vulnerable strikes at all. You will get a vulnerable strike on an enemy's obvious glowing weak point and then shoot it again on the same enemy and do regular damage. Other times you'll shoot the same type of enemy in an entirely unremarkable spot on their body and it will flash as a Vulnerable hit. Guns are unsatisfying to use and classes are boring and equally unsatisfying. Guns have, for lack of a better term, no character or handling.  Melee is surprisingly nice to strike enemies with but the enemy and environment design means melee is totally ineffective on a great deal of enemies, especially small annoying swarm ones.",1704078811,1704078811,False,1,0,0.509385645389556885,0,True,False,False

My biggest complaint is the lack of content. While there are still literally dozens of levels and hundreds of items to collect, There are only three 'main' worlds to explore. For context, even the prequel had four 'main' worlds. The first DLC, for instance, isn't so much an expansion pack as a last-minute patch that costs money, as it doesn't add a new world, only a new continent on an already existing world. This worries me deeply, as we may be forced to return to Corsus or Reisum for the remaining two DLCs - or worse, extra re-hashes of N'erud and Yaesha.

+++ Smoother gameplay, stronger bosses
+++ Team synergy is more effective
++ Strong Lore and Acting
++ Further build customization and exploration
--- Even less worlds to explore than the prequel

Yes, there's lots of concepts here from Dark Souls, but there's also plenty of other things too. The class system is the biggest thing that sets this apart. It literally determines what your character does. Plus, this game puts it's own spin on the class system by letting your character equip two classes at the same time, and you can switch classes at any time.

Also, guns may be the main focus of this game, but melee is very powerful too. I've been doing mostly melee for a while, and it feels a little overpowered. It's only when I encounter a group of flying enemies or a floating boss that I feel the need to fire a gun. However, this is on easy mode. Harder difficulties may create a different experience.

Also, I had a great time starting out as the Handler. It comes with a dog that fights, heals, and can even revive you when you're down. You can also pet it. <3",1703981331,1703981331,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Making a character build is fun. You'll have access to a lot of different guns and melee options, plus rings and runes that give you useful passive abilities. Once you have access to multiple classes, you can mix two of them together to create some interesting combos.

Random generation of the worlds with different hand-made dungeons gives some extra replayability and exploration, though if you're the type that likes to use guides to find all the secrets you missed the first time around (or just to help you when you're stuck) you'll have a harder time due everyone's playthrough being different.

And, this game encourages free exploration on random maps, but it turns out to be a pseudo-random world. While this may not appear significant, the late-game experience becomes poor due to several factors. 

1.Limited Map Options: The absence of the option to freely combine levels results in players constantly recreating maps in Adventure Mode to find desired hidden content. The lack of a choice to freely combine maps leads to repetitive experiences.
2.Limited Randomization: Random maps offer only a limited number of permutations, making me feel bored when facing repetitive terrains and monsters again and again. This design doesn't seem wiser than including all contents in a single large map.
3.Poor Item Interface: The item interface has poor indexing, making it challenging to select needed equipment among dozens of items. The game lacks any indication of progress in collecting hidden equipment, which is disappointing for a collection-oriented player.

TL;DR: 7.5-8.5 depending on your expectations and wants from a game. Good value on sales.

PROS:
Gorgeous scenes, very different stylish worlds, nice music, and a solid sequel overall. Core gameplay ideas remained same but some alterations were made and game is more action packed compared to the first one. Bosses are still challenging and fun.

CONS:
Core gameplay loop remains same for all worlds, not that many differences between enemies and it gets kinda tedious going from checkpoint to checkpoint (e.g. optional dungeons) and clearing regular mobs.

MEHS:
The delivery of worldbuilding does not meet the scenery of the worlds you visit: you just get to a world and go shooting-tooting. Nobody explains you what's happening until like 1/3 of clearing the world and the notes and diaries you find don't help much.

The idea of 1 world 2 plots seemed cool, but the end result is kinda strange: you can't dive much into the plot on the first try and the level becomes just a set of dungeons and corridors for you to clear and move the plot.

The dialogue sound disappears if you move camera from the speaker, that was pretty weird.

END COMPARISON:
Imagine getting a Rolls-Royce on a budget: stylish, luxury with a lot on technical feats here and there and a lot of effort being put into it. And then driving for groceries in traffic jams.

Same here: a lot of effort from designers, change of day/night and associated events, tons of secrets on levels. And it's all boils down to pretty repetitive gameplay for the most part, remember: boss battles are sparse.",1703852067,1703852067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Remnant 2 felt like a huge downgrade in replayabilty when compared to the first Remnant game. A big reason for this is the lack of Survival mode which was endlessly replayable in the first game. I'm sure down the line Remnant 2 will add this feature but that brings up the other problem with this game: the bosses. They were either headache inducing or complete pushovers. There really wasn't any middle ground for the boss difficulty and fight mechanics, never mind the fact a few boss fights had such cluttered visual effects to the point it could be hard to spot the boss in the visual mess. This leads to the next problem: enemy types. The enemy types were boring almost all the way through. Humanoids were cool looking to fight, but largely pushovers, and the droid and ""zombie"" type enemies were complete borefests to engage with and look at. Only the first world with the original and new Root enemies were interesting to me (and the enemies at the very tail end of the game). That brings up the next problem: only three core biomes, again, a downgrade from the first game. Boring enemies, lackluster locations, and mostly boring bosses, a huge problem for this ""soulslike"" game. 

    The archetype system at first seemed interesting but actually unlocking the archetypes becomes a headache. This game at the end of the day is a chore to grind, so locking some of the interesting archetypes behind obscure requirements kind of limits what classes you can actually beat the game with on the first attempt. Beyond min-maxing and grinding your heart out at the ""end game"" I don't really see a reason using anything besides the starting classes. You'll have to pick a new unleveled archetype mid way through your first playthrough and essentially grind it up to an acceptable level or it will functionally be a downgrade in your power level. Also, just for humors sake: look up how to unlock the summoner. It's beyond frustrating. It is the opposite of fun. It also takes a while to level the archetypes and it's prohibitively expensive to upgrade guns, so on your first play through you better like the gun you chose and the archetype you chose. Ultimately the game is set up for grindability but for what reason? To steamroll the mostly boring bosses or bang your head against the wall on the others? (Venom was the only hard boss I enjoyed fighting) To repeatedly plink away the dreadfully boring robots? To grind an archetype which at the end of the day isn't better than the starting ones? Oh yeah, there is no text or voice chat in this game so playing with randoms is a complete headache that shouldn't be. There were so many situations where if I could've merely typed a sentence it would have resolved a wipe to a boss mechanic. Everyone else who did not recommend this game complained about the connectivity issues (which are there) but to me the biggest problems are with the core mechanics, locations, and enemies in the game. It's a beautiful game that is good enough for one play through but it completely misses the magic and endless replayability of the first game. The second I finished the last boss I let out a sigh because I knew I would not be buying any of the DLC's or playing this game again.",1703818958,1703819419,False,19,2,0.557860136032104492,0,True,False,False

However, it took me quite a while to even figure out how to get the game to run as it kept crashing. I tried the usual things like updating graphics driver, restarting. It's not a matter of not having the horsepower to run the game, as I've got recently build rig with fairly high end parts.

Seems like a lot of other people had the same issue as me, but there has never been any fix for it. Ultimately found a tip to perform some weird voodoo of running the game in Windows 8 compatibility. Even then, when I could get through the splash screen, it took a few end task freezes to even get into the game, where I was met with missing models/textures. The first cutscene where the hero hops off a rusted train onto something else isn't there and the hero walks through the air. After the tutorial boss, I had a long conversation with a floating head.

I beat the game and continued to experience LOTS of crashing throughout my play through. I tried everything I could find online to fix the issues (disabling overclocking, lowering graphics settings, disabling DLSS, ran as administrator, whitelisted it in Microsoft Defender, updated my 3090 driver, etc.). Ended up playing at 60fps and had my graphics set to medium, but I don't think it helped much, if at all.

Crashing aside, the game is pretty good, I really enjoyed most of the story and bosses especially towards the end, though some parts of the game were baffling (the cube boss made me want to drop the game and never come back, it is easily the worst boss of any game I've ever played). If the game didn't crash I would give it an 8/10, but with the crashing it's probably a 5/10.

My PC should have been able to handle this game without any issues. Still not sure why the game crashes.

For newcomers: the game is designed to be replayed, so it may seem short but each world generates differently every time you re-roll it, so you may get an entirely different story on each go around.

It really feels like thought went into the design of this game, like usually games are so predictable but this one often feels smarter than me, which is something i like! although some of the puzzles and secrets are verry obscure, like idk how people find them without a wiki on a 2nd screen.

combat feels chunky and rewarding once you find the weapons and mods that suit you.

i really love the theorycrafting element of working out your rings/amulet/relic combos, a lot of useless guff but some really interesting combos are hidden in there.

I like that armour is basically cosmetic now, because im obsessed with in-game fashion, but sadly a lot of sets don't mix well, a lot of clipping if you use e.g a head from one set with a chest from another and so on..

You have co-op looting shooting and dungeons/trials of Destiny, and the questing/difficulty of the Souls Series.
The main campaign is complete bait, as the best experience is explored in the world(s).
The bulk of the fun is in the gameplay and exploration. 
STARTING is the part where you're at your weakest and easily drops many players off. 
It's akin to Destiny or any MMO in a smaller scope.

Side quests and stories are that of a Souls game somewhat... Good or bad depending on the player
(if you are an *actual* Souls fan, then you'd know that answer..)

Build variety and strength comes with time. As you require independent questing for specific loot, or just playing and using what you get luckily dropped. Key items and quests require a web of pathing if you want anything specific. Remember playing Elden Ring or any souls game and wanting a specific armor or weapon from a questline? Well that exists here, and it's made as fun.

Builds really only come online after you unlock a secondary class, as there's multiclassing, and when you really start getting good traits/mods/rings/amulets. Everything is unlocked via bosses, world drops or questlines. There are very few NPCs with exceptions.

The level designs are that of a roguelike but with soulslike checkpoints, and every run you FIRST-TIME start a world you get different layouts and key areas with different events/quests going on. The order of the worlds you go through will be random, with the only static ones being the required ones to progress. And yes, if you don't like what locations your world ended up rolling, you can re-roll at will.
ALL character progress stays.
This is very well executed replayability and it's keeps you playing.

This is very much worth getting, especially at it's current sale price.

This game is my biggest disappointment of 2023. For being a sequel, it offers little noticeable improvement over the gameplay systems of Remnant 1, systems which can best be described as serviceable.

Gunplay is fine, and dodging and movement feel fine, nothing to write home about. Weapons and archetypes are cool, but often have strange caveats that make them hard to work with, and many of them. especially the cool ones, are absolute nonsense to unlock. 

Artstyle is awesome, with enemies and levels being amazing to look at and play with, and the top-notch graphics really push it along as well, but the soundscape is overall meh, with little noteworthy to mention.

Story is nonsensical, with pretty much everything explained in grand and flowery sentences that clearly attempt to invoke Dark Souls in their nature, but lack any actual meaning that make Dark Souls engaging. There is no flow to the story, since levels are 100% disconnected from the plot outside of the very last one, and much of the dialogue is laughably terrible.

Bosses are, overall, boring and unnoteworthy, it felt like many were designed with the idea of co-op in mind, and were more puzzle bosses than actual combat challenges. Most weren't very challenging, to the point where the final boss, which, without spoiling anything, is *awesome* and very challenging, was a massive shock since nothing prepared us for that.

The game is very short, I finished it in 19 with a friend and we hardly rushed it, probably wouldn't be much slower by yourself since we did spend quite a bit just shooting the shit in the main hub. It feels like a game that gets its length from enticing you to replay with a different build, but with how stupid it can be to unlock many of the cooler weapons and archetypes, as mentioned previously, I just have no desire to actually do so. Plus, ultimately, there's not enough service put into the gunplay that I can image getting a different gun would actually feel super different.",1703723881,1703723881,False,1,0,0.47936895489692688,0,True,False,False

1. The leveling system is confusing as hell. it scales primarily with your weapon upgrades from what i understand, and areas are scaled to your level + 1. So really upgrading your weapon just makes enemies stronger, which defeats the entire purpose of leveling your weapon. I didn't realize this game did this, any game that scales enemies to your level is dog**** and a lazy way of managing difficulty. You never feel ANY sense of progression whatsoever

2. The loot in this game is absolute garbage. the only thing most enemies drop are ammo and scrap, this games currency, which, unfortunately like most games, there's pretty much nothing to spend it on. So wtf is the point of killing any monsters? to get your ammo back that you spent killing them...?

3.  10 hours in and the only guns ive seen available are all from the starting merchant, same goes for armor. have fun using the same 2 guns and the same armor set for the entirety of the game. Some tougher enemies drop some other stuff, but even though it's listed in the materials page you just have to check every merchant or figure out somehow what it does. In dark souls when you get an item description, it tells you what the item does, and then it gives you some background info/lore on it. Not in this game, it just gives you some background info on it without ever telling you what it does

4. consumable are a joke and useless

5. traits are a joke, boring and give such minuscule upgrades they feel irrelevant

6. Maybe it's cause i'm playing on nightmare but the elemental resistances and armor don't seem to do much at all. Kinda like how that starting resistance in biomutant doesnt matter.

I just don't feel the need to explore anything in this game, there's no reward for doing so. Killing enemies is pointless, you get ammo and a useless currency, the leveling your character doesnt matter so the xp you get from killing enemies doesnt matter. finding upgrade materials doesn't matter since leveling your weapon levels enemies so theres actually no point.

Although not necessary to play through ""from the ashes"" it does help with understanding some of the lore and locations but this sequel does a good job of filling you in on past events where needed without being overwhelming. 

The combat, atmosphere, puzzles, tragic storylines and funny moments make this a great game. The mix and matching of gear, classes, skills, mods and more make crafting your perfect build a joy. Changing things up and trying something different on another run can make the game play completely different so it has a lot of replay value. In addition to this your choices will affect what storylines, items and enemies are available to you. Plus each realm is created with a random selection of locations, bosses and items so you can never experience everything in one run through. The game provides a great mechanic to let you replay a region you have conquered in adventure mode - make different choices and see what happens, re-roll and access different locations. I imagine I will spend many many hours trying to see it all. 

Exploring and doing the unexpected is often rewarded too with so many secrets hidden away so don't be afraid to go off the beaten path or to try the improbable.

Fun and Challenging in solo or in co-op.

One warning about co-op. If you set your game to public you sometimes get players that want to speedrun everything, not giving you time to experience the story or even make choices as they can trigger those for you. One particular event was spoiled for me where I had to investigate to find who had betrayed the king. After solving the case the random co-op ran ahead, skipped all the dialogue options before I could even see them and ended up causing everyone to attack us and not solve the case. I wish the developers had left all dialogue/decisions to the host.

Despite it's ""not supported"" status it works on steam deck with no tinkering. However, you lose a lot of the atmosphere as the graphics are set to the lowest. If you have have a bit of a play with settings you can get a very playable 30fps on improved graphical settings (not sure if it helped but I have used cryotools to optimise).

Unfortunately, A and B are the norm with many fights being so poor that the player can't see the boss attacks due to the camera or due to the constant attack spam and stunlocks from adds. (Chained stunlocks leading to death are extremely common even on the easiest difficulty. It's apparent that the devs do not fundamentally understand how to design difficult enemies that can still present a fair fight.)

The best ""bosses"" in the game are almost all in category C, which are a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of the game. I genuinely enjoyed them with the ""fights"" displaying unique concepts and mechanics. Unfortunately, these bosses are in the minority. 

There are several fun bosses (Root Mother or Cancer for example) that demonstrate that the designers could make better fights, but apparently they just can't do it consistently without resorting to lazy design decisions. [u]The most likely explanation is that the inclusion of co-op and the randomized, ""rogue-like"" campaign structure wrecked enemy and boss balancing to the detriment of the entire game.[/u]

One of the game's few bright spots are the puzzles and secrets, which are genuinely difficult enough for puzzle enjoyers to sink their teeth into; however, this aspect of the game isn't enough to overcome what is fundamentally an annoying and frustrating experience.",1703709877,1703709877,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some things I like:
-Price tag is lower than most new games today.
-Style is mostly separated from game performance. There is a dark souls like roll mechanic that is affected by your armor weight but it is only one minor facet of build selection and it can be adjusted with rings and such if you want to wear heavier armor but have lighter roll etc.
-Guns feel very punchy and satisfying to use. The weapon variety is good and the balance between weapons is better than most games. There are just a couple of truly overpowered weapons.
-Build variety is staggering with the ability to choose two classes at a time, weapons, MODifiers, mutators, relics, relic shards, amulets, and four ring slots. It's fun to try out all of these things and it feels good to find a combo that works well for you.
-I absolutely love the aesthetics of the game. Each world has its own contributions, but overall it comes to a weird mix of post-apocalyptic and low-fantasy, though Losomn brought in some higher fantasy stuff too.

As an aside, the people who complain about the removal of armor bonuses from the first game are wrong. They were unnecessarily restrictive and killed style and fashion souls. You were always punished for not wearing a single armor set. Also, these bonuses were moved to Mutators and Relic shards so the functionality remains in this game, but decoupled from armor.

A few negatives but not dealbreakers for me:
-Game can be a bit unstable. Sometimes nothing, other times a couple crashes over several hours. DO NOT ALT TAB IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY HELP IT.
-Some of the weapons and gear are impossible to find without using wikis. The methods are really cool, but most people would never ever figure this stuff out on their own.

Maybe it's a good game (after a very long while), I was just really bored... at least insofar as I could tell within the steam 2 hour refund window. Many reviews say persevere, yet the cost of the base game + dlc left me wanting. Maybe I'll update my review, but honestly I don't feel must desire to fire up this title again. 

I bought this to play co-op with a friend. Instead of doing that, I had to do what's becoming the usual nonsense to unlock co-op (which I never managed to do). Instead, I managed the following in 1.5hrs:

Go here.
Talk to this inconsequential npc.
Fall asleep from reading dreary dialogue (why no voice actors??).

Go there.
Talk to another npc I didn't give a toss about. 
Choose responses from a list curated by those who seem equally disinterested.
Be miserable that they write so much but offer so little of consequence.
The circle repeats.

Rush to choose a class (I've never been into this) I don't have the time to research.
Be disappointed with that choice.

The overall game is good but it lacks things that are essential. If you got a weak PC, don't buy it.

Game mechanic: 7/10
The game feels good when dodging and the weapon design is good enough. However, if you want to do multiplayer, good luck when fighting over for that 5 or 6 ammo drop on the ground as for some fking reasons the devs decided to not have ammo pickup shared in multiplayer. The random generated world is kind of a nah for me as my friend rolled the most difficult map at the beginning for our multiplayer session. Of course you could reroll the world for easier map but I would say letting the more difficult map to be rolled after NG+ would be more reasonable as the enemies in that map are atrocious.

Map design: 5/10
The map design is okish in my opinion for now as I only played on N'Erud and that map is bad, I mean real bad. You got swarms of zombie and drones that can overwhelm you easily. As for the dungeon, it is mostly good but the puzzle design is very very questionable. Like the Vault of the Formless, how are you suppose to know how to get the key for the end loot without looking the guide online?

Game optimization: 3/10
The game really need to improve the optimization. I know the devs said the game is designed with AI upscale tech in mind but even with AI upscale enabled, the game still runs horribly. As for my computer, 5800X3D + 32GB RAM + RX 6600XT with potato setting and FSR enabled, the game only runs at an average of 20 fps and the usage on GPU is 100% while the CPU only 10%, WOW I thought in 1080p games are more CPU intensive.

Bought this game about a month after its release since I had just finished Remnant: From the Ashes by then. It's just as addicting as Remnant: FtA was for me, kept my mind occupied and focused downloading the boss' moveset instead of mindlessly wandering the internet. Now to the actual review:

[hr][/hr]

[u] Graphics[/u]

A large improvement from Remnant: FtA. 

[u] Gameplay[/u]

Dark Souls but with Guns and World RNG.
You can go for Melee builds but I would assume that would be for a second run of the campaign (I haven't attempted this yet). Trait points being capped (to 65) compared to FtA (no caps at all) took some getting used to, but it wasn't that bad considering I had to really think about where to put points into for a specific build. (They increased the cap with the release of DLC1 to 85) (Note: you don't have to own the DLC)

[b] You can pet the dog, big W.[/b]


[u] Audio[/u]

It won't kill your eardrums that's for sure. Music's great as well, and don't you dare skip the credits song when you get there.

[u] PC Requirements[/u]

I played on Ultra with DLSS on Balanced averaging 90 to 100-ish frames.
RTX 3060 Ti + Ryzen 5 5600x, 32gb RAM @ 3600MHz.

[u] Difficulty[/u]

Souls-like gameplay but with difficulty settings.

[u] Grind[/u]

Could take months to get everything unless this is the only game you play daily or every other day;
or use Remnant Save Guardian to analyze your rolls and save a lot of time trying to find a specific item; [strike] and/or utilize save scumming, your move. [/strike]


[u] Story[/u]

If you are into lore then this game is a treat. There's too many things to read in one of the worlds though lmao. Unfortunately, you can't read in-game voice logs from a menu, you have to listen to it from start to finish; on the upside there's only one world with voice logs anyway.

[u] Game Time[/u]

I finished the story in [b] 69 hours, [/b] while also doing [b] 2 runs on Adventure mode. [/b] Could easily go into the hundreds.

[u] Price[/u]

Definitely worth the money, even more so on sale.

[u] Bugs[/u]

Unless some bugs are apparent (e.g. a skill not charging), you won't notice some bugs like in damage calculations until you go to the comment section in the wiki for that specific ring/amulet/mutator/mod/skill or you calculate it yourself. Another thing, this game was crashing a lot for me and it kept giving the same error as anyone else, I assumed it was some of the background apps I was running since they always closed when the game crashed. When I closed those (ZeroTier and HWiNFO), the game stopped crashing for me.

[hr][/hr]

All in all, a great game and possibly more fun with people (my friends couldn't play since they're saving money or their war machine will be able to cook an omelette while running the game, and then explode).

Pros:
- World building is great, Yaesha, N'Erud and Losomn were full of lore and secrets, except for Root Earth.
- Puzzles were engaging, some literally had me running around for an hour before I found the answer right in front of me.
- Enemy combat is fun, but some bosses had telegraphs that are harder to interpret.
- If you love hunting for secret loot and classes, this game is for you.

Cons:
- The playable character has dialogue options like that one cousin you don't want your friends finding out about because they say the most unpredictable things imaginable. I absolutely cringed at multiple cutscenes.
- Root Earth had more Purple items back-to-back than the other realms. Felt like the devs wanted to flood me with items before I die horribly at the final boss.",1703604886,1703604886,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Other problems involve the puzzles. Clues to the puzzle solutions are found in books, these books tend to look like all the other random debris strewn about and won't be highlighted in anyway. It's not until you get very close to it and look in its general direction will you know it's something you can read.

Then when you do read the book, either have a pen and paper handy, take a screenshot or take a picture with your phone, because the information isn't something your character can carry with them. This isn't Elden Ring where you can just go in your inventory and look at a note you picked up.

Early on I came across a platforming puzzle, where after a 1 minute run from the checkpoint to the puzzle you have to jump on a series of platforms to reach some loot on the other side, if you overshoot the jump you die. Now what the game doesn't tell you is there is a secret solution that involves an invisible path with no jumping involved. This ain't Elden Ring, where you can observe the snow falling from the sky and falling on the invisible path, or a note you can pick up that alludes to this path. No you either die and die again until you land on the invisible path by accident and discover its existence then just constantly shoot at the floor to figure out where it is.

I came across a puzzle (Cathedral of Omens) where I was supposed to line up up some symbols and rings, the game gives you a book to tell you how they line up but never once mentions where the symbol is supposed to point to. I essentially lined it up correctly but then had to check a wiki to understand the wolf symbol is supposed to point towards the doorway I came in from and not to the door I was trying to open.",1703580543,1703585802,False,2,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

First off, it's buggy as hell.  I've had my character get stuck in a floor, the [spoiler] Faelin fight bugged out where he wasn't moving and after exciting and returning no matter which palace I was in I could only talk to Faerin[/spoiler] , my character likes to start sliding off of beams or ledges that have clearly been landed on, I sometimes get terrible lag, multiple times I've not gotten corrupted Luminite when members of my party have (didn't matter if I was in their world or my own), at least one boss bugging out as I was killed but my dog killed the boss so going back it just sat there, the game likes to randomly switch my active weapon if I'm going through a loading screen, a mutator that worked fine on the staff you [spoiler] get from the Doe[/spoiler] then it stops working along with numerous crashes, sometimes solo, sometimes in a party of friends.  

Oh, and it is possible to, somehow, [b]NOT[/b] pick up the dragon heart at the start of the game yet it lets you continue to the first world, that sucked.  I honestly am not sure HOW I didn't pick it up since I had to pick up the matchbox and [spoiler] Ford [/spoiler] comments on what the relic is called.

I didn't start playing until the DLC dropped and I've had performance issues, though many threads in the discussion say the DLC being added made it worse.  

And I was really, really not a fan of the ending.

So yeah, I'm recommending this game but just be super aware of these issues first.

For the record, I use mouse and keyboard.  I've a friend who used a PS controller and said the mapping was poor but I cannot speak to that in person.

I enjoy most of the combat.  Many bosses still feel like they're designed more for multiplayer and while I don't consider myself a particularity good player, seeing these bosses give friends who are far better than me the same trouble in solo kinda emphasizes that point.

Alright, now for what I like.  I DO get drops when I'm playing in a friends world, that helps cut down on the number or re-rolls of worlds I'd need to do.  I like I can leave it on Survivor difficulty and still get the things I need.

It has at least 2 bows, big fan of those.

I played the DLC with a friend who had it, I did not, and I appreciated that items I picked up that were DLC exclusive once I purchases the DLC I was able to just receive them without re-doing the same content.

I liked this more than the first game.  That game once I had friends help me finish one run through I never touched it again.  Right now, to avoid [spoiler] the gods damned cube boss in the labyrinth AND the final boss of the game itself [/spoiler] I've just been re-rolling worlds in Adventure mode.  I appreciate I know what map it is before I enter so if I need something else I can re-roll right away without needing to waste time loading into said world.  

I like the music when I am able to notice it.  Also, big fan of [spoiler] the Pan and getting more of their lore.  the Flutist [/spoiler] is a personal favorite.

I'm not going to comment on puzzle difficulty because it is subjective.  I've read the discussion threads and things I had no trouble with others were pulling their hair out over and vice versa.  I appreciate that some areas I can have a friend navigate then turn off traps (I have vision issues that makes being precise with my movements difficult).   Hell, there's a boss that's very puzzle based that is VERY polarizing so it's completely a matter of taste/experience.

I appreciate we can remap our traits whenever we want for the small cost of an item.  Said item is, now, thankfully, reusable.  I've not tried more than the two archetypes I pretty much started with, Handler and Hunter so again, can't speak to strengths and difficulties for the others.  Handler for solo was VERY helpful.

This, I feel, is another game that you'll be able to tell right away if you're going to like it or not.  If you're almost 2 hours in and hating how it feels, might just wanna refund this one.",1703583762,1703583815,True,0,0,0.469387739896774292,0,True,False,False

Veteran gamer here. started on easy/normal mode, tried for about 4.5 hours in and the game is just way too fucking hard. Your character is slow, dodges don't roll far enough to get out of the way, it is way too easy to get stunlocked where you cant move fast enough to run. Dodges often aren't able to fire because you cant stand up. Enemies close distance so much faster than you can move, so you often end up in a situation where it is impossible to create space. On top of that there are often waves of easier creatures when you encounter a boss, that also do tons of dmg. Lastly, it is far too easy to run out of ammo.

Controls are funky and make it super easy to accidentally use the rare resources/healing by accident. After reworking the controls I have this happen less often, but why tf would the game let me use items for healing or clearing status when I am uninjured or don't have the status. Super easy to burn through resources.

Why is normal mode so damn impossible!! Would be fun if I could just play the story, but I can't even get through some of the early sections.

The 3rd person aiming is so incredibly clunky (pc with mouse and keyboard here, so it shouldn't be hard, but it is just awkward). no mission log, so if I missed something I don't actually know what I am supposed to be searching for. (update, there is not enough depth to need a mission log, so not a loss if you can say that). Not enough instructions on crafting to help you figure out how to min max without wasting hours. (update, you don't need to craft, really for any reason - you visit the armory to upgrade your weapons and that is about it. zzzzz)

Let's add on top of this, poor/annoying voice acting, and a fairly shallow story (started off interesting, but I haven't had anything to progress it in ages, very dull.)

Overall I really regret buying this, glad I got it on sale instead of wasting the full 50$.

Do not buy, and smash your head against the wall in frustration like I have been....

**Update** - After not being able to get a refund because I had spent more than 2 hrs playing, I thought I would try it for a while longer to see if it got any better. The first 5 or so hours was an absolute slog until finally gaining a few levels and some items that made my hero's damage output actually accomplish anything. This was *miserable* to get through. After that, progress happened a lot more quickly, but still never reached a place where the game felt tolerable. Level design (procedurally generated) is incredibly banal. Aesthetically the game gets super tiresome very fast. Enemies, once you have the items to fight them, quickly become stale. Bosses add a new element briefly, with 1 or 2 infuriating tries before you figure out the handful of combos they do, and then they just become a drag.

Lastly, you never feel like you get any character level progression, beyond the super painful first hurdle, as the enemies are always 1 level above you character, so you cant even go back to easier areas to feel progress, as this inst a thing. 

In 13 hours there has been ZERO story advancement, hell the story was barely even established in the first place. No reason for me to care about the characters, as there has not been any events to create any story, let alone anything to get me invested in the dragging game play. At least the voice acting for the 3 NPCs you encounter out in the world and the world 1 boss improved, but that is not enough of a redeeming factor.

The second world, ""the labyrinth"" is the dullest level design and makes me want to rip my eyes out it is SO GREY.

I thought once I got to where the game was actually playable that I would stick it out until I had put in 30 hrs or so, to get my play time to ~1$/hr, but I have reached a point where I am convinced this is the most abhorrent game play experience I have suffered through since COD Black Ops Cold War. (fundamentally different game, but also fundamentally bad). Except this game requires a substantially greater investment of time. And I just can't. I can't continue to suffer through this dull digital effluent of a game.",1703365203,1703579137,False,1,6,0.417218536138534546,0,True,False,False

It's gorgeous, the worldbuilding is fun, but I feel like by capping traits they changed a core aspect of the game that a lot of the players from the first enjoyed. They are increasing trait cap with the new DLC, but that still doesn't change the fact that there's no reason for me to replay the game after I've got my build set. 

In the first game, your build was dependent on your equipment, but your traits helped you survive and you could slowly through many hours become OP. And that was super rewarding! I'd struggle through harder difficulties at first, but later found myself able to solo them as I both learned the game and beefed up my character. I loved seeing that progress, feeling like I earned being an OP deathbomb. If I wanted to steamroll through a dungeon I'd go to an easier difficulty, if I wanted to work for the win I'd bump it up. 

Maybe I'll come back to this game once they develop it some more, but I really don't see the point.

I played the game a LOT for a reason, having beaten it four separate times and even recently beat it on Apoc, so I'm positive that people will have fun with the game.

Despite saying that, I genuinely believe that people should just play Remnant 1 instead. A lot of the things Remnant 2 does has been improved vastly from Remnant 1, such as the addition of classes to allow even more customization to your active abilities than before.

Alternatively...

Everything Remnant 1 did poorly, Remnant 2 does much worse at.

The highs in this game may be much higher than its predecessor, but boy do its low get so much deeper into the mud. For example, I really disliked most of the bosses. Remnant 1 had an issue with redoing Elites as bosses, but usually they had some sort of really interesting arena to play around like with the Archer Elite. In Remnant 2 when they bring back that same Archer boss fight it is found in a flat open area with only a single tree in the center.

This sort of downgrade in the bosses also reflect in the actual enemies as well. I found the way enemies approached the player in this game were often less interesting than they were in Remnant 1 with only a few highlights to mention.

That's a small thing I noted, but the biggest downgrade to me was obtaining weapons. In Remnant 1 most weapons had to be found, but in Remnant 2 most of them are just bought from Brabus. It's like the discovery is just gone. Sure rings are more plentiful, and some of them are far more interesting than what Remnant 1 ever came up with, but I really miss just being able to play Pokemon with guns. To have that ability to say wow and just put the sucker in my hand and test it out.

Honestly the more I play Remnant 2 the more sad I get. I hope they make another game, maybe not a direct sequel since I feel like this game made retcons to the previous two games in the series, but I wanna see them experiment and improve the formula some more.",1703570679,1703570679,False,4,0,0.509315848350524902,0,True,False,False

Remnant 2: An In-Depth Review

Remnant 2, the long-awaited sequel to the Souls-like shooter Remnant: From the Ashes, arrived in July 2023. So, after months of exploration, boss battles, and loot drops, is it a worthy successor? Let's delve deep into the world of Remnant 2 and see what's in store.

Story & Worldbuilding:

The narrative takes place years after the events of the first game. The Root has seemingly been defeated, but its remnants still plague the world. As a ""Scour"" tasked with rebuilding civilization, you'll travel through procedurally generated worlds called ""Wards"" brimming with hostile creatures and environmental hazards. While the story takes a backseat to the gameplay, it provides enough intrigue and lore to keep you invested, with cryptic messages and environmental storytelling adding depth.

Gameplay & Combat:

Remnant 2 shines in its refined combat. The satisfying gunplay combines with strategic melee options, demanding mastery of both to tackle the diverse enemy roster. Dodging, parrying, and weapon mods add layers of complexity, creating a rewarding loop of learning enemy patterns and exploiting weaknesses. The addition of four distinct archetypes (Handler, Hunter, Challenger, Medic) and multi-classing opens up diverse character builds and playstyles, catering to various preferences.

Level Design & Progression:

The procedurally generated Wards offer surprising variety in environments and enemy encounters. Each playthrough feels fresh, ensuring replayability. However, the lack of handholding can be frustrating at times, with unclear objectives and map navigation demanding player initiative. Progression feels satisfying, with loot drops rewarding exploration and experimentation. The crafting system lets you tailor weapons and armor to your preferred playstyle, further enhancing the sense of customization.

Multiplayer & Co-op:

Remnant 2 shines in its co-operative aspect. Up to three players can tackle the Wards together, creating a fun and challenging experience. Sharing resources, reviving fallen comrades, and coordinating strategies adds another layer of depth to the gameplay. However, some technical issues like inconsistent hit registration and frame drops can dampen the co-op experience.

Technical Aspects:

The visuals are decent, with detailed environments and impressive boss designs. However, certain textures and animations lack polish. Performance is generally smooth on higher-end hardware, but frame drops and minor technical hiccups can occasionally disrupt the flow.

Overall Verdict:

Remnant 2 is a solid evolution of its predecessor. The refined combat, diverse world design, and satisfying loot loop offer a deeply engaging experience. While the story takes a backseat and technical issues persist, the core gameplay loop and co-op potential are undoubtedly captivating. If you enjoyed the first Remnant or crave a challenging Souls-like shooter with unique twists, Remnant 2 is definitely worth diving into.

Here are some additional points to consider:

    The difficulty curve can be steep, especially for newcomers to the genre.
    The lack of fast travel in Adventure Mode can feel tedious at times.
    The ending might leave some players wanting more closure.

Final Score: 8/10

Remnant 2 is a rewarding and challenging experience that builds upon the foundations of its predecessor. While not without its flaws, it offers a unique blend of Souls-like action, shooter mechanics, and procedural worldbuilding that will keep you hooked for hours on end.

I hope this in-depth review provides you with a comprehensive understanding of Remnant 2 and helps you decide whether it's the right game for you. Enjoy the Root!",1703495265,1703495265,True,3,0,0.537537515163421631,0,True,False,False

The progression is just poorly designed and makes it so that I can't really recommend the game at full price. If you can get it on sale, it's probably worth it.

There is nothing engaging about a leveling system that increased your damage by 5% or whatever, but also scales the enemies to your level. The weapons don't feel unique or useful, the best damage and clip size is all that matters, even for guns that are ""at the same level"" as far as when you get them or what class they are for. A lot of the enemies are bullet sponges with no unique mechanics, so just more damage per bullet and more bullets is the only viable strategy.",1703459457,1703459457,False,4,0,0.52245098352432251,0,True,False,False

One, how the fuck is there not crossplay? It's 2023, every game has it. So I basically wasted 50 dollars so that my character on Steam, can't play with my friend on Game Pass. Backwards as fuck.

Two, they went WAYYY too hard on the randomization this time. In my full playthrough, didn't do any other worlds again, I had a total of 10 weapons, primary and secondary. In Remenant 1, I had over a dozen. I'm not gonna play the same boring ass world again for a CHANCE for the weapon or gear I'm looking for. It's dumb

Three, God are the worlds so uninspired. The Eon Vault is just fog everywhere, and enemies just pasted all around the area, the last area is basically LINEAR. Like what the fuck is going on here?

And last, the bosses. Wow, every boss was a push over, but when you get to the last boss, it's just difficulty ramp right the fuck up. Like it'd be fine if the other bosses were hard, but they weren't. The last boss is the casual filter, and that point I don't even wanna finish it. (But I did, took 2 hours)

The gunplay is great, and all but everything else about the game sucked, EVEN THE FUCKING ENDING. THAT HAS TO BE THE [b]W O R S T[/b] ENDING TO A VIDEO GAME EVER. It goes ""Oh no, we can't get rid of the root without wiping out the whole timeline."" Then the chick that you meet like 3 times, but has a HUGE part in the story goes, ""I have an idea!"" and she still wipes out the timeline. WHAT THE FUCK? 

Yeah to say this is my last remnant game is an understatement. I will never buy another Gunfire game. This was a waste of 50 dollars. I wish I could get it back, or go back in time and tell my past self that this game blows ass.

I actually forgot the WORST PART. The devs decided ""Hey, let's build this game with DLSS being on AT ALL TIMES"" What...the...fuck... What dumbass thought that was a good idea? The game barely runs well with DLSS on. (3060ti, i7 12000) but with it off, HAH, have fun even playing the game. Matter of fact, if you don't have a RTX card, don't even bother with this game.

In retrospect after playing the first one I hated all the characters in that game too so I think It's just a problem area for these writers or at least the style the writers adopt for these games. Playing a bit more and I hate the first area with a burning passion and I find the puzzles more tedious than you can possibly imagine. Combat is just as okay as the first game and after a bit of playing around with upgrading and downgrading different weapons I settled on the same loadout I had for the first one, not super strong or even very good but It challenged me appropriately and I find it does the same.  Level design in general feels worse, they went for a more sprawling feel but at the cost of clear direction with a side of multiple choice, I appreciate they tried to compensate with objective markers that set you in a certain area to find your way and framing doors on the map as side or main paths but it doest fix the problem, Seemingly randomised boss quirks are good only on paper but thats about it, in practice its just a little tedious but might feel different later if I go through this again. Honestly this whole game could have just been a DLC for Remnant: From the Ashes. I still keep it as a non reccomends because I would reccomend the first game before this one in a heartbeat and I still hate so much about this but I'll keep it going for now

-------------------OLD THOUGHTS---------------------

Yes I'm only in the beginning but I think I hate this game. The only thing so far that this game does that I liked was the dog you get with one of the classes. They gave my character a voice and ""personality"" and I wanted nothing more than to see her disembowelled. My characters ""Friend"" I want to get punched in the face untill her head is nothing more than a slurry and I hope every character except Dwell and Rigs are completely slaughtered.

I HATE the intro squence, I hate that they made me hate my character before I even played, I hate they didn't give me an oppertunity to explore earth to get a handle on things, I hate that they immediately blew their load with world travel immediately, I hate that my charater went to save that random lady I also hate, I hate that I wasn't given any option to tell these unbarable characters to go f*ck themselves and instead have to drop to my knees and be forced to feign interest or slobber over their c*cks in worship, I hate that the first area is filled with flying enemies so my melee weapon doesnt get the use I want it to have, I hate that there are random ambushes denying me the ability to make my way through an area and plan encounters and I hate that I could have just replayed the first game and got everything this game seems to have but designed so much better. . . 

I'm gonna wait on this but all this game has done so far is remind me the first better game exists.

For the record on its own its not bad, compared to the first so far? its just an inferior clone in every way I've seen so far",1690673500,1703452459,False,5,1,0.278698921203613281,0,True,False,False

Will, maybe, buy it again later for some, say, 10 USD just to try again with all the patches and simply for collection. But it's definitely not worth 20 USD in my region now. That's the price for some God of War, not this. Or a fresh RoboCop, with nice graphics, alright performance, and meaningful cutscenes.

What about the game itself, regardless of its price. On the Steam Deck (15W) rigth from the beginnig you'll be met with an FSR2 being set to performance (or ultra performance) where bluriness is so bad that you can see the second character running right after yours like a shadow (it's a blur, not an actual character). The same for the real second character being seen from far away -- it's not easily distinguishable from the environment. Okay, you'll switch to balance or quality and set a limit at 30 fps. I may not like the genre but it's a personal preference, alright. The navigation through the menu is being completely performed with your analog stick (not partially, and mixed with the dpad, like in Hogwarts Legacy) -- I have no idea why this is considered a ""full gamepad supported"" game, while its menus are typical grids and lines totally suitable for the dpad of any gamepad. Even if you're okay with that, the moment you reach the hub you see an fps being cut in half (so you'll probably have to return to performance or ultra performance? that's why I've described it in details previously).

It's not exactly the same game, but if you're looking for an adventure game disguised as a third person shooter, you couldn't find a better game. This is easily my game of the year. If you're familiar with the souls-like genre, this game easily scratches the itches you'll get for exploration, loot, and player expression. It didn't have a loadouts at launch, but now, there's plenty of room to engage with the game as you'd like. Its bosses are varied, daunting and cruel, without being outright unfair.

The characters? They're a bit more interesting this time around, and a lot people return from the previous game (even ones you may not expect). The story is straightforward, and gives you bits of lore to fill in some gaps in the history of the timeline, and the only thing I can't say for certain at the time of this review is if the core plot of the series is finally resolved, as there is still DLC coming. 

Speaking of! the first DLC, The Awakened King, is fantastic, and bodes well for the rest of the game.

Combat is a blast and there is a fantastic selection of classes, skills, gear and weapons to use.  Some of the weapons are really unique and deviate from standard shooter formulas.  The armor in particular is amazing looking, even if it's been rendered mostly aesthetic only in this game.

I only have two real complaints.  The leveling and progression systems are awful.  Truly terrible, same as the first game.  Because the world scaling always matches your power level, upgrading your weapons actually hurts you.  Upgrading in a game should always be a pure benefit for the player and gated behind resources if you want to limit progression.  The second issue is that a lot of the content is locked behind RNG that even rerolling adventure mode can't fix.  For example, there is a particular weapon that requires you to get two different random levels in the same campaign because you have to pick up an item and then turn it in much later.  Quest items can't be brought across from Adventure mode and you can't check your campaign to see if you've rolled both of the required areas.  This is really unsatisfying if you are looking to get that particular gear.

I understood that the starting world you get can be different for different characters, and I got thrown into a world that not only looks and feels boring - it keeps spawning swarms of flying enemies that shoot sometimes homing projectiles... and negate my selected classes main advantage (melee).

Not to mention the bizarre design choice to make this supposedly close-quarters class nearly useless in dodging. They equip you with this heavy armour that absolutely demolishes your speed - you're far better off just unqeuipping it and using the dodge to avoid the damage.
Why would anyone want to be forced to soak damage in a soulslike game - is beyond me.

Other than that - graphics are great, guns feel great, character systems are far improved over the first game. You can carry more than one archetype now, and you have special traits that level up with it, you get skills to execute aside mods, etc...

The game looks and feels like it must be so much fun! buy it because a friend recommend it and the little bit I played was really fun.

BUT.....

-First game softlocked the very first minutes: When the first monster appeared climbing down the fan shaft I killed it before it touched the ground, This made the female character softlocks and unable to continue the sequence and open the door to the next room.

-Restarted the game.. I softlocked it again by grabbing the heal (Prior to the monster fan shaft scene) too quickly, this made the girl never to ask me to grab the heal and use it so she would not open the door again.

-First boss encounter I won and the game supposedly needs to starts to load the next level? well it hard crashes!.
I restart the game only to found it didnt have the chance to save for the next chapter so I have to start all over again the second half of the tutorial again...

-First boss crashes again after defeat not once, not twice, but 5 times!!!

At this point My friend cant believe I am having such issues so I invite him to Discord so I can stream the game to him, I defeat the boss yet again, game crashes... I start again and for some reason the game finally decides to load the next part only to HARD CRASH AGAIN after I skip the cutscene!!! Luckily the game saved so I can continue the journey.

I meet some NPCs I choose my Archetype and when its finally the time to continue the journey (Touching the red cristal thing and probably teleport to the next area) YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS! Hard Crash AGAIN!! Now for ever stuck in here since loading my save will insta crash the game... 

I am sorry but this is just unnaceptable, I tried more than once to find a solution and nothing, Probably the save file is corrupted and I need to start from scratch yet again but I am so over this..

I've had my fun, I think it's a fun and fairly decent game for what it is despite the few annoyances I have with it. It's an improvement over the first game in many ways, though it makes similar mistakes its predecessor does while making some of its own.

The individual worlds are more interesting than the game's ""overarching"" story, much like the first game. It is also a painfully *short* game in terms of its main quest, though this can work in the games favour in ways I'll touch on later. The main story is, also, woefully underdeveloped with characters I don't *really* care about and the game tries *oh so hard* to make me care, or make me think they are cool. They are not. It's a tiny bit... it made me wince. To clarify - these are characters from the first game too. The characters barely came up in the main game's story, apparently being developed more in the DLCs (which I never played.)

This game gets its length from its replayability.. You won't see all of the dungeons, secrets, and cool shit in your first play through of any area (except the labyrinth which, again, we did not see enough of.), areas are structured together similar to how many 'randomly generated' games handle it, through premade tiles that the game will glue together. This game, thankfully, marks what areas are mandatory for progression and what areas are not through its map, and I appreciate that so much. It REALLY cuts down the tedium of repeat playthroughs, an issue with the first game.

I do believe the enemy design is mostly improved from the first game. The varied weakspots are welcomed to a degree, robots from N'erud having little sensors on the sides you have to aim for, humanoids usually sporting the head, etc. There's also fewer enemies in this game that wear my complaint from the first game on their head, quite literally, but those enemies are often still there... and unfortunately extended to many of the ""minibosses"" that make up most of the dungeons; another thing i dislike about this game. Many normal enemies, or elites, see themselves upgraded to ""Bosses"" or ""Abberations"", former often found in dungeons, latter often found in the field or in secrets. Fighting a small alien crab for 10 minutes that occasionally leaves the arena to embed itself in a host while the arena is constantly filled with exploding projectiles, harmful aoes, and dozens of tiny crabs for the whole fight is not fun. Fighting a boss enemy that features no weakspot, meaning the only way to get good damage is through status (shockingly limited in this game, compared to the first.) or by using close-range weapons that sport raw damage over anything else isn't... great. Many, many times have I found myself fighting a boss where I sighed and said ""Man, I wish I had a fucking shotgun right now."" - I said about the old game ""It's a very odd design choice to make single shot, high damage on headshot weapons completely invalid for a large portion of the game by making every enemy wear a helmet that reduces headshot damage by 50%. That, and enemies always running AT you, pushed me towards using shotguns which were already some of the best guns in this game.""

Additionally, Yaesha has seen a huge downgrade over the first Remnant. Very sad to see we do not return to the tree top villages, instead we are restricted to the ground and forced to fight one of the more boring enemy types in this game: the fucking root. Annoying little buggers. 

With most of my complaints out the way, let me say nice things about this game. I like the areas a lot more, they also FEEL more varied than the first game. First game had the issue of ""Grey, samey looking ruined city."", ""orange, samey looking ruined civilisation"", ""Samey looking green swamp"", ""Oh, shit, this area is actually really pretty and sports a lot of colours."". 

This game at least sports a genuinely desolate feeling area, devoid of the people that once inhabited; outlived by their automatons and the strange 'zombie' like creatures that now inhabit the runes of their still functional automated faciltiies. That is N'erud.
Losomn is an interesting place; two worlds smashed together and thrown into utter chaos at the cause of it. Dran, the people of Losomn, turn against eachother and viciously attack Outsiders in presumed defence (much to their demise, I have a shotgun with two barrels.), as they find themselves often hunted by the Fae who inhabit the other world that collided into theirs. Losomn is a very dreary place, the kind of streets you'd expect to see in the impoverished districts of some shitty victorian place. Rancid sewers, filled with wooden structures that people inhabit, too. 
The Fae, conversely, live in the most grand and opulent halls. Very pretty place to look at, gilded and decorated. That conceals their more... dark nature, however. And their petty, internal struggles.

I mentioned Yaesha, earlier, an area from the first game. It's seem better times, the once vibrant life of the dense jungles have withered and greyed as Yaesha sees the Root sucking the life out of the world itself. Still, some of its old inhabitants, some familiar to the player, return, as does much of its previous story elements.

Also - this game is absolutely CHOCK full of really cool shit. Some places have multiple outcomes, some places have cool secrets, and by god there are a lot of secrets both clever and bullshit in many places. If you enjoy digging through every little nook and cranny, you might enjoy the optional stuff in this game.
This is what I meant by ""The game is short, measured by the campaign, but it's replayability comes from the side."", this game is more or less meant to be replayed over and over. Start on normal, the FIRST difficulty, to get some gear together. Play it again on higher difficulties for more of a challenge. Play it on even HIGHER difficulties to put your builds to the test. Along the way, you'll probably find things you didn't find before, or maybe your main bosses will be different! New guns, new secondary fires, new modifiers, new melee weapons, new classes! Await you on future playthroughs.

... I feel like I need to say something about weapon balancing, but I can't comment on it too much given how little guns I've used. Nightfall, a gun with the ability to gain infinite ammo and higher rate of fire with healing on damage, is the gun I found on my first playthrough. And holy fucking shit is that gun horrifically powerful.

Eh, I'm not sure if this 'review' helps anyone, and I know a lot of it is negative - unfortunately my brain has a tendency to focus on the negatives more than the positives, but I wouldn't RECOMMEND this game if I thought it was shit. Genuinely I think this game is fun and I do recommend it. Fun alone, fun with pals.",1703253927,1703253927,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Definitely going in my top 5 favorite games. I enjoyed Remnant 1 and Remnant 2 expanded on every good aspect. While you can play it by yourself, it is infinitely better with friends. I've never even played a souls-like game before Remnant 1, and I still haven't. These games are far enough removed from the genre that a newbie can get into them. Some people complain about the story or the writing or the humans or whatever, but honestly I didn't notice it. I play the game for the cool ass weapons and mods, for all the cool ass skills and perks from the many archetypes/classes, for the cool ass enemies and bosses, and all the fun you have finding different ways to obliterate them. They did a great job with the weapons and mods, making many more than were in the first game and including a few of the memorable ones too.

That being said, I did actually enjoy the story. It tied the flow of gameplay together and connected to the first game in a sensible way. 

My only gripe is the final boss, it really needs its difficulty lowered (again). Three power level 20 players struggling for hours to take it down? that was the intention? really? I suppose we could have looked up broken character/damage builds but that's not the way we like to do things.

My favorite part though, are all the secrets. The game is chock full of them around every corner. The best weapons and items are of course hidden this way, and figuring out the puzzles or cryptic clues is always very satisfying. 

Some people tout the random world generation but honestly that's one thing that makes this game very worth the price. Each 'dungeon' or side door you enter has a boss in it (or most do, anyway) and they made like three different possible bosses for that room. Each world has two main areas with 2-4 side doors each. Each world has one main quest-line and 2-3 possible quest-lines for it to choose from. Basically you can play though this game three times and still have not seen everything. Translated, that means you're effectively getting THREE GAMES for the price of one. And not even the normal price for a game like this these days. It absolutely would have been worth $60, much less the actual $40 price tag. I'm 65 hours in and have seen maybe 70% of things; you do the math.",1703187212,1703187212,True,2,0,0.507816195487976074,0,True,False,False

[TL:DR]
White man bad, whamen strong, crashes alot, bugs that won't get fixed because it forces replay, downgrade from first game, devs hate fun.

-game is filled with ESG ass kissing. Gotta push ""THE MESSAGE"".
-Same garbage as Elden Ring. Even though, there are more unique bosses. 
-Bosses AOE infinity spam. Nothing creative there.
-The dodge, is slow to respond and slow to finish. And yet the whole game relies on it. But it's ok to have a faulty/shitty system for survivability, because there's 3 of you. Why fix the wheel on the wheelbarrow, when your 2 other friends can carry the front. 
-Campaign is short, relying heavily on replayability, unlike the first that didn't heavily rely on ""rerolls"" for longevity.
-Puzzles are boring. They are needlessly convoluted. Want a hint? Go find a book and read it, it might have a clue. (rinse and repeat, untill you find the one clue you need)
-Resource acquisition is a grind within a grind. Far worse then what was implemented in the first.
-Boss attack timing is deliberately inconsistent, same garbage as Elden Ring. 50/50 chance the same attack will delay or won't. Couple that with the stop-wait-then-roll dodge animations, consistently dodging instant damage attacks is basically ""cheating the player to fake difficulty"".
-No more max leveling, like we had in the first. TPs are enough to fill half, or less, of the trait chart. Collecting more trait books, does nothing.
-Armor sets no longer give bonuses. They are just cosmetic. 
-No more innate elemental weapons. Unlike in the first game.
-Build diversity comes down to perk and weapon mods; armor and weapons amounts to shit for builds. Hurray for diversity....smh
-Vaulting is...just retarded. Some things you can vault others no, ok fine. Of the ones you can, somethings you can't because...Devs don't know either apparently. Guess ""If it's broke, fix it."" is lost on them. Taking pages from CDPR Cyberpunk's book I see.
-Consistent crashes just for hosting/changing loadouts
-Melee combat is straight ass
-Secrets are like finding a needle in a hay factory, because it gives fanboys a sense of ""accomplishment"" for scurrying around for 2 hours. All for a piece of gear that's no better then what you get for starting the game.
-Enemy scaling is bonkers retarded. You are forced to max level anything new, just for testing purposes to see if it's viable or not. A grind that is completely RNG and scarce. 
-Still has fun ending bugs, some game ending, and some game crashing
-Staggering is just, bluntly put, retarded. Light attacks can stagger lock regardless of heavy armor. No such thing as poise, all you get is one ability that's temporarily resists staggers from light attacks only. Med-strong attacks still stagger lock you till you die. As for enemies, it's the complete opposite. The same garbage as stumbling in B4B. Enemies will be long dead before you can ""stun"" them.
-Updates fix one issue just to break 2 more. 
-Constant crashing and freezing, multiplayer is unplayable. But according to them, playing online for 5min before game crashes is considered fixed.
-Roll jumping off a ledge is as retarded as vaulting over a barrier. The ""sweet spot"" is less then 5% of the 3 meter wide ledge.
-Visual effects still bug-out
-Boss alternate kills are still bugged.


*bugs need fixing*
Devs: ""Eh, maybe tomorrow or something.""

*players created a fun build*

I like the fact the devs took chances but overall the game is super grindy now and the only reason to play it is to make builds but to make the builds you need to invest many hours in a single build. 
A deep dive into the state of the game review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoBN2R4ryzk

After 30 hours of playing the game i saw the major changes and it's a mixed bag.
My first review for the game places it at 8/10 with a mention its very fun but only if you are a fan of remnant 1 or a co-op player
Many thing were improved but this was done at a cost for the general experience.
The combat can depend a lot on the person and their knowledge of the game so we will leave that for last

Pros: great atmosphere, great item variety, nice builds, archetype system is not bad, interesting interactions with items, quest items and dungeons, nice places to visit

Cons: garbage performance, game looks blury, Super ultra mega grindy now, some dungeon secrets or interactions are so obscure you can spend hours and not solve them
.
Mega cons: limitd to ONLY 60 trait point cap( you can only choose to max out 6 trait and 2 archetype trait to 10 depending on equiped archetypes)
A lot less dungeons and bosses
Game suffers from the cyberpunk police effect, killing an enemy might trigger a wave and after that an elite spawn around the player
Not designed for Solo play
Horrible story, you can't even ignore how bad and lazy it is.

Will probably modify my review to positive after i get the 3 dlcs i paid with the extorsion edition but for now, let's admit to the problems and discuss them so we can improve the game and the player experience

Ps: After playing 50 hours more i see the game has game breaking bugs and some weapons that break the balance making collecting items useless because the devs badly overtuned some guns.
Not only that but there is a glitch for infinite money that hasn't been fixed for a week.
It really makes no sense to strugle in this game if the devs can't release hotfixes.
Very dissapointed with the lack of hotfixes to fix broken balance, exploits, bugs or even archetype specific problems like gun swap on engineer.
Lol, it's like they are a small studio. All they do is talk to their fanboys and cheerleaders on reddit and discord but they haven't fixed anything.
Don't buy unless there is a big disscount, the game has serious issues and you will miss out on the fun experience if you buy now",1690303635,1702913082,True,0,0,0.48250424861907959,0,True,False,False

Even if the gun-focus doesn't seem initially like your jam, there's much that's familiar and the rest is a nice change of pace from other soulslike-games. The randomization aspect of levels and loot are reason enough to provide gameplay for a good while.

In this review I'll go over some of the basics of what makes this game so good, while being vague so as to not spoil any of the experience. This review was written after the first DLC launched, and it will be updated if anything significant happens as the rest of them are released.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
First off: the Archetypes. The best thing I can say about the class system of this game is that I hope other games will steal the idea from this one as the way Remnant II does it is brilliant. Each class provides a selection of three active abilities (of which only one can be equipped and used at a time) and several passive perks, along with a powerful prime perk that provides a major changes to how you play the game. The medic class for instance can recover estus charges (your healing potion if you're new to the genre) by healing allies, allowing them to keep themselves and others alive longer. Their abilities heal in various ways, and can even revive fallen allies back to their feet.

Once you have the item for a class, you can swap them at any time, thus allowing you to freely switch up whenever you feel like. You can also have two classes equipped at a time, providing many unique combinations of abilities and passive perks. It's a blast to think of and play as different combinations, with many of them having synergies with each other. There's a good selection of classes to start from, and you can unlock more by finding obscure secrets as you play through the game. Some aren't all that powerful, but even the worst ones have their use cases.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Secondly: the loot. You can equip up to four different rings, an amulet, a long gun, a hand gun, a melee weapon, an estus flask and your choice of four armor pieces. Weapon mods and mutators also affect how you play. Of these the ones that stand out the most are rings, amulets, weapon mods and weapons. 

Rings and amulets provide passive effects to your character, with some varying from boosting reload speed, damage, or just giving you a chance to not consume estus upon use. Amulets often have more powerful, unique effects, like releasing toxic gas upon switching weapons or causing reloads to only consume half the ammo you reload. Rings tend to be more minor, but still retain significant effect on your build. With more than 70 amulets and more than 150 rings in the game, there's plenty to choose from.

Weapons vary in effect from bows to rifles to shotguns, with most having their own unique niche that they fulfil. Basic long guns and hand guns can equip weapon mods, while boss weapons and unique weapons usually have their own custom weapon mod that cannot be removed. Weapon mods are like spells you can fire from your gun, with some just dealing damage, some firing healing energy while others create new weakspots on hit enemies. Most guns and weapon mods are useful or even build defining, with some falling short compared to what others provide. Again, there's plenty to choose from.

Melee weapons also exist, but they're much more simplified compared to common soulslike weapons. Each one has a combo string, a heavy attack and a backdash attack. Many of the unique weapons change how you use them, with some being throwable while others might leave a damage over time effect. Melee combat is a great alternative to using ammo on common enemies, but against many of the bosses it's either reckless or basically impossible.

Estus flasks, or Relics as the game calls them, come in many varieties. Some heal you instantly on use, others heal over time, some provide other bizzare ways to regain health. With 23 unique ones to choose from, this system is like if Salt and Sanctuary healing was overhauled and expanded on. Not all are made equal but the standing out ones can define how you build your character (not going to spoil them of course!)

Armor is divided into light, medium, heavy and ultra heavy varieties. It uses a similar weight based system common to soulslikes where wearing heavier armor grants you better defences at the cost of slower invincibility rolls and more stamina consumption, while lighter armor allows you to roll faster at the cost of less resistances. There's good variety in aesthetics, with some being fantasy-like, some being just utilitarian armor, while others are just something like a cowboy costume. Armors don't provide anything beyond defences which is a shame since they had abilities in the first game, but the other loot provides them in spades.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thirdly, boss fights. The main bosses are a treat; unique fights that have a twist that changes up the normal dodging and weaving of normal fights. They are challenging and satisfying to take down, and even the minibosses pose a unique threat. Two especially memorable fights that everyone will meet regardless of randomization are sure to stick out. Love 'em or hate 'em, they're excellent in providing a unique challenge you can't find elsewhere. The final boss will thoroughly test you and your build (don't be discouraged, keep up the fight skeleton!).

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Now you know the basics of what makes this game cool. All that's left is to mention the few issues the game has.

Major issue: Performance. With the release of the first DLC, performance has taken a dive. I don't mean that it's a constant low framerate mess, just that sometimes in some areas it dips below what it should be. My computer can run the game on ultra settings just fine, but in some of the DLC areas the framerate has been reduced to less than a single frame every 6 seconds while the computer screams in agony. These dips tend to pass after a while, but it has gotten me killed more than once. If you don't plan on getting the DLC this shouldn't affect you (atleast according to some user reports which might not be reliable.)

Minor gripes: 1) Economy. Scrap, the main resource of the game, is hard to come by. Environmental objects and common enemies drop pitiful amounts, while chests, bosses and minibosses provide slightly more. All in all, you can't afford much beyond upgrading your main weapon until you start grinding an area you've already explored once again. The highest yield of scrap can be gained from picking up either amulets/rings you already have, or tomes of traits after you've reached the trait cap. As a result, the consumable items like buff potions are almost a bad investment when compared to saving for buying permanent power in the form of new weapons, weapon mods and weapon upgrades. If it were up to me, I'd boost income by introducing items like the souls from Dark Souls or runes from Elden Ring, a pickup that grants you scrap upon consuming it. These could drop from any viable loot source, and if they'd boost the player income by say 20-30% you'd have enough to go around for buying consumables or trying new weapons from the shop or whatever else you might use it for.

2) Story. The main story is very barebones, it's just an excuse to go see cool worlds and shoot enemies for loot. No lore channel will spring forth to explain the main story, as there's not much to go on. The world building for each of the areas is interesting and fun to read",1702904916,1702904916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The worlds became much larger than in the first Remnant and they mostly consist of copy/pasted half-empty boring locations.
2. The gameplay is very repetative, enemies are stupid and work as a dummies for shooting. Their variety is poor.
3. Boring gameplay could be compensated by constant build/loot progression but soon you'll realize that you need MANY hours to grind for a gun that is barely better that your starting one.
4. Like in a previous title the worlds are generated with a random logic, but now it takes hours just to check if certain dungeon/event has spawned for farming equipment for your build. Basically you need days to farm certain weapon/ring/amulet and you don't even know if it is better than yours.
5. Extremely stupid puzzles.
6. Bad performance even on top systems.
Overall you can complete it once but I see zero replayability, unrewarding gameplay and large copy/pasted maps which are boring to play even on a first try.",1702894307,1702894307,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

This game has much more customization, too much almost. You have 3 stat bonuses to add to your relic, different relics (estus), 50 different rings but 10 main artifacts to make your build, stat increasing traits after beating most bosses, and progressively more complex mod abilities for your guns. Not to mention, many of the classes are not available from the start and require you too go out of your way to find. Most are not easy either, the engineer for example (look up a guide, idk how you'd find it otherwise). And those classes near the end; they won't even be that leveled by the time you beat the game, so it feels like a waste. Otherwise, making my character stronger felt empowering. There is so much synergy between the class archetypes, as well as the rings, artifacts, mods, and even the armors.

There are so many bonus, side objectives that if you skip, it makes you feel like you skipped half the game. You can do nothing but focus the main objectives and miss out on whole levels with boss fights and unique NPCs with great storytelling and perks. The side areas felt like chores you had to complete, and you'd be surprised when you encountered these nuggets of a sparatic, but amazingly well made world. I wish there was less fluff of killing the same few enemies is the same copy pasted dungeons with the only incentive being a boss or item you'd get. It is quite repetitive, much like the first game.

Though very specific, I wished you'd get to really know the characters. You're thrown in like you had a whole game already with them. I could care less about the tutorial interactions with my 'best friend / you owe me one / overly chipper' side character. She gets degraded into a store by the way, no cool missions to make up for this. I was really happy when you met Ford; I really hoped to go on one of his adventures, but he and Clementine ditch you to do the same old slaughter dimensional entities for the mcguffin to progress. I did not care about the city in the beginning, their dialogue was easy to miss, and they had no plot relevance. They were an 'immersive' 'this is what you are fighting for' element, but I wish you could interact with the town, like a defense mission for it. But they remain cardboard cutouts for you to role-play with.

Talking about the end here:

There was a huge difficulty spike hear the end. The second to last boss had no story relevance, but was a warning for the final boss. It was HARD, and me and my friend had real builds to try to fight him. Even then, it took us about 10 tries, with each attempt being 10 or more minutes. It was not a satisfying end, and I feel like they made it that way on purpose. It is the most logical, setting up newgame+, but it deeply upset both me (remnant 1 player), and my friend (new player). I want a conclusion. Not a ""play the game again, or get the DLC"" let down. There is so much customization I could go back and do, but I feel exhausted, and unable to bring myself to go back into the dungeon crawler simulator. I feel bad for those NPC and boss moments that genuinely surprised us. If the game was cut down to half the areas in each world, but retained the side content, It would be much easier than having to wade though actual sewer levels to discover small, but touching stories in this shattered universe.

The ending to the first game was how I wished this game ended. The Wander is my cannon Anomaly.

• Some enemies/bosses have some jank hitboxes where even avoiding it, you'll still be hit. Could be skill issue/desync.
• Perma-stun lock.
• Challenger archetype feels weak early on where you still only want to rely on guns since a lot of bosses seem to live in the sky or hug ceilings. Your prime perk DIE HARD is also a negative where if you get put down during a boss fight, to only get back up for that boss to 1 shot the zone you're in, sucks.
• Some bosses spamming ads where you fight them more than the boss and have to evade/run when a boss exposes a weak point.
• Party scale gets pretty difficult at 3 players where we would suggest doing it solo to make it easier. Funny how that works.
• NPCs and lore is pretty forgettable, but the interesting world more than makes up for it.

• Adventure Mode is a nice addition to comb through multiple levels and grind through them.
• Armor is so much better where you don't have to worry about them messing up your build, while looking cool.
• Trait points are limited to 85 levels but are so much more impactful.
• Your character no longer feels sluggish.
• Finally, classes feel like classes and don't all feel the same.
• Sub-Archetype class is a nice diversity to be flexible and try combinations that work for you and the team.
• Archetype skills, that can be switched out. You're never truly locked in
• Level design is much more interesting even if there are random dead ends. Designers definitely knocked it out of the park.
• Puzzles, secrets, and illusory walls.
• Randomly starting on a new world.
• Crawling while down.
• Finally having infinite stamina while exploring.
• Map is a game changer. Wish it would highlight where your friends discovered.
• Tons of replayability.

   most of them are either way to easy and boring or you'll just get 
   drowned by monsters

- lack of some basic functions, like comparing items ,sort your inventory, etc.

- boring loot: 
   - most of the loot is just lying around with little to none skill requirements

   - bosses most of the time don't drop cool new weapons, instead you get special material to give
      your weapon a new fire mode. Which feels boring 

   - I nearly finished the story mode and I've only got 2 new main weapons (ranged)
     compared to a ton of melee weapons and secondary weapons (pistols). In a shooting game ?!
 
-apparently there are 11 Archetypes(classes) of which you can choose 2 at the same time but I still haven't got any new 
  one, apart from the 4 base Archetypes. Why hiding such a interesting mechanic?


There are still lots of minors flaws which gives me the impression, that they improved nearly nothing
apart from the visuals compared to the first game.

I think I liked the structure of the 1st one a bit more, this one made things more random. Sometimes people give linear games a bad rap and I'm not sure why. Not every game needs to be an open world GTA or Far Cry nor do they need randomly generated maps like in Diablo. Sometimes, a good linear path for a story driven game is good. Having said that, the gameplay is the real star of the show here and it's still solid. Weapons feel great to shoot and the movement is great. The challenge of the combat is still solid and if you mess up it will cost you but feel fair. The dual class system lets you customize your playstyle pretty well and it was cool seeing what my friends came up with. I'm not a personal fan of Souls-like games but for some reason I love Remnant, I think because of the focus on ranged combat and the co-op.

I quit midway in the first game because after I explored the whole map, defeat the boss, and killed everything I could find, I did not know how to proceed to the next area/segment/quest. I was totally stuck. Spent another hour or so looking thoroughly through the map and still had not a damn clue how to proceed. Didn't bother to waste another hour doing so.

I was stupid enough to purchase the second game because I thought this time shit like that in the first game wouldn't happen again (and also because the game was so damn fun when everything goes well). Then I got stuck again, and this time it happened in THE VERY FIRST MAP after finishing the tutorial. What an absolute cluster fuck. This is not an open-world game.

Still the worst $50 I ever spent on this platform.  Game is still irritating dogshit.  Multiplayer is always garbage/dead/unavailable.  Controls are still finicky dogshit.  Gameplay is unrewarding.  I only die due to controls not responding or enemies spawning 10 feet behind me.  

Quick Summary:  2.5/10
1) Character customization (physical):  Dogsh*t.  Afterthought.  Doesn't matter.
2) Character customization (skills & Talents):  Meh. Basic.  Leveling is mostly unrewarding 75% of the time.
3) Difficulty: Typical dark souls experience.
4) Online play:  ABSOLUTE dogsh*t.  The worst aspect of the game, and the most disappointing.  Forced spectating.  Disconnections.  Joining a game where the host is AFK.  Just awful.
5) Graphics and design:  Really phenomenal, even if some areas are ripped from Stranger Things.
6) Weapons and armor:  Extremely lackluster.  Same systems are Dark Souls, except armor is RARE.

Long summary:

Hey Gunfire Games.  It appears you're trying to make a game.  I presume you want it to be enjoyable.  Here are some tips from someone who actually plays video games that maybe you can use for Remnant 3:

Good idea:  Make boss kills feel rewarding by having them drop unique weapons and armor.
Bad idea:  Not having bosses drop anything useful at all, ever.

Good idea:  Character customization.
Bad idea:  Have everyone look identical, man or woman, if they are wearing the same armor.  Sh*t, just pay a nerd who mods for Skyrim to show you how.

Good idea:  Allow players to use an arsenal of different skills that they can combine to form their own unique playstyle.
Bad idea:  Only allow players 1 ability to use at a time.

Good idea:  When a player levels up, reward them with something.  Anything.  Seriously, literally anything is good.
Bad idea:  Making leveling up completely pointless by not rewarding the player with anything.

Good idea:  Have fun, enjoyable online Coop where the players have multiple ways to aid each other and work together.  (Left 4 Dead 2, Vermintide, etc)
Bad idea:  Have online Coop where you wait in spectator mode for 15 minutes while the active player finishes killing a boss, then they quit and you get disconnected.

Those are the big ones.  I figured you guys could use some advice from someone who actually plays video games.  If you want Remnant 3 to be an overwhelming success, feel free to follow my guide here.  Good luck in the future.",1691442255,1702706942,False,2,0,0.48204311728477478,0,True,False,False

   Quick Summary:
This game is a more story driven dark souls with FAR better multiplayer and easier difficulties available.

   This game... just wow: 
The trailer at the far right side of all the pictures on the steam store is one of the best god damn trailers I've ever seen. Still gives me the chills. Watch it.

   Extremely immersive world: 
Even just walking around is actually so fun just cause of the view and the scenery. It's so freakin' well done. 

   There are old friends and new ones too: 
Hearing people talk about their lives at home base is interesting and felt like a treat. Honestly felt like returning to a family after playing the first game.

   Gameplay felt really good: 
From improved basic movement (Identical except now you can jump off ledges [def better]) to the improved load-out system (yes, I was worried 2) I'm happy to say, ""improved"" is the right word. At first it felt weird not being able to upgrade armor, but after playing through the game on Veteran difficulty and completing a run, I looked back to realize the enemies that attack you scale in a way that ""feels"" like you ARE actually upgrading your armor as well as enemy difficulty increasing just the right amount. This as because all the foes you come across are actually relatively the same difficulty, but since learning how to beat them is the hard part it always feels like the right amount of challenge. 

   Difficulty recommendations:
-If you're new to the series or just want to enjoy the story, I recommend Survivor difficulty. ESPECIALLY IN MULTIPLAYER.
-Veteran is either for people that have FINISHED the first game, or experienced tactical shooters/Dark Souls players. If you start on Veteran difficulty and don't know what you're doing, you will get your ass handed to you ESPECIALLY IN MULTIPLAYER.
-Nightmare IS for players that have played through the game once before or people that hate their lives and want to hate them even more.
-Apocalypse isn't available until you beat the game once and is probably the game's final gambit at making you rage-quit.

   Dev's aren't greedy:
No battlepass, no cash grab dlc, you buy the game, and unlock the shit. For a decent price nowadays mind you. Just the way it should be. I bought Ultimate Edition cause I know I would buy all the dlc when it came out. There are a few bugs as of 7/28/2023 which are potentially anger inducing. However, Gunfire did say they were working on them. Yes, this is Epic Games, but they don't make you do stupid login shit like they usually do, so absolutely no complaints.
   
   Late game build potential:
This is insane. From a Thor, God of Thunder build that can throw an axe and summon lightning to smite hoards of enemies at a time, to custom builds like my life-stealing/teleporting/dual wealding assasin and toxic exterminator (where I turn being poisoned into a buff.) There are SOOOOO many posibilities that are fun to test and play as well as many meta boss builds to choose from online. Seems like every person has their own twist on how they like to play/build.

Probably the best part of the game is build variety. There is a good variety of guns and bows, and they're all viable. The downside is that since zones (and enemies) scale with your highest upgraded weapons, it can be expensive early on to try out different weapons unless you don't upgrade very much.

Enemy variety is also strong. Each biome has distinct enemies. Boss design has shifted a bit from the first game to be less dependent on minions for difficulty and more on the main boss itself, which is a positive. Also, the game's final boss is one of the most unique boss fights I've encountered in video games, especially shooters. The main complaint I have about combat is that basically all enemies tend to employee delayed attacks that punish you if you try to dodge instinctively.

Way better than Remnant 1 in almost every way. Completely delivers on the idea of ""Soulslike with guns"".
Build variety and replayability? Double check.
Fun and satisfying combat? Check. Guns feel great, abilities and mods are properly impactfull, dodges feel great and fun to use. This game boasts probably the best neutral dodge in any soulslike. Kinda makes me think why backsteps don't have any iframes in other soulslikes.
Appropriate level of challenge? Check. I also hate cubes now.
Locations are still kinda meh. I wish Yaesha looked like it was in Remnant 1. Now it is all red like earth was in Remnant one. Booo-ring. Two other locations are way too gray. This game could stand to get a splash of colour.
Bosses?
They are kinda hit or miss, but this game also gave me two of my most favorite bosses ever. Shoutout to Annihilation and the Red Prince. I like them so much I can't really find any flaw with either one of them. 
Some bosses are real stinkers though, and it is almost surprising that they are in the same game as the good ones.

This is a well and true deserved successor..

Its the same but also not the same, Improved gameplay and the story picks up from where we were left hanging at the previous game. I'd say its gotten an improvement and a well welcomed one at that.

The story is pretty typical, Its not ground breaking but it fills in the gaps here and there from the two games, though it is very much enjoyable as how in the 'Awakened King' its a throwback to the little things you find and it comes out into a whole new piece.

Gameplay wise, Definitely improved. The maps are..Pretty big still, Not Super huge but large enough to warrant significant exploration and especially a keen eye and an open mind. Stuff you wouldn't expect to do in other games or you would say ""Surely not right? Im not this dumb to just do it right? Ah screw it.""
And they reward you for the effort of digging around.

Plenty of weapons both unique and standard, Weapon mods are plenty and their modifiers too.
Although the grind is pretty long especially for traits and EXP (Sadly you cant have ALL the traits like in the last game)

The length? At first it feels short, But once you redo runs again and again and again. You are missing ALOT..And i mean alot of stuff. Both big and small, easy and complicated. Im at..80 Hours? And i guarantee i still am missing quite a few rings, Amulets, Artifacts and etc. Weapons are pretty 'easy' as i would loosely say to get. Some are much more complicated than others and very easy to miss.

Oh..And mandatory multiplayer. (Honestly..Grab a friend.) Singleplayer its good, But multiplayer with more friends and chaos is much better yeah? I thoroughly enjoyed this and would definitely recommend it. Especially with the Upcoming DLCS if this is the effort they put in...Unlike certain AAA games.

[h2]Gameplay: 3/5[/h2]

I like the basic gameplay loop, which is somewhere between ARPG, looter shooter, horde shooter (but with much less density), and Souls-like (but not really).

The puzzles and secrets add a good amount of replay value up to a point (it makes the first few replays [i]much[/i] better than replays/NG+ in other games). I suggest not spoiling too much for yourself, it's ok to experiment, try, and fail. Some things may take multiple tries or even multiple replays to figure out.

Onboarding is rough. The random world generation can be extremely unfun for new players. I chose the Handler (pet) class and got a world with only flying enemies that the pet couldn't hit.

The game itself isn't that complicated; the knowledge hurdle is mainly caused by poor UI and inconsistent descriptions. Say you find an item with Haste. The tooltip doesn't tell you what Haste does, that would be too easy. You have to equip the item, activate its conditions if any (e.g. use a skill or be under a certain % of HP), then open your character sheet and mouse over the tiny Haste buff in the top-left before it disappears. If there are 3 items with the exact same mechanic/conditions, you can expect them to be written in 3 different ways.

[h2]Story: 2/5[/h2]

There are 2 layers to the storytelling in Remnant: the lore and events of other worlds, as well as the overarching story of the protagonist and our world.

The other worlds are well-written, and explore a wide variety of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror tropes with some interesting spins. I love when games bring classic sci-fi ideas to a wider audience, even though some references are a bit too on-the-nose. I'd go as far as to say each of the worlds is rich enough to support their own games.

The main story however is Avengers wannabe, without the polish or pizzaz. Flat characters (including your own) make Marvel-style quips out of nowhere. Obvious parallels to various Marvel characters and plot points.

This is an actual quest entry (written in first person from your character's view): [spoiler]A giant ball of light told me to kill some powerful creatures to collect segments of the Index. Sounds important.[/spoiler] You're just too cool for the end of the world.

[h2]Performance: 2/5[/h2]

Far under expectations for the visual quality. I'm lucky it runs mostly smooth 60fps (with aggressive upscaling) on an RX 6600, though many others with better hardware have worse problems. I still get bizarre issues like an empty room with 1 light causing frame drops.

DLC and patches seem to introduce new issues for many users, so even if you're lucky now, it might not be the case tomorrow.

[h2]Bugs: -2147483648/5[/h2]

This game has everything: gameplay, graphics, sound, input, UI, networking bugs; random crashes; partial or complete loss of progress. Steam forums are filled with players reporting the same major bugs like crashes everyday, with no response.

Even their bugfix patches have bugs. The best way to discover new bugs is to check the patch notes; within 24 hours, someone will comment that the thing they fixed actually wasn't fixed or broke something else.

Bugs that give players an advantage are quickly fixed though!

There are various enemy types that hide in the environment. Quite a lot of rooms are obviously designed for ambushes. But, your character will randomly shout combat lines (""Here they come!"") [i]before[/i] the enemies aggro or are visible, completely spoiling the ambush.

Similarly, one of the main combat mechanics is the dynamic elite spawns, which are supposed to add randomness to gameplay instead of fixed enemy placements. However, the sound design directly contradicts that by having the same non-directional alert sound for every elite spawn, which trains you to simply press your buttons when you hear the sound. You don't react to specific enemy sounds. You can't hear an elite patrolling the next room to prepare, because it doesn't exist until it ""dynamically"" spawns.",1700321471,1702527139,False,2,1,0.50083470344543457,0,True,False,False

The map is confusing to tell where you or where you need to travel to since you can't look into a location or zone unless you travel to it. It's especially boring if you are not the host. Being a partner you see nothing of the map and can't even look at your gear or inventory whilst you wait.

There are too many rings and no way to filter them, only set favourites.
All the mutators look exactly the same and there's no favouriting.
Trying to navigate the menu and inventory is still just a terrible experience overall. What is it, left click the gun, right click the mutator, press space to equip the mutator or something?

Too many secrets that I would never ever figure out without looking at wikipedia. Invisible walls, hate it. Unlocking the Archon required datamining. Place an item down, leave the zone and come back.

Still decent and I do intend to keep playing, I enjoy sooo much of it. But I don't know, just seems like a lot of obvious stuff that make it so clunky for such a big game.

[u]But the main story is definitely not the game's strongest point. [/u]
It's probably okay for me to spoil a bit, since there is no breath-taking, deep story to begin with. 

[h2]The Full Main Story of Remnant 2 (Abridged)[/h2]
-> After a tutorial, you reach ""Ward 13"", the base of your operations in this game. 
-> You gear up and follow an old man (Ford) to an abandoned place. 
-> You and old man find a Large Floating Red Rock.
-> Old man touches rock and gets teleported away 
-> Woman (Clementine) appears out of nowhere
-> She gets dragged/kidnapped into rock and so you follow her in. 
-> Your goal for the main story is to find these two [b][Initial Goal][/b]
-> After exploring one world, you get taken to a place called ""Labyrinth"" 
-> You meet Woman and big eyeball [strike]god[/strike] who says a lot of things, just to say so little.
-> Eyeball talks like a Chat BOT that was asked to talk using only complicated words
-> Eyeball is really bad at explaining and talks a lot for a few minutes 
-> Basically, eyeball wants a companion because they're overworked. 
-> Woman was kidnapped earlier to become companion for big eyeball.
-> Woman's just chilling with big eyeball now.  
-> [strike] Who's Ford again? Nevermind, let's just call it a day since we found the woman [/strike]
-> Explore two more worlds to get shiny shards.
-> Shiny shards turn into portal to go to Earth 2.0, which is overtaken by root monsters. 
-> Apparently root monsters are a threat to other worlds so you must destroy them!!
-> Meet up with Woman and Big Eyeball at a big tree
-> Big Eyeball is now a humanoid with a quirky personality
-> There is big barrier blocking access to big tree with final boss in it
-> Woman yells and loses her special powers to remove barrier
-> You go in and kill final boss
-> Final boss can't die
-> Only way to deal with the boss is to factory reset the entire universe. 
-> Eyeball starts whining and can't bring themselves to do it.
-> Clementine takes factory reset button out of eyeball man's hands
-> (Best scene in the game), eyeball man yells ""CLEMENTINEEEEE"" 
-> Clementine presses factory reset button instead
-> World resets.
-> Credits Roll
 
{THE END}

[h3]Things I'm genuinely sad about the story [/h3]
- Character Development of the Eyeball man happens off screen 
(From ChatGBT to an awkward humanoid being with a quirky personality)
- Ford's just gone from the Main story. You won't be seeing him again. 
- Game treats it like there's countless worlds out there, but you only go to 5 in total.
- Each world has its own story, but most don't even connect with the main story line. 
- The story definitely had potential :(",1700669999,1702472195,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's also the only other game I've been wanting to consistently play other than BG3 (when solo) and the story/game play has kept me entertained the whole time!

As a try to be completionist this game has really been a attention grabber with so much RNG for worlds and some weapons/experience needing you to replay the campaign again I think it makes the want to replay really stand out.  

I would say the only drawback on this game is the optimization as some areas my computer really struggles and sometimes freezes a bit which is always a pain for souls like games. However this has seemed to be the case with a lot of really stand out games and if you don't need to have super crisp frame rates its still very enjoyable. 

Overall I would give this game a 9/10 and cant wait to sink a bunch of hours in over the holidays

As a big fan of the original Remnant, I decided to buy Remnant 2 on release and ended up having to refund it.
Mainly due to them lying on the minimum system requirements on Steam of an i5-7600 & GTX 1650, The store page still has these minimum system requirements..
Which at the time i had a i7 6700k & GTX 1070 Ti, That couldn't even get above 12-22fps.
It didn't take me long to then find the thousands of complaints about performance and the game requiring a system that supports some form of upscaling or DLSS.
Why isnt this stated on the Store page?

- - - -

4-5 months later i ended up upgraded my rig to a RTX 4070 Ti.
As a result i ended up re-buying a few games in one of the Steam sales this being one of them, of which i then ended up getting instantly hooked and spending over 90 hours in the game..

That being said the game isnt the same as the original Remnant and does a lot of things differently, however the overall game is still a lot of fun and in keeping with the original game. 

Things i dislike:
The lack of alternate reward for killing bosses on a harder difficulty. (same reward as on easy)
Major disconnect issues with the matchmaking system, also the the rare cheater/modder due to no anti-cheat.
Also why does matchmaking kick you back to the main login menu instead of placing you back in your own game session?

Overall,
I would recommend this game but only IF you have a powerful enough computer to run it.

If you haven't played the first its lovingly called souls-like with guns... or a looter shooter.... mix in some third person adventure game and random generation? 

Things that are improved/great:
- Graphics/details in all of the worlds you travel to are so awesome and very distinct to almost feel like different games
- Extremely in depth RPG mechanics with an archetype to choose and many items/mods/abilities to equip so you can truly create a unique and powerful build thats personal to you. There are infinite combinations that are viable, seemingly, a huge step up from the first game. 
- There is the ability to change archetypes (classes) or try out a multiclass combination, without creating a new character, you can simply switch on your same character. This is much improved from the first game and lets you experiment with things more readily. 
- Fun and addicting gameplay. A few things were added from the first such as an ability to jump over gaps which is nice
- The random generation seems to have improved to provide even more options for each world so your playthroughs can have completely different stories. 
- Boss fights have been significantly improved. There are some amazing ones and they've removed the over-reliance on adds which were one of the main complaints of the first game. 
- Ward 13 hub world is easier to navigate than the first game. 
- There is so much loot to collect - but every item you collect has meaning and its own unique usage. There is none of this nonsense i hate in other games where you've got this weapon but now its  134 instead of 78. Each item has a unique usage. 
- Even more secrets than the first game, some so hidden. 
- Good story. Though the main plot is somewhat straightforward but decent (saving the multiverse). however the sub plots of each biome are fascinating, and the lore is rich.
- Fun co-op. The uniqueness of everyone's builds can lead to awesome co-op fun. You and your buddy's game playthroughs will likely have different dungeons, plots, and stories than your campaign. 

Edit: The one negative I really find to this game is the final boss. It's really not enjoyable and the difficulty spike does not match the rest of the game. The first games final boss was difficult but there was a strategy to learn and it wasn't the worst. This one is the worst. There's an area that's just so visually challenging to understand what's going on in this boss that I just could not understand. I had to get on discord to find a team to get me through this boss. I just did not like it. The other bosses in the game were mostly great and better than the first game.",1690415247,1702421073,True,2,0,0.492857128381729126,0,True,False,False

Performance: It runs well, but I also have a 4000 series card and new PC. Running on ultra using DLSS quality and the game feels great running at 110-144 fps at all times. No real FPS drops, no screen tearing, no crashes at all. 

Visual/Level Design: The game is stunningly beautiful, especially in the way that colors contrast and the world design incorporates the visuals of each of the worlds is masterful. The level design is amazing. Puzzles are thoughtful, difficult but rewarding. Loot actually matters and going off the beaten path will net you amazing rewards. Rerolling each world gives you a completely different run from your last. The story in each world can go a variety of ways and there are up to 4 different alternate deaths for some bosses, each giving a different set of items/rewards.

Gameplay: There are so many ways you can build your character. Archtypes are plentiful, there are an insane amounts of items like rings, amulets, and guns at your disposal. Gunfire games seems hellbent to making sure every item is viable. There is no real meta as you can easily use anything in the highest difficulties.

Story: The main story is okay at best, the real lore comes from each of the worlds in Remnant 2. Each of them has multiple timelines that you are plopped into with any reroll of your campaign or adventure mode. You can spend hours within each world feeling like a third party observer of the plights of each of the world's main characters and suddenly get thrust into the middle of their struggles. The story behind each world is insanely rich, and getting transported into the next world is jarring in a good way.

Remnant 2 is my choice for GOTY 2023. Tons of replayability, amazing level design, impeccable gameplay and lore.

Overall a very polished game out of the box.. if it wasn't such an intentional grindfest. 
If there was an award for 'best adopter of ingame grinding mechanics' this game would be the top contender for 2023. 
That said, this is still a better collectathon than Assassin's Creed games. 

The game is full of unnecessary mechanics that force you to replay the game multiple times in order for you to just have a CHANCE at obtaining certain items. There are also MULTIPLE in-game mechanics that are hardcapped by the passing of real-world time to force you to play a lot, and play often. 

And then imagine a slightly buggy, unoptimized game, and the first patch that hits you is one that removes an XP farm and balances (i.e. nerfs) weapons/abilities.. in a PvE game. 

This is my personal opinion but the developers absolutely do NOT respect your time and this is made clear to me by how they go out of their way to inflate players' playtime hours by prioritizing the elimination of ""farm shortcuts"" and ""OP builds"" (or ""exploits"") ahead of even basic bugfixes - those who have followed and played the game since launch would be well aware of this. 

The game is also not at all optimized for older systems and is constantly and consistently CPU heavy, so forget about getting this for the Steam Deck or similar. 
DLSS/FSR/XeSS is also required to comfortably run this, even on high end GPUs (RTX 3080/4080). 

TLDR; only buy if you have lots of time to kill and do not mind grindy mechanics - this IS a cool action game with lots of cool build synergies and very little statfa-.. stat minmaxing involved, relative to games like Nioh (no rarity mechanics or stat RNG - all players, items, weapons, abilities have the same stats).",1701954571,1702305321,False,2,0,0.493403702974319458,0,True,False,False

A better amount of weapons that are just fluffed up by guns that were also in the first game.  Sad excuse for a game. Endless potential that's just been absolutely wasted.

You definitely should get in touch with Games Workshop and create a Space Marine game with Remnant playstyle (Shooter soulslike) in Warhammer 40k universe. Class choice: choose one from the many space marine chapters. Now, that would have game of the year potential!

- Not sure I agree with some of the grindy stuff. Currency is grindy, capping how many trait points you can have, armor having perks was another level to decisions that I enjoyed in the first game is absent now. Perhaps a mutator system could be added but for armor? There are too many rings. Remove some of the weapons and armor sets from shops and add them to the random loot pool. Getting loot needs more variety in general.

Do a quick ""Remnant 2 crashes before launch"" search and you'll be surprised at how many sites have to talk about this issue. Look into steam community too.

But for real it's pretty fun, since there is no block or riposte system the game is balanced around you switching between melee and shooting. You can just shoot if you want, or just melee but the game will be much harder. I can see the shooting is meant more as a defensive system in place of blocking.

The locations are otherworldly and gorgeous, and this game is MEANT to be played with someone though it does seem like you can play it on solo. This game is almost meant to be played multiple times, not just beat once. The main gameplay loop is about completing campaign runs, then ""re-rolling the campaign"" with your same character, stats, build, etc and it has a chance of completely changing each world. There could be secret areas unlocked, altogether new areas, new bosses, weapons, drops, etc. The game has 4 difficulties, Survivor, Veteran, Nightmare, and the unlocked Apocalypse. Enemies on each higher difficulty don't seem to have a huge number bloat for health, especially since you won't do the hardest difficulties until you have a better build. I do not recommend you play on Survivor though unless you want a more casual experience.

Survivor is the games easiest difficulty and considered ""normal"" while Veteran is considered the way the game is meant to be play. Veteran with another friend is still a bit easier than Dark Souls. Also this game's multiplayer is what it was built around. It is not like a soulsborne game where you just summon a  friend who can't do a whole lot in your world. Players share loot, can interact with anything they want, and some encounters even feel balanced around 2+ people.

The dodge mechanic isn't the best but it's definitely not the worst. You still have I-Frames, fast rolling, fat rolling, etc. There is poise, stagger, and all the regular souls mechanics in here. Just with guns and grenades as well as melee weapons. Also there is no ""real"" magic. Each of your weapons has a mod slot. Mods are crafted and sometimes looted items that you equip to your weapons that change the look of the weapon and add a special skill tied to that weapon. They are essentially the skills and spells of the game. Along with that each weapon can equip a ""mutator"" which can change your build variability immensely. Each class has 3 ""ultimates"" to pick from, from healing, buffing, tanking, damage, etc. Each character you make also can have two classes or ""archetypes"".

Any who bosses are fun and unique, and the game likes to spawn mini-bosses and mini-boss versions of stronger mobs which constantly keeps you on your toes. Fun game and I do recommend it is much more unique and better of the souls-like games.",1702142933,1702142933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Exploration is a breeze in Remnant 2, with a world that begs to be discovered. Unraveling its secrets and stumbling upon hidden treasures adds an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay.

The music deserves a standing ovation, seamlessly weaving into the gameplay to intensify the atmosphere. It enhances the overall experience, making each encounter feel epic and every victory well-earned. The soundtrack is a true companion on this perilous journey, guiding you through moments of tension and triumph.

Remnant 2 masterfully blends elements of a looter shooter and a Souls game. The satisfaction of acquiring new gear and weapons is addictive, and the combat mechanics draw inspiration from the Souls series, providing a strategic and methodical approach to battles. This amalgamation of genres creates a unique and captivating gaming experience that keeps you coming back for more.

It's been called ""Dark Souls with guns"" and I would say that's a pretty apt descriptor. However, ultimately, after 20 hours of play, you kinda learn why Dark Souls with guns is not really the best thing. For most guns I've encountered, reload times feel like an absolute eternity. Enemies close distance and engage with you very quickly, and while you can usually dispatch them or otherwise deal with them, constantly having to find breathing room for reloading is just...not fun. If you play Remnant 2, I would recommend playing a class which operates at a great distance, using guns which have the lowest possible reload time, and/or taking traits and items which decrease reload time.

I wanted to get that out of the way first because that's the biggest flaw this game has in terms of gameplay. But all that aside, there's just something about Remnant 2 which feels oddly linear and kind of...I don't know...sparse? It feels a bit ""on rails"", and I think the devs try to account for this by putting a lot of secret things in the game, so it *feels* more content-heavy than it actually is. Also, the unlockables are often very obscure, and while some people might enjoy the ""looking stuff up online"" thing when it comes to games, I've never been a huge fan. The game design is also a bit muddled in terms of this, too. Like I was trying to find the Atom Splitter melee weapon, and I must have spent 3-4 hours watching videos, reading articles, and going over certain maps several times trying to find this one particular telltale sign on the minimap to show that I could get the item. It turns out, after all of that effort, I simply got unlucky with my world generation and I was not going to be able to get the item. I can *sort of* understand why they designed the game this way; it ensures that you can't get every item on the first playthrough, but I would like to have the opportunity to do that at some point and without having to delve into articles and youtube videos in order to do so. So that's another frustrating aspect of Remnant 2.

Another frustrating thing is that enemy health seems a bit disjointed. In some places, the enemies will have a lot of health and you're dumping mag after mag into these enemies to progress through the level and it just kinda gets tiresome. At this point I've spent many resources to upgrade my weapons, but I'm still spending minutes taking down ""alpha"" enemies. Each level will typically have a mixture of mooks which die quickly (but are annoying and tend to close distance and harass you), and more powerful enemies which act as ""captains"". It's decent in theory, but as I say it becomes sort of laborious swatting away the mooks and trying to reload before you have to dodge to avoid some attack, sometimes you groan and just switch to your secondary and burn through your ammo to get some breathing room, then get to work on the captains...sometimes it just feels more like work than play.

The boss fights are pretty good, I must say. They're designed well. I usually had to burn most of my heals in order to beat a boss and oftentimes I would barely win, so that's cool.

I think a lot of these problems can be solved by playing with other people, and in fact it almost trivializes the experience of making your way through the level, so there's always that option when you're feeling frustrated. The bosses are balanced based on how many players are in a session, but I don't know if this also applies to normal enemies, so yeah, it'll typically trivialize getting to the boss (or maybe I just had players join my game who are well-equipped?).

There's a story, but I mostly don't care about it. The characters seem okay, but sometimes the writing comes off as trying too hard, and the characters strike me as a diversity checklist and they have these annoying personality types that you get in modern games - check out this Youtube vid called ""Millenial Writing"" for a good explanation of what I mean. I actually hated the first character you encounter in this game so much that I kept waiting for her to die, and when it seemed like she might die I was like, ""Finally!"". But then she doesn't die and I was actually disappointed. The good news is you can mostly ignore all the characters once the game really starts.

There's a lot of rings and amulets and such, which is good. There's also a decent selection of weapons, but as I mentioned it's often difficult to find out how to get them, and it's impossible to know if you even can without running all over the place and seeing if you lucked out on your world generation. But the weapons that I've encountered are all pretty cool and well-made.

So yeah, ultimately, this review is more like a ""meh"". It's too bad the game is so often unbalanced in terms of fun and frustration. They really did aim high with this one and I think they did pretty good, it's just...there are better Soulslike experiences out there, in my opinion.",1702043348,1702043661,False,2,0,0.502840876579284668,0,True,False,False

There are some decent actors as well, but the bad and annoying ones leave enough salt in your mouth, the dead sea would be jealous. :(",1701503688,1702015753,False,3,0,0.480531662702560425,0,True,False,False

Story/Characters/Setting: Pretty cheesy and generic story. Characters are very bland and uninspiring and VERY cheesy. I hate the hand-holding your character does and the random cheesy pep talks that happen after fights. ""Wooo! Heh.. yeah! Yeah...."" or ""Yeah, you ain't so tough now huh! Haha, wheww... whew!"" The other voice acting is super corny too, like the girl who makes mods for you. I also find it funny that in an apocalyptic world, you just happen to encounter the last bastion of humanity and everyone's like, ""Howdy, friend! Come on in!"" 

The world building is amazing though and I find that the NPCs you encounter in different worlds and the little bits of lore you discover along the way to be far more impactful and interesting.

Gear/loot: I have a TON of amulets and rings, but hardly any weapons or armor to create a build surrounding these accessories. I've been using the same shotgun when I chose my first archetype and the first SMG I found in the beginning in a secret area. I just keep upgrading them, but it does nothing to make the game more fun/interesting. Equipping mutations and mods spices it up a bit, but after testing it out on a couple enemies a few times, it gets old quick.

Misc: The animations for this game are very long and drawn-out, and for what? In The Forgotten Prison, I have to wait in between doors... and it takes FOREVER. I understand that sometimes this is just a hidden loading screen, but what's the point when you enter the dungeon and the whole place is already loaded anyway?

Another example is when you attempt to open a locked door, your character pounds on the door... and you can't just roll out of it... Why? Another example (which is obv intentional) is walking around while you're in the middle of healing. Personally, I find it really grating.

Yet another example is when you've been struck hard enough to where your character needs to animate to get up. During this whole process, you continue to get pummeled by enemies. And it takes FOREVER to recover during this animation. The only option is to sit back and watch your character face tank hits until you can FINALLY get up. By that time you're pretty much dead, but if you're lucky enough to recover, don't worry! You still have to walk around nice and slow to heal.

This last example is when you approach a new world stone/checkpoint. You have to wait for it to light up and do its little song-and-dance and then you can finally interact with it. Just really small minor details like this that add up and bring down the experience.


Final thoughts: This game is a solid 3/5 and I'll continue playing it and can see myself completing it, but there are more times where it feels like a slog rather than an enjoyable experience. Overall, the game feels pretty empty and boring. Definitely not worth paying full price for.",1702012430,1702013299,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Until i eventually picked it up around 6 months ago and loved every second of it.

If you want a game that gives you the best of Roguelike generation of areas, looter shooters and dark souls difficulty/mechanics; this is the game for you.

The only downside is there isnt much added in terms of locations, same as the last game theres 3-4 planets and the labyrinth, i was hoping for at least 6 different open areas but with the ammount of secrets crammed into each world and the different branching storylines you can follow, it more than makes up for this.

Free patches added loadouts which were extremely needed, countless balance tweaks based largely on player feedback.

The same great 3rd-person shooter, with that much more good stuff. Callbacks to the previous game are awesome, especially the way things played out during the timeskip. All the old characters are back and just as I remember, with a few easter eggs that make me like some of them that much more.
The infinite out-of-combat stamina is so much better when it comes exploration and back-tracking. Classes having defined abilities means you can more easily customize your play style and still use weapons with locked mods, and a greater variety in classes means more play styles to work with (and picking a class at the start actually matters). Having powers tied to classes and not armor sets means that armor is easier to manage as well (even if I miss the ritualist skin for the cultist set). Variety in relics was also fun, even if the Dragonheart is still one of the better ones for most circumstances (imo). Mutators are a fantastic addition to the game, and give that much more variety for what you're able to do with your kit; it also gives me an incentive to use my melee weapons, whereas before that was more a matter of pure resource conservation. Even if I'm a little pissed that they messed with some of the classic weapons from the old game, *cough cough* Spitfire and Fusion Rifle (or Hellfire and Savior, as they're now called) *cough cough* the variety of new weapons, accessories, armors, and mods are fantastic for customizing and tailoring builds.
Coming from FtA, it was disappointing to not have Rhom, Corsus, or Reisum, and it was heartbreaking to see Yaesha in such disarray (and it was infuriating to deal with the centipede-snake mobs again, who now shoot projectiles... I actually said 'are you f-ing kidding me' when I saw them for the first time), but I don't think what we got was any less than amazing. The visuals are stunning; The decayed, crumbling and often grotesque N'erud, the fascinating contradiction of the grand, sprawling, gothic-esk fae halls and the crude, run-down, Industrial Revolution-Era England inspired, Dran cities in Losomn, a ramshackle and chaotic take on the now-collapsing Labyrinth and... well, I don't wanna throw spoilers out there, but it's grand, dark, oddly vibrant and honestly not how I expected the game to end. The procedural generated map and all the secret locations of gear and class engrams means it's got replay value; there are a pair of locations I've never encountered in all my hours of playing and replaying.
They also fixed both the major issues I had with FtA's gameplay. First was the issue of not locking the mouse to the center of the screen, so no more non-responsiveness from clicking or keys, or starting to melee at nothing, when I mean to be shooting. The other was that hardcore mode considered game crashes as ""invalid exits,"" which doesn't seem to be a problem here. It does have some issues with crashing when trying to engage in multiplayer, but so far it's a very rare problem for me and my friends, and the game files getting corrupted during a crash (something I've read about in other negative reviews for this game) has never happened to me.

Remnant 1 is not a soulslike, it is an amazing action adventure.
I hate souls-likes, but i fell in love with remnant 1 it was like a game that felt it was made just for me.
The game had an amazing world and story and characters and bosses and customisation and variety and endless replayability.
Remnant 2 improved on all gameplay aspects of smoothness of player animations and the archetypes are nice, the enemy and boss mechanics just do not allow for the variety that remnant 1 allowed due to their uncompromising brutal nature and often times they cheat. 

[strike]Too many enemies withhold their strikes and swing instantly afterwards.
They often ignore the assumed weight or physics of the world with how they swing and attack you. It gets really annoying when every enemy attack-swings just weirdly and unrealistically. Also almost every enemy has a preternatural ability to recognise when you aim at them and especially at their head and dodge your aim. You get grabbed by withheld super fast strikes that most likely kill you by some mobs.
This is all just to inflate the difficulty of Remnant 2 - this is also the main theme of the game overall. Everything that would make this a cooler and better game of the action adventure genre is sacrificed to it towards the masochistically minded soulslike crowd.[/strike]

It does not feel as unnecessary punishing as before.

You do not get good traits to progress and strengthen your character, you start inhibited and all the traits do is to normalise aspects of the game and what is what you ""progress"" in.
If you loved the way remnant 1 traits worked, do not buy this game.
Generally if you loved remnant 1, you might have a harder time with remnant 2 in many regards.


[strike]Still some strikes and ground effects hit do not hit you as the animation hits.[/strike] A lot of the bosses are simply too fast to react to for most people, so figuratively everyone runs the most damage reduction ""builds"" they can. Great game design and build diversity right? I lost all trust in this developer to create anything cool for the future, while i already paid for the dlcs, i know they will be the same soulslike shit that remnant 2 is.
People who unwittingly hate themselves and enjoy the mean and hatefully designed soulslike crap are numerous. I despise those games and the people who design it. 

[strike]The game is not tuned for cooperative beyond veteran, which is the 2nd difficulty. Only if you are max geared, leveled and have a good cookie cutter cheesy setup, you can play remnant 2 in a balanced way in nightmare., it is totally legit to feel bad for joining other players in nightmare or apocalypse for making their game insanely harder.[/strike]

Now you can play apocalypse with friends and do not have to feel bad about it.

There is only a minuscule minority who actually possesses the required reflexes to play these mean and overly punishing games proficiently, but an awful self hating masochistic majority who are willing to pay for games to suffer and be confused in thinking they are entertained.

i was looking for a third person action rpg shooter like remnant 1 and i got a soulslike. 

Some skills still do not work properly as advertised and it is an utter disgrace, that i have been basically made to play an early access title. This company will not see another cent from my wallet ever again. When you finish the game and are forced to watch the credits to the end, due to the end of credit scene playing the 2nd half of the very shitty and unsatisfying ending of the campaign, you see a long list of testers. What did these ""testers"" work on [strike]as so many bugs are still present in the game[/strike]?
You will have a generally nicer gaming experience if you DO NOT UPGRADE your weapons as fast as you can, because the enemies damage scale with your own power level.
the skill states you get a buff for each sacrificed minion but even if you sacrifice 2 you only get the benefit of one.
The amazing worldbuilding of the remnant world, the voice acting the character animation, the soulslike crowd does not care about any of that fluff (in their mind), they just want all this in the game to deliberately skip and ignore it.
My wallet does not count, since my kind of player is the minuscule minority, the kind who appreciates refined and solid game design and does not look to be given a reason to hate 
themselves.

[strike]Remnant 2 is just unnecessarily brutal and unforgiving and often times pure sadism in design on display. the game makes me feel hated playing it.[/strike]

I do not feel like the game hates me anymore, but if i had not found people for remnant, i'd not have played it much.

There is one boss, the final boss called annihilation, which is among the most amazing boss encounters i had in decades of gaming. He is honest, but a hard fight, he asks you to dance with him and listen and watch his queues and animations and he shifts through his phases fast, but in his order. you can learn him, get to know him and enjoy the fight and smile even if he kills you. 
The boss right before that, is the most unfun gaming experience i ever had in 3 decades gaming and i always feel just exhausted after i beat him following plain suffering - Venom. He wears a particle cloak that sometimes obscures his posture so out of randomness he can instakill you regardless of how much damage your ""build"" is set up to have. Towards the end of the fight the energy pillars can randomly spawn weirdly in front of you and they do not hit you as their animaiton or sound would suggest.
I have many dark and ugly thoughts toward the people responsible for the existence of this particular boss in the game, that i will never want to realise. I hope i will never meet any of them face to face in my life.

Having played remnant 2 i question myself who designed and refined the first game that i loved very much - past tense intentional.

[strike]If you want to hate yourself and like the brutality and punishing and unforgiving gaming experiences, this is for you. think dark souls, elden ring and all the other games i heavily dislike.
Remnant 2 often asks for perfection, but it does not deliver it itself. It spent all my love i had for remnant and i uninstalled both games after this experience. rarely has a game drained all my love for it.
By the end of my experience with remnant 2 it felt like i quit an abusive relationship.

This is neither safe, sane or consensual, but puts me at the receiving end of pure sadism, but according to the majority, this is all fine.

Check the steam achievements of how many players even got through the game or have reached anything worthwhile and you get a clear picture of the masochist soulslike crowd this is marketed at with great success. at the time of writing this review, remnant 2 sold over a million times.

There is a lot more negative to say about Remnant 2, but i feel too drained to speak about it.[/strike]

When the DLC came out i did not even notice, because i was done with Remnant overall, but a friend talked me into giving the game another look. It is alright now i guess? The story of the DLC is alright, the enemies do not feel as unforgiving as before, with some annoying exceptions.

I will not recommend a soulslike to any other player, because i strongly believe they are more damaging emotionally then entertaining for most people.
In addition i am sick and tired of every game being obsessed with ""builds"" and fake variety.

The world level makes it difficult to understand why you should bother leveling in the first place, although the amount I ""just so happened"" to level while running from place to place seemed fine enough.

The boss design is immaculate though, with exceptions being the [spoiler]venom fight[/spoiler] (one of the only fights that managed to make my gpu chug, seriously there's too much rendering going on in this fight/arena, especially with the smoke particles) and essentially any fight that forced you to fight extensive amounts of fodder like [spoiler]legion or astropath[/spoiler]. Seriously, in single player the ammo should be dropped like it was in the [spoiler]final boss fight[/spoiler] , even in coop the fights with extensive fodder seemed to go way out of hand.

I didn't really care too much about the story, but it was pretty gripping even though I was really just here for the game-play, and it was pretty funny to see how idiotic the humans in the game seem to be compared to just about every single non-human character. I personally recommend the game though, nearly every fight was extremely fresh and had its very own rhythm of dodging (although... I wouldn't hate a parry system). The relief of defeating some of the most challenging foes definitely makes the souls-like tag fit.

Remnant 2 is an absolute gem of a game. The first game was great, and often sequels fall short, but not this one. While some of the novelty of the style of the first game is gone that's only because they've taken what works and done it better. 

Great graphics, lots of collectables, and HUGE replayability. Combat is simple and satisfying but still leaves lots of room for various different play-styles.

Devs - Your RNG system is horrendous and you need to rethink it. It does not respect the time of your players and biggest supporters. We don't have an endless amount of time to game, since 99% of us have lives (possibly work, kids, loved ones, other hobbies, other games, need to sleep, etc...). This is coming from someone who put over 2k hrs into Destiny 2, but lets face it, this game doesn't have a fraction of the content Destiny 2 has.

Also - the Awakened King is not a new biome. You just added some new enemies to an existing biome and I'm assuming the same will happen for the next 2 dlcs. Very disappointed.

Players - The RNG is a nightmare. If you look up a build, good luck getting all the items some streamer has. I download a third party tool that just lets you know what your world looks like (what bosses, dungeons, items, events, etc.. have been populated in your worlds). This may sound like cheating, but you have no clue what your world rolled with and if you are looking for a specific item or event, you won't know until you get that far in the campaign and that might be 2, 5, 10, 15hrs later only to find out it's not there. Or even worse, you may need 2 specific things in a campaign and without this tool, you have no way of knowing without constantly rerolling your campaign just in hopes the first world rolls correctly only to speed run and/or use glitches to get to the second biome asap (still a couple hours most likely) only to find out it didn't roll the way you need it to. So I used this tool and saw that an event I had been hunting was on my adventure mode, so I got excited. I get to that event after searching for hours (I missed a crawl space and kept walking all over the map thinking I missed something somewhere else and to boot it's the ugliest biome in the game and just boring). I get there and the computer in the room scans me but won't open the door. So I know I need a piece of gear. I google what is needed and it says I need a specific helm from a rare enemy that may or may not even spawn for me in this biome. Just wonderful, rng behind rng yet again. I had 2 random players with me and as I walked away, they kept telling me to stand in a spot. I was getting annoyed and started to walk away again and just then the door suddenly opened. So I thought maybe they knew of a glitch to force it open. I walk in the room and literally nothing is in there. So either the items glitched out with the glitch, they didn't load into the world properly, not using the actual helm made them despawn, etc.... So now I have no clue if I can still get that ring in this run or not. This was the last straw after 45hrs of gameplay and things like this happening multiple times. 


Overall, the game was fun until it wasn't. I highly suggest picking it up on sale (possibly waiting for a deep sale) as it is fun for your first play through or 2. But don't get your hopes up on running the game on the higher difficulties unless you are willing to spend 100-200 hrs grinding for gear or picking up the world viewer app I did and still praying to rng gods. I luckily got this on the Black Friday sale, so I feel like I got my money's worth and will do the same for their next game. 



Original:
For the record, I hate the Steam rating system. This game is so hard to recommend or not recommend. I'm loving it, but also beyond frustrated with the design. 

Pros:
- Probably my favorite souls like game. They clearly did their own thing based on the souls formula and they knocked this part of the game out of the park.
- Weapons are fun and feel impactful.
- Graphics aren't the best, but more than good enough.
- Pick ups in coop are for everyone. This ROCKS!!!! Finally a dev that gets it. We don't like watching someone else get gear while we don't because maybe we died during a boss fight. Or accidentally rolled off a ledge. Etc....
- THE COMMUNITY IS AMAZING!!! Might be the best community so far. Clearly end game players who beat apocalypse difficulty have helped me and others out countless times. Showing up secrets, helping with puzzles and bosses. If it wasn't for the community being this awesome, I would have put this game down.


Neutral:
- Boss fights. Some are clearly designed with coop in mind and feel punishing as a solo player. Some I have pushed through and others I just waited for help. I wish the fight would scale better for solo players.


Cons:
- Controls can feel clunky, but not horrible. I had to remap melee, because it was throwing me off (if you aren't aiming down sights, you will melee strike by default. Then switching back to your gun takes time, so this alone can get you killed.). But after remapping, this was no longer and issue for me, but still the controls can feel clunky.
- RNG. OMG this is RNG from hell. This is the hate part for me. I get they want to promote replayability, but when you mess up a puzzle, that you had no clue was even a puzzle or that it existed because you moved on in the story, then pray to RNG gods that you find a multiplayer game that is in that area, the puzzle exists in their world, they haven't solved yet and they want to solve it. Some items are hidden behind how your campaign rolled, which is a horrible idea. With this, even coop won't help unless you intend on playing with someone who got that perfect campaign roll, which could be for hours on end and you won't even know until hours into their campaign. Example, one relic requires 2 biomes to roll with very specific criteria, but you need to finish the first biome to access the 2nd and 3rd biomes, and then you have to progress that 2nd one far enough in to even know if the area/dungeon you need is there. This just feels horrible if you get that combination but had no clue the item exists. Then only to realize that you finished a biome you can no longer access but had the perfect roll. Now you have to keep trying??? They need to rethink this level of RNG. I'm fine with weapons being hidden behind the most difficult content with guaranteed drops, but not just praying for rng.

All that said, I'm still loving the game, but there are plenty of times I'm just beyond frustrated seeing I missed something good because I didn't research the hell out of every item, puzzle, dungeon, biome, etc... before even starting it. I stopped playing Baldur's Gate 3 because I didn't want to look everything up so I wouldn't feel like I'm missing out since playing games isn't a full time job for me. This is very close to that and I wish they would change this.",1701636012,1701867415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Current state = Deep sale purchase or sale purchase. Not a full price game at all.

It starts off fairly/ pretty fun but gets stale quick. Combat isn't terrible. Graphics are pretty much the biggest thing holding this game back for most people. I had to spend the first and only 2 hours i get just modding the GFX so the game was at least playable to my eyes. DLSS > FSR> XESS> TAA. However all of them have at least a bit of smearing. DLSS was finally much more playable w/ DLSS 2.5.1 using DLSSSWAPPER, however, i was out of time to test the game so im giving them a negative to start just due to that.

URE5 is mostly hot garbage and is used to stress cards to the extent nobody can play your game. Ill bet these devs are in NVIDIAs/AMDs pockets for sure. MODDERS had to make this far better for me and thats unacceptable. Disabling SSGI is what i had to do to make the game play locked or very close to 60 fps at 4k resolution (total nonsense). Even a 4080 can't do native 4k w/o upscaling. Totally  unacceptable in todays world. Forcing upscaling onto people because you have to shill makes you a scumbag in my book. No need for it. NO toggle for the basics. Forced chromatic abberation, vignette, film grain, etc etc. At least FOV is present. But all of that w/ no AA disable in game is an instant negative review for me right off the bat. 

Story is very bland and not really satisfying. Find female X and then play 4 bland levels and beat a final boss to then repeat playing for alternate builds that really dont matter as you do so much dmg it wont matter. Not worth 60 bucks for sure. Its enough for a cheaper game, but not this garbage. Not 60 dollars great. Totally let down by this. After you win it youll hate it.  

World looks great and is immersive but lacks any enemies and variety/challenge to make it fun in the long run. Its also more empty than not (5 levels total). Enemies exist but are very sparse in most locations. Enemies are the one type per area with no variation, and once you fight one mob youll have fought all of them and it quickly becomes boring. Mini bosses are a nice touch and seek to break up the monotony somewhat but the PC spawns them and then lazy spawns enemies all over. OFten youll get 2 special bosses and one will just come up behind you because....lazy devs cant be bothered to make it fun.

Combat is cool, but pretty easy w/ several lazy mechanics put in place to add the ""souls like"" factor. Computer gets too many stun lock attacks and i can't get out of anything if i try to roll out forcing me to do perfect dodges or perfect attacks to win. NO blocking in this game (only slow and awkward rolling). No mistakes can be made mostly as the computer gets very late swings. And they basically rely on this shtick to a fault. 

AI formula can easily  be spotted so thats another lazy feature. All AI do the exact same things but vary in only looks and attack type. They all just basically dodge your target reticule and just move at the last second just as you fire forcing you to miss. Nothing especially groundbreaking there as i worked around that easily. Once you get used to it its pretty easy to see how little they did with it all. The hardest parts will almost always be just learning what you dont understand to kill a mini boss, special unit, or regular boss. And even thats not that hard to do and generally is well understood early-mid game how it works. Basically you know early on what to expect.

Boss fights are pretty cool, at least but could use some tweaking. Too bad the rest of the game is lame and boring for the most part and gets old too quickly. Very little replayability for any reason other than maybe trying out a cooler build. Other bosses afterwards pretty much dont require anything special. I found myself spamming as usual w/ no tweaked build needed.

So far nightmare is as easy as veteran. I still 1-2 shot most everything and mini bosses are just spam rolling to get away. Pretty easy and not really a challenge for me, but boring to say the least. Lies of P had much greater replay value than this game.

Armor is pointless. Really nothing more than slightly higher dmg resist and character look. Rings and necklaces are mostly useless and not needed (cant be sold either) once you have the ones you want. What few items do drop for you are nothing you can easily purchase w/o losing all your scrap metal, but none of them i found  using regularly anyways which was dissapointing as they put a lot of effort into adding them to the game but then never forced players to use them. Inventory is just a list of items in a grid storage. No way to know what you want w/o looking at every single ring. 

Perhaps more important during replays (game+  modes), but i can't see myself playing this again as the first play through was simply not engaging enough to try it again.

Game annoyingly lets you know what you can and cannot do even if it should be obvious or intuitive. Too many ""devs want you to do it this way"" moments for it to feel truly player driven.

Am now on nightmare mode in a ""campaign reroll"" and its really just the regular campaign in a different order with different boss fights. Not really fun enough to replay it all again. So far its definitely a recommended sale. I got mine for 34 dollars. Its a fun in between AAA games.  This game is not that.",1700528158,1701825924,False,0,2,0.455764055252075195,0,True,False,False

- A damn fine [b]Single-Player Campaign[/b].
- A very well polished [b]Co-op experience[/b].
- A scratch on your [b]SOULS-like[/b] itch.
- Random generated worlds with metroidvania-like possibilities.
- Into Roguelikes? Once you get the hang of the game you can go Hardcore mode!
- [b]Metaprogression[/b] (through gear and character leveling and traits).
- Immense [b]replayability[/b] potencial due to the World building mechanics (different sorylines and/or events in each run).
- A lot of Build possibilities due to the [b]characer Multi-class system[/b]!
- [b]Secrets[/b]. A lot of them.
- Simple yet welcoming puzzle solving for a change (they´re mainly not necessary for story progression. For those who don't like them).

[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]

Remnant 2 is a fairly fast paced, though not frenzied, action game. The movements are well measured and the gunplay is very smooth and straight forward. Though I struggled a bit to reconcile the ""mouse 1"" clicks for melee and the combo ""m2+m1"" to aim and shoot. It's not a bad system. Just one I was not used to.

Traversing biomes feels ok, more so because of the revamped stamina system (only used when in combat), though sometimes a bit janky. The auto-jump function is sometimes unreliable in the sense that when you land (depending on the map and ledges layout) you may struggle to keep your char from falling into the abiss! Most of the time you falling is your own fault, though !!

[h3]Graphics:[/h3]

Well, images speak for themselves. But, I found it very pleasing! It is a beautiful game. And up-to-date with the modern standards.

[b]Sound:[/b]

Sound is a very important part of Remnant 2, for without it you would miss dodge queues most of he time. So, not only it is important as it's also a tip here for you people going into it: [b]pay attention to the sound queues !!!!!![/b]

As for the soundtrack... I couldn't tell. I find music in games mostly distracting so I usually turn it off or leave it really low.

[h3]Story and Lore:[/h3]

Remnant 2 is a fallow up from Remnant from the Ashes story (which I didn't play). Still, from what I gathered and experienced it's very well written. Characers have personalities and voices are well dubbed. Extra Lore are there in form of dialogues and letters and books scattered throughout the worlds. Each world have many substories and one can only experience them all by playing the campaign (or advenure mode) multiple times, for the world building will only spawn a fracion of the huge assorment of tiles for each Biome. 
I ended my first run in about 40 hours. I took my time. You can do it faster, or slower... depending on your playstyle.

[hr][/hr]

All in all, I bought it very reluctantly for it's high price but I think it was (and is) worth the trouble. More so if you have friends to play with. And, if you don´t and still want to run it co-op, you can always join Remnant's Discord Channel and get into a lobby there.

Good things about this game:
1) Exceptional gun play. There's a good variety of weapons and they all feel good to use. The upgrade system really locks you into one weapon for the first chunk of the game, but after you play a bit resources will accumulate and you can start to try other things. Good times. 
2) Cool bosses. They are difficult, but they are for the most part fair (except for maybe the bizarre last boss). It felt great to be facing off against a major boss and to have my two lame allies drop before the guy lost a sliver of health and then go on to beat him using the power of my expertly timed dodge rolls. 
3) The first area of the game is based on Bloodborne and is very cool. If the whole game were at its level, this would be an all-time classic. 

Bad things about the game:
1) After the Bloodborne area, the maps are kind of shit. There's a swamp that's mediocre, a space station that sucked and some kind of post apocalyptic place that was underwhelming. Hordes of dudes come at you for ill defined reasons and I had no idea what any of their problems were. 
2) I don't know why they keep putting in puzzles and 'find the key' shit in this game. It's a multiplayer coop shooter. Who wants to stop their multiplayer shooting battles to do a puzzle? Answer: No one. 
3) There is a class whose primary function is having a dog. 

Overall rating: 7.29/11. Better than the first one, but not by much.

Imagine a world where interdimensional travel is as common as ordering a pizza, but instead of pepperoni, you get a horde of nightmare creatures! Our heroes, armed with weapons that look like they were made by a steampunk enthusiast with a penchant for monster movies, travel through these bizarre worlds. Think of it as a cosmic road trip, but instead of stopping for souvenirs, you're collecting strange artifacts and blasting every monstrosity in sight.

The game's monsters seem like they've been plucked from a fantasy enthusiast's fever dream. The bosses? Oh, they're like the big, bad bullies of the monster world, but with more tentacles.

Co-op gameplay brings a whole new level of chaos. Imagine trying to coordinate a strategic plan with your friend who can't stop laughing at a monster that looks like it ate too much spicy food. And the loot system? It's like the game's way of saying, ""Sorry for the nightmares, here's a cool hat.""

Highly recommended to any FPS lover that wants to feel like they're playing Dark Souls, without actually having to play Dark Souls.

Overall i recommend this game, especially with friends:

Pros: Amazingly tight shooter, combat feels really great, exploration is fun, the co-op with friends is a blast and solo is just as good. It's a total upgrade from remnant 1 in my eyes. I love the selection of weapons, mods, mutators and skills available within this game. Some of these boss fights and choices are really well designed and you can tell a lot of thought was put into keeping the replayability of these areas fun and interesting, even after multiple runs. I think Remnant achieved these goals really well.

Cons: this game can be really challenging at times, which is to be expected from a game with some soulslike elements within it. Sometimes it can border on frustration. Some maps have incredibly long traversal paths packed with enemies and a lot of environmental hazards that can wipe you out, having to essentially restart the area hoping to make it all the way this time. this isn't felt as hard in co-op since you have a partner to assist with revives, but unless you are running a particular archetype, if you go down in solo, you restart from your previous checkpoint, which is essentially the start of a dungeon. This game was also one of the most poorly optimized games on my CPU. They have released some patches for this that have helped, but some of the loading screens can take a serious amount of time, and the initial start screen freezes and stutters every time i load it. Thankfully it no longer crashes out like it used to for me, but it is something to be aware of. I will say in game where moment-to-moment REALLY matters, these issues do not pop up often if at all (at least not for me.)

as a small gripe, i really wish there was a better way to locate rings with certain traits/abilities in your inventory. i have so many rings and going through all of them to find a certain stat/bonus can be a real pain sometimes. Again, small gripe and something I hope the devs may offer in the future, especially if expansions plan on adding even more weapons and rings/amulets into the game.

All in all, really good game, really glad i picked this up and i always look forward to the next adventure mode/run.

It definitely is a fun game in co-op but it's absolutely boring and a chore to play by yourself. 

The biggest problem with this game is the performance and bugs. This game cannot go for a few hours without crashing for me. I have so many games on my computer that do not crash, and have no technical problems. This game crashes pretty much every time at random intervals of 2-3 hours.

This game offers no incentive for sustaining the matchmaking experience. Hosts will often kick players or end sessions rather than be inconvenienced by teammates, and it's difficult to tell who the host is when you have a full team of 3. It's very rare for a public session to last long. Repeatedly loading back into the game to join a new match can get tiresome if you're just trying to enjoy some multiplayer action.

There's no leaver check. Using the quick play button, you'll get connected to people who set their sessions to public and go AFK.

Overall the game is very fun and has good design choices. In common souls-like fashion, communication is limited, in this case to gestures and pings. This probably contributes to the lack of co-operative charm that some other games overflow with. The game's mechanics make moving and communicating as a team very doable, if not intuitive and easy.

Also, there are still some multiplayer session-breaking bugs in the game, but I expect those to get polished out. Overall, this is a great game. Thanks for reading. You should read the other reviews, too!",1701633489,1701633489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bulletdodges on a pixel screen doesn't look cool. The game is harder for me on so many levels and I guess it's the fact that I play on below minimum recommended hardware. Or.. maybe I'm the one that's getting old!?

 (""Don't blame it on sunshine, don't blame it on moonlight, blame it on Frames per second.)

That being said - I really like the game! Looter/ shooters when done right is so rewarding and Gunfire games have hit the right spot once again on so many levels. It's just too bad that I can't fully enjoy the scenery and atmosphere because my graphics card's a Roy Batty- contemplation from the movie Bladerunner.

+ When it comes to gameplay R2 is on par with RFTA. The Movement & mechanics were good! Still is! no need to change it and the developers haven't let us down. *thumbs up*

(+/-) The narrative might be a slight upgrade perhaps. It's the same ol' save the World angle that is OK but not that exciting. In R2 the story is mainly told via Not playable characters you encounter in your home base and around the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Lore in form and shape of pergaments and books help with solving puzzles aswell as giving background and perspective.

+ The boss fights are impressive and challeging. The loot consists yet again of Necklaces, rings, weapons and weapon mods and there's a plethora of builds that you can experiment with. You can also pick up upgrades for your weapons in the form of so called 'Mutators'. They can be obtained by the NPC in Ward 13 or dropped from enemies or bosses. A cool feature!

+ Now. Archetypes, - (your character's role/class), Oh boy, what fun! Especially when you can combine two of them and benefit from both. There are many combinations to choose from. Initially, I started as a gunslinger. Now that I've leveled up 5 different types of Archetypes, nearly 7, it's fun to mix and mash and costomize your character and dps-build. 

- The game has improved a lot since launch but there were some crashes and lag issues. I'm not sure I Should comment on this due to the obvious fact that I'm playing on a piece of garbage machine.. but in that regard the fun and hype isn't there as much as in Remnant from the ashes. 

- One thing bugs the hell out of me though. Something I pointed out in my review of RFTA.. You still can't choose the amount of quantity you want to sell or buy to an NPC in the Ward. Sure you have the option nowdays to sell ALL of your precious metal, thanks I guess! But not an exact figure. So if you don't wanna sell everything you need to spamm the living ham out of your mouse button. Come on Gunfire games - please no more torture - ok?!

Remnant 2 scratches the itch immensely well, and about 80 hours in now, I mostly just play to join people's games and help them out. There is a TON of variety in gameplay with different classes (archetypes), guns, mods, and consumables. The game isn't super long but you can have a lot of fun with it, and the worlds you visit are unique experiences with multiple possible stories they tell - which is a great concept for replayability.

So yeah, I recommend it. On sale is great, but even full price it's worth it. As for flaws: needs a better inventory UI. By the time you get most of the items, scrolling through looking for a particular ring gets ridiculous. The upgrade system is very grindy, especially in the first 30-40 hours. It makes it difficult to try new gear and merely serves to impede enjoyment of the myriad of awesome weapons in the game. But it's not a deal-breaker, and some masochists out there may even... like it?

Multiplayer can be a blast, although I've had connection issues at times. The story is pretty good honestly. It feels a little disjointed at times and doesn't spend enough time connecting you to a certain someone and thus caring about them before they're whisked away - but Remnant 1 & 2 tell a pretty darn cool and unique tale.

The trait point cap leads to a far less rewarding grind than the original, interesting weapons/armor are sparse, scrap is even sparser (making it a slog to try new equipment), and the boss fights are hit or miss, more frequently a ""miss"". The final boss is a visually confusing fight that I just can't justifiably call a good conclusion. The fact that they carried over the ham-fisted scaling system, where upgrading your gear never feels as rewarding as it should, is also just disappointing. The game is also still riddled with bugs, regardless of how many hot fixes the developers release. One of the handguns, Sorrow, makes an incessant ringing noise in my cooperators headsets after using its mod power, and does not stop until I swap it out of the handgun slot and back in. 

To the games credit, the archetype system is a fun addition, and Losomn is my favorite area in both games by far.

The game is short, and the only point in carrying on is to grind in a way that is just... worse in every way than the original.

Generic fights, enemies that spawn behind you, maybe 4 enemies per area if you are lucky, melee is pretty useless, un-memorable boss fights. Most areas were boring and uninspired, plot doesnt make any sense and isnt explained.

AREA COMPLAINTS:
Lomsom issues: 2-3 enemies TOTAL for each area. Spear guy+archers in the fae area. Elf area had like 2 enemies, dude with hatched or woman with gun.

In the parts where you find elves in cages you cant even release them, you can just gun them down. How stupid is that? Did anyone playtest this at all?

Plot totally sucked for asylum part. The asylum is like a 1600 sq foot home, thats IT. Thats it. Not much of anything uncovered, pretty bland. The boss should be harassing you the entire area but it doesnt. Its just some mediocre boss at the end I beat to death with a staff.

As for the imposter king, you have to side with one and can't backstab the other? what nonsense is that? why cant I blow them both away?

Forest area:
One of 2 enjoyable area in entire game, however enemies constantly spawn behind you and there is like 3 enemies total for the entire area.

Labyrinth:
Honestly no huge complaints, enemies were kinda boring: just a bunch of boxes. But still a cool area

N'arud: Plot here was so convoluted I was vomiting. Random space aliens go into black hole which turns them into zombies? Every single plot item says not to trust the AI we are working with but we cannot backstab him.

Final boss has no explanation at all, just shoot it i guess.

All the machines are hostile for absolutely NO REASON.

2-4 enemies for the entire area, thats it. Every combat encounter is the same.

Final area:
2-3 enemies for the entire area, AGAIN, absolutely uninspired. Bosses just stunlock you with not cool looking attacks. By this point I had given up on the plot.
They pretty much stole Halo Combat Evolved plot but made it stupider. Some plants are somehow taking over the universe? How stupid is that!
And the only solution is to kill everyone?

FIGHT COMPLAINTS: 
Every fight was very boring. Just pew pew, dodge, pew pew. Not a single NPC ever helps with anything. Super stale, super boring. Most enemies were not even cool looking.

PLOT COMPLAINTS:
They pretty much stole Halo Combat Evolved plot but made it stupider. Some plants are somehow taking over the universe? How stupid is that!
And the only solution is to kill everyone?

You run around killing big bads to give some item to an uninspired AI who has partnered with the Clem woman, who was boring by the way, to win? I wanted Clem to die by the end because she was as stale as 20-year old saltines. Somehow these items help you get to the final boss who just stunlocks you to death. I hated or didnt care about a single NPC. I was hoping my guy could jump off a cliff just to end this terrible plot.

Not a single character was memorable, none of the NPC's gave any satisfactory answers on the plot at all. I couldnt turn on a single NPC when I decided they sucked.

I am glad the plot ended with everyone dying because I was dying on the inside 40% through. Terrible story telling, terrible combat, terrible NPC's, 100% railroaded.

First, the game is way too easy and none of the enemies or bosses were memorable except for the last boss of the game. I spent the entirety of the game wondering when there would be a good fight with interesting mechanics and I never got one. I am aware that there are multiple difficulties, but all they do is make the boring fights longer.

The level design is also extremely boring, and this is exacerbated by the lengthy animations. Opening doors, activating checkpoints, climbing ladders, jumping, and so many more animations take way too long. Then I have to run through levels filled with nothing? The enemies are also extremely basic, and it's just sad to see. Oh, and did I mention that the equivalent of skill points, trait points, are only as items on the ground? It's such a chore to explore such a boring world, but if you don't do it. you'll be missing out on a lot of stats.

This game is so short (I have completed it at the time of review, with ~5 of these hours spent in co-op in a friends world, not progressing on my own), and they try to make it longer by locking certain areas/items behind completely redoing worlds. First off, ridiculous and grindy; second off, not fun. Half of the game is hidden behind what is basically NG+ mixed in with RNG. The method to getting some items and fighting some bosses is ""reset this area until you RNG the one you need."" 

Finally, my smallest complaint is that it takes way too much grinding to upgrade weapons/buy items. Scrap, the game's currency, is too rare. I didn't have enough to upgrade my weapons even though I had enough materials, and I was only able to buy one secondary class. I also had enough items to craft more relic (estus) uses, but not enough scrap. I picked up a lot of weapons and potential boss weapons and mods, but I wasn't able to try any of them because I didn't even have enough scrap to upgrade my previous weapons, let alone the new ones. Obviously the solution would be to sit and grind currency, but then what? I try weapons to fight these boring bosses or run around areas with nothing in them?

TL;DR: If you're going to solo the game and are an average player like myself, I would caution you that it may be a frustrating and short experience since you may not be skilled enough to advance.
I played the first game, but I could not beat either of the first 2 bosses. I saw that this game had less 'adds' on bosses (a big reason I couldn't beat Shroud or Gorefist) and I liked their varied designs, so I decided to give this a chance on sale because I liked feel of the shooting so much.
I played this on Survivor as Handler, solo.
Like I said: I *really* enjoy the feeling of the shooting mechanic in this game and the world design/aesthetic so I really wanted to try my hardest to improve so I could enjoy it, but there are just too many times when there are too many enemies' attacks to manage.  Skillful/tactical play will still result in cheap loss of life which I can't find a way to avoid.  I played handler just for the dog to aggro, but that only does so much; snipers, for example, will shoot 3 projectiles/each at you, and you can walk-strafe and shoot them as you avoid them, but you end up getting shot by another 2 at your 4 o'clock so you lose that life anyway.

Epic fun and inclusive quips. Click <button> to have a pointless animation. ""Unique"" and diverse characters. Dialogue and writing that even bing's chat AI could pulverize. I wonder what the ratio is of gamplay to: dialogue, fetch-and-retrieve quests, run around the map talking to NPCs, cutscenes (that one can skip thankfully), etc.

I wanted a looter shooter. I don't want a looter shooter mixed with slop, ""cinematic narrative driven experiences"", self-inserts, etc. It just sucks.

Just look up the 'Managing Director of Narrative Properties' of gearbox or from Wikipedia, the various writers involved.  Poke around their publications/speeches/papers/portfolio/personal websites and pieces of the puzzle fit together. Just 5 minutes of searching makes it crystal clear.

Imagine you go to a restaurant and order a meal. It looks real pretty on the menu. The server comes with your food and you dig in. First bite - you taste.. meat in your salad? Upon closer inspection, your ceasar salad has chunks of half cooked pork tenderloin. You try and wash it down with some water but it tastes like it came from the nastiest well in Flint, Michigan. You walk to the server area and tell them the quality is bad. ""Well, don't buy it if you don't like it."" You rebuttal with ""how can water taste this bad?"" and the server replies, ""it's been procured by the finest professionals in the water industry specialized to meet the publics needs"". ""What? It tastes terrible. Why is there chunks of half cooked pork in my salad?"" The head chef comes out, ""What's your problem ya'll? This is a dish that draws from various facets of my life. Do you know how traumatizing it was in high school being called ""porky"" by everyone? There's nothing wrong with pork. Maybe you need to reconsider how you view salads"" and walks away. Silence follows and you look around the restaurant. To your confusion, everyone in the restaurant is eating pork-slop-salad with flint well water with a big grin on their face and pork grease dripping down their chin. ""Alright I'm going home"" you say to yourself.

*Update - the DLC is also excellent. Well designed levels and story. The aforementioned bug fix may now be resolved too. I haven't come across it lately.",1700311394,1701458721,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The beauty of this game is that it is brutal and unforgiving in the GOOD way, this is a game that after about 30 hours I think does difficulty the right way and I can safely say I love it for that. Too many games make challenge to mean bullet spongy enemies and cheap tricks, but Remnant 2 has interesting, deadly enemies that have [i]clever[/i] tricks. Some enemies, or situations at times feel a little bit too much, like there was no possible way for you survive which is in a way true, although almost always you look back on it and realize that something you did put you in that situation. Then the next time you go through you know more and it feels satisfying to get through it. It's still not for the faint of heart though, if you're not okay with a game that is going to make you own your mistakes than you won't like this (but then again you won't like any game similar to this either, that's not really the games fault, so I'm glad they stuck to the games vision still)

The bosses are going to kill you and make you suffer fighting them, and then every time you die, you [i]learn[/i] and you get angry, and more clever, until you beat them and it feels [i]good[/i].

The souls like element are definitely present and they're done well, in a sense it is like dark souls with guns but in another sense it almost feels like a (yes that's right, I'll say it) better version of Destiny in the genre of Dark Souls. Weapons feel viable and satisfying and it looks gorgeous. And good lord, kudos to the artists for the things they came up with in this game, the creativity is off the charts and gives that wow factor in some many places. You know the feeling where you enter a new area and just stand there for a second and say, ""Huh....this is cool,"" yeah that happened a lot with me.

The upgrade systems, progression, is all there and works well, the ability to re-roll and replay areas feels good as well and is an interesting take. Whatever is procedural generated here feels good and real, not bland and boring. It might get that way after a lot of runs, but that's inevitable, given how satisfying the combat is though I can't dock it for that.

Overall Remnant 2 is probably one of the best games this year and feels hugely underrated to me. It does so many things so well, with very few misses. It's clever, interesting, and satisfying. Easily a near perfect 9/10 for me and strongly recommended.

And to address the co-op versus solo angle, honestly, it's fantastic either way. If you have hesitation that it won't be fun because you aren't playing it co-op, don't be. It's still fantastic no matter which way you play. The fact that it works so well in co-op is a fantastic achievement but it doesn't require it to be good - exactly how it should be and an example of good game design as a whole.",1701455971,1701456386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A great Souls-Like experience. Especially fun to play with a friend. Various builds, bosses and area's allow a wide variety of game play.
The general 'run through' is highly entertaining because there are so many ways and possibly hidden loot which could turn out to be some great item which fits your build perfectly.

Boss design is great, lots of variety, each boss is completely different and requires learning all the basic dodging again while getting blasted by several new attacks.
Some minor issues are little bugs here and there, certain skills put you stuck in place such as overcharging the 'rage' skill on the challenger class. This normally makes the player invulnerable for all attacks, as you can't do anything during that moment. However sometimes you get attacked and still take damage.

AOE's are VERY difficult to dodge as some builds require you to be zoomed in for a longer period of time to do more damage and so on. Bombs get thrown at you from high, but you can't see it until the last split second.
Certain attacks can be launched at the same time but hit you at slightly different rates. You'll dodge the first but second already comes faster than you can dodge a second time causing you to eat the hit.
After focusing much more on every single thing thrown at you, this gets easier to deal with but could use some patching. As my current build demands constant shooting for a 10 second window to deal high dps it's a bit annoying.

There was also one boss upon a platform throwing grenades and what not to you. It's placement upon that platform with no way of getting to that level, he was very annoying to play. He'd sit in the center, ok fine run to the center, nope he moved to the side again, ok move to the side. Nope he went back all the way across now. Not a single hit can be given during these moments.

The good/more fun weapons are locked behind bosses which you can't complete right away. Certain weapons/items/classes are locked behind finishing the game once. Where's the fun in that? 
Let me run around throwing black holes at  halfway the game, makes the next play through more fun as well.
I can't be bothered running around for hours until i've found that one secret hole where it could be. Something could be done here, like a skill or pet that sometimes points things out.
Still the overall atmosphere and setting of the game are fun

Leveling up and upgrading skills and weapons is a part of the game which is good. But it could be better.
As it is, you sometimes get through area's and face a certain boss, but at halfway HP you realize you're just not strong enough to finish the fight. So you'll have to go back and rerun the same previous maps/bosses to find more items and loot and XP to get more damage or support out of your first run build. Especially on the second hardest difficulty this gets a little tedious rather quickly.

A longer more streamlined way of getting build items/rings/amulets/etc, to then slay a boss according to your level across more maps would be a better experience. You'll get a sense of accomplishment better than just rerunning area's until you're  strong enough to take it on.

Certain drops are RNG based. The challenger for example can be both ranged and a great melee class. Therefor most relic drops are melee based. But what if a player prefers ranged on the challenger because of it's static buffs?
Why not give the choice for the Melee or Ranged relic version on pickup?

While my review may sound negative, these are only things i'd like to see different.
Overall i have a great time in the game and doing all sorts of bosses and trying to find certain items is quite fun.
Currently i Burn and explode everything i see alive (even the children at Ward 13 (ingame)) But i'm curious about a more sniper based class or perhaps Alchemist. Once unlocked.. :)

When Remnant: From The Ashes came out, I felt like it released out of no where and it was a solid game. Gun Fire games blew all my expectations out of the water with Remnant 2. 10/10 for me this year. Lets cover why. 

Archetypes:
I love the archetype system and the freedom to mix and match and try crazy class combinations, mixed with the myriad of items to choose from there are truly endless options for builds, the 500 hours I have put in a is a mix of just exploring every nook and cranny and trying different archetypes and truly learning the pros and cons between them. This is such a fun and robust system even between DLCs it keeps me coming back.

Items:
The items that you are rewarded feel purposeful and useful. While some are stronger, build into a meta and just down right OP. There is a ring, weapon, amulet or relic that fits into some type of play style. Again the builds are endless. I am still farming to complete all 100% of the base and DLC items and I cannot wait for more. 

Combat:
If you played RFtA then you know the combat. Tho Rem2 feels much cleaner, more responsive and over all just high adrenaline rush while in combat. The combat is fun and engaging keeping you on your toes especially in higher difficulties. The boss fights are a blast, i enjoyed them very much. My biggest complaint in combat is the Apocalypse modifiers on bosses. These can stop your build dead, and then you either just push through it or find away to adapt it. Probably my biggest pet peeve with modifiers and I would love to see them add an option to turn them off when re-rolling adventures/campaigns. Otherwise combat is amazing. 

World:
The worlds this time around are amazing. Probably my favorite and among the many others is Losmon, the Bloodborne English Elvin setting just feels amazing. Root Earth, while a royal pain in my arse, I love the design and feel of it. Yaesha was just a typical jungle and Ner'ud my least favorite in terms of enemies but my favorite in terms of aesthetics. Only Gun Fire Games found away to make all these unique worlds work together. They are blast to explore (except Ner'ud, cause vomiting is always fun) and the randomization does add some fresh play to the worlds on each new role. 


Weapons/Mods/Mutators/Skills:
This is where the game shines, the Weapons/Mods/Mutators/Skills are unique, thought out and just fun. Turning into a lightning overload that can teleport while dishing out constant lighting building up crit dmg while your turret has infinite ammo and a fire tornado is spinning around killing all the enemies it pulls in, never felt so good. GunFireGames did an outstanding here and while some guns do lack punch or fit into a build, they are all fun to just play around with and see what works where. 


Performance:
This is where the game has issues, and its really tough on PC. I run a 7950x with a 7900xt and 32GB of and Samsung SSDs across the board and I could be consistently at 120FPS then just walking i drop to 15 FPS for no reason. I have played with so many settings, I actually ended up turning off AMD Smart Access Memory and this help stabilize the fluctuation of my FPS and instead of dropping down to 15 from 120, i drop to 60. There is for sure much work that needs to be done here, as I do not encounter this in any other game.  Hopefully the devs can figure it out and optimize the game. 


DLC:
The DLC for me was a blast. All though short, I beat it in about 5 hours, the lore of Lomson has been fabulous. The fights are awesome and I am still discovering secrets as I go. I 100% recommend the DLC, even tho i feel the release of it hindered the performance of the game even more.

Overall:
Remnant 2 has struck some many cords over the other glaring issues it has, performance, some design choices and other little annoying factors like buggy items (Brewmasters Cork) otherwise this game is a 10/10 for me and shows that if a company actually cares and has good leadership and not chasing the games wallet amazing games can be made. I look forward to the future of Remnant and the DLCs and  hopefully some neat game modes. 

Wish List:
-Performance fixes
-Survivor mode (rogue like)
-Boss Rush mode Timed with leader boards/Untimed
-Relics slots for armor
-Option to turn off modifiers
-Harder difficulty
-higher respawn rate on apparition 
-API to easily develop databases for character builders / calculators

Co-op is the real way to play this game as each class helps one another and can help clear adds, give ammo, heal, etc. solo play is NOT impossible, but it is disappointingly unenjoyable in my experience of trying to get into this game with 2 characters, solo and co-op. the locations are diverse but sparse of anything other than walls, foliage, and enemies which helps to make the game feel like an empty shell complemented by the clunky controls to create a really half baked feeling game.

It's Remnant 1, but better.

+ Very nice dark atmosphere with some small variation of grey.
+ moment-to-moment third person gameplay is excellent as we're used to from Gearbox.
+ Varied weapons and mod powers.
+ Complete freedom with up to 2 archetypes with powers. Suitable both for solo and co-op play.
+ Perfect online integration.

- A LOT of grey, brown and muted color. A little less color variation than the first game, I think.
- Story is honestly kind of meh, more of a weak excuse to shoot things.
- Like Diablo, you remember the bosses, but not much else.

Also reading technical support discussions and seeing this problem repeated constantly with 0 replies is bogus. 

Update: To obtain rewards for a specific difficulty you must have a ""check"" on one character for each of the 5 world bosses. My friend I was playing with killed the Doe on Yaesha while I was afk because, who cares? Well, that's why I wasn't able to get the rewards. After killing the Doe again in my own campaign the apocalypse rewards did unlock for me.
I am still leaving a not recommended review however due to the absolutely abysmal latency while playing with a friend more than a few miles from you and the comically inbalanced difficulty of some of the late game bosses just making the game more chore than entertainment.

However il give em the credit for fixing the game bout 80%.....but please for the love of God fix or nerf those damn Fiends and Armored Fiends from the DLC area....who in the dev team thought it was a good idea to make a MOB not an Elite a damn mob....a tank that does a ton of damage with each hit and spawns bubble's that can 2 shoot even a tank if he gets caught in a tight area with it....and dont get me started at the spawn rates it has from Dran. Worst idea of a mob ever cheap shit mob that should not deal the amount of damage it does or be as tanky as it is


ORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: At the moment i dont recommend this game at all....the gameplay is good and satisfying, secrets are many and looking for them is satisfying

However if a highend rig hickups like hell and barely manages 40-50FPS on low-medium quality WITH DLLS on you know there is a big problem with it....""made with DLLS in mind"" means they were to lazy to optimise it and left it to AI resolution changing to ""help"" them to bad it backfired big time....but wait, there's more to the list of problems, like crashing randomly for no reason whatsoever at random intervals no connection between them what so ever except the same crash error which comes from Unreal Engine 5.....either the devs didnt know how to work with UE5 or they didnt bother to learn how to work with it.

even after 5 patches it still crashes randomly with same UE5 LowLevelFatalError
Reason: DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG

This is an amazing single-player FPS RPG. Because the network implementation for coop is peer-to-peer, you should not buy expecting to play a soulslike with friends.

Main considerations:

- the gunplay is varied and uniformly excellent, and the melee is pretty good. I'd say the physics feel not quite as good as Destiny 2, but that is imo the highest bar for gunplay - this is still incredibly satisfying to play on a visceral level, and a noticeable improvement over the first Remnant game.
- core ""loops"" within the game like ammunition management, gun upgrading, archetype leveling etc. feel good. There's a lot of room for balance and other improvements, but this seems like an area where the dev team will continue to make good progress over time.
- the core ""souls-like"" elements are generally great; it's a big, ambitious game, so of course there is no shortage of stupid boss mechanics, broken hitboxes, scripted trash mob spawns, etc. that will kill you in utterly unfair ways. But for something like 70% of challenging encounters, I would win after 2-3 tries and be left with the feeling of having solved a very cool puzzle and improved my mastery of very satisfying movement and shooting mechanics.
- the worldbuilding is generally great, and the mini-stories of each world you explore pair very well with the art and overall tone of the game. the procedural generation of maps, while it often feels gimmicky, does in the end add somewhat to the replayability, which is no mean accomplishment as most games that try this don't reach that bar. the world variety is currently too small by about half, but this feels easy to improve over time and generally reasonable to ask players to pay on the order of $10 per year for more of.

- the game was shipped with huge, devastating bugs, most notably ones that will erase all of your character progression and can irreparably (as far as we know as of now) corrupt your save.
- the devs are present on discord and reddit and twitter, but their presence does not seem to be paired with any meaningful community or product management, so there is no bug tracking, no organized triage, no way to know when bugs that are preventing you from playing might be fixed or even if they are being investigated (unless they happen to make the weekly reddit announcement).
- the idea that this game is ""multiplayer"" is probably misleading. It has a small feature set built around coop, but leaving aside myriad big but solvable problems with that implementation, fundamentally the combination of a soulslike game, that relies on carefully studying animations and dodging damage with invulnerability frames, with a peer-to-peer network architecture just does not work.
- only caveat to this is it's possible that if you're very geographically/network-topographically close to the people you want to play with you might have a good experience--I haven't tried but it does seem at least theoretically possible, depending on how consoles/Steam handle such a setup.",1691401010,1701289772,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Solo: 7/10 
Co-op: 8.5/10 


The games concept is fantastic. Playthrouhgs don't follow a set path, you start two campaigns and get two different areas / bosses to start. Some loot is random, some fixed. 
Even after several playthroughs you can discover new things and the build variety is pretty good. 
Something i really like is the ability to level every class on one char. 

As for the cons, the game tends to get annoying soundbugs for a lot of people. Some boss designs are more annoying than challenging and some puzzles are  too obscure and/or aggravating, such as one-shot trap gauntlets or far too long gauntlets with timers and, again, one-shot mechanics.

The combat in this game is so fun. With so many gun and melee options, it's awesome to find a few that I really love and upgrade them to max. There's so much variety in this game, and the builds you can come up with are awesome. The classes are each so unique, and unlocking sub-classes is fun and rewarding. I am really having a great time with this game and I recommend it wholesale. I think the developers did a fantastic job with the level design, allowing for tile-built worlds that feel different every time you explore them.

With the new updates and patches this game is much improved and in my top 5 2023 games. New bosses and weapons to make new builds, quicker matchmaking with less latency so you can actually survive a boss fight. Ok game became a good game! Well done!

Great level design.  Awful boss design (Edit 2 : Maybe like 5 bosses are actually fun only if you're host because multiplayer lag, but SO MANY bosses are absolute 1-hit RNG nonsense that I doubt they ever played their own game). Getting hit by a boss should feel like you fucked up and can learn from it, not like you're being rawdogged from offscreen unavoidable cancer (funny that one of the worst bosses hands down is literally named Cancer).

Edit : Also game takes a gigantic L in multiplayer. Lag is about 1-2 seconds in a game with hair's breadth dodge windows, so make sure you always host.

Enemy AI seems relatively smart in most instances and can be rather aggressive which is good to see. The final bosses which their are multiple of for each world have been amazing in design. It's also clear that the Developers do absolutely love this game and are trying to listen to feedback. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. ALSO, you can pet the dog from the Handler class.

HOWEVER, friendly AI for summons and the dog is horrific to the point that they will sometimes genuinely just stand there in front of a enemy and not attack. Certain bosses or enemies do have attacks that can stun lock you into a cheesy death on occasion. 

I DO HAVE TO BRING UP THE ENDING AND FINAL BOSS OF THIS GAME... the end boss fight of this game genuinely feels awful and gimmicky... It's essentially a THREE PHASE FIGHT that feels anything but enjoyable or fair especially when compared to the design and difficulty of every world boss prior. I didn't feel challenged by it or enjoy it; a final boss of a game shouldn't make you feel relieved that it's finally over or see it as a final chore to be completed each campaign run. The ending cinematic of the game does have me worried; it very much gave the distinct impression that this story was written purely with DLC in mind. That kinda of writing for a ending drastically takes away from the impact and flow of the story.

Everything (except the main storyline, which still kinda takes a back seat to the multitude of self-contained stories you'll experience in each realm) has been improved significantly from its predecessor. Literally 100+ hours of things to do, and outside of a couple cheesy bosses and items that take dozens of campaign re-rolls to even have a chance at acquiring, all of it feels genuinely fun and rewarding to play through. As with Remnant 1, this is a ton of fun to play co-op but doesn't feel like nearly as much of a requirement as it did in that game. Due to the classes available, fully solo play is not only viable, but just as fun as co-op.

Major props to the Gunfire team for taking the community criticism from the first game and using it to mold an even better sequel than we could've dreamed of.

Nov. 2023 Update: Somehow still finding plenty to enjoy with this game. The first DLC expanded on my favorite world, added tons of interesting new items that make elemental builds (besides Twisting Wounds and Enigma) even more viable than before.

Well let's start with my biggest and only real complaint about the game is the limit to only 3 players. Now considering that as my only real complaint is something that most people could just write off, that says a lot about what I think of the game.

Remnant 2 is the first game since Spyro Reignited that I even considered wanting to 100%, and I actually did successfully 100% it, at least until the DLC released. There are practically no games where I actually attempt to 100% the game.

As a friend has reviewed this game and only using a single sentence of his review, ""You can easily play through the entire game with just the starting weapons and still face a fair challenge."" and quite frankly I love how he puts that, because many games make it so you have to hunt down specific weapons just to have a chance at beating the game. Remnant 2 developer Gunfire Games seems to strive for a game where all options are equally viable, or at least such within reason.

The fact that the game story is designed in a mix of somewhat randomly generated maps where not everything will be available with every run, they do however have a way to make every piece of content playable on a single character, so you don't have to worry about that. The main story content is setup in 5 parts, first you play a world that is of that somewhat randomly generated stuff, then you get a set-piece, followed by 2 more with the generated stuff, and finishes with a final set-piece.

The DLC is fun and seems to be setup, so any character can play the DLC immediately via Adventure Mode.

Overall, I have had a blast and expect to put way more hours into the game. Worth noting that in the 1st month of release I put so many hours into the game, way out of normal for myself. I even picked up the game for a few friends of mine.",1701145199,1701145199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I went into this blind, never having played the previous games. Given what I had seen in 30 seconds of trailer footage, I thought this would be a Souls-like game with guns, set in a Bloodborne-like universe. I was mistaken in all the right ways.

Don't get me wrong, I love Souls games, and the comparison isn't far off, but needless to say my initial idea of this game doesn't fully capture the essence of Remnant 2. After about 15 minutes of gameplay, the scope of the narrative opened up and I was HOOKED.

 [h3] Story & Environments [/h3] 

What Remnant 2 offers is a story with lore on a generally similar scale and aesthetic to Souls games, but with less of FromSoftware's signature ambiguity and vagueness, which I sometimes find difficult to get invested in. It features lots of interesting characters with fantastic writing and performances, alien worlds, and beautiful vistas.

The environments boast meaningful visual variety that's still surprising me 30+ hours in. Enemy variety is also quite good, with each environment featuring new enemies with cool visuals and unique behavior. Weapons and armors look so cool too, which matters a lot if you're playing for fashion. The gunplay is very satisfying, and the game encourages a variety of playstyles and builds.

 [h3] Playstyle Variety [/h3] 

Forego traditional healing and only heal from weapon mods? Melee focused? Summoner build? Sniper glasscannon? It's all possible, and encouraged.

Resources work so that you can always completely change your build at a very low cost. I've already shifted my character's focus multiple times as I stock up on interesting equipment, and it's been refreshing to have the freedom to redefine my playstyle so easily.

 [h3] Difficulty [/h3] 

Another way Remnant 2 differs from Souls games is that it isn't as punishing. Death is not as big of a deal, you can often respawn very near a boss gate instead of having to run through enemies to retry a fight, and all in all it doesn't feel as difficult. I don't think this is a bad thing though, it keeps the momentum going, and there's certainly still enough of a challenge to keep me invested and focused.

 [h3] Exploration & Discovery[/h3] 

Beyond all this, however, the part that really appeals to me is the exploration and discovery. The world is full of secrets, hidden passages, puzzles, and challenges. There's a plethora of items to collect, with high content replay value (and replay systems that make this super easy and comfortable). Some randomness introduced here and there keeps things fresh, too.

With the exception of a few especially obtuse secrets, the exploration is super satisfying. It feels like there's something cool to discover and collect around every corner. And it's rewarding on an intrinsic level, it doesn't hold your hand and map everything out for you. Unlike many publishers who see potentially missable content as time wasted on development, Remnant 2 is indeed a lot like Souls games - not at all afraid to see large chunks of its content missed if you don't look for it. And that makes discovering it all the more sweeter.

I honestly don't get my hopes up for games due to the sheer number of disappointments from developers I had learned to trust. Gunfire didn't let me down here though and I am glad to have supported them. They stayed true to the spirit of the game while providing a lot of world building and fun game play.

That said, The story was great and not overbearing, allowing for those that go for bare minimum lore to focus on action to still know what is going on while allowing lore hunters and secret seekers plentiful chances to take a break from combat and read the random 1-6 page notes lying around.

As a player in the community and a double degree carrying game developer, I have a humble request fellas.... Give us an item search bar?

After comparing this one to the first, I can say that the second one is sort of disappointing. So to start the graphics are nice and the gameplay felt smooth for me. I enjoyed some of the added features as well. 

However, this game falls flat with some big components. The first one being that this game is way shorter then the first one which was kind of a bummer. The second big issue is the upgrade system overall, they added a trait point count at like 60 which is weird considering the last game was like 600 or 700. You don't even really earn trait points like the last game too so it makes farming and replayability pretty much nonexistent. You basically find trait points laying around and sure you earn a couple here and there, but its just not the same. They for some reason took out armor upgrading which is weird, because once again that just decreases replayability and farming. It makes visiting recent sections pointless and it shortens the game a lot. 

The story in the game kind of sucks. The main villain which are the Root hardly show up in the game. You see them in the beginning and you see them in the end that's it. Don't get me started on the ending its pretty much this vegans wet dream where the groots were too powerful and grew out of control and the only choice was to Thanos wipe everything which was just lame af. For some reason too this Clementine character is more or less a god with all this mystical power for no reason lol. The story is whack just put it that way. 

Now I can forgive them cutting out a bunch of content that adds to replayability and I can forgive a dumbA$$ story with SpeD characters, but the meat and potatoes of Remnant are the bosses. We come here to battle some muffuggin tough and cool bosses and the bosses in this game are dog water to the first ones. The first game had a larger variety of cooler more unique bosses compared to this one. Not to mention that the bosses in this game feel way easier then the first ones. I don't know how to put my finger on it, but when I played against the first boss in the first game this Gorefist guy I got rocked by him like 13 times before beating him. In this game I pretty much dusted every boss first or second try. [Excluding the final two bosses]. 

This is not to trash the developers and im not saying Remnant 2 is bad, but its a downgrade in a lot of ways compared to the first. 
Im sure there will be more content that can be purchased later so we will see the end product at some point.

It's incredibly apparent in this title as well, almost as if the base game's story was intentionally left hollow to leave room for the DLCs.

The game itself plays a lot like the first game, with a reworked trait system that has a hard cap on usable trait points to encourage making builds instead of just endlessly grinding trait points to eventually max out everything. The archetypes play very well into this system, and being able to mix them gives some very decent build variety. Melee is also not complete garbage in this game due to some new incredible trait bonuses. Unlockable archetypes also add a lot to the game's replayability, and I'm very excited for the new DLC archetypes and what they will bring to the table.

Overall, if you enjoyed the first game, you are essentially getting much more of it along with some shiny new abilities/weapons to play with. Is it worth full price? Unless you are a hardcore Remnant fan, then no. For new players, I would definitely pick it up once it's gone on sale.

Remnant 2 does exactly what Remnant from the ashes did, but better. The Game looks absolutely amazing, the weapons are cool and fun to use and most of the Areas are fun as well. 

The Game however has some flaws. The first of them being N´Erud, fck N´Erud, this area is absolutely unfun.
While the Idea and Lore of the area is pretty cool, the experience isn´t. Large open areas, locked by poisonous mist that animation locks you, as well as tons of Zombies and Drones shooting you. The Dungeons are either Hallways filled with bugs and other crawling creatures or Towers with the same Robot enemies all over the place. But hey, at least the bosses in this area are kinda cool. 
The Second Issue I have with this game are the FPS Drops. My Hardware exceeds the recommended stats, and yet the game sometimes freezes or drops down to below 20 fps. This Issue made the Endboss into a double fight. Fighting the boss itself, while fighting FPS Drops and input delays at the same time. 

Despite these Issues I´ve beaten the game three times and had mostly a good and fun time. Co-Op is also where this game really shines. Playing with friends can make this game a lot easier, or harder, depending on what your friends are doing. When not taken too serious, friendly fire can cause some hilarous moments, where Rotten Arrows or Firestorm knock you around or suck you out of the map, just to fall free bird style for 30 seconds. Despite the performance issues (please fix them gearbox) the game is good and fun, grab a friend and give it a try.

A very fun and intense experience.  Love this game besides it having huge performance issues. Would I recommend it? Yes I would if you want to have fun but if you care about fps or quality. This isn't for you sadly since on a 3080 at most setting on high I get 80-90fps but I set it in game at 60fps. Plus the game which I realized works the gpu a little to much. Even at max settings at 1080p. My temps would be close to 68c-70c which isn't a bad thing but my ocd prefers 60-65c. Trust me when I say I went overkill on cooling and Yes its in a proper fan layout.

Updated review as of Nov/26/23

After several updates to the game, you can get a stable 60fps+ on around ultra to high settings at 4k. You can achieve higher fps if you lower the detailed shadows to medium and view distance to medium as well. Sadly you can't use msi afterburner which I use quite often but expect roughly 74c on a rtx 3080 with high/ultra settings. But than again everyones cooling is different.",1691318794,1701078407,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

The game-play is enjoyable, there is a decent amount of enemy variety and different ways to approach combat. 

The bosses in Remnant 2 are infinitely superior to the first, the original just had the bosses swamp you with enemy waves, in this sequel the bosses have more interesting mechanics and far fewer or no minion spawns.

Progression is also a fairly pleasant experience, the traits available in Remnant 2 are generally more meaningful than they were in the first game. If there was an issue here, it's just the trait point cap; base game the cap was 65 I think, which I thought was very restrictive. The new cap after the first DLC drop is 85 and this is substantially better, but I would still like maybe 10 to 15 more points.

The two main things holding the game back is writing and lack of biomes.

Writing doesn't matter too much, it's not why I play Remnant 2, but it's largely not much more than serviceable. There are certain quest-lines that are actually pretty fun when it comes to the writing, but the main campaign is nothing to write home about. Arguably, the ending of the mainline story is outright bad.

The issue regarding variety when it comes to the biomes is something I'm hoping DLC can resolve, adding two new worlds/areas would go a long way. Currently, even with the randomization and numerous secrets, I don't think there's enough here to keep things from getting stale beyond a handful of play-throughs for me.

There are still more minor issues, heavy armor doesn't really feel very impactful on higher difficulties cause you'll probably get blown away in one or two hits anyway, but these sorts of things don't detract from the experience to have me list them out.",1701066102,1701066102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game certainly has a steep learning curve like most Soulslikes, but there are a selection of difficulty modes if you're the type to get frustrated easily. I started off on ""Veteran"" mode, the second of four because I'm somehow worried about some invisible force judging me for starting on ""easy mode"" and found that difficulty to be quite a solid meaty challenge that wasn't too rough for the most part but still had a few bosses and areas that took quite a few attempts to beat.

The gameplay is fun and fast paced, and as you might expect from a Soulslike quite difficult. The selection of classes are varied and there are lots of fun and viable playstyle, though certainly some classes are much stronger for solo-play than others.

The levels are stunningly detailed and most are beautiful with gorgeous backdrops, though there are one or two areas that are less impressive than the others. I didn't have the experience of the earlier games, and while the game does give a little exposition much of the world is left unexplained. The usual Soulsborne type worldbuilding through item flavour text is in effect, though the lore did feel spread quite wide and thin, perhaps something that you wouldn't feel if you'd played the previous games in the serious.

If I had to critique the game I'd say that some of the classes can be a little more esoteric to unlock than it feels they really should be. The game does reuse some standard enemies with beefed up health as boss encounters which can feel a little disappointing. But my main complaint is being restricted to two abilities. I suspect having more powers might mess with the game's balance which is understandable, but it always felt like I should be able to use three or four abilities so that I wasn't constantly waiting on cooldowns. Even just being able to use two abilities from a single class if you don't have a second class equipped would have been nice.

Other than that though I'd say the game is definitely worth your time. The story didn't grab me as hard as Soulsborne titles did, but the gameplay was just as addictive, with plenty of buildcrafting to be done.",1701039386,1701039386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a perfect world, good taste would be a universal virtue and everyone would have already bought and enjoyed the masterpiece that Remnant 2 is.....but we all know this is not a perfect world.

Let me tell you something about Remnant 2. We are talking about one of the most polished and amazing games ever made. Gunfire broke the goddamn mold and this is no longer a ""souls"" with guns....this is Remnant 2 baby, and Remnant 2 now has its own game category. 

The unparalleled and  extremly satisfying third person shooting action is the main reason to buy this game right here and now but of course you...(the reader of this review) want more than that and belive me when i say you shall get it. 
Im not going to bore you with details and a wall of text but will just say that the game feels totally different depending your ""loadout"". As a loadout im not only talking about your archtypes or weapons....ooooh no hoho. Also ring, traits, amulets and more, game feels completly different and equally entertaining. So dont even dare to think this is a simple game at all but at the same time not unnecesary complex. You can face the challenge by yourself or with friends in true co-op action, reanimating your fallen comrades while you run towards them as fast your character legs allows it. All of this with massive bosses and monsters in the way, raising hell every second forcing you to constantly think your next move and avoiding harm. There are various difficulty levels designed for basic or more advanced characters but all of them provide a balanced and extremly challenging experience both solo and co-op. 

Now...graphics..this is ART. From the jungle of Yaesha to the derelict docks in Losonm everything looks perfect, after all we are talking about a Unreal 5 game well programed. So bear in mind that you will need a ""decent"" computer with a proper GPU and not trash like a 3070. Boss fights are breath taking...everything in this game is.

Sound. I think the guys who picked the Game of the Year award nominess are totally tone-deaf in every sense of the word. Mr. Rob Westwood composed one of the best soundtracks ever made......i consider a CRIME this game was not nominated for this particular thing...but i guess there are some philistines left  (even in 2023)

Anyways go and buy the damn game already. Treat yourself with the best action game of the year, alone or with friends you are going to enjoy every second of your time played, so dont miss it!

Oh one last thing. There is people who consider hot garbage like Sekiro the hardest game ever made. They think they are some ""superstarts"" for beating a damn game about a one handed hobo with a katana (LOL)....you guys are nothing more than fluffers...KINGS who killed the last boss alone or co-op in  apocalypse difficulty are the real stars here. So if you want a real challenge buy Remnant 2 RIGHT NOW.",1701021581,1701039159,True,19,3,0.559488177299499512,0,True,False,False

Beyond that this game is phenomenal, executes much of what I want to see other games in an excellent way, and provides a smooth gameplay experience in all modes of play.

There are many equipment pieces that combo in tons of different sets, playstyles, and situations. One of my favorite parts of any game is creating loadouts for a variety of class roles (tank, dps, heals, mixed) and this game gives me all of that and more. From Mods and Mutations, to Prime and Sub Archetypes I can customize my experience the way I want. And while character creation is a bit limited, its sufficiently varied, and ultimately doesn't matter much after equipping armor. 

They improved MUCH since the first game. The worlds are more interesting, the voice acting is great, and co-op is smoother. 11/10 guys. Thanks for an awesome game.

Exceptionally fun tactical gunplay, mechanically fun and unique spectacle-style boss encounters, secrets galore, weapons, and loot that are beyond cool and fun to collect, all bundled together with a really great skill and level system to make you always feel like you're making progress somewhere. I can't recommend it enough. It's some of the most fun I've had with a game in years, and I hope more people get the chance to appreciate it.

The long version: It's surprising even to me that I'm singing such high praises. I never played the original Remnant, and haven't heard of Gunfire Games either. Perhaps more interesting, is that I am not the biggest fan of FromSoftware's souls-like formula. I don't particularly seek out punishingly difficult games. To come from that background and enjoy Remnant 2 this much, as a game that's marketed as 'Souls-like with guns', I think that's worthy of including right at the beginning here.

To get some of the weaker points of the game out of the way, some of the narrative is a bit uninteresting. Some of the art direction is a little bland and uninspired. Maybe some of the music is lacking character. Definitely hated the puking in N'Erud. Some other negligible nitpicks not worth mentioning. But those are my only complaints.

I've technically played through the game almost 3 times over and I'm still having a blast. I can't stress enough how important it is to go in with the expectation that you will have to ""replay"" the game and when doing so you will *SEE* some similar things as this game is lightly procedurally generated. There are 3 main areas, each can generate one of two different world bosses. Within those areas, you have a certain number of dungeons, that are also randomized in their inclusion. Then within the dungeons themselves, the tileset is scrambled to a degree. So in my 3 playthroughs of the game, it feels like over 70% of all the content I'm seeing is new dungeons. New bosses. Always new mini-bosses. It's always fresh! A mechanic that is done super super well. Because it's all randomized if you want to play with a friend, it's likely that you'll see or experience something you've never seen before making this (what I presume to be) a really cool multiplayer experience).

So let me be even clearer -- You're going to want to beat this game twice. But understand: more than 80% of everything you'll see on your second time through will have different paths, leading to different dungeons, bosses, and different loot, with a different overarching story for each. Even beyond the two playthroughs I recommend, there are multiple ways to kill bosses or complete areas, which also determines the loot you get so you may find yourself as I am now, meticulously searching the game for the coolest weapons in the most hidden of secrets, and doing the alternative boss killing methods.

I think what really made a huge difference for me in making the Souls formula bearable is you don't lose anything when you die other than progress since your last checkpoint. There's no crap mechanic where you have to go grab the currency you accumulated through the whole dungeon after you die to a cheap boss move, or fall off a cliff or whatever. It was a constant relief to have that area of my brain available to focus on the boss encounters and have more unabated fun.

What glues it all together is certainly the gunplay and the light RPG systems. I did have to fiddle with my DPS to get it just right, but once I got comfortable with aiming, the rest of the game felt so good to play! Weapons feel excellent to use, and some pack a wallop of a punch, visibly staggering or even knocking over weaker enemies. The animations in this game sell the vigor of combat as your bullets penetrate your foes, especially as you hit weak spots. In that sense, the gunslinging you do can really fulfill some great power fantasies. But the guns, ESPECIALLY the ones hidden away in secrets are SO cool, some overpowered in their own right, and everyone is fun to use in their own right.

I also loved the level-up system in conjunction with the skill and perks. Besides your two guns, and single melee, your character class (or classes as you equip a second class later in the game) has 3 variations of an ultimate ability that you can use to spice up combat. Each character class has 10 levels as well, and all have passive bonuses that you accumulate. The skill tree is a little more vast, with a total of 65 levels (at the time of writing) that you can attribute to various little bonuses here and there. But it all comes together and makes you feel like every encounter, every action has meaningful consequences helping you advance and progress through the game.

I need a paragraph for the secrets in this game. There are many. Some are hiding behind methods so far beyond the normal human understanding it is insane. My advice? Beat the game once through blind. In your second playthrough, try and hit all the world bosses you missed the first time and while you're at it, look up a guide on how to unlock all the character classes. Archon alone will probably add another 20 hours to your playtime. Then really open your third eye and watch some YouTube videos on how to get the best weapons. See how far the rabbit hole goes. There was a minute where I kept getting recommended Remnant 2 videos on my TikTok for you page, and out of the 15 videos I found, they were all different weapons, behind different secrets, that I had never seen before. There is so much that any average player just won't find it all. Don't feel bad about watching or reading how to find some of this stuff! I promise it is still a challenge to get to, even if you know where you're going.

And one little section about the boss encounters. Some of the most interesting and variated I've ever played in a game. Period. Some of them had attacks and moves that made me have audible yells, and many prompted shouts of victory after I finally had defeated them. They are truly some of the best parts of this entire game.

Overall, Remnant 2 is an incredible package of a game. Even at full price, which is cheaper than your average AAA game, it's a compelling package that makes every second of your time within it worth it. You always feel like you're progressing in one way or another, and it's always fun. I can't wait for more people to play it, and experience the depth of its secrets, and exceptional combat.

Otherwise, if you like the idea of Souls-like with classes, guns, actual co-op and option for higher difficulties, with built-in path randomizer, this is a great buy. 

Character building isn't centered around attributes, instead you get traits that improve your mechanical stats, but you have to find and unlock most traits. You get classes which you can combine two of, with skills and perks and you can put more skills (mods) on weapons to use. Rest comes from your amulet, rings and ""healing flasks"" which can do other stuff than healing. Gear bonuses range from buffs, to changing how things work so great variability. 

You get campaign mode which can spawn you different locations from a pool so potentially each playthrough is a little different plus maps are somewhat randomized in layout, but you also get adventure mode so you can just play through each world separately and look for stuff you need for your dream build.

Graphics and lore are beautiful, big draw of this game I think are the very varied biomes and different themes that come with them, from dream-like forest and ancient castles, to old ""London"" and post-apocalyptic earth, with some alien deep space sci-fi shenanigans, but you definitely have more random lore than consistent story.

The story telling as well as the design of the games locations and enemy variety has noticeably improved in detail and scope compared to Remnant 1.
The amount of ingame-events, as well as the number of different dungeons has increased and the new archetype classes are an interesting addition that further enables the diversity of possible playstyles.

Most mechanics known from the predecessor can still be found although there have been some changes which, combined with said new archetypes, seemingly aim for a greater diversity of playstyle as well. Such would be the moving of set-effects from armor sets to the increased variety of rings, amuletts and Dragonhearts.

That being said, compared to Remnant 2 does have some ""flaws"" as well.
To promote the variety of different builds the game does have an upper limit of trait points you can aquire which is not as high as one might suspect. Where in Remnant 1 you would (as a long time player) max out your traits at some point and 
be able to run through high difficulty maps in record time, in Remnant 2 that is no longer possible.
Not only are traits limited in the amount of points you can aquire but some traits known from the 1st game have been removed entirely, mostly those that increase damage dealt.
In addition the games locations now scale heavily align with the powerlevel of your character.
Meaning, the strength of a locations inhabitants depends much more strongly on your powerlevel the first time you enter it
than the difficulty you have set.

The combined trait-level cap and said enemy-scaling make it extremely hard to level your character to a point where it feels like you can evenly fight enemies on high difficulties.
Therefore except for aquring some nice moves by leveling archetypes, leveling sometimes does not feel like its improving your characters capabilities in comparison to the opponents you face.

Another ""flaw"" is the way the developers have been patching the game ever since its release.
As it often rather pushes the players towards  certain playstyles, such as reducing the maximum possible damage reduction
provided by armor whilst increasing the disadvantages of waring heavy armor, implementing new hardcaps on stats
or reducing some archetypes damage output.
A good example would be ""fixing"" a bug that occoured whenever a player managed to create a 100% cooldown reduction
build by hardcapping cooldown reduction on 65%. (Which is more like not fixing the broken top shelf and putting up a ""do not use"" sign instead of just repairing the shelf)


Overall the game is still a lot of fun, especially if you have played Remnant 1 as you can really see the amount of love the developers poured into its details. And I highly recomend it as a coop game.

However if you are looking for long-time fun with your niche-builds and are easily aggravated by developer patches affecting your thoroughly created favourite build, you might want to consider whether you want to buy it for full price or not.",1701023092,1701023092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gunplay is super fun, going through dungeons is engaging, and the 2 player dynamics are great. The game is very clearly built to avoid problems with playing both single and multiplayer, and doesnt seem to have issues with overleveled teammates ruining the fun for others (an issue i had with borderlands). Playing through the main campaign with my bf (love you babe) has been really *painless.

One of my favorite parts is how not a single part of your build is really locked in. Rings, Amulets, Relics, Weapon Mods, and even your classes can be swapped out at any time (not even at a checkpoint!), so trying out tons of stuff is super easy and doesnt require any amount of grinding or finite resources (*ahem* fromsoft). Skill points do require you buy an item to reset them, but theyre not super impactful and said item is relatively cheap, infinite, and immediately available.

The story and characters arent really anything to write home about, but i find it mildly interesting and some of the character designs are fun (we both love dwell).

So far we're having a blast playing it, and i totally recommend anyone who wants an RPG hoard shooter.

The only things I didnt like was that you cant max out every perk anymore which I guess they wanted for build diversity.
The only problem is some weapons or mods NEED specific perks like reduced ally damage unless you keep killing your summons and Coop players. So either you only use these weapons and mods when playing solo or sacrifice some points into a stat you would have wanted just to be able to use that weapon with other players.

The other thing was that some rewards involve ""to much randomness"". I understand some things are for completionists but I was able to 100% the first game in roughly above 100 hours. In this game though some items rely on you having a very small percent chance to get the perfect map spawn to even have a chance of obtaining them.

Played it when it released and the most annoying stuff was syncing issues. For a game designed to be played in Coop it is not acceptable that only I get the campaign rewards and my Coop partner doesnt get them. It incites a lot of frustration when you finish a playthrough, especially on the harder difficulties, and one player doesnt get the rewards and sits depressed in the corner while the other plays with his shiny new toys.

All in all though definitely a hard recommend especially since the devs recognize this game as a AA game and dont keep asking for some 70/80€ like some other scumbags out there!",1701021759,1701021759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Machine freezes Randomly into the game and only way to get out it is a hard reset not a good idea for your windows setup it can cause a serious fault in your windows. Needing to re install your full windows again task manager would not shut down the program. 

This should be on Steam games page to warm people you are buying a dead donkey that the software writers do not give a damn as long as they get users money.
  
 With the restarts and lockups it takes you past the 2 hours refund for your money back.  

Steam should be removing this Game from the store. 
It looks like either a bad memory usage or a bad driver usage to cause such a lockup total freeze of your system.   A hard reset can corrupt your windows system. other wise screw your full computer up that bad it will have to be totally wiped and you will loose everything on your system.

Still getting server message disconnected from server  at save points as well as a random crash when archer angel appears in game. 

my machine freezes and have to do a hard reset to get out of it.  
I did manage to get it to tell me that memory was being used 99% the full 32 GB of it so looks like programmers not flushing non used memory space before using it again. 
could be reason for the lock up,s Game freeze.

Neither of them fail in drastic ways, but the mechanics changed enough to keep things lively. R2 kept it close to the chest, almost guarded in formula, but changed enough to keep things fresh and exciting. 
It's rare that a sequel is so similar without being bland and keeps everything lively. What a wonderful adventure.

There is so much Hidden that a single plathrough will not be enough. The difficulty is pretty hard but manageable with the right setup. Love how the guns feels especially with the variety, snipers, bows, lmgs, smgs, ars, alien/root guns. 
The music adds a lot to the atmosphere.

The game also has co-op which is incredible only issue is finding friends... Nevermind. Solo time.

Overall 9/10.

Boss fights are more about the boss and less about surviving the add swarms.
Armors can look epic without detracting from your survivability.
4 Ring slots means you can really customize your loadout for any situation without feeling like you need to choose between survivability, damage, or utility.

68 hours in and I'm still super eager to play more! I'll probably end up sinking over 100 hours into this.

The game is definitely souls-like. The bosses are intended to be difficult. I'm playing on first difficulty but they can still become an issue. However so far I feel it is due to clunky controls rather than actual difficulty. 

You improve your gear by finding pre-determined loot in the open world and by upgrading enchantments on your gear by using boss-organs. Sounds fun right? I thought so too, but somehow wasn't enjoying it too much. Maybe because compared to Elden Ring, you don't actually get different looking/behaving loot. Or if you do is infrequent enough I haven't gotten to it yet.

Gunfight is nice, but why am I constantly out of bullets? This is my number one reason to rest - and respawn all the trash -. I thought about doing melee, but you get penalised so much doing that it is not worth it.

The game offers infrequent puzzles to solve. They're so fun, without fail they make me wish I was playing something else. I'm now at a spot where I just can't be bothered to figure out where to go next, as I'm not interested in clearing the trash for the nth time to get exactly back where I am now.

I'll see if I end up trying more, as my refund request is denied. So, a fair warning: 2 hours provided is not enough to decide if you like the game or not.",1700956305,1700993703,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By now a lot of the rough edges of it's troubled release have been sanded away, though it is not without it's remaining issues.

The graphics aren't actually that good if you look at them in detail, but the design carries the entire visual presentation easily, while the music has some serious unexpected bangers in there.

About half the bosses are somewhat boring reskins of existing mobs, but unlike the first one, the other half vary between pretty w/e and absolutely incredible (the final boss in particular is one of the best bosses I have ever seen in my life, which is doubly ironic considering how bad the final boss of the first game was).

Class and gun variability keeps this game fresh far beyond it's assumed shelf life and while you start noticing the basic layouts of areas very soon, the randomly generated worlds, different final world bosses and especially the, at times, excellent special events are worth repeat playthroughs if you enjoy the core gameplay.

The game is of course hardly perfect and there are a few things you might want to be aware of before you start:
- Melee only does not work in this game despite what everyone including the developers of the game tell you; most bosses are designed with range clearly in mind and some are flat out impossible to melee because they are flying enemies
- In true Soulsborne(TM) fashion, the game is absolutely crap at explaining some fairly important gameplay concepts
- Some of the random boss modifiers are just actually asinine and turn otherwise properly designed fights into a dumpster fire
- Pet/Summon classes trivialize 90% of the game, while they just don't work at all on the remaining 10%

But honestly this game, especially for its lower than usual price and how often it is discounted, is an absolute steal. If you like Souls-likes and third person shooters, you should get this.",1700990106,1700990106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Scaling and level cap are the main issues in Remnant 2, remove scaling and you'll have a near perfect game. Skill points are capped at 65, unlike Remnant 1, you can't max out every trait, but there's a mod that raises the cap and one that increases trait levels from 10 to 20 so you can get traits to feel like they do something.
Scaling: 
-You'll have fun as long as you don't level your weapons past lvl5. You'd think a lvl20 weapon with 300dmg would one-shot a basic enemy but it'll take 5 shots, the same weapon at lvl3 60dmg could 2 shot that basic enemy. Oh, and scaling is based on your inventory, not what you have equipped, so that lvl3 weapon is going to fall off if you have a lvl6 weapon in storage... In Remnant 1 Scaling was based on the Difficulty, World, and +1lvl over player gearscore. Your weapons do more damage at max lvl than at lvl5. In Remnant 2 it's claimed scaling works the same as the first game but that's just not true, lvl5 weapons do more damage than max lvl20. Enemies at gearscore 12-14 feel balanced, you can do good feeling damage but can die just as easy, at gearscore 20 a common enemy has so much health you'll empty a mag from a gun that should 2 shot the fucker. Forget about bosses, you can learn the attacks and strats to take no damage but you'll empty all your ammo before you see 1% dent in the healthbar, it'll make you wonder why you leveled your weapons at all. But that same boss vs lvl5 guns will be easy. Many Faced God boss on Yaesha Nightmare (Hard) takes me less than 2m to kill with my lvl5 guns but the same boss on Adventure (Easy) with max lvl20 guns took almost 30m to kill.
Story:
-Not as good as Remnant 1, they tried to make the cast of Ward 13 interesting with some cutscenes and making some of them central to the story. it didn't work. Just like Remnant 1, all the good story is in the notes and characters you find in the different worlds, but they took interesting characters you only read about in Remnant 1 and brought them to disappointing life in Remnant 2. The Dreamers you read about in Remnant 1 are now part of the Ward 13 cast and have just a little personality as the rest of Ward 13. Ford, Clementine, that dude that gives you new classes, they should have just been reading material because whoever wrote all the notes and books from Remnant 1 was a great story and world builder while whoever wrote the cutscenes and player dialogues with these characters for Remnant 2 probably came from Netflix if you know what i mean. -World building is still here in the notes you find in the worlds so it's not bad, just missed the intrigue that was present in the first game. Overall would have been better if things continued with our player from Remnant 1 instead of doing a massive time jump and a new hero with a partner that takes no part in anything and taking characters of mystique and making them into some teen drama. It's good that Ford just fucks off for the whole story cause one lame scene isn't going to ruin him but Clementine is the main story, reading about her in Remnant 1 is like reading Claremont's X-Men, watching her scenes and listening to her player dialogue is like watching Fox's X-Men Dark Phoenix.
Gameplay:
-Stunlocks, there are loads of common basic enemies that can stun you, even halfway through an attack, heal, or skill animation. Stuns stack, you can get stunned before the stun animation is done and before there's a window to dodge out of the next attack. You can not stun enemies out of their attacks like in Remnant 1 or any other Souls type game.
-The floating enemies, robots on the Nerud and triangles on Yeasha, are uninspired boring nothings that belong in Destiny 2.
-Aberrations; there are many times through the game where a normal enemy or special unit is designated as a miniboss with a red corruption/glitch effect that sometimes does nothing other than make it a miniboss and sometimes shoots energy orbs of debuffs and elemental status at you with tracking, AOE and cast spam. I guess it's explained as the root corruption of the labyrinth leaking into the worlds? The effect and its energy attacks are dumb and look out of place in every world except the one it's never used in, the one it supposedly comes from, the Labyrinth. It's also lame and lazy to give normal enemies boss sized health and damage and call them a miniboss, yall didn't even give them animations to go with the corruption effect/attacks, they are 100% regular enemies doing nothing different from their normal version.
-Bosses, some good Souls bosses but most Remnant 2 bosses are very large arena types with ground and energy highlights that feel more like an MMO event than the Souls bosses of Remnant 1. Only a few lame bosses, they're the special units with a bigger model and more health.",1700375221,1700959800,True,0,0,0.48328101634979248,0,True,False,False

One such update broke online for me until I made a dummy Epic account, linked it for less than 5 minutes, and then unlinked it again.  Until I gave in and did that, trying to switch my world to online or friends-only would immediately crash me to main menu.  I haven't had problems since, however, and they claim to have fixed the root issue in a recent patch.  I can only assume the root issue is Epic Servers being as Epic Servers tend to be.

If you want to play in offline or have no problems having and linking an Epic account, this shouldn't matter to you.  Outside of patch-specific connection weirdness, this is a better version of Remnant: From the Ashes.  However, I can't properly review the offline experience, as I learned my lesson from getting bodied by Remnant 1 bosses in solo and I didn't even try this time around; it's been with friends exclusively.  Beyond that, they took the formula that worked last time, iterated, polished, and presented the world again.  It's a nice nostalgia trip if you particularly liked Remnant 1; you can see how worlds changed after your last character finished going through and committing atrocities in them in the name of performing a raid on a lighthouse on Earth.  There's some hints at what became of characters, others return wholesale, and it all comes together to a point where I feel like you may legitimately be missing out on content if you're jumping into the series at this stage.

I feel the dungeons might be the game's strongest point.  Moreso than the first game (at least moreso than I remember), the optional dungeons have a number of puzzles gating off optional content.  They vary in obscurity, ranging from ""what symbol do I put in here"" to ""if I shoot this barrel, it may bridge the gap in between two wires, temporarily completing the circuit!""  My main complaint on this front is the inspect mechanic has never not felt like bullshit.  There's no strong indication that an item needs to be inspected or interacted with in the inspect window for progression.  This led to a frustrating moment where I knew an object was a key I needed to progress, but my character wouldn't utilize it at all, leaving me trying other things for way too long.  I even thought to inspect it, but found nothing until I finally gave in, looked it up, and found out that while I was technically right, the key wasn't recognized as a key until I inspected it and maneuvered the camera to a VERY finicky location that prompted me to press a button to turn my key into a key.

This is a tentative recommend.  I'm enjoying my time with it and it's difficult to describe the sheer joy I felt when my melee build finally got the equipment it needed to click into place without ending up on a list, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still salty about having had to cave in and attach my email to an Epic account just to play the game that I bought on the promise of online play, and which I wouldn't have bought if there had been a ""Requires Epic Account"" disclaimer.",1698469563,1700947511,True,0,0,0.492195606231689453,0,True,False,False

The gameplay quickly devolves into an exhausting slog on par with Daikatana. Most of the enemies are flying and all enemies input read, causing enemies to dodge midair when you aim at them. Remember how fun those brain slug infected elves were to kill in Remnant 1? That's completely missing from the game, with all enemies being some combination of aim-trainer ""hit the white cube to kill"" or teleporting flying creature that shoots homing projectiles.

Leveling weapons is a nightmare, given how stingy the game is with scrap. The gameplay loop necessitates a serious amount of grinding for basic upgrade materials and currency. As such, you get forced into simplistic builds because it's just too damn expensive to upgrade a new weapon from scratch.

If you played Remnant 1, then you know not to expect a story. Thankfully, you can just skip through all the painful dialog. Blah blah blah last human settlement blah blah blah the root is a threat to all worlds but somehow not the humans with quantum immortality running around looting tombs and massacring gods. Italian comics published in Heavy Metal have more coherent plots.

All in all, it's a 5/10 game carried by the gorgeous environments, rewarding exploration, and some clever puzzles but finds itself completely sabotaged by its worst failings.

TLDR: It's exactly how a successor should be done. Gameplay wise not all too much changes, but simply better in almost every aspect and deepening the core mechanics. More and better puzzles and secrets. The build possibilities are deepened very much with up to 132 class combinations (12 classes which can be combined into a dual class with different effects depending on your first pick), more weapons, more skills, more rings and ring slots, more amulets to choose from and so on.

It's still Dark Souls with guns and some bosses only have adds in certain stages (not like in the first game where almost every boss had adds the whole fight, with the exception of the DLC-Bosses).

[b][u]Story[/u][/b]
As in Remnant - From the Ashes the Root are still the main threat in the story, but due to some random and unforeseen interactions with the world stone you also end up in different worlds with their own problems and factions.

[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]
While the gameplay still mostly revolves around combat with your Estus flask (relics called hearts), ammo restricted long and hand gun and melee weapon. The soulslike typical dodge roll also returns (determined by your armor's encumberance).
Every enemy type has a different move set and different weak spots. Like the first game with enough practice the whole game can be beaten without getting hit once.
Ammo and relics can be refilled by interacting with the world stone or a crystal bonfire but doing so respawns - in Dark Souls fashion - every non-Boss enemy.

[b][u]Items[/u][/b]
You have four armor slots, three weapon slots (long gun, hand gun, melee), three mutators (which are equipped on your weapons and change their behaviour, e.g. %-chance to refill ammo on hit or % damage per round missing in the magazine), four rings, one amulet, up to three different weapon mods, one relic and three different passive stat bonuses on your relic (e.g. more health, more damage mitigation, faster reloads, higher critical strike chance).
This time there are already more than 50 guns (more to come with updates and DLCs) which are vastly different in their designs and functions. These weapons range from classical repeating or levering rifles to fully automatic ones to bows and crossbows and sci-fi guns which shoot gas, lightning, fire or black holes.
The amount of melee weapons got bumped up to more than 40 and also got very creative ones like a light sabre, an atomic powered hammer or magical throwing axe and so on.
Weapons can be upgraded to deal up to three times their base damage, mutators can be upgraded in their power and unlock a new additional effect upon reaching their maximum level.
For balance sake armor cannot be upgraded and leads to you being able to swap to new or other armor without having to upgrade it to the previous armor's level.
The weapon mods are skills for your weapon and can embue your shots with fire or poison, summon minions, grant auras or shields and much more.

[b][u]Character Customization[/u][/b]
When creating a character you have a small editor for your character. You can change gender, pick from some predefined faces, choose scars if you want to, and pick a colour for your hair, eyes, facial hair and/or makeup.

[b][u]Build Customization[/u][/b]
You have up to 132 class combinations to choose from (12 classes, you get to pick two and get a different prime perk depending on your first pick), multiple armors sets, 4 ring slots, 1 amulet, 2 active class' skills, 3 weapon mods, 3 weapon mutators, and are capped at 85 trait points.
While the trait points are capped this time, their changes are bigger and you need to priorize their effects, like health, stamina, stamina regeneration, dodge distance, weapon range, etc.

[b][u]Bosses[/u][/b]
At the time of writing this review there are 30 bosses. All of these bosses are very different to fight due to vastly different move sets, boss sizes, arenas which can also change during the encounter. Somes Bosses have some adds during certain phases and the boss' move set and behaviour change depending on your actions and their health. On harder difficulties the bosses also gain some mutator which change their behaviour and/or add some skills.
Additionally there are random minibosses which are stronger default enemies with even more mutators to choose from to spice up the experience.

You usually encounter up to half of the bosses during a playthrough.

[b][u]Difficulty and game modes[/u][/b]
The game has four difficulties to offer (Survivor, Veteran, Nightmare, Abomination). The hardest difficulty is locked behind beating the final boss the first time.
The game offers Story Mode and Adventure. Story Mode is - surprisingly - the story (which sub-stories also change per playthrough) and Adventure let's reroll 3 of 5 Story regions (the 2 Story regions which can't be played in Adventure are not randomized).",1700922800,1700922977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Character classes (Archetypes), areas, boss fights and weapons all feel very unique. The ability to switch between your campaign run and an adventure run is also a great quality of life feature that allows you to farm levels, materials and loot perpetually. 

There are a few things in the game that annoyed the hell out of me, such as the worst gimmick boss ever the Labyrinth Sentinel & a certain parkour area that took me an hour to get past because jumping and vaulting can be trash sometimes. Im also not a fan of the changing worlds system. Basically theres 3 worlds and each gets randomily generated except for the starting/ending points which are linked. Now this system does add a bunch of replay-ability but the issue is if your trying to get specific loot from specific encounters you may end up clearing half the world before realizing your world didnt roll with the dungeons you needed and now you have to replay the entire thing again and pray that you get the dungeons you need. With that said the good still heavily out weighed the bad.

I highly recommend giving this game a try if your a fan of the souls games or are just looking for a challenging rpg experience.  Rated 9/10",1700737458,1700922222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, many of the roguelikes out there failed to deliver a meaningfully lengthy yet varied gameplay. What they usually do is just repeat early-game enemies and bosses (maybe do a reskin or have some minor tweaks to their move set here and there) in the late game. By doing so, the playtime is artificially lengthened, and people are misled to think that it is a great game of value. But most of the content is just grinding on the repetitive levels and monsters. Making the game unnecessarily grindy. 

 

Remnants 2, on the other hand, suffers no such issue. The fundamental reason is that the contents crafted by the developer are just so abundant and it is not possible to be depleted fully in the first playthrough (in fact, not even close). The puzzles are creative, the bosses are well-designed, and the challenges are fun in general. And there are countless of secrets well-hidden and waiting to be found.

- File corruption (deletion of your character) after crashing.
- Constant crashing.
- Very bad Desync, even for people with internet cable.
- Boss rooms don't reset properly (leaving mobs in the room when you get back to it, or the 
  boss having a bugged hp bar).
- Not receiving items after a kill, while your co-op partners do.
- Your character rolling back on relogs (missing items they unlocked and can't get them back).
- Not being able to play at all, due to ""network issues"" (that have nothing to do with you, btw).

I'm sure I'm missing some bugs, but this is the list of bugs STILL in the game. Buy at your own risk.

Unlike a souls game you don't loose anything upon death and the enemy's are simply just there for you to kill you gain nothing by killing everything you can basically run to the next boss and just push through.

I could say the standard stuff about what I like, but it would end up sounding a bit games journalist-ish, and then everyone would wonder if I'd managed to get out of the first zone yet.

Overall, this is a very good game, though some aspects annoy me.  

+ Very very good character customization.  This allows people to have very customized setups that fulfill various roles when playing co-op, while also allowing a variety of approaches in terms of solo play.
+ Enemy variety is very cool to see, and quite well done.
+ Gunplay and melee both feel good to use.
+ Very nicely-crafted different areas, each of which is very, very different. N'Erud is a great example, as are several others.

But...

- The game isn't great in terms of performance, at least on PC.  Still playable of course, but gets some major FPS and performance loss on pretty good hardware.
- Each of the areas are beautifully done, but having them be different, with different quests and a different layout each time is both a good and a bad thing.  
It's a good thing in that it offers a fresh experience of the same areas, with a different overworld, and different stages of progression, and different dungeons each time. But, it's a bad thing in that there is no real feeling of being able to explore every nook and cranny of an area and call it explored - only explored for this runthrough.  It feels as if one is visiting one parallel version of that world each time, which is... kind of cool, but it should have been explained in game somehow.
- The writing and plot is... basic at best.  Honestly, the first game was about on par; great environments and good souls-like gameplay, but mediocre storytelling.

Honestly, it's a pretty good game overall, despite my nitpicks.  You're not going to buy it due to the deep and existential writing, but for being able to get and use weird and cool weapons on a wide variety of things that want to eat your face, in a variety of interesting places.  Between the items you can equip and the classes you can equip as primary & secondary, a player gets many, many options for how they want to play.

My final score is 8.5/10.  If they hire a good writer for their next game to help tie everything together, so much the better.",1700544537,1700891135,True,2,0,0.537148356437683105,0,True,False,False

It was kind of fun looking at various pieces of equipment and rings and trying to get weird builds that completely change the way you play, like decreasing health while using rings that apply shields at low health, made in an interesting game of cat and mouse. Regeneration builds were fun, and when you maximized to struggle on the highest difficulty, it was, for the most part, fun. 

I quickly plateaued, and hit the max trait points, and then it started to get monotonous. New rings, weapons, or armor weren't as interesting, and if they felt useless at least if I could continue leveling up, I would continue to feel like I was being rewarded for playing, like it was with the previous one.

With a build set, and nothing really to strive towards, I just sped through to beat the game to get it over with, and move on. I don't think I can recommend this one too much, you'll pretty quickly hit the top and have nowhere to go. I understand the reason for removing uncapped trait points and I disagree with that design philosophy. Continuous positive reinforcement was what hooked me into the original, made new traits always a joy to find, no matter how minuscule their effect may be. It would have also encouraged me to max out every class so I could combine all the class perks together. It's fun to get stronger. It's fun to be rewarded. Even helping against bosses you've already beaten were rewards in themselves until you're maxed out. Now it's monotonous.

I don't think they'll be changing it. But I don't think I'll be getting back into it unless they do. Ahh well. Guess that's how the cookie crumbles.",1700886806,1700886806,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

About the Variety of this game are quiet a lot, each time u replay or go on and on again on the new adventure mode the map changes every times. However, if you play long enough you can play with your eyes close, as the pattern of the map is there. 

Just that it looks kind of mixed up. You can replay and replay until you stuck at some point where you need “Friends” to help you open the secret door or map (normally I will just wait for random players to join my quest then tada! Secret Unveil).

If you didn't like the first game, you can probably still handle this one if you're in need of a co-op shooter. I like the archetype system, and some of the guns are neat. I genuinely enjoy finding some of the secrets while exploring, and I actually find myself mildly interested in the story this time around. But without someone asking me to play I doubt I would continue.

The same slow, clunky movement is back, as well as the tedium and frustration that often accompanies procedurally generated levels. During a couple boss fights, my co-op partner's game would freeze and crash, leaving me to fend for myself and leaving them without the loot drops. 

The map is actually usable this time around but the number of irritating design issues push my patience beyond its limit at least twice a session. Why do I need to backtrack through another load zone and then back again to find the answer to a small puzzle that I need in order to progress, the completion of which again takes me BACK to the original zone...? Why does the map indicate a wide pathway to an area that I've already been, yet if I try to take that route I start to choke and die from the out-of-bounds mechanic? While we're at it, why are the checkpoint map and in-game map completely different so that I can't tell where I need to go in order to explore an undiscovered area? 

Remnant 2 is an improvement over the previous entry, but an overall mediocre third person shooter that I would recommend to someone if it's on sale and they need a decent co-op experience.

I can't even begin to express how utterly thrilled I am with Remnant 2. As a devoted fan of the original, my expectations were sky-high, and I'm elated to say that this sequel has not only met but exceeded them in every conceivable way!

From the moment I fired up Remnant 2, I was captivated by the stunning graphics. The attention to detail in every environment is mind-blowing, and the character models are so lifelike that it's easy to become emotionally invested in their journeys. The art team behind this game deserves a standing ovation!

The gameplay mechanics have been finely tuned to perfection. Combat feels even more visceral and satisfying, with a vast array of weapons and abilities that cater to every playstyle. The addition of new enemy types and challenging boss battles keeps the adrenaline pumping, and the level design is a true work of genius, offering a sense of exploration that's second to none.

But what truly sets Remnant 2 apart is its storytelling. The narrative is gripping, with twists and turns that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire game. The characters are beautifully developed, and their interactions are filled with depth and emotion. The choices you make along the way have a real impact on the outcome, adding layers of replayability that I can't wait to dive into.

And let's not forget the incredible soundtrack, which sets the mood perfectly and enhances the overall experience.

To top it all off, the developers have shown an unwavering commitment to their community. Regular updates, bug fixes, and a clear roadmap for future content ensure that Remnant 2 will continue to evolve and provide countless hours of enjoyment.

In conclusion, Remnant 2 is an absolute triumph, a testament to the dedication and passion of its creators. It's a must-play for anyone who appreciates exceptional storytelling, immersive gameplay, and breathtaking visuals. Thank you, developers, for delivering a sequel that has left me absolutely awestruck.

Long version:

The story is offensively, insultingly, aggressively bad.  I hate the writing, dialogue, and cutscene direction.  I hate that the opening tries to paint the player and bratty girl as a dynamic duo but all she does is verbally abuse you and then pretend she's your friend.  I hate that the inciting incident is an old man being senile in a way that makes you doubt the writer more than the character.  I hate that the player character quips like a Marvel character constantly.

The game is tuned for multiplayer, but I was told to use the dog character while trying it so there's an entity that will soak up aggro, because you'll get attacked from behind constantly.

The world is supposedly well designed but I can't enjoy a world inhabited by unlikable characters, and most people I've asked about it either stopped playing in a literal desert, or in the final boss.

After giving up on this game I felt the only clever thing the devs did was make the prologue take more than 2 hours so the game is difficult to refund.",1700200858,1700880631,False,6,3,0.420180797576904297,0,True,False,False

My experience is basically being stuck with the trash default gun for the first 6 - 7 hours, and the few I have picked up aren't much better. They're either slightly better than the default, or have some kind of weird jank where the feel of the default gun is better than the newer weapon. Weapons also tend to either be extremely well hidden to the point even a thorough search of the map is unlikely to discover them, so you will be limited to pre-determined boss drops if any even drop at all. Frankly, I'm surprised some just didn't end up going entirely undiscovered for years after release. 

The boss design for the most part is very well done with multiple being puzzle boss fights. There are a few stinkers though. Some bosses will fill all available space within the room with homing exploding projectiles, while possessing a very aggressive melee moveset. While some puzzle bosses will not have a reasonable solution in sight. Specifically, The Chimney's roots midway down the gauntlet.

In normal levels the enemies do materialize out of thin air and often behind you, so you cannot plan out how to take on a room. Some bosses and enemies do tend to be bullet sponges as well. With how well many things are hidden, and with how some boss fights are designed you'll probably need to have a guide open, or someone who has already beaten the game along with you.

Don't go into this expecting a looter shooter. All pick ups are resources or rings/ mods with small power ups. Stuff like +1% health, or a conditional regen like 5% lifesteal up to 50% of max HP.

I can't say much about the story, but the NPC merchant dialogue is outright annoying and will either force you to wait for their animation to catch up, or lock you into chat when you just wanted to see what they're selling instead of listening to them complain about you breathing air near them.

TL;DR:
The good:
Most bosses are well designed
World design is creative and genuinely interesting
No AAA baby hand holding and no cluttered interface
Smooth gun play


The bad:
Barely any guns to use
Open world surface levels feel empty, lots of aimless walking
Occasional bullet sponge enemies/ bosses
Occasional over designed bosses
Awful NPC dialogue that also obstructs shop UI access

Overall good game with some annoying issues. There really just needs to be more weapon availability, and pulling back a little bit on how ridiculously well hidden weapons are around the world.

Which makes me sad cause I like the game but fuck me, even with a mod that makes the game look like it was made for a PS2 and still run like shit with more performance problems then complaints in this review.

Is the game fun? Yes
Am I having fun? Yes
Is my fps ever hitting 60+? Not even on loading screens.

While I haven't gotten too far into the game to say much about it overall, I can't ignore the poor performance.
 While my PC isn't good, it manages to pull consistent 30-60 FPS on most games released recently,
  However Remnant 2 is not one of them. 
   Which in a way is weird to me, since for the most part, it's like the Remnant 1, feels like it, looks like it and plays like it, yet in set places fps will go as low as below 10 while the previous one had none of these performance problems. 

Exploratory places of such fps loss are in the great Labyrinth
 Walking around is completely fine, decent 40 fps but the moment one of those portals get a hard one from you being near it, the fps will plummet until you put a restraining order on it and get away set distance. 

Now while it might just be my PC growing ancient, I still think the performance shouldn't be this down bad.

Normally there is a TL;DR at the end, but I'm putting it here. Good/Bad at the end.

TL;DR: if you were a fan of the first Remnant, just buy the game. It's the same game, but more refined, polished and with double the content, maybe even triple.

With that out of the way, the rest of the review [i](hopefully limited on spoilers.)[/i] 

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

The game, like the first, starts you out in a short tutorial section; however this time you have a team of 3 others with you. It is a very short section, with a small boss fight that immediately hammers home just how important patience and dodging is. The NPCs also regularly introduce you to the friendly fire mechanic to prepare you for Co-op play, because I have yet to go more than 5 minutes without being shot in the back of the head. Fortunately there isn't anything in my skull I need.

Visually the game is breathtaking. It runs on Unreal 5, so this isn't a surprise at all, however what flabbergasts me is how absolutely gorgeous every item is in the game. You can now fully inspect the models and they are [i]stunning[/i]. I am convinced Gunfire has the best art team in the business. I don't know how you manage to make 100+ rings all look not only unique but incredible visually, but damn, they did it.

Maps are beautiful as ever. The worlds were my favorite part about Rem 1, and my lord does this game ramp it up. The areas are oozing with subtle story telling, and feel very real and lived in despite being completely alien. Every corner has been nothing short of a pure joy to explore.

On the note of exploring, most areas have a ton of secrets or puzzles, which the puzzles are absolutely incredibly well done. Solving riddles, deducting codes, extrapolation of incomplete data, the puzzles are fantastic, I'm not a very smart girl, so I needed a wiki for a fair bit, but anyone of average intelligence will eventually get it. Well, except [i]that one puzzle...[/i]

Anyways, you have multiple worlds.

[b]N'erud[/b] - A desolated alien wasteland filled with robots and abominations; I love this place despite the pain it caused me, it feels so lonely and it's so easy to get lost in, exploring it has been a lot of fun, getting the items I wanted, not so much.

[b]Yaesha[/b] - Yaesha returns; and I still hate traversing it, even more here now that the game has puzzles and now I'm agitated by the hostile truffles rolling into me for 50% of my health, while having my intelligence insulted because I always skipped family pictionary night. Place is friggin' breath-takingly beautiful as it always has been.

[b]Labyrinth[/b] - Ah yes, Cubes. But now fueled by hate. I love the area but I've spent so much of my time there I have developed Cubophobia. This was my bane during my Hardcore Apocalypse runs. Every Reset was here. It's not even hard. I just really suck at Rubik's Cubes and pattern recognition.

[b]Losomn[/b] - This might need it's own section; Holy. Hell. This might be my favorite area in gaming as a whole. Victorian London, with british elves to fight?! A CASTLE?! WITH A MILLION SECRETS?! AN ASYLUM!! And the best character to boot (Faelin, my beloved...) What an incredible experience Losomn is as a whole. I think I can live without Bloodborne on PC because of this area.

Anything more would be spoilers, so I'll leave that for you to find.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Okay, done gushing over the visuals. Guns, yes, combat. It's the exact same as Remnant 1. But, like, better.

There is about the same amount of weapons, but they're mostly different, though a lot of fan favorites return, and the new ones are ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! They really went a long way in polishing the already excellent gunplay, the addition of Bows has made every combat encounter so much damn fun, I have 100%'d the game nearly, and I just run around sticking idiots with arrows, I can't STOP and I need someone to HELP ME. 

My only complaint about the gunplay is [b]Mods[/b] are much less interesting and even less effective than they used to be, they are still helpful, some are quite strong, but a majority are easily forgotten, obvious exception being Blood Draw. I love shooting an idiot with a harpoon, and dragging them to the barrel of my shotgun. Better than therapy, honestly.

[b]Mutators[/b] largely replace the Armor Sets that were present in the base game. These are placed on weapons and are Upgradable. This is a good change, I can look like the deranged hobo I was born to be without losing out on cool stats like Infinite Ammo, Bleed Bullets, I Just Crit More Bro, and I Just Crit More Bro, But On A Tuesday At 7:33PM After Eating Taco Bell.

[b]Classes[/b] are a thing now too. There is 10. There is technically 11, but if you play without a walkthrough, there is only 10. You'll never find the 11th. It's not real, it can't hurt you. (It can and will hurt you.)

Each class has 3 skills to pick from, 4 passives that gain power as you level to the cap of 10 per class and a Prime Perk, which is an ultra powerful passive, you can only have 1 of these at a time. 

You can mix and match 2 classes. This is how you break the game and clear HC-Apoc with a +3 Huntmaster M1. Skills are useful for filling gaps where gear can't, or compensating for bad plays, or to show off how many times you can die in a boss fight. Mine is 13 times, I hope nobody beats that because it wasn't intentional, I just never had a Bop-it as a kid.

Now that I'm done talking about the good, let's talk about the source of my androgenetic alopecia; Rings. Jesus, they look amazing but there is so many. I know what ring I want but I can't find a drop of water in a damned ocean. This game seriously needs a search function because god there is so many rings. Ringnant 2,000, because that's how many rings you have after the first 20 hours. I know you can favorite rings, but that goes away after you restart the game.

Please Devs, let us search for keywords like Weakspot, Bleed, Bulwark, etc... 

[h1]Audio[/h1]

Normally don't care. This is an exception. The music is so damn good, the sound is so damn good, absolutely nothing to complain about here, go enjoy the OST, it's great. The Huntress is my favorite.

[h1]TL;DR - Ringnant: Ultimate Ring Edition[/h1]

[b]Good[/b]
+Extremely satisfying gameplay all around.
+Absurd build variety.
+Progression is good, despite some rough spots with resources and scaling.
+Awesome enemies.
+Some of the best boss fights in the genre.
+Concerningly accurate hitboxes.
+The best level design I've seen in many, many years.
+Incredible replayability.
+Excellent visuals.
+Superb Audio.
+Just buy the game at this point
+Decent story, though cryptic.
+Lots of puzzles and secrets.
+Lots of upcoming DLC.
+Games actually complete and not selling cut content as DLC or MTX.
+You can fight British elves.

[b]Bad[/b]
-So many rings, we need a search or sort option, I can't take it any more.
-Co-op is very janky, and often times the latency will kill you, if the ridiculous damage scaling doesn't.
-Performance issues, namely on 30xx series nVidia cards.
-Cass never shuts up. Just let me buy your garbage, please. (Timebased RNG shop, no premium currency crap though, just an annoying NPC.)",1691063890,1700866088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It can be incredibly hard if you want it to be (especially on higher difficulties), but the lower difficulties are totally workable (and I say this as someone who's a complete souls-like noob), and the penalty for death is minimal. The same friend who got me into Remnant tried to get me into elden ring, but I'm not the biggest fan of the ""drive-by the spot where you died and run like crazy"" gameplay loop.
In this game, you get respawned at the spot where you last checked in, and all your enemies respawn too, but you don't lose anything. It's fantastic. You have the freedom to experiment with builds and do weird things, and the game doesn't punish you for it. Speaking of which, the build diversity is excellent, you can find all sorts of weird, wacky, and fun builds to smack enemies around with.

Kind of the oposite of Tiny Tina, where you CONSTANTLY meetiing someone and CONSTANTLY hearing some dialog.

Loved the first Remnant on PS, Remnant 2 is the same but better. Love the builds, love the rings and amulets, the weapons.

Not a fan of most of them, if I do play its usually a top down twin shooter type game or a platform shooter (think Bastion or Keroblaster). the ONLY reason why I thought about buying this game in the first place, were because of 2 factors.
1. My friend was really adamant about it, describing it like a dark souls shooter type.
2. Their was a Dog.

That dog did a lot of heavy lifting to convince me to play the game, and I am so thankful for it.

This game is SO MUCH good fun. ESPECIALLY with friends. You don't really need to play the first game, but it dose add context and may make you happy with how present one of the NPCs is. but otherwise, its a solid action game that has many clashing styles that all work thanks to the strange world Remnant lives in. It may feel odd with Clementine and her who plot taking up the hero roll and actually doing most of the saving, but really, you come to this game for the shoot out, the boss fights, and the secrets. 

Its one of the few games that I'm dissecting the NEW DLC to hopefully find one of its many puzzled out secrets. It's engaging, letting you spot enemies ahead with certain skills, yet cleverly spawning in more out of sight whenever you have been spotted by a huge crowd and a wave is coming. Each setting is realized with SO MUCH hidden under the surface that each world is DYING to get its own DLC.

The only main thing I wish they had now, is a way to organize your inventory/rings/armor/weapons better. As of now they go by alphabetical order and my slow brain only realized that this month thanks to a friend pointing this out. It takes me forever to find anything that I haven't favorited. 

one more minor complaint.

You can upgrade your weapons, which increases damage done to you as well. BUT their is no way to upgrade armor. So if you want more beef, you either have to use ring slots or amulet to get it, or just become a slow moving flop wall.

Unfortunately, the developer has make a consistent and interesting mistake with updating the game, and causing the game to be almost unplayable even with a higher end system. 

At this point in the game, Gunfire games should know better on how to update the game, and unfortunately they are updating just as bad as bungie when it comes to Destiny 2. Like really? Are your standards that low? Stop making half baked fixes that cause the latency and playability of the game to fall. On top of that, Gunfire then, when the player base falls away, then starts focusing on the updates that make the game more playable. Players find a great build? Gunfire attacks the build faster than players can try it out. Focus on problems Gunfire, not players figuring fun things out. 

The game itself, has been fleshed out pretty well, so many hidden features, fun things to explore, better mechanics like jumping! The graphics have come a long way and honestly the latest expansion was great. I think the devs need to tune the game a little more for solo, duo and 3 man team play, but thats my opinion. I love the game for what its supposed to better, a definite upgrade to the original game. That being said, balance the builds and TEST them before releasing them, and please work a little harder on build diversity? There really isnt much, and you keeping breaking all the classes minus HUGs.

One thing I will say, the few weapons they brought from the first game were mostly done dirty and are worthless. Special note is the Hellfire(Spitfire remade). That was just an insult plain and simple.

It is one of the most responsive games. Each choice a player makes in-game or strategizing with their characters is given explicit feedback that feels impactful and important. And the more you play, the more the layers of that character building slowly unravel themselves.

Over time, you are given so many tools that you begin to develop a generalized intelligence of the game's systems, and utilizing all the weapons, armor, amulets, and rings, not to mention mods and mutators, is so rewarding.

1. The ""power level"" system is way out of balance!  I feel punished for maxing out my weapons and classes.  The difficulty ramp up is too steep.
2. I have no problem with RNG as is the backbone of this game however, re-rolling adventure mode 25 times trying to get a specific zone to pop up and then more RNG to see if the item is in said zone... that isn't fun... just makes me mad.

There are only two gripes I have so far; the cut scenes sometimes have an SLIGHT FPS drop - and I think that is just a small optimization issue ((Nothing crazy or really noticeable; in fact its not even really worth mentioning here)) - and the other gripe is there is no voice chat or a way to type to your allies when you are playing in a public session. 

First sort of game like this I feel like I have played; people say that its a soul's like game - I have never played Dark Souls or Elden Ring so its interesting to hear that it has vibes of those games. This game might convince me to go check those out whenever I get bored of it. 

The game honestly feels like its worth the 50 dollars it ask's for.

- Lack of area variety, around 4 locations. This is very small for such a big game.

This is a deeply unfair description, as someone who dislikes souls-likes and LOVES both Remnant games. It does have souls' strengths of challenging gameplay (so you can't get cocky), and learning boss' attack patterns. What it DOESN'T have is the obtuse UI issues or reliance on janky inputs for difficulty that are a mainstay of the genre.
In addition to this, Remnant II doubles down on the first game's biggest strengths:
-Multiple unique, gorgeous worlds to explore, each with their own stories and lore.
-Huge amounts of replayability with variations in both the maps, storyline, and events that can occur in eahc world. Doubly so because some of these have multiple possible outcomes. 
-Fantastic hidden easter eggs throughout the game; including events behind secret walls, and environmental features that reveal hidden rewards under the right circumstances.
-Immense build customisability. Between unlockable weapons, gear, classes, and traits there are so many options for different builds, whether you're playing on normal difficulties to do random fun things, or trying to optimise for Apocalypse mode.

DLC update: The obvious content of the DLC is fairly neutral, it's more of the same, worth the money, but nothing to write home about. The additional hard-to-find elements are a really nice touch though, if you put in the work, there are more great hidden gems to keep an eye out for.",1694842018,1700810257,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Although there might still be some minor performance issue due to the complexity of UE5 and optimization, the current version of Remnant 2 outshines many of the big titles this year in terms of fun, depth and variety. Even after collecting all the achievements, the structure of the game encourage subsequent playthroughs. To the point that you can just say ""why not? let's just go for another run"" or ""another co-op session"" and the game remains enjoyable.

I also like how the game toned down from 100% procedural generation and settle with 'randomized injectibles' where you randomly get a selection of crafted section of each maps instead of 100 AI generated content. In the current landscape of procedural generation games, I heavily prefer this kind of randomness in a sense that you still get a package of crafted stage which enable players to detect pattern and learn, instead of just accepting the 100% chaos of randomness.

Although I highly recommend it as a co-op game, it is still 100% enjoyable playing solo. Do not miss out.",1700808213,1700808213,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Little things that mean a lot, for example running out of battle does not drain stamina.  Sharing ammo picked up with teammates.  Quality of life improvements that are much appreciated.  Let me just say, I loved Remnant: From the Ashes and this is a continuation of that story/game.  The controls are almost the same but feel smoother.  The sounds, graphics, mood are all very contiguous with the initial game.  The NPCs are back but older (most of them) and it really FEELS like a sequel, which is intuitive but rarely accomplished in a sequel with lots of love poured into the inner-workings of the mechanics/character development.  Loving it so far.  Will update if that changes but this game is a BUY!  Go get it!

It's wrapped in a skin that's best described as a post-apocalyptic inter-dimensional fantasy sci-fi romp. If the setting sounds like a convoluted mouthful or an outright confusing mess even, that's because it is. The over-arching main story comes across as superficial, generic, and even cringey at times, however it's juxtaposed with surprisingly deep and well-written side-stories that are embedded in the lore and the somewhat tedious NPC dialogs found within the individual worlds. These 'worlds' act as the games main levels, the procedural combinations of which, provide endless replayabilty. But questionable story exposition choices aside, everything else on offer here is utterly sublime: Super tight gun-play and melee combat, gratifyingly deep build-crafting and RPG mechanics meshed with a ridiculous amount of items and secrets to uncover, a staggering number of satisfyingly complex puzzles to solve... the list goes on.

Mods fixed that for me, but after the new update the game can't even be launched. This isn't a new issue. This is an ONGOING and UNRESOLVED issue.

Until that is fixed, and until I can play the game again, there's no way I can recommend this game to anyone. There is basically no information on how to fix these problems anywhere that I've found outside of the basic ""Reinstall and verify, run as admin, delete everything, etc"" prattle.

Edit:
I've managed to get the game working, by essentially double uninstalling the game; Delete the remnants 2 folder physically, any trace you can find, then uninstall from steam. Re-download, try to run and fail- Verify, find one missing file, run and fail- By some grace clicking the play button non stop actually worked.

Then, once the game had launched, I was met with around 10 FPS for my troubles. I'm not sure if this is what I would say is a fix... But the game did indeed launch. Is it playable? Certainly not by the 50-70 FPS I had before. But it did launch.

Graphic's, Animations, Effects, Enemy Design, Combat and World Design is truly Next Gen Graphics. I am truly blown away by this game. Its crazy and i lost for words for just how much fun this game is.

The over all experience this next generation game brings when you combine everything is unlike anything before. I've never seen a game look this good and play this good. The amount of content in Remnant 2 is staggering.  The amount of future replayability seems to be almost endless. You literally want to explore everything because you just never know what you will find.

Remnant 2 is dang near a 10/10. I say near only bc there are a couple things that i hope they increase. For example the trait point amount. If they do the balancing on a couple of these things i will call Remnant 2 a 10/10 game.

Well Done Gunfire Games. You hit it out of the park with this one. Thank you for making a Great game in the middle of the worst time for gamers where other gaming studios have been putting out junk after junk and ripping us off with over priced garbage and micro transaction PTW junk.

Buy this game if you haven't already.

Remnant 2 has a fantastic world build and story of it's zones, the main story is more of an excuse to get you going and is not the focus.

It has plenty of classes with unique skills. Pletera of weapons including ranged and melee options. Lots of build varaity.

Remnant: From the Ashes was a great game but it did have some slight issues like running in and or out of combat would always deplete your stamina, causing world traversal to be a chore, classes didn't really have any set identity other than the armor and the skill set with it, your starting weapons and your first mod, and overall the boatload of traits that you never really used as some didn't seem useful at all.    Remnant II fixed those issues and made each class have 3 separate abilities you unlock with a set Prime Perk and passive perks.  Prime Perks are for whatever your primary class is and only one can be active due to how powerful they are.  For example, the Handler class has the ability to revive themselves with their dog using a relic charge, or another teammate using their relic, the other downside of it is it only heals you to half health but it helps you or the other person to focus on fighting rather than reviving as long as that perk is off cooldown.  The variety of weapons and modifications give the player extreme freedom to express themselves not only with armor and skills but even their weapons and what mods they use.  The Bosses in Remnant II still keep their alternate kills to give different rewards and are still extremely fun and more challenging to the player.  With the First DLC as well it has been a joy playing through it and I'll update this review for each DLC that comes out and give a spoiler free review of it when I beat them.",1700772753,1700772753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere in the game, the visuals and the music and especially them combined was fantastic.
Even when I played with random people to do some of the missions it felt as if people actually wanted to help and not just troll as it might be in other games.

Solving the puzzles and getting stronger was fun. It felt easy to find a decent weapon which I liked to play with and upgrade it.

Remnant 1 and 2 are often described as 'Dark Souls with guns' - while there is some merit to this statement, the games very much stand as their own thing. The gun play is excellent, the game play is challenging (with extra rewards for engaging in harder difficulties and perma-death mode), the co-op is a hell of a lot of fun and the new archetype system in 2 makes character progression feel rewarding and exciting. There are puzzles but these are almost all optional if that's not your thing. There's only one that I can think of that isn't and calling it a 'puzzle' is an overstatement (the solution is literally in a book 30secs away). The levels/maps have certain set piece locations which are connected by procedurally generated areas, the side dungeons are also randomly generated from a ready made pool. This makes each run different and keep the game throwing unexpected things at you for longer. Eventually you will see it all of course but that takes a while.

As far as I'm concerned this is game of the year 2023 for me. I almost never write reviews but this one really deserves the positive shout out!

At the time of writing this review the game is 30% in the Autumn sale which is an absolute steal. If you're really not sure, my advice would be to pick up Remnant 1 (I think that goes on sale very cheap these days) and see how you get on. If you enjoy 1 then there's a very high chance you will like 2. If you don't like 1 then at least you won't have lost much.

Doesn't do anything new or interesting, just plays it really safe. I'ts not bad but not particularly good either.

Even with the option of having two skills and team mates, it still just feels like a bunch of people running around shooting stuff, No intricate team play necessary. I guess that's my biggest let down. Reviving a downed team mate is about the extent of the cooperative play in remnant 2 and that's a major bummer. i guess if you play with friends in voice chat you could come up with some strategies and I imagine that would make the game play a lot more fun... but if you're like me and play solo or with randoms, there isn't much to it.

Environments are generic and overall completely visually uninteresting. Maps are packed with secrets though so that's a plus.

However, If you are coming here for a souls experience I should say that after finishing this game all I got was that the devs only understood ""dark souls is a hard game"" from the souls series. This game attempts to imitate something that its devs do not understand.

I'll start with the good: the visuals are very good. Although they don't tell a good story like in the souls games, they are visually pleasing.

that's where the good ends.

here are the bad things:
quest markers, and the map in general are abysmal. The worst I've ever experienced in any game. I believe this has been intentionally designed poorly to waste your time (by making you go through the same areas multiple times to find the damn main/side quests). Way too many times I randomly got to an area which was locked behind some random sh*t I didn't have (and no, not on my way to some quest, but on a long ass diversion). If you don't want to guide the player at least you should let them roam around freely (maybe with the rare ""you need x to get into here""). Not respecting your time is the big sin number 1 of this game.

The second big sin of this game is input reading (i.e. NPC's instant reaction to your clicks). it is as old as the gaming industry itself (MK2 comes to mind), and is a cheap way to make NPCs of a game look ""smart"". However, it is nothing but frustrating for the players. It kills a big portion of the fun. Weirdly enough, I think this input reading not only has made the NPCs annoying, it also has created a notable delay in how dodges  and other actions are executed, which if you have played any of the souls game you would understand how much worse they would be if your inputs were delayed all the time.

The 3rd sin of this game is the poor boss design. I will try to avoid spoilers but I will mention the bad design choices here. Take the last boss for instance (this is just an example, applies to many other bosses), beside input reading, it is a giant monster which moves all over the place faster than I could move my mice.  Entire battlefield was filled with random stuff, so it was hard to follow it around and random projectiles spawn and hit you from other places on the field (which because of all the random stuff are hard to see). Keep in mind that all of this is happening on a relatively small battlefield which heavily limits your movement. When you go to phase 2, it gets much worse. Some attacks are intentionally delayed (the boss holds them for a few seconds before unleashing) and some execute faster than any boss in the souls series with little to no visual indicators. The boss goes back and forth between the two phases in an instance after some point which is also horribly designed since it makes it impossible to dodge some attacks that are mid air while the phase shifts happen (yes, the phase shifts are horribly timed)! I killed most bosses the first attempt, but a few were very frustrating for the wrong reasons!

And the last but not the least of the sins: The progression in this game is horrible. I had a set of armor that I got at the very beginning, guess how many times I got a good armor set or piece to replace my starter armor with (I did the main story and a lot of the side dungeons)? Zero! None! why the hell would you add armor slots if your game has zero armor variety besides the original classes? Oh yes, we are imitating some game without understanding it... This also applies to weapons, although at least you have 2-3 options per weapon type there (which is still abysmal for a shooter game).

Summary: this game imitates souls games without understanding it. It severely mistakes ""challenging"" with ""annoying/frustrating"". I do not recommend this game, since it does not respect your time. I would not write a review for this game, if it wasn't for the hype it gets and truly does not deserve. I wish someone would tell me these problems before I started playing it.",1700720604,1700720604,False,6,0,0.512095749378204346,0,True,False,False

The improvements are so substantial that it feels like a whole new gaming experience, making it an absolute must-play for fans of the original and newcomers alike.

1. Visual Marvel:
Remnant 2 takes the visual fidelity to a whole new level. The environments are breathtaking, with stunning details that immerse you in a world teeming with life and danger. The lighting effects are nothing short of phenomenal, enhancing the overall atmosphere and creating a more immersive and visually captivating experience.

2. Streamlined Gameplay:
One of the most notable improvements is the refined and streamlined gameplay mechanics. The controls feel more responsive, and the combat has been fine-tuned to perfection. The fluidity of movement, combined with a diverse range of weapons and abilities, makes each encounter a thrilling and dynamic experience. The balance between challenge and reward is spot-on, keeping you engaged without becoming frustrating.

3. Expanded Lore and Storytelling:
Remnant 2 takes the intriguing lore of the first game and expands it into a more immersive narrative. The world-building is top-notch, and the story unfolds in a way that keeps you invested from start to finish. The addition of new characters and factions adds depth to the overall narrative, providing a richer storytelling experience for players who love to uncover the mysteries of the game world.

4. Enhanced Co-op Experience:
The co-op aspect, which was already a strong point in the original Remnant, has been enhanced even further. The game encourages cooperative play with seamless drop-in/drop-out multiplayer, making it easier than ever to team up with friends or join forces with other players. The synergy between team members is crucial, and the shared victories feel incredibly rewarding.

5. Diverse and Challenging Enemies:
The variety of enemies in Remnant 2 is impressive, each requiring a different strategy to overcome. The AI has been noticeably improved, making battles more unpredictable and satisfying. From hulking monstrosities to nimble and elusive foes, every encounter keeps you on your toes and contributes to the overall excitement of the gameplay.

6. Expanded Arsenal:
The weapon and armor options have been expanded, offering players even more choices to tailor their playstyle. The addition of new mods and abilities adds strategic depth, allowing for more creative and personalized character builds. Experimenting with different loadouts becomes an addictive aspect of the game, adding to its overall replay value.

Remnant 2 stands as a shining example of how a sequel should improve upon its predecessor. The developers have not only listened to player feedback but have also demonstrated a clear commitment to delivering a gaming experience that exceeds expectations. If you enjoyed the first Remnant or are a fan of action-packed shooters with deep lore and cooperative gameplay, Remnant 2 is an absolute gem that deserves a spot in your gaming library.

This new DLC has expanded on something great that was already in place and made it even better in my opinion.  Played through with one character at the top 3 difficulties.  Playing a 4th time with the new type on Nightmare and still love it.  If you are into co-op or get stuck like me, making your game public is an easy fix to that, most of the time.  If you are going solo I recommend just starting at Veteran even if you are new to the game.  Bosses are unique and similar to Remnant 1, you can get a taste of that boss's mini version when triggered looting and progressing through that world.  Other random challenging encounters will pop up as well which keep you on guard and ready.  You can lose health fast if you get rushed or are too close to the action.  Space is your friend in this (along with timing).  Love Apocalypse, synergy is very important.  There are a handful of options when it comes to your build or how you'd like to play or even look while you play.  I do hope they expand on this more before they consider another drop.

It can be very fun as a bit of run and gun adventure.  It does have a couple drawbacks as you really do have to dive deep to get everything, but if you enjoy it, you might love going the extra distance for some things.

 Even the few things that were only found out because someone had to datamine to figure it out are sort of okay.  It's forgivable and still an adventure game.

 I do suggest people play it though I also suggest sticking to lower difficulties as the higher difficulties and the hardcore mode are very over the top and only meant for people going for too much challenge.",1700703524,1700703524,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly adventuring with family/friends squad is pretty nice and full of chaotic moments and derpy situations in certain events or bosses.

My only let down is actually the game has bugs may work for some and some doesn't for instance I hit the max trait level and yet my achievement doesn't confirm that neither for my bro but to my friends and others I know have so.
meeting the blue goddess for like 8 times doesn't register u did so until sometime as an achievement and still crashes time to time. thats my only complain toward the game other than that its fun and lively on going especially online people are much cooperative.",1691412826,1700703478,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

The world is rich with detail and art making exploration feel really nice compared to the last game. A lot of peeves I had with the last game essentially disappeared and all I really thought about while playing this game was that the devs put a lot of heart into this game. Even now when I don't play, I see updates, fixes, and additions that would get rid of things that were annoying to help polish and improve. This game was fun, I was happy to play.

Also several of the bugs were cool like the high five glitch.

I guess the only caution I would give, is that the game does seem to have some performance issues. I was able to get it playable by just using DLSS, but it'd be nice if it didn't require it to run smoothly, especially on above average hardware at 1080p. While I was able to get it to run fine, other's mileage may vary- that just tends to be how these things work. A few months after release and this issue still exists, where it's only really possible to get an really good frame rate by using DLSS, even on high end hardware.

If you are new to this type of games start from the bottom and climb up with time you get more confident. Soundtrack, Gameplay. Graphics are top in my book. Also the dlc which was released recently is really enjoyable. New Archetype and weapons are fun to use. Small tip if you are first time player in this sort of game.

If you're new to the game, my personal opinion is you should know two things: do not use a guide (at the start), and experiment. This game is built on discovery, secrets, and having those ""WHAT!?!?"" moments. If you play with a step-by-step tutorial on what to do, where to go, and how to get everything, you're going to end up with no gameplay. There is no end game; once you've unlocked everything, you're done. Its predecessor had a survival mode, but you had nothing unlocked, and while it was an enjoyable end game experience, the story, atmosphere, and thrill of the hunt is what makes Remnant stand apart. When you feel stuck or like you need a guide to make progress, then by all means---no judgment here---but do know that this is not a conventional RPG where you're trying to get super powered and then do The Thing™. Finding the super powers *is* the experience, and if you keep that in mind, you'll find yourself enjoying the iterative playthroughs, the campaign-spanning hidden quests, and feel rewarded for your time. As for experimenting, this game does a good job letting one build shine, only to take away its advantages the next fight. Keep an open mind, shuffle your loadouts when you get stuck, and enjoy the weird puzzle shooter in a souls-like world.

Now, I refer to Remnant 2 as Remnant 1 but a heck ton more stuff. Items you find randomly on the ground, Items you get from having long conversations, HELL there's a few items you can only get if you roll the right campaign setup.

Choices have consequences, some of which are not even obvious. The game is so massive that it's filled with secrets and easter eggs you may never find without listening to the community. I find the amount of detail and subtlety squeezed into the game to be amazing. 

The story is mid and very generic as an overall plot in my opinion, But the individual  worlds that you unlock have better  lore on their own associated with that world.

Co-op is what makes this game a 5 star. It works well, smooth, and was balanced with this option in mind.

• [h3] It's so good. [/h3]
A [b] ""Souls-Like"" [/b] game on Steam that finally deserves its place... a souls-like that does not aim to gate keep me with absurd difficulties or awful movement and combat when paired with a Keyboard\Mouse. Featuring secrets and treasures around every corner, exploring each tile set feels incredibly rewarding. A wonderful blend of looter-shooter stats and gearing to make build-making and endgame min-maxing feel diverse at every stage of your playthrough. Randomly generated world layouts to make every single player's first play-through completely different from someone else's.

Every core system of this game is incredibly well fleshed out, requiring some level of attention and knowledge from the player to help in learning build making, boss fighting, and world layouts.

• [h3] 'Dark Souls with Guns' [/h3]
As cringeworthy as this statement is these days, it does work as a description: Adding shooting to the genre really aids in the experience as a Keyboard\Mouse player, as I am always sick of the clunky movement and combat for the Standard Souls franchise. A classic gun and crosshair allow for another layer of game mastery and overall skill cap, which will be familiar to a lot of players. Remnant features a smooth and responsive gun playground for you to dodge, roll, and shoot things to your heart's content. Gun balance seems relatively well ironed out after the first few patches, and for your first few playthroughs, each gun shouldn't struggle with getting the job done until you are finally battling with Power Level 20 or Apocalypse Difficulty.

• [h3] Randomly generated dungeons and loot! [/h3]
Every playthrough will consist of five main areas. [spoiler] Yaesha, N'rud, Losomn, The Labyrinth, and Root Earth [/spoiler] as well as your main base of operations, Ward 13. Each 'world' has two main layouts, each with a set final boss. The journey towards the boss will be different in some way each time (bosses, loot, side areas, secrets, and side quests). Everything will be shifted around and repositioned on each playthrough. [u] Please understand. The game is meant to be played over and over again for full enjoyment. [/u]

• [h3] Build Engineering [/h3]
After my full time with the game, certain builds and formats saw repeated use of certain rings, and archetypes saw constant use compared to others, especially in the higher difficulties. But testing and making builds for your play style is entertaining and relatively in-depth for those willing to dig deep enough. But the topic of gear does push me towards the weakest aspect of the game, and that is in its comparison to the first game. Remnant [b] 1 [/b] Featured unique and interesting armour sets that granted bonuses depending on the amount of pieces equipped, they added just enough excitement and build diversity to make them worth looking at, but in Remnant 2 armour feels boring and thrown together poorly with nothing but a 'Weight\Armour' rating, with almost every player using either the lightest they can find or the heaviest with almost nothing in between. I truly hope armour gets more exciting down the line.

• [h3] Something for everyone [/h3]
I'll start by saying here that I don't often find myself enjoying Souls-like games for their awkward way of gatekeeping fun by locking the enjoyment behind dying to a boss 50 times over because of insane twists and absurd mechanics that one could only learn through experience, or a locked difficulty forcing you to play the game way all the time without the ability to mess around on an easier setting or without the ability to challenge yourself further. Remnant 2 offers four difficulties: [i] Survivor, Veteran, Nightmare, Apocalypse [/i]. I highly recommend starting this game on the lowest difficulty offered, especially if you want to play with friends, as the multiplayer scaling and latency can often be far too annoying to have to deal with a new mechanic on a higher difficulty. HP scaling is as follows: [i] 100%, 150%, 250%, 275% [/i] and damage scaling is: [i] 100%, 165%, 350%, 450% [/i]. As you can see, difficulties will spike your challenge dramatically, and the game itself recommends you only play on Nightmare+ if you have strong boss knowledge and build functionality. 

- 150 Hours Later
• Multiple Survivor Difficulty Runs
• Veteran, Nightmare, and Apocalypse Completion
• Hardcore Veteran Completion
• 100% achievement completion

[h1] 9.3 \ 10 [/h1]

Finally, a newly released game where I can happily say it's 'one of my favourites'. With the only issues being a few missing features that I wanted from the first game, the game shows fantastic polish, clear support from the development team with frequent patches and fixes, and a long road ahead of them with three promised DLCs to release the following year.

Do not be hesitant about trying out Remnant 2.

I have about 100 hours in the first game and love it to death. Even 100% it. But doubt I will try the same for this one.

Pros:
Beautiful graphical makeover from the first game.
Improved movement and combat flow, especially melee.
Archetypes and dual-class system are fun to experiment with to fit anyone's play style (handler + challenger is pretty fun so far with a lot of rooms for errors).
Guns, melee, relics, mods have a lot of interesting and fun effects to play around with. 
Addition of mutators on weapons allow for even more customization.
Shooting range, finally.
A lot of familiar faces if you play first games. Glad to see some of them living better lives now.

Cons:
QoL... equipping, unequipping weapons, armors, mods, mutators is quite a hassle still.
Cannot compare items stats side by side in shop or inventory screen. Why??? This is like the most basic feature to have in item-based games.
Secrets, way too many of them now. Some are so convoluted and extreme I don't see myself bothering anymore. Hidden items, I can understand, but some archetypes are even locked behind them. Such key game-defining features should not have been hidden like that. Never felt I had to google so much on a game before.
False walls with 0 indications. You almost have to stumble on them by sheer luck.
Clues (or lack thereof) are super convoluted. Stuck in the first visit to the labyrinth for hours. 
(How should I know I have to shoot the center of the first door to open it? How do I know when to jump through the portal and not die?) - I have to google stuffs way too often and really kills the flow of gameplay sometimes.

Now some potentially controversial takes compared to first game:
I wish they didn't remove armor set bonus.

Sure, they can argue that adding mutators and relic fragments, class skill/perks, allow for more customization. But here's the thing, why not do that, and also keep armor set bonus?
May be reduce the number or dumb down the effect of the set bonus a little to prevent it from being too build-defining. Or just make the bonus for 2 or 3 pieces only to encourage mixing stuffs together.

Now armor is just...cosmetics. You cannot upgrade them. Once you find the balance you want between armor rating and weight (which will happen very soon), there's no more reason to buy/craft anything else. There's no point experimenting with different armors anymore.

Also a minor gripe, I hate to see some of the iconic weapons from 1st game getting locked behind completing campaigns at max difficulty instead of normal unlock through world roll.",1691464559,1700639474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And while I can confidently call it a good game overall, I cannot consider it a good sequel.

This is what this review is about. Let me start with positives first:

[h1] Good [/h1]

[h3] Secrets: [/h3]

This game has some of the best secrets and puzzles I've ever seen in a non-puzzle game. You will have to inspect your items, resident evil style, you will have to manipulate the environment, and you will have to actually think. Beware though, a lot of the puzzles are designed as time wasters. If you engage them directly, you'll just be wasting time. Those puzzles require you to ignore the obvious solution and think outside of the box. Also, there are quite a few puzzles that can only be done in coop. So be aware of those.

I just wish they were better spread out, because in jungle worlds, you basically find a new puzzle in every other dungeon, but in sci-fi world there are basically zero of them (there are two technically, but calling them puzzles is being VERY generous), and bloodborne worlds has only few. So since I started in the jungle world, I quickly became burned out by the third puzzle. 

And yes, I will call the locations using the code words (jungle - Yaesha, sci-fi - Nerud, bloodborne - Losomn), for those who haven't played the game.

[h3] Bosses: [/h3]

Bosses are a massive improvement over the first game. Most bosses are really good, with many of them being at least okay and only few of them being straight up bad (one of the bosses has a one-shot mechanic. If you fail to dodge it, it's literally impossible to survive. Simply fuck off with that). Otherwise, bosses have been a pleasant surprise for me. I enjoyed most of them in my time (fuck abomination though) with this game and this is a clear improvement over the first game.

[h3] Build variety: [/h3]

There is a massive assortment of items. There over 80 guns in the game (all of them unique), more than that of rings and 11 classes, which are all fun to play with. 

[h3] Exploration: [/h3]

This game is very rewarding for people who explore every corner. Every location has one randomised item and one level up book, so it's always worth exploring everything fully. Don't forget any loot that is specific to the location itself. And on top of that, every location has few chests with money and upgrade materials which are quite important in this game

So, in short, this game values exploration quite a lot and your curiosity is greatly rewarded

[h3] Map menu: [/h3]

Mini-map is fantastic. I never understood people who complain about having to fiddle with the 3D map. Go back to the first Remnant and dare to tell me that a 2D map is better

[h3] Verticality: [/h3]

Added verticality is awesome. You can now jump when pressing dodge near a ledge. The timing is very forgiving, which is a good thing. Makes exploring vertical locations so much more dynamic.

[h1] Bad [/h1]

[h3] Randomisation: [/h3]

Randomisation of the world was a big selling point of Remnant 1. Everytime you replayed a world in R1, it would change how it's structured and their layout. You would get different dungeons and structures each time. I'm not gonna pretend like the system was perfect, because there was way too little variety in those locations, but it helped with replayability nonethenless

This is pretty much the case with Remnant 2. However, there are few massive differences. First of all, the locations themselves are always the same. The way randomisation works in this game is that you get two versions of overworld. Each has it's own storyline and final boss and visual theme. That's pretty cool. However, the worlds themselves do not change in any way (except for randomised items on the level) and dungeons, which also seem to be always the same with few corridors that randomise

So that means that randomisation was severely downgraded compared to the first game. I understand why they did it, because it's immensely difficult to create randomimasion system that provides layout even half as interesting as manually created content. However, I still find it dissapointing that they simply gave up on the idea of randomised layouts instead of trying to improve on it somehow. 

I wouldn't call it a big deal, however it's still something I thought worth mentioning 

[h3] Optimisation: [/h3]

The game had AWFUL optimisation on launch. Many people couldn't even launch the game, and many people, like me, had to play on lowest settings. The worst part is that some people had perfectly reasonable performance, so it's not even consistent. Even to this day, the game's optimisation is rough. They're making it better with every patch, but the game is still not in the shape it should've launched in.

The worst part however? The game was disagned with use of AI upscaling in mind. I don't like using statements like that, but whoever thought it was a good idea to do that deserves to be fired. Every self respecting programmer in the industry will tell you that designing your game around AI is incredibly stupid idea; And you could see why with the state this game released.
Not only is it stupid because using AI does not make your game run better (so you still have to optimise it), but also because people on older hardware (or any hardware that does not support AI upscaling) will not be able to even play the game.

With recent patches, the game is now playable without AI upscaling turned on (if you were to turn it off at launch, you had to endure actual slideshow), but the game's optimisation is still rough. I'm forced to play on lowest settings despite the fact that my hardware far exceeds recommended requirements.
Not to mention is that the game often crashes for many people. For me, personally, it happens only when I minimize the game

[h3] Artstyle and visibility: [/h3]

I'm sure you've noticed that this game looks very differently compared to the first one. That's right, now instead of somewhat cartoonish bright artsyle, the game has shifted to pseudo-realistic one. 
Now, don't get me wrong, it would be foolish to say that, on the fidelity side, the game looks worse than the first one. However, with the shift in visuals, the game also lost a lot the first game's unique identity. 

The second game is still carried by it's art direction, but the art style itself was turned into generic pseudo realism. This transition made Remnant lose it's visual identity. Artsyle for the first game was very memorable to the point that you now can import a random pseudo-realistic model from sketchfab, and it wouldn't look too different from the rest. With the original Remnant, you'd have to spend a very long time trying to find something that looks similar in artstyle.
I really liked how R1 artsyle struck fantastic balance between being visually diverse and colourful but also keeping the atmosphere of dying, worn out world.
I bet that in few years you will see people making fake bloodborne 2 trailers and using remnant 2 footage for it. Something like that would be impossible with R1 artstyle, but remnant 2's pseudo realistic style is convincing enough, While From fans are quick to recognise their style, a lot of casual players may be fooled.

While you may disagree, which is fine, there's also one major consequence that came from this. The visibility of the game is a lot worse now.
I really liked how clear the visuals were in the first game. Sure, it wasn't perfect, but in R2 it's difficult to see anything even when there's nothing going on. Jungle world is especially bad at that. The second area is way too dark, with red lighting, making it really painful on the eyes to be able to see anything.

[h3] I will have to post the rest in the comments since Steam has a very harsh symbol limit. Please start on last page, and keep reading upwards. Sorry for inconvinience [/h3]",1695551530,1700637802,False,24,4,0.539759516716003418,24,True,False,False

- Graphics are much better
- Art style seems little different, but in a good way.
- Maps/world are built with more details, and for the time being doesn't feel like just stack of repeated elements

The whole world feels much bigger and lots more to explore, definitely is going to suck lots of time to get familiar.

Haven't had much issue with optimization, but there is some minor bug/stability issue, our host was disconnected completed mid game once and one of us was frozen briefly.

Definitely looking forward to spend many hours and hope to receive more updates and great DLCs from dev teams.

Thanks for creating such an amazing game for my friends.

Update:
Beat the campaign and we pretty much rerolled the adventures to make sure we went through most of unplayed maps and events to have all classes unlocked. A small feedback is that the leveling of new classes takes quite a bit of grind, which makes trying out new builds a little harder.

More content, build diversity is huge, Monster Hunter Level, but its not Monster Hunter, saying this is souls-like but with guns is shallow, Remnant is Remnant, its own genre, that's my opinion of course.

Keep in mind that this game is one of the first to use UE 5.2 without Lumen and the performance is a mixed bag, older GPU before 2020 is struggling, so good luck with your 2017 GPU.

Like I said, build diversity is HUGE, almost limitless... and it can only get better going forward, weapons, mods, melee weapons, amulets, rings, mutators, relic fragments, sadly armor is just armor in this game, its for damage reduction and weight, and if that does not matter, its all about the drip.

Every single run from the first is randomly generated, dungeons are random, and within that dungeon, there's another hidden dungeon, events, injectables they said. Choice kinda mattered in a way but not that ground breaking, its okay, since this game encourage you to play through it multiple times.

Classes is replace with Archetypes, there's more than just 5, that's for sure, have fun finding the other 6 !
On top of that, you can have dual archetypes ! If you played Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, its like that but better here, better in every way, good for us, build crafting got a lot more depth.

Overall, game is awesome for the price, even the Dulexe Edition, that includes 3 confirmed DLC's is worth the price, but go for the standard edition since Remnant's DLC's are reasonably priced for the content it offers.

BUY IT ! 
9 out of 10. Solid.

Improves from a lot of mechanics from the first game, From the Ashes.

Not a fan of the new armor system and would personally prefer the gear set bonuses From the Ashes has, but all of the rings and amulets offer a lot new creative builds.

Boss fights are remarkable and the best I have played out of a souls like game.

A lot of items to chase and secrets to find. 

Matchmaking can be better, but it is tolerable.

The new trait system is better suited for this game instead of having unlimited trait points like in From the Ashes. Trait points in Remnant 2 helps define your build and what your build does. Loadouts helps saves a multitude of different builds the game throws at you.

Excellent game, perfectly expanded on the first one. The game is filled with depth, each campaign/adventure will be slightly different with variant sections of the same maps and dungeons with loads of secrets so even if you come across the same dungeon on a reset you may find something you missed the first time. I found 3 secret areas in one dungeon across 2 runs, literally secrets in secrets.

The game is souls-like, as is the first, although I didn't find it too hard even starting out on Nightmare. I found it easier than the first game, but there is also Apocalypse difficulty which unlocks when you complete the game, this may be as hard as Nightmare was in the first, haven't tried it yet so not sure.

The multi-player wasn't as polished as I had hoped, I felt as though there was delay that shouldn't have existed, with enemies hitting me before their animation showed they would. I fought the same boss as a host and a client and it was noticeably more delayed as a client. If you plan to play single-player there really isn't an issue, but be warned multi-player may get a little frustrating due to the networking.

If you liked the first you will almost definitely enjoy the second, it is less brutal but the new archetype abilities and perks are super fun to mess with, enabling much more in-depth character builds than before.

Currently at the final boss of The Awakened King DLC, it is a pretty good fight so far although I guess it might be different based on what choices you made throughout the DLC. Only downside I have for the DLC so far is the length, I played 6.1 hours of it and I am currently at the final boss, although there may be dungeons I haven't seen and are definitely some items I haven't obtained, it doesn't seem like it would be more than 10 hours playtime to fully complete it. The new archetype is pretty great looking, haven't fully utilised it yet, but I can definitely see some fun builds already.

All in all, I would suggest this game (and DLC) to anyone who likes souls-like games and anyone who played the first game. It truly is one of the best games to release this year. This is also a pretty great gateway into the souls-like genre as it isn't as harsh as some of the other games in the genre.",1700631037,1700631037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To me this a game is like a child who the company( father and mother ) made when it finaly grew up to learn how to walk and talk the company ( fahter and mother ) told the child to go out side and play make friends and when the child finaly made friends ( consumer ) his friends told the child parent( the company ) that thier is some thing wrong with thier child 
( the game ) the Mother and father ( company ) did not care about its child ( the game ) and just told thier child friends to 
mind your own  problem ( the consumer ) that is how i see this game ( that is dark, really dark )  Its fun to play with but at the same time thier is some thing worng with it ( IF THEY FIX THE BUGS I WILL CHANGE MY REVEW )

The gear system is an improvement over the previous one with additional ring slots and gauntlets being separated from torsos for armor. The fact that you can also change what kind of relic you have is another phenomenal change from the first game, with a lot of diversity in how they work.

My one real gripe is that it feels like the devs were scared of powerhouse ranged damage so only a few guns are actually worth using on higher difficulties, everything else is basically useless. Skills and Mods overperform in this regard, with some truly nutty builds out there with bonkers amount of damage being pumped out; if they added in more ranged damage specific items or adjusted the numbers on some guns and rings/amulets then it'd be just perfect.

The story is okay. I was pretty happy with the story all around, it wasn't super invasive or anything but there were certain decisions that were made that are just so cheesy and/or questionable. Some missed opportunities as well. I suppose that since there's 3 total guaranteed dlcs coming out that maybe one of them will expand upon certain avenues that the base story didn't explore, but I still feel like that's first and foremost a very long shot since the first one only expands upon side story business and doesn't relate to the main story at all. I suppose only time will tell.

To finish this off, I really do recommend this game, its a blast to play especially with other people and its already provided me with hundreds of hours of entertainment. If you like difficult shooters, then this is definitely worth checking out, especially since the difficulty tiers made me want to blow my brains out while I completed them all. Veteran is probably the highest difficulty you can go while having dumb fun, but Nightmare and Apocalypse are definitely demanding of a strong build and knowledge of fights/game mechanics. So, you know, be prepared. The replay-ability of the content is quite high since there's a lot of gear combinations to experiment with and people can just be a delight to go on a journey with. You can learn from others, and others can learn from you, and I honestly think that's one of the most beautiful things about this game.

Just like the first game I've sunk a bit under a hundred hours into it -- about eighty at the time of writing -- and have seen a large chunk of the game through two full playthroughs at various difficulties and a lot of adventure-mode content. Here's why this game surprised me though; Remnant: From the Ashes was a good game -- emphasis on good rather than excellent, amazing or any permutation thereof. I've sunk almost a hundred hours into it to get a little over 90% of the achievements just to say that I did and I enjoyed my time with it, but it hardly ranked into a favorite regardless. Remnant 2 provided a much more well rounded experience throughout, and a host of improvements in every single department that has catapulted it into one of my favorite games, and easily my favorite game of 2023. 

Remnant 2, for the unitiated,, is a souls-like that differentiates itself by having a large focus on ranged combat with guns being a strong focal point. It's somewhat more linear than games like Elden Ring, but far less linear than other choices. What makes the Remnant series extremelly replayable however is the level layout; outside of a few ""hub"" maps, much of the content is randomly assembled together. It isn't a crazy amount, but it's enough to keep gameplays fresh and incentivize multiple runs through the same biomes to collect everything, fight every boss and go through every story. Lastly, I have to mention that there is zero penalty for death which I don't always condone, but in the case of remnant encourages riskier plays and really pushes you to just keep going to the next checkpoint even if you aren't completely topped off. This is highly similar to the first game and nothing too new to make Remnant 2 stand out however.

What does set the second game apart however, is in the details. For starters, each of the five biomes are distinct and have their own palettes, styles and overall ""mood"". Some are more fleshed out than others -- but more on that later. The sound design is solid and guns feel impactful, enemy sounds are distinct and immersive, and the voice acting is above average across the board. Weapons mostly all feel really good to use, and almost every choice can viable to take through the game (although you can and will struggle on the highest difficulty if you don't optimize things to death). Lastly, every class feels really fun to use, unique, and with the exception of Archon (more on this later as well), is really fun to unlock. Maps are well assembled, flow nicely into one another, and no biome ever feels like it's going on for too long. Bosses rarely feel cheap (a big improvement from the first) and always reward something useful for at least some builds. All around, there's very little I can say about the core of the game that's negative at all. Personally, I really enjoyed the multiple ""puzzles"" and interactions you can have by repeatting playthroughs -- things like owning a certain medalion you get from one version of the biome into a specific map of another, unlocking a secret treasure room with unique loot. The game is utterly jam-packed with hidden interactions that don't rely on moon-logic to figure out, and reward you with cool, interesting loot, traits and additional trait points.

A few minor gripes however;
- It is far too easy to get staggered halfway to death (looking at you, little spiky jungle balls) with very little recourse if you aren't careful about spacing. 
- Some biomes are leagues behind others in terms of interesting lore. N'Erud feels .. kinda meh in comparison to the beautiful Losomn. Hopefully future DLC adds some more fun in this case.
- Yaesha is kinda recycled from the game. It doesn't feel new if you've played the first and it's kind of disappointing to see it reused this way.
- I won't lie, some builds are just downright overpowered and remove almost all the challenge from the game even at extreme difficulties. The difference that a few missable traits and items can make in a single playthrough is astounding. 

All around, Remnant 2 is phenomenal and a very high recommend from me. It's extremelly fun alone, even more fun with friends, and easily has a hundred hours of content at the time of writing with The Awakened King DLC.",1700624809,1700624809,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The dead giveaway is the fact I platinumed this game and completed all the challenges even went and completed this game on the highest difficulty (which I rarely do for any game) the fact i did so for this game says how much I enjoyed every bit of it. All I'm missing now is my Hardcore run for the game. I can't think of any negative to say about the game but if i were to nitpick is how getting some items in the game relies heavily to RNG and having the exact events, tilesets to roll into your game, I personally wish that were not the case but other than that I'm having a blast with the base game still going through the DLC, and Looking forward to the remaining 2 DLC's for it.

It's still not perfect, and no game is, but it's certainly a game I'd recommend picking up, especially when it goes on sale.  Given the content of the first DLC, I'd also recommend picking up the Ultimate edition just to save a little more money vs. picking up DLC individually.  The game certainly plays better with friends, if you have some to bring, but it's still quite enjoyable solo (and you can always join randoms if you're so inclined).

----------------------------------

Cons:
There is one fixed boss fight (around the 1/3 mark of a story campaign) that I vehemently hate because it's not skill based, but instead feels more like a puzzle boss or quick-time event . . . only one error kills you, no matter what.  Once you know the patterns it makes it a truly trivial, annoying, and tedious matter; but until you fully know the patterns it is infuriating.  Thus, the end result is a loathsome boss fight that I wish was reworked or removed.

Some secrets and event interactions are obscure to the point of absurdity . . . however on the flip side this plays into the greater social aspect where some data is truly meant to be populated to friends, group play, and (most likely) an internet search.

Not everything can be done solo; and on top of that a lot of the game seems particularly balanced towards group play.  While this isn't a big deal for most people, if you are exclusively a solo player it means there is some content you cannot access (puzzles, items, etc.).  Regardless, as mentioned in the beginning, it's still quite playable solo, you're just missing some content and it may feel a little unfair/overtuned at times.

There is some content (items) that cannot be accessed without playing hardcore modes and higher difficulties.  Only mildly annoying for a filthy casual like myself (especially because it doesn't have much that I'm interested in acquiring), but the first game still had the Glowing Fragment store that felt like a better compromise to this concept, as higher difficulties and hardcore mode offered greater Fragment rewards.  However, for anyone that cares, this does not prevent you from getting 100% achievements (as I can directly attest to).

Pros:
The game is loaded with event interactions and secrets.  These will keep you going through adventure runs or giving you reasons to reroll your story mode campaign just to try and find them all.  Whether it's alternate boss kill techniques, specific item interactions, or acquiring a certain relic that requires very specific boss rolls for multiple realms to be in the same story mode.  Some of the interactions are as subtle as new dialog lines for wearing specific equipment when interacting with some NPCs.  As a HUGE boon for the new DLC, they have extended this into the DLC not just via interactions within it, but also via interactions with NPCs and items from the base game.

There is much more build diversity than the first game; and it stands as one of the hallmark improvements over the original.  No longer are build-defining choices locked behind wearing certain armor sets.  Now you can mix and match armor, for aesthetic or practical purposes, with mutators, more accessory slots, and relic fragments providing that special refinement to your build.  While trait points may be limited (the first game let you eventually grind enough levels to max every trait), it actually helps push players in the direction of defining a character and build, rather than just grinding points.  Also, with the purchase of a very cheap item available from the beginning of the game, respecs are unlimited and free (after your initial tiny investment).

Of course the baseline for defining builds, the dual archetype system and all of the choices offered therein actually helps your character feel more like it's playing an actual ARPG ROLE instead of just another variation of the same bullet-spewing character everyone else has.  Whatever you want to play, the system has you covered.  What's even better, however, is how they interact.  You'll get the ""Prime Perk"" of whatever is your primary archetype, along with all of it's other benefits; meanwhile you'll still get the archetype trait, basic perks, and chosen ability of your secondary archetype.  In addition, because of the character defining abilities of your ""Prime Perks"", a character using the same two archetypes can play vastly different just by changing which is the primary archetype.  That decision can then influence all of your other build choices to create completely different characters. 

Most importantly, the developers care.  Nearly every major complaint about the game has been addressed in some form or another.  While it's impossible to make everyone happy, I'd argue that nearly everyone is at least happy with some change the developers have made since launch.  The only major nerfs came from grossly overtuned items, bugs, and unintended interactions.  Everything else has been some kind of buff to bring undertuned items/skills/perks/traits closer to the intended baseline performance of a given slot.

----------------------------------

As a final note, if you enjoy the souls-like concept of play, die, learn, improve, and eventually feel the satisfaction of winning, you can't really go wrong with Remnant 2, or even the first Remnant; and I only discovered that underrated gem shortly before the sequel was announced.

I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the mainline campaign and discovering the many secrets hidden throughout the realms. I still believe there is much for me to discover. 

What's great too is that there is an Adventure Mode that promises even more replayability, and the procedural generation of dungeons and various locations are well done enough to make multiple runs feel like unique experiences. Joining in someone's game could mean a pretty different experience from your own.

The archetypal progression system is a welcome new feature and a second archetype can be acquired in tandem, although it is pretty nuanced to obtain. This is a pretty hardcore game in terms of difficulty, gear building depth, and exploration, so it's not the most friendly game for someone looking for a more casual third-person shooter experience. This is indeed like you've heard many times over, Dark Souls with guns.

I would like to point out however, some of Remnant 2's shortcomings. First and foremost, performance mileage may vary. My RTX2060 gaming laptop runs the game just fine, only with occasional hiccups especially during segments of intense combat. If you have a beefy system, you run the risk of optimization issues. My biggest gripe about this however, is Steam Deck performance. I think Steam is too laxed on allowing developers to implement Steam Deck verification when performance on Steam Deck is poor. Remnant 2 is no exception.

Really the only complaint I have outside of Steam Deck performance is the lack of an in-game chat feature. This is a bizarre game design decision, as matchmaking is the prominent means of multiplayer functionality. That means you will pair with random partners unable to speak to them in any tangible way, but by means of a few emotes and a pinging feature. Why is this? I don't know. I have been told this is a staple of Soulsborne games, but it seems like an unnecessary exclusion from the co-op experience. A chat feature would allow you to communicate during boss fights, talk about points of interest, explain what your objective is, make solving puzzles more efficient, discuss gear builds, or even just socialize. Personally, I'd like to see this feature added.

Those are the only gripes. There is an insane amount of gear building experimentation to do with weapons, mods, mutators, archetypes, and more. I have always enjoyed the unique and weird enemy types in Remnant and there are plenty of different enemy types, some more inspired than others, in Remnant 2. I am always excited to step foot in a new realm or location and discover a new wacky set of enemies. The boss fights are engaging and fun to play, some down right infuriating, but satisfying to complete. (Looking at you Annihilation) Locations are brimming with secrets and things to explore. There is no hand holding when it comes to some of these features. Puzzles are cryptic and obtaining quest items can be very obscure, but I think that's part of Remnant's charm. It's full of mystery.

Ultimately, Remnant 2 is worth your time and a delightful upgrade to the original game. 9/10",1690531548,1700620892,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The worlds are just as, if not more diverse than those of the first game, and the bosses are a truly spectacular step up from an already amazing impressive streak of challenges featured in the first game. 

The game also greatly expands on and explains the lore in a natural way, leaving new players with a solid drop-in point without needing to have played the first game to get the ""whole picture."" (though I would still absolutely recommend doing so as the first game is a great experience)

The build system is so dynamic and intuitive only concern is the lack of load-outs so when it comes to switching things up for a certain encounter it becomes tedious to remember 1 of the a thousand rings I have. I think I really enjoy is the repeatability of the game with the worlds as well as finishing the world and then coming back a week later when I'm bored and re-rolling a tile of the same world to find new stuff is an awesome and rewarding feeling. another great point is that the feeling of exploring or doing something that feels insignificant can lead to you getting a pretty neat item. all in all the game feels and plays great some occasional bugs sometimes my friend does crash randomly but not to often but the only thing to make this game perfect is a loadout system or a search box for rings,1700620795,1700620795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is fun to play co-op with friends, and randoms it can vary with what kind of group you can play with. 
The armor designs for the players vary with a great variety and the level design is fairly concrete in different areas of the game. 

There are a few downsides to the game, where you don't know where you are supposed to go for objects. Another would be not being able to communicate well with your co-op group if you aren't already in a discord call with them. The biggest downside is not being able to put down a marker on the map to show where you need to go for your object. Some of the maps can be confusing with the level design(s). 

Other than that it's a pretty round solid game with endless hours of content and secrets to discover within the game. I would recommend this if you are into looter shooter-type games but with Bloodborne / DarkSouls-like environments.

Very few things to polish, 3 days for it to be out in the open, and it is astonishing, completely inmersive conversations (despite some random buggy stuff with answers being in whichever language or in whichever might be the official Remnant language ;D) , magnificent designs... Incredible job guys, so far soo AWESOME
i just started and i CANNOT STOP ♥

i think for me the normal difficulty was a bit easy but that's probably just me, i felt that there are many more rings than mods at first, but who knows! altho i feel like it's longer than the first game, i don't think it will last more than 40 hours or 50 on the first run.

i suggest to disable the minimap (set transparency 100% in options) and disable health bars/damage display for total immersion, worked wonders for me and u still have the map!
:praisesun:

EDIT - Just finished the game, this was an awesome experience and investment, first run took for me between 40 and 50 hours, enjoying every pixel of every map, getting ready for the next run, re-visiting some places i've already been to check them out should take between 3 and 10 hours depending on the Bloodmoon spawn and all set for the next difficulty!

2nd EDIT! i have played this game for more than 200 hours, and now i can do a short stop, from which i will come back for sure! I've played this game alone in every difficulty, with a 5H1TL04D Of different builds, even one that i just had to... roll? YES YOU ROLL AND YOU HEAL YOUR TEAMMATES! you are immune to almost everything and you even deal damage in area! and yes you keeeeep roolling and doing random shit, yes you need items and to see how to combine those, and thats how magic this game is!

Mutators... such a wonderful thing! but it takes too long to upgrade :'( (they improved since halloween 2023)
in Remnant 1 as someone that under 200 Hours had EVERY gun in the game maxed! and half of the armors maxed too (the other half at +19) i can say that upgrades in this game get a bit expensive, specially at first, but there is no need to upgrade almost anything past lvl 10 even for Hard difficulty (in my oppinion of course!) but seriusly, if u come from Remnant 1 and u see this... mutators might think a lot of stuff, let me summarize: This is a mod on how you weapon (gun or sword) behaves, it goes from level 1 to 10 and when upgraded to lvl 10 gains a 2nd passive, some of which are MINDBENDING!
*Sadly, and at least for now, this is just nuts to farm (i've completed the whole game alone campaign mode around 9 times, some adventures... in multiplayer? the whole game again between 6 and 8 times (hosted by 6 different players some of which repeated ;D ) and some random players that i didn't know but were refreshingly friendly when went into the fight shoulder to shoulder with them!
*Improved already!

3rd Edit!
First DLC Released! and after the event of Halloween 2023.
They just keep making this better and better, the dlc is pretty good specially if you are into this game's lore, very good news, they implemented MANY more opportunities to gain materials to upgrade Mutators which is currently betwween 3 and 5 times the previous amount per run, up to 8 presets that save mods mutators and runes, increased max trait points (85) and added a new role! in the dlc u will encounter rooms from which you already know the name, complete them since ""a few"" things change and yes BOTH ""sides""
Fun thing is that you can play in the dlc while u dont have it, as long as the host owns it buuut you wont keep the items... it's just not that expensive isn't it? =P
Many improvements performance wise have been implemented, gameplay related too... they just keep making things better!

It's a great investment, in fun and challenges for you aand suitable for a group up to 3 dummies like me that love this game to have fun and break their keyboards i mean like to challenge themselves! =D

First the good: The game is very fun, the enemy types are varied, and the bosses are all quite unique, even if some can be a bit frustrating at times. The landscapes are beautiful, and the random generation is a neat gimmick to give you unique experiences on each successive playthrough.

And now, the bad: The random generation can make it very difficult to get specific instances of specific areas, making acquiring certain items very grindy and obnoxious, I personally don't really mind this, but if it would bother you, now you know. The main problem i have with this game, is whatever they are using to process online connections, because it really doesn't work that well. When playing online, if you are not the host, you will have input delay, and a significant amount of lag. At first i thought it was just on my end, because i have Starlink, but the person i've been playing with also tested this by joining other random people through matchmaking, and the connection was just as bad every single time. Statistically, this means that it is not just my internet or his causing problems, it is something on the end of the developers making the game not play as well online as it could, because it was bad for both of us no matter what we tried, and he has fiber internet. The high amounts of lag also cause frame drops for both of us, but i never got frame drops when doing even more to the game when playing solo, so there's that too.

I do very much enjoy playing this game, but it is very annoying to play online when confronted with the amount of lag that the game currently has. I hope it gets addressed eventually, but until then i don't think you should get the game if you plan on playing online more than solo, but playing solo is perfectly fine.",1700616124,1700616124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

More classes
Duel classes
more interesting worlds, that are better designed and have a lot more things to discover.
Guns are more satisfying to use
Skills are more impactful.
Builds are more satisfying to put together
The final boss isn't shit.

It's not flawless, there are no filters to search through the over 100 rings you'll end up with.
I personally don't like the secrets that require data-mining to be done to discover and solve them.
Starting out can be rough as resources are very tight (You can downgrade now at least but you only get half your scrap back.)
Enemy modifiers can combine in ways that make easy bosses near impossible or make some of the mini bosses actually impossible unless your running an ultra broken build.
Farming corrupted shards to buy corrupted weapons sucks fat one.
If Venom could actually just fuck off that would be great.

But, the devs are good, they've implemented load outs and increased the trait cap in response to community feedback.

the TL:DR is. This is a fantastic game. If you enjoy difficulty that 9 times out of 10 is fair and challenging due to good enemy design, and good mechanics.

So the moment I saw the begining of the trailer when the game was beiang revealed at the game show i knew I was getting a sequel to one of my favorite games. I was excited and preordered when i could. However, the game has many issues and i cannot say i recommend the game to any fans or new players.
My game crashes often. It tends to happen the most when there is a boss cutscene so i never get to watch it. The multiplayer is not balanced at all. This is a game to play with friends but when you play with friends the difficulty gets ramped yp so much you cant do anything and lose interest. I have fought a few bosses by the time i write this and have been able to only craft mods no new weapons. Also the bosses are not like in the first one. Some do not count as bosses that give you a boss material. Also they make it a point to have a miniboss in every dungeon that walks around and can kill the team if you do not kill them fast enough.
There are a lot more flaws that i could mention but in the end all i have to say is that the first one is better and that this game does not deliver what i expected or was promised.

1. Runs are randomly generated, don't expect everything to be hand-placed like in Fromsoft titles because it won't be. This includes bosses having modifiers (from health and damage increase to new abilities/teleportation).

2. The RNG nature means the game will not respect your time. For instance if you want a certain ring/amulet, you may be stacking RNG on RNG (e.g. re-rolling your world to have a chance of having an area which has a chance of having an area that has the item you want; re-rolling a world to get two certain zones to spawn which takes 60-80% of the run to confirm whether the zones spawn or not).",1700611937,1700611937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Supplementing these archetypes with their built in traits are other traits you can invest into with points you'll accrue as you go through the game, two guns (one long and one  short) and a melee weapon, 4 rings and one amulet as well as customizable  Estus flask equivalents.

It brings me back to my childhood days where developers actually cared about what they were making and weren't focused on money or deadlines. Each world you encounter will last you an average of 6 hours on your first run, with replayability that will have you going through it at least two more times. There's about 5 worlds for you to explore with more added via DLC. I've logged over 100 hours already just casually trying to collect and level everything. I don't usually leave reviews, but this game deserves it. Hands down my favorite game because the developers are passionate in making this game enjoyable for their players.

[Gameplay]
Remnant was described as a soulslike shooter, and it does it pretty well. There's difficulty modes that caters to varying skill levels so you can find your comfort zone and adjust as you get better. Enemies and bosses are challenging but not impossible to beat as long as you learn to adapt and overcome. Some bosses have really unique fights that will test your mettle. As you progress you will find and unlock many equipment and archetypes (classes) to create a loadout that speaks to you and changes the gameplay to your tastes. If you play with friends things can become even more fun as everyone has their own role to play as well as a few encounters to find. I wish there were more games like Remnant as I can say it is unique in that it does so much right when it comes to gameplay.

[Story]
Remnant 2 leaves off from the first story so I very much recommend trying out the first game which is equally as enjoyable. As per usual souls-like games the lore can be scattered within the worlds via enemies, bosses, books, etc. which you will piece together. Compared to the first game though I find the cutscenes and characters are more prominent so you can get a general idea of what is happening in the world. The story is honestly the only thing that has me a bit ""ehhh"" as it can feel pretty short/simple and didn't hook me too much, but I guess it's still more than what I'd see in souls games. The beauty honestly is within the worlds and lore you discover. Each world also has its own story to tell and questions to be had. ""What happened here?"" is a constant thought.

[Worlds (Ranked High to Low]
-Losomn is what my friends refer to as ""The Bloodborne World"", it has the coolest design and atmosphere set in a medieval style kingdom with a ton of story behind it.
-??? I'll keep this one a secret
-Yaesha brings you back to the good ol' forest world of the first game and has my favorite scenery, cause who doesn't like a land of lush biomes and ruins to explore?
-Labyrinth is a neat and interesting place, pretty simple but the aesthetic is very pleasing and cool.
-N'erud...The story behind it is rather intriguing but I personally disliked the map itself, or at least the overworld. It's an empty wasteland full of annoying monsters. My least liked but I won't say I hate it. Remnant 2 randomizes the map you start in and I'd say reroll your campaign if this is what you get.

[DLC - One True King]
I LOVE THIS DLC. What it adds is so good and very enjoyable, which easily outweighs any possible downside. The only bad I can say is that it reuses a few parts of Lonsomn, but that's why I say it's more of an expansion. It adds alot of extra lore and bits to explore. The new areas are very beautiful and refreshing to see, by far my favorite scenery in the game. The bosses in this DLC are also insane and so enjoyable to fight. My friends and I got wiped quite a few times but we learned and managed after a few runs (and it didn't get annoyingly hard). I'm happy to say the first DLC delivers and I'm happy with the 6+ extra hours of gameplay. 

[Conclusion]
Like I said, I don't usually review games...but this one deserves it. I can't recommend it enough. It's a game made with love and care from the developers. My favorite game that I will always support. I hope you all enjoy it too.

Got Roflstomped.
Would get Roflstomped again.

Negatives: Difficulty scales with weapon upgrades, and explodes in multiplayer. Cosmetic options are lacking, optimization is difficult, impossible to tell if items and interactions work correctly. Melee and special actions are borderline inaccessible for people without lightning reflexes. Some Bosses have one-hit-kill moves.

Positives: Mad cackling when something works. Many screm. The Dakka is Dakka. Great Atmosphere. Great Sound. Good sound cues. Mixing and matching components is fun. Great for groups.

1282100,144050147,76561198040852060,0,4,9537,0,2831,1707635862,"I had gone into this game knowing very little about this franchise or even anything about the game outside of an elevator pitch a friend gave describing this game as souls-like with 3rd person shooter elements set in a post apocalyptic world. Over the course of me playing this game nearly everything I came across, may it be the realms you enter bosses, mods, weapons, and sometimes armor (I wish there was more full sets for fashion purposes and having some more unique benefits but thankfully it didn't detract from my experience) made me more and more hooked with each passing discovery. I have had some issues with performance even with a rtx2080 and needing to use DSLL to make sure my computer didn't overheat (though I'm going to chock it up to me having an oldish cpu which is an intel i7 6700k), but the game for me runs at 60 for the most part on a balanced power setting for my computer and even if it didn't I'd still fully recommend this game. I'll list some detailed thoughts about the game following this, I'm not really the best at describing specifics or rating things on a scale. 

*The asking price of 50-70 dollars is well worth the playtime you should get if you love the game loop of replaying the realms (both with the campaign and in adventures). I've yet to see every encounter or boss yet in the game even 50 hours in and even if you repeat some of them there could be alternate rewards and you still get resources like scrap among other crafting materials so it never feels wasted to do things again. There's also a lot of secrets on top of this, some hiding really good weapons or even classes (I'd suggest looking them up after completing an initial play through of the campaign but I ain't stopping you if you want to get them earlier) so it's always good to be curious about finding secrets or checking things that look out of place.

*I've beaten the game on survivor (the easiest difficulty) and it did still provide some challenge here and there. I'm running the campaign now on apocalypse now and it's really tough/punishing, but I've been enjoying it even when anything could demolish you on a whim if you aren't careful. I'd probably recommend people experienced with souls-like games play on Veteran, and if it's too hard (or easy) you can re-roll the campaign at at any point, you will lose progress story wise but will keep anything you've already gotten.

*Gun play feels great, normal and special weapons both feel useful in their own way due to the mod system and the mutator system really helps to build into how you'd personally prefer to play. While not every mod is insane, I do enjoy experimenting with them and trying them out on different weapons to see which ones pair well with most. You might not see the full extent of it early on since the starting mods are alright, but there are some insane weapon builds you can perform especially with fully upgraded mutators. 

*Classes are all really varied and each feel fun to play (melee feels a little weaker compared to gun play but I still need to play the challenger class). You only start with 4 classes with the remaining 7 being secret classes you unlock either naturally as you play the game or through finding some hard to find secrets that'd feel at home in most souls games. There's more traditional classes focusing on direct combat or through support with providing healing or buffs to allies,
but there's also classes relating to summons, having a dog, focusing on mod energy (which is underselling the class but I still need to get it as of this review), deploying turrets/heavy weapons, running the hell through areas while providing increased material rewards and resources for yourself and allies, and even a class that focuses on evasion and providing decoys to draw enemy attention. That's already a lot, and with each class having multiple active skills to chose between, the game's multi-classing where you can use any two classes you've obtained the engrams for, and adding in the rings and amulets you can equip to further experiment with, there's a lot of opportunities to make great or even weird class combinations that let you play nearly exactly how you want to.

*Enemy combat is fun imo, there's only really one boss I've fought that I'd consider to be lackluster, but overall every enemy and boss has felt enjoyable to learn and I never felt like any single one was unfair or frustrating to fight against. This is the area where I'm not the best at describing what is objectively ""good"" in terms of encounter design or enemy attacks (even with my experience with Bloodborne and Elden Ring) but at the very least I never felt annoyed with anything. Yes, this includes the final boss which was hard but once I got it down it wasn't so bad (apocalypse will 100% test me and I'm looking forward to it)

*Aesthetically this game has some of my favorite locales in anything I've played recently. This isn't a major point but it did really help pull me in as I continued to play seeing the enemy designs and getting to experience the worlds thoroughly and being intrigued by them, even if individually they aren't as in depth compared to other games, but I just thought it was neat.

*Music is great too, Rob Westwood did an outstanding job on this ost and even if you don't play the game at least give it a listen. He's still uploading tracks to his youtube so it's not all on there yet, other people have been posting rips from the game if there's any that's missing that you want to listen to specifically but his masters are extremely well done.

*In terms of things I wish that were better, the overarching story was serviceable but not my favorite, but it was nothing that detracted from my experience as I enjoyed the smaller stories from each of the worlds and was still intrigued by learning about the lore of the series regardless. That and the relic fragment system could be better explained for upgrading them, but otherwise they're still providing benefits so it could be worse there. Hardware limitations might be the limiting factor for being able to play this game, but if you're okay with using DSLL or any other means to help performance, I think it's worth it, and even with DSLL this game still looks great on balanced and even performance mode (just try not to use high performance mode as that does look wonky at times.)

Overall, I think this game is fantastic, I know I wasn't overly critical of the game and this sort of game isn't for everyone, but I'll admit this game feels like it was made for me specifically as it provided an experience I've been missing from games recently like with Destiny which I have nearly 4000 hours in. If you are still on the fence, buy it for $50 since the deluxe armor isn't game breaking, it's purely for aesthetics as those are from the first game and if you enjoy it buy the dlcs by themselves. If this game does interest you long term at all, I still think $70 is still worth the price and what you get since that will come with the dlcs as they release and if they do keep their word about them being the quality of the worlds already in the game, they should be outstanding. As of now, this is now one of my favorite games I've played in a long time and even as a newcomer to the series, I hope other people enjoy it as much as I have.

Update for DLC 1:
I'll give a more in depth review on the dlc itself, but I really enjoyed it. Bosses were fun, the new class has been a joy to play and use with the other existing classes, the weapons and gear they did add were all enjoyable to use (even if some are more niche than others) and I enjoyed the story scenario. I think as a part of the deluxe edition it's worth it, but by itself I can see why $10 might be a little much. It's far from a rip off and for me it was worth it but I'll have to talk more on the dlc itself cause I hit the word cap here.",1691893237,1700603950,True,1,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

NOTES 

*The game has a lot of dialogue which is both very lighthearted in nature and very unnecessary. This is supposed to be dark fantasy / horror, silence is your friend.

*The last boss is a ridiculous dodge fest as well as a visual nightmare i simply cannot be bothered to put myself trough.

Considering my gripes are all very subjective in nature and most people would see what i deem as bad the opposite way,
the game is definitely recommended.

More like Borked Souls with Guns.

I really want to love the game (and there is a lot to love), but there is so much broken bull**** in this game. And before the knuckle-dragging Miyazaki (AKA Todd Howard of the East) simp troglodytes come b***hing at me, I have beaten the game on every difficulty, including Hardcore Apocalypse and I also beat the first game on the hardest difficulty without 99% of the problems this game has. There are so many issues with this game and virtually no one seems to talking about them.

The game is beyond f***ed. Combine some bull**** game design with some of the worst game-breaking glitches I have ever seen in a modern game. Let me list some of them: Final Boss has a glitch in Co-Op where he just will not take damage, like his hitbox just disappears into the ether or something, effectively making him impossible to kill, Adventure Mode on Yaesha has a nasty glitch where you will get Blood Moons (which are very rare, they appear like once every two hours of REAL LIFE TIME), but no Blood Moon Essences will spawn and no hidden trap doors will open despite there obviously being a blood moon present (occasionally they do work in AM but it's very rare for it to work properly so please farm Blood Moons in Story Mode), severe latency in both multiplayer and single player which ends up getting you killed a lot, also framerate issues are a frequent issue in co-op, even if you have a god rig, the game frequently eats inputs in both single player and co-op, frequently getting you killed.

Let me reiterate: I really want to love this game but it is utterly plagued with game-breaking bugs and other bad design decisions. Please wait for a sale or until Gunfire Games fixes the actual game-breaking bugs instead of nerfing things that help players combat the bull****. 

Finally, I LOVE how the Healer is an infinitely better tank class than the ACTUAL TANK CLASS (Challenger).

EDIT: The recent patches have fixed a lot of the issues that I mentioned in this review. It has been improved to the point where I can gladly recommend this game now. I'll edit this review with my updates thoughts sometime later.

If you die you just get sent to the last ""bonfire"" and have to retry the area. Combat feels alright. Using guns feels good and the melee weapons I've used feel impact. Dodging feels great, it is a little worse when you are not the host in multiplayer but I was still able to through attacks pretty consistently.

Plenty of randomization per run to keep things fresh for a bit. After a couple runs it does start to get stale. You start seeing the same areas and you've picked up most of the randomized items. Unless you are going for a full 100% completion I'd say the game will give you ~20 hours to complete the campaign and another 50ish or so hours to see most of the content (like fighting all the bosses, finding all the different dungeons, or beating the game on harder difficulties).",1700601438,1700601438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Graphics, gameplay, boss fights and everything else are just better. (Less adds in boss fights compared to 1st game, more tactic focussed gameplay)
- They added even more puzzles/secrets into this game, it'll probably take a while for community to find every loot and secret in this game. You just miss like 90% of the loot while playing without checking wiki/youtube.
- You need to restart your campaign or adventure mode to find other dungeons&loot. You can't get all loot in one playthrough. Sometimes it takes hours to find a specific dungeon. This is time consuming. If you like that kind of grind, this is a game for you.
- I still miss probably half the loot but for now I can say that most weapons are meh. Weapons with special mods are fun but only when the mod is active. Most special weapons have bad dps, they're only strong when mod's active. Developers will probably deploy a balance patch later on cause the game is new.
- I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs(Started playing 2 days after the launch) But these are problems I currently have and it seems most people have these;
[i] Played on high settings + 2k resolution / PC specs: 3060ti, i5 9400f, 16gb ram, 1tb hdd, windows 10 [/i]

*FPS drops in certain locations
*0,5second game freeze when looting relics/lumenite crystals or other special loot. This happens 50% of the time.
*Similar 0,5s-1s freezes in some boss fights. They occur randomly, not when boss does an ability or else.

[b]TLDR[/b]
------
-Great game(8/10). If they make some weapons more fun, my score will be 9/10 for sure.
-Hundreds of hours playtime cause of randomly generated world and loot. Worth the full price.
-If you like shooter games with puzzles/secrets like Destiny 2, just buy this now. [spoiler] There are some Destiny influenced weapons in Remnant 2 - Atom sword(Black talon), Enigma(Anarchy) [/spoiler]
-It's more fun in Co-op so bring some friends if you can :P

If you did not like the previous game, you won't like this one, but if you're like me, and loved the first, you'll love this sequel too.

Pros:
- High amounts of customization in terms of your equipment and build, with the ability to attain traits individually, slot in secondary classes to broaden your playstyle, and equip your weapons with slottable abilities and modifiers. Your main healing item has varied versions with different abilities now as well, with its own modifier slots.
- High amounts of replayability with the randomly rolled level layouts that you, yourself, can reroll at any given time without risking your progress. You can even roll a separate one-shot version of worlds you cleared, for bonus loot or bosses you might have not fought.
- Art design is excellent. Environments are gorgeous, enemies look varied and cool, as do your equipment.
- Music is borderline surprising in how great it is; so much so that it can feel TOO heroic for some fights.
- Exploration is rewarded, and there's fun side paths, secrets, and puzzles to find and solve for goodies (including entire playable classes you can unlock for your current and subsequent new playthroughs).
- Controls are nice, snappy and responsive.
- Probably the most candid reactions I've seen out of a protagonist ever in this type of multiple-dimension spanning story, and it's bizarrely comforting to see.
- Incredible amounts of worldbuilding, which, considering the theme of visiting a variety of worlds, is just even more impressive.
- Lots of difficulty options to choose from to finetune the amount of challenge you'll face.

Cons:
- Resources can get sparse to come by, and unless you plan on leveling one single set of weapons without ever branching out into others, you'll be kind of expected to do reruns for upgrade materials and currency.
- The story gets incredibly hard to follow as there is a lot thrown at the player, and the game seems to expect at least cursory knowledge of the previous titles. All the visited worlds having their own things going on only adds to the confusion and creates a narrative tonal whiplash every few hours, unless you can at least partially detach yourself from it.
- Game still suffers from ""but what if there were six million adds bumrushing you"" syndrome in a lot of bossfights which still feels a bit cheap.
- Some elite enemies may get buffed to become minibosses, gaining a distinct boss healthbar and seemingly randomly rolled buffs. These minibosses often prove to be worse than actual level bosses, mostly due to placement and the traits making them less a fun fight and more a damage-sponge endurance run. (When a big axe guy spawns in a water-filled thin corridor and spawns rats you can't see from the water, which also makes you unable to dodgeroll, you'll get what I mean.)
- There are reports of performance hitches at inopportune times, though I'm assuming these won't stick around after patches or hotfixes.

All in all, if you enjoy third person shooters and Soulslikes, Remnant 2 is perfect, just like Remnant: From the Ashes was. It can be a hit or miss, but if its a hit for you, then it'll be an extremely long-running, fun one to experience.",1691389231,1700600400,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Much better boss fights.
More ring/amulet choices that are usable.
Much better world design and exploration with creative and interesting secrets to discover everywhere in the game.
Actual class variety (that can be freely swapped mid-game) with multi-classing as well.
Great side-story/dungeon content.
Actually good use of enemy mini-boss variants.

Downsides:

Not too many traits this time with a low trait cap, and no free re-spec (the only thing that isn't a free re-spec for some reason). Having to choose is nice, but I kind of wish you could get a weaker version of all traits to give something long term like in Remnant 1. Especially with some of the very use-case limited like ""movement speed out of combat"" or ""weapon handling"".
No armor abilities this time around (or mutator slots like guns have now), so they are just for basic damage resistances and roll speed.
Only 3 main worlds that actually re-roll, so though there is a ton there, the visual variety throughout the game takes a hit.

The actual main story sucks and Clementine seems like a mary-sue. Ends on a crappy cliff hanger; thankfully the side worlds are much more interesting.

Performance is bad. I have the newest AMD card and it still has some framerate issues.


Neutral:
The post-completion difficulty still just obsoletes too much of the games design with builds...  but thankfully it doesn't seem to give anything, so it's completely for funsies.
Edit: it does have unlocks, whoops. Thankfully, not as obsoleting as I thought. Unfortunately the ""neutral"" stays here, as you need to re-beat the entire campaign in the hardest difficulty, as well as separately in hardcore on any difficulty (cube boss makes this a risky chore), to unlock them all. Not a huge fan of that with how collect-it-all themed the rest of the game is.

Final boss is cool but a massive difficulty spike, and not that fun to fight (also no melee for you melee builds, again).

Re-roll variety is neat, but it seems like there are only two real setups for each world. Still good, but with only 3 worlds it's a bit of a shame.
4 base classes; there are a lot more, but most of them are very hidden. And very late game for some, so you'll only be using them on a new game for sure.


Overall, it's fully worth the price (at least 50 dollars, won't know for the DLC until that happens). For many, Remnant 1 was an average game; Remnant 2 is a massive improvement and an actual great game, and I highly recommend it (single or co-op).

Well, i really enjoy this game so far.

Performance, optimization and the fact that the only fps caps in-game make no sense (that needs to be forced in the Nvidia control pannel) are the only negatives i can think of.

Combat is way more enjoyable and deep.
Graphics, animations, story and overall gameplay are night and day compared to the previous game.

I could only try it 2 hours with a friend in co-op and boy oh boy : It's even better !
It's the most co-op fun i've had in quite some time and am giving my vote in the better with friends to this game.

Keep up the good work Gunfire Games !

Update as of October 27, 2023: The game has received quite a few optimization patches and is now in a significantly better state than when it first launched. At launch I needed to use DLSS Performance mode in order to get 1080p60FPS on even the Low settings preset. This is with tech that is one generation ahead of recommended. Now I can obtain 1080p60FPS on High/Ultra (more unstable at Ultra) while using DLSS Quality. To make that much of a leap in a few months time is good. I can now actually recommend the game to people. Even though my playtime is low, it really is just more Remnant. I dumped at least 50 or so hours into that game, maybe more. My issues now lie in why GfG did not delay the game to now if it needed this extra time for optimization and have an otherwise smooth launch. 

Playtime: 15 hours for the first campaign run. 

But, putting that aside, if they can carry this diligence and momentum moving forward, then the game can definitely surpass it's predecessor. The boss fights are good with interesting mechanics, the game is incredibly pretty, the guns feel good to shoot, melee feels a bit better than Remnant 1, and everything seems well balanced. There have been some massive damage glitches found since this review released, but those were patched.

Some of the bad sides of this game lie in it's boss fights. Some of them are too chaotic and it can be downright aggravating. The final boss is especially notorious for this. It is nigh impossible to actually try to deal damage because you have to constantly look at where the next attack is coming from. Though that seems to be a consistent problem with many of the Souls games and Souls-likes. Some archetypes (read: classes) also feel kinda...useless? One of them is definitely more so meant for farming, but it's also required to be leveled to max in order to get another archetype, which just isn't fun because it doesn't actually do much. It's just, there. My other issue lies with keys. Keys keys keys! Single-use keys! Dumbest crap ever. I understand wanting people to go back through the world again to get the other items, but without a way to give up some sort of currency to focus a specific dungeon, it feels like a huge ass waste of time. I know, I know, explore every corner, but still. That's a lazy excuse. 

My other large issue lies in how this game updates. I know the engine it runs on is the major pain point but I practically have to uninstall then reinstall every update because it requires the size of the game + the size of the update itself in order to patch. And with a 70gb+ game? Yikes...

Update for DLC 1: The first expansion released and is absolutely wonderful. It took me about 6-8 hours to complete. The final boss fight was good. Though I do take issue with the way the boss weapons drop. I think the way they did it was a bit wonky. The new archetype is great for status effect builds, and when paired with a hidden archetype (who I still need to get) + one of the new weapons, I'd imagine you can make some really damn good DPS setups. All in all, I'd say worth it. Especially if you like the world of Losomn it can be a pretty cool expansion to go through. 


Old review start: Good game, requires upscaling to even run properly (extensively tested this). Oh and the devs even admitted it: ""But for the sake of transparency, we designed the game with upscaling in mind (DLSS/FSR/XeSS)."" Skip if you don't meet recommended specs, don't like the look of upscaling, or didn't like the first (as it's more of the same, just polished).

Remnant 2 is my dream game, being an excellent soulslike ARPG that manages to cut out its own niche in a genre that mostly just focuses on the ""Souls"" part of that title. If you want a unique take on the genre made with passion and love, this is a good one to take a look at.

Pros: As mentioned above, build variety is a very strong part of the game. If there's a mechanic that you like interacting with, Its near guaranteed that you will be able to hyper fixate on it to a horrific degree. Want to spend the entire game with an overshield that doubles your health? go for it. Want to poison your enemies to death by dodging? morally questionably but doable. With the release of the first dlc, an item was introduced that constantly hurts the player, which in turn can be used with other items that activate on taking damage to give them infinite uptime. The possibilities are massive with the systems in place, and they tie perfectly into the gunplay, which I don't have much to say about other than it feels nice and snappy.

I also find the world building of the game to be very fascinating. The three main worlds you'll be interacting with, N'erud, Yaesha, and Losomn all take place in unique settings facing their own personal end of the world, and exploring through the areas while slowly finding out about the decaying societies around you is a wonderful experience if you like that sort of thing.

Mixed: This game is very big on secrets. We're talking ""wear a very specific loadout to unlock a hidden door to unlock a secret subclass."" kind of stuff in the worst case scenario. Personally, I love that stuff, and the developers have stated it was designed to be solved via dataming since thats a part of the community you won't be able to avoid, but if you're just wanting to go through it on your own while still wanting to see as much content as possible, it can be frustrating when you find out you needed to learn algebraic theory in morse code in order to get  the final piece of a build you're going for.

Semi-combined with this is gear progression. Levels being randomly generated means that theres some items you just won't see during a playthrough. The game emphasizes multiple runs through an area, but if you hate that kind of thing then its not going to be very good.

Cons: While I said I love the world building, I can't say the same for the main story. Its... written? I think? An integral character from the first game shows up at the start, sets the plot in motion, and then just disappears for the rest of the game. Unironic ""I must go now, my people need me"" kinda of deal. The rest of the main story has to deal with two other characters magicking up a solution to the earth's apocalypse while you go and stumble through some other worlds. There's interesting lore implications, but anything approaching character depth has no time to flourish and is incredibly shallow. 

What doesn't help is that alot of writing for human characters is written like marvel characters. Very quip heavy and irreverant, which can work for some characters but when its shoved in your face can get annoying fast. Its mostly just a problem in the opening section, but there is one character that is really hurt by it; the player character. You can only take so many ""Pretty. Yeah, I don't trust this place""s before you lose it. There's a decent amount of voice options, but I can't help myself from wishing that there were fewer voices with unique personalities.

Despite these problems, I do still find Remnant's universe (universes?) to be highly engaging. I love this game, and I am excitedly awaiting to see where it goes in the future.

your basically stuck with putting them in spots like the generic starter ones for +max hp and a few of the traits you get for ranking classes to 10

In [strike]brief[/strike] summary, if you are directly coming to the game after Remnant: From the Ashes, you'll find a good handful of things familar, and foreign at the same time.

-Armor no longer has set bonuses or any benefits at all attached, side from armor rating and weight, not unlike traditional souls / souls-like titles. If you aren't fresh from Remnant: FtA, this is basically a non-issue, but for veterans used to throwing together armor sets, or cobbled pieces of several sets, its a bit jarring, especially considering that Leto's Armor has been downgraded from armor that basically gives you enough poise to rival [i]Havel the Rock[/i], let alone [b]surpass him[/b], into armor that just, makes you belly flop with minimal upsides, there is a disconnect. Of course, maybe there's a way to turn that into a positive with trinkets or a certain archetype, but I've yet to find that for myself.

-There is a hard cap on trait points that can be attained, est.. 65. Under most aspects this isn't important, since traits in Remnant: FtA, while powerful, merely acted as backdrop bonus utilities to supplement extra damage absorption, or stamina, or an extra source of crit. There are 50 traits in FtA, and each can be leveled to 20, giving you a whopping trait level of [b]1,000[/b]. This sounds powerful, yet remember, traits only go to 20. As a result, you can reasonably get your preferred traits maxed before extra ones you encounter in say, the Corsus and 2923 DLCs. [i]Backtracking back to Remnant II however[/i], since the maximum trait limit is 65, part of the character building process turns into a min-max perspective. Do you [i]really[/i] need that extra stamina? Is that extra little investment of Mod Generation really gonna help?
 
Admittedly, thats the main two gripes going from main game to sequel, but I will throw in one more caveat for the record; [b]namely, that campaign is now slightly random on initial and subsequent rolls[/b]. Specifically what this means, is that you have a chance to be initially sent to not just one linear campaign start, but rather potentially [b]3[/b].

If you are like me, saw Challenger at archetype selection and thought, ""Ooh hey, Scrapper returns from FtA!"" and then went through the rest of the lil prologue only to get thrown into N'Erud, where all the initial enemies are hovering robots, who fire homing projectiles that are very much capable of stagger-juggling you until a Specter spawns in, and, having spent all your attention on these flying Apple products, get one-shot killed in a small cinematic (which I'll admit, is kinda cool if you experience it by accident/underestimation).. well, that's how the road got paved I guess.

I got over that slump with careful consideration that the guns Challenger started with, were [strike]absolute dogs***[/strike] simply not meant for that zone, and proceeded to buy the LMG from Brabus, solving basically every problem since that point.

Oh, I almost forgot as well. This is the first game I ever bought, and played, which caused my GPU to cycle its fans hard enough to generate enough lift to act as an Amazon Delivery Drone. I have never seen any other game spike my card's temperature to 80 Celsius. Consider that a warning if you have a 3090 or less.

TL;DR - It has a weird stink that makes going from the first remnant to this difficult, mind your graphics settings, and do not pick Challenger as your starting archetype unless you're willing to gamble you get a starting point in campaign that suits it well, and do not, under any circumstance, f*** around with enemies you do not understand, cause you will undoubtedly find out.",1690958745,1700597192,False,3,2,0.520990133285522461,0,True,False,False

The game is fun. Solid gunplay. Movement might just be a tad bit slow. If a few enemies get too close you might just end up stunlocked.

Developers seems to nerf quite a lot of fun builds. But they tell you that they want you to be powerful. I don't really feel all that powerful against bosses.

Story is fine. The beginning started off pretty rough with some hilariously bad dialog between main character and the NPC.
After that there really isn't much added to the story. Things happen but it's just MEH and you just have fun blasting enemies.

There are a TON of stuff to find too. Secrets, puzzles and Music puzzles. I don't like those music puzzles because I can't read the tone for the life of me.
Youtube has all of the answers though.

As for the DLC. It's a re use of Lonsom area. Not my most favorite area to be honest. Several sewers to go through as well.

The combat is awesome. The ability/classes + weapon mod system is nice and gives you quite a lot of choices. It just feels fun to shoot a fire tornado at the enemy and destroy them with it.
Even some of the boss fights are quite interesting(not all of them tho). And i had the most fun playing it coop with my friend. I would say it is actully one of the better coop games. The story in the 3 different worlds are also quite interesting(not the main story sadly) and i think the areas look very nice.

Now i am coming to the bad part... This game made me so mad sometimes. Not because of difficulty or combat. I was mad because of the absolute stupid RNG in this game + annoying secrets.
I actually like secrets in games and they are quite fun to find out sometimes but i think they overdid it here with the secrets.
After i finished the campaign with my friend, i went to the wiki to see if i missed things. And there is a lot of stuff you will miss just because of RNG because some items and zones don't spawn always. I gonna be honest...i dislike this RNG system a lot. I saw items that would make my build so damm good but farming them was the most horrible experiance i ever had.

And to top it all off they hid one of the most fun classes behind a datamining challange(from what i read)???
It took me hours to get that class just because you had to lvl other classes for it as well. And you had to farm specific items for it. I also just wanna mention that one of the classes needed is also hidden behind a secret that requires you to have a special weapon. I can't believe they would hide such a fun class behind so much horrible grind. Basically no normal player will find this class unless they google a guide. I think hiding a class like that is stupid in my opinion. 

What i want them to change:

I hope they change how you get this class in the future for other players.
Because a normal player who just explores a lot will never find this hidden class without a guide.(trust me you won't)
I think they should add a system that makes random world drop items more likely to drop the thing you don't have yet. (because who wants to reset a world 20+ times just to get 1 item)

Aside from that... the main story was kinda lame. It didn't feel like a victory to kill the end boss. But the rest of the game is pretty nice.

I would recommend buying it when its on sale.",1700555836,1700593745,True,1,0,0.517025530338287354,0,True,False,False

As of this writing I have solo'd the game on apocalypse and done about 90% of the content excluding the new DLC.

Pros:
[list]
    [*]Significantly more depth to the buildcrafting system compared to R1.
    [*]Unique bosses that are generally fun to fight. There are some really cool fights in this game. The final boss is probably the coolest fight I have ever seen.
    [*]Secrets are scattered everywhere so exploration is fun and rewarding.
    [*]Lots of different tile sets which require several play-throughs to see everything.

Cons:

I love the class system and the ability to dual class really makes it feel like you're really customizing your gameplay style.


My only con for the game is armor sets. My favorite part of the first game was the ability to use the set bonuses to make some really powerful builds. Armor feel kinda lackluster in this game. from not being able to upgrade it, to there being no set bonuses on them. (at least so far I have not noticed any.) Guns still get the ability to be modded, upgraded, and now adding mutators to them. Yet armor just get some resistance stats and armor values and thats it... 

but thats my only issue so far. 

combat = great
lore = amazing
maps = Bigger/ visually pleasing
dog = you can pet the damn dog and have it kill for you. need I say more?

-It takes everything that the first game has to offer and improves on every single system. 
-More randomized levels, bosses and item drops. 
-More involved secrets inside of each area
-Classes that can be changed at any point during the game
-Amazing level designs.  I caught myself saying ""Whoa!"" more than I would like to admit.
-Randomized experiences through levels and item drops.  Different final boss fights and secret areas each time you play.  
-Engaging boss fights
-Several progression systems.
-Difficulty selection so hard that normal mobs kill you.  
-A huge expansive campaign and an adventure mode on top of that.  It has the End game.
-Amazing voice acting with a huge in depth story.  They could write novels on the game.

This is much bigger, much deeper and with more of a AAA feel over the original.

The inventory needs the ability to do some type of sorting/searching - especially rings, amulets, and runes.

If you want a casual / difficult co-op souls-like shooter to play with friends, you'll like this game. Combat (for the most part) and gameplay as a whole are very good with worthwhile exploration and a good aesthetic. DO NOT EXPECT GOOD CHARACTER WRITING. 8.4/10 will play it again with the dlcs.

For context, I played through to the ending co-op on nightmare difficulty. I'm going to say mostly negative things in this review but I want to preface this with I did genuinely enjoy the game and believe their is more good than bad and by a large degree, but the bad stuff is pretty bad...

Co-op, Difficulty and Builds. This game has some of the most penalizing scaling I've ever seen. Google up the chart for scaling to see exact number but as an example on nightmare difficulty, non boss monsters have 2.5 times health but do 3.5 times damage, this basically makes all but armor builds very difficult and niche. I understand that this is the harder difficulty but this isn't even the hardest difficulty and its not a problem of me 'getting good', it just means that you are effectively exempt from using builds because you can be stunlocked into being killed from regular mobs. Weapons suffer from scaling as well, a weapon that would otherwise be viable is gated from being not leveled up. Resources in your first 2-ish play throughs will be scarce as you can only upgrade 1 weapon at a time and you don't have a good idea as to what weapons will be found throughout the game without looking them up. And to make leveling weapons even worse, the game scales with the highest level of your weapons and classes, meaning that if you find a weapon you are not only doing less damage because you haven't leveled the weapon up, but the enemies also scale with how strong the weapon you just stopped using. Bosses luckily don't have their damage scale as much as their health scales but that's because they have higher base damage, causing you to die from full health using the tankiest build possible at certain points in the game because of stagger. All of the damage you take and the way that upgrading weapons works punishes you for trying anything new and this trend continues with classes. Co-op seems to increase enemy health and damage, but I have been unable to find out the amount.

Classes and XP. When you pick a class, the game doesnt tell you that you get the weakest skill and have to spend up to 10 hours in game to unlock the third skill in the class, you dont get to pick what you want from the beginning and you have to just deal with having the weaker ability and less attribute points. Farther into the game you will find more classes and want to use them but have to go through the boring process of leveling it up which will require that you give up something like 10-40% of your weapon damage and use likely a less interesting ability so that you can unlock the one you actually want. 

The writing. oh..my...god... Without using spoilers, I think a developer inserted their OC into the game and made them them the macguffin for the plot, and because its not a plot heavy game, that means that about half the story is just about this npc being magically important for basically no reason. The world has very good lore and some of the side characters that are ""unimportant"" are the more interesting characters. I would also argue that the established lore and story from the first game is effectively retconned into being mostly irrelevant which personally makes me angry at basically all of the writers for this game that had to do with the overarching story of Remnant 2. The writing is by far the worst part of the game by a big margin.

Combat. Remnant 2 has this problem where youre supposed to dodge animation windups and not attacks. When you see an enemy thats the size of a school bus, you would inherently thing that they have slow large attacks or ranged attacks, players will expect this without knowing they expect this, the enemies do not do this. if an enemy has a big sword and slams it on the ground, you would naturally think that you have to dodge the sword. In Remnant 2 the giant sword has no weight in animation, the windup is longer than the swing for arbitrary reasons, if you were to swing something, it is impossible for the swing to take less time then the windup, but not in remnant 2. If you look up a video of the final boss, the windup for their attack is 2-3 times as many frames as the actual swing, with the swing being roughly 100 milliseconds and the duration for I frames in your dodge is about 300-500 milliseconds, meaning that you dont dodge the attack, you dodge the windup animation. This seems like another ""get good"" situation but this does have negative impact on gameplay, with enemy design requiring you remember attack windups and dodging attacks by reaction becoming arbitrarily more difficult, you are effectively required to be hit by an enemy to learn how to evade them, meaning that its not actually a ""skill issue"", its more of a ""remember this thing after you see it"" issue.",1700490799,1700490799,True,1,0,0.484052538871765137,0,True,False,False

If you're a souls-like fan (I wasn't until I played the first Remnant -I love guns) this will be right up your alley. 

Only complaints I have is the cheap trick the first game DIDN'T have with enemies constantly spawning behind you, even though you checked. It's frustrating when you are focused one way and then get swamped from behind out of nowhere. (If that's just how souls-likes are, oh well) Also the damned random horde attacks are irritating at times but does make the game tense and lively with enemies. 

Aside from those complaints, the game is TWIN BARRELS of FUN. Alot more variety, bloody obscure mystery weapons, mods, and items, the devs are constantly updating, improving and tweaking things and the story is fun.

Having owned Remnant From the Ashes since launch on Xbox, I wasn't sure about the second. But after playing it, it took everything about the first game and dialed it up to 12. classes *actually* matter now, due to having skills/powers/perks that can only be used while they're equipped. That alone is a massive game changer. But in terms of the world as well? absolutely massive in comparison to the first. Like the first it's semi-open world. You can't really do things out of order like a Bethesda game, but there's enough loot and hidden rewards that exploring is absolutely worth your time. There's also much more variety in terms of relic and build options.

couple major ""downgrades"" vs RFTA, however:
    You can't max your traits like the first game. there's a trait point cap. so spend wisely. thankfully they can be reset with a consumable that's fairly inexpensive (for the late game it's built for, the mats are pocket change). So no god mode with maxed everything like you can in FO4, for example.
    Armor is no longer upgrade-able. You get what you get and that's that. Haven't gone into any re-rolls yet, but you're only able to upgrade your weapons this time around. They have added the ability to downgrade weapons/items however. So no more +14 hunting rifles you never use anymore, can downgrade to base level for 100% mats and 50% scrap and flip it into that new toy you picked up.

Pro-tip - Your starter class doesn't actually matter much at all. But if you're going to be playing solo, your best bet to start is the Handler. That fur missile will come in clutch during the boss fights (and can be leveled to unlock an improvised medic ability with passive AOE heals, albeit slow)",1700377353,1700377353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The puzzles are interesting because I think it's dynamic so you are asked to commit more of your attention to solve it. A vague message might asked you to find a certain building for example, and there is no indication as to which building is the correct one. I like when games respect your ability to puzzle solve, even thought that puzzle just ends up being find 3 glowing numbers in the room. The variety of weapon types and builds, if we also include the different classes and multi-class, are staggering. The weak part of it is just the armor part because only the weight of it matters. It creates this weird contrast where you have all of this options to slot your weapons and healing items but there is no love given to the armor customization. I was expecting armor specified for medic to increase the amount of healing or something but alas. The combat is amazing and the boss are all very unique. Although the biggest star, in my opinion, is the different worlds that you get to explore semi-randomly. All of them are beautiful and different in their own way. My favorite is the Bloodborne dimension, a victorian looking city filled with twisted villagers, huge rats, and a ghostly figure roaming around. What is cool is that the boss that you encounter and their drops are also random, meaning that you could not completely see the story of that dimension in a single playthrough. You are incentivized to either do multiple playthrough or help other people in their dimension. The fact that the developers made something that might not be seen by the player if you only played it once is cool to me. The only big problem that I can think of is that the narrative is all over and I don't know what to feel of the story by the end of it. Definitely ignore the story and come for the gameplay.",1700374126,1700374126,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly one of my favorites.
Vast improvement over the first Remnant, that was also a great game.

The good:
Great variety is zones and dungeons that are relativity randomly generated with expected repeats.
Branching story and dynamic choices make multiple playthroughs a must (in a good way).
Loads of meaningful secrets to unlock new gear, classes, areas and more.
Difficulty feels fair most of the time, you find yourself adjusting play style to the world and your gear.
Healthy variety in builds, mods, traits, classes etc, builds have a lot of depth.

The not so good:
Gun handling is solid though not the best I've ever played.
Melee combat is/was more a meme, many mobs/bosses you can't kill with melee.
Lack of an actual jump is disappointing, maybe Remnant 3 will have a jump.
Inventory management can be frustrating with no quick reference. Such as the dozens, maybe over a hundred rings that you have to mouse-over each one to know what it does.
Armor is pretty bare bones, not a lot of option and you can't modify or upgrade them.

After you unlock most of the gear and areas the game can get pretty grindy, but that could be a good things so you have something to keep doing.

Playing with friends is great, though the added scaling on the mobs is very high. Would not necessarily say the game is easier with friends.

There's way more

The game isn't stupidly unbalanced when playing with friends too. Early on, I needed my co-op partner to use less upgraded weapons to not overpower everything, but after a few hours of play, you upgrade your guns, find cool items, gain new abilities and any balance issues went away. This seems like the kind of game that will go on sale fairly regularly, definitely worth a purchase.

I adore these kinds of games that don't punish you for playing how you want to play. It's just as fun to play on your own, level up your items, guns, abilities, etc, then have a friend join and just keep playing. There's no ""Oh, but I'm level 500 and you're only level 5, so we can't play together"".

The first few hours can be confusing, and the first characters you are introduced to are the opposite of interesting, but it all kinda goes away as you explore the different worlds and characters and you figure out what you're supposed to be doing, and which characters are worth listening to and which characters you should embrace your inner iPad baby within during.

Archetypes are a great idea, they just take way too long to level and good luck leveling them if you're max level because the enemy scaling in this game is ridiculous. 

I came back to try the DLC and Jesus Christ they put 50 trash mobs in 1 room that can 2 shot you (because armor in this game is a joke) and are just damage sponges. I'm playing on the third highest difficulty, but I'm using my max level build.

With that said it's still a pretty good game! Kyle and I absolutely loved the first one and I think we both liked this one still. There's obvious flaws but there's also new skill mechanics that make it unique and enjoyable. It didn't capture us as much as the first game, I mean we play that one 3 times through and this one twice. 

The first one's story is pretty engaging, this one is uh, it's passable? Don't get me wrong it's not bad, it's just not really gonna tug on you in any way.

If you want dumb fun though with some friends this is it, I think this series has an almost perfect vibe to it and I love playing it with Kyle. Whether It's because the game is good or Kyle just makes things more enjoyable idk but overall a good time.

This game reminds me of a time where games were meant to be enjoyable, and not the borefest triple A games have become lately.

This is clearly made by people who love videogames, and not by those major companies wanting to squeeze in as much microtransactions in their 'game' as possible.

The shooting feels amazing, the character progression is insanely good and deep with lots of options to create an unique build. So Many amazing itens and unique weapons to find.

The only downside I have found so far is the main story, which is a bit of a letdown. Each unique world you visit tho, has a really interesting story and characters.

This is a rare disease which if you hadn't guessed it already is gaming specific attention deficit disorder. I'm cursed to hop from game to game to game, never completing a title and only sampling the potential experiences that lie beneath the purchases that fill the depths of my bottomless library. 

I've accepted my fate living with this disease. One day I mindlessly purchased this game as I often do scrolling through new releases. If a new release has passable reviews, then it's going to go into my library. It's just the way it is.

Installing and opening Remnant II... something happened that I never expected. My fried receptors in my brain started firing off endorphins in numbers that I've not experienced in years. The last time I felt something like this was when I popped a pill that had a pokeball imprinted on it that I was slipped shadily at an electronic music show. 

Needless to say, I've completed this game and I'm fully intending to complete any subsequent DLC that is released from this point forward. It's a ""game-changer"" as one might say.

Everything about this game exceeded my expectations and provided me an experience I had long given up on receiving from a modern release.

I have never been able to see the full ending of the game, because the game either crashes, or I lose connection to the coop session right when the credits start (there is a cinematic after the credits). the game itself is excellent, but you cannot play with other people for very long. It will disconnect you, and it seems to do it more frequently with the final boss. I do not like fighting the final boss because you CAN get into a state where the boss is invincible, and even if you all kill yourselves it will not allow you to reset the boss. My only guess is you have to restart the game, but then you lose your team. I have beaten the final boss at least 5 times, but never get the item reward to craft the final weapons because it crashes during the final cinematic. I see it grants me the items, but when I go to the crafter I do not have them after I restart the game. I have beaten the final boss on survivor, vet, nightmare, and Apocalypse but do not have the weapons for beating the final boss.

PLEASE FIX AND TEST YOUR DAMN GAMES. I have an NVIDIA 3090 graphics card, with a 12 gen intel i9-12900K processor. So it is not my computer.


[u] After updates [/u] 

Still crashing or disconnecting during or after finishing the final boss and NOT GETTING THE REWARDS FOR BEATING THE BOSS ON APOCALYPSE. Beat it again on apocalypse twice in coop sessions with all 3 people surviving and the game crashed when the credits came up. Even though the game said Quest complete, and showed we got scrap and trait points, it still did not give us the rewards at the vendor. PLEASE FIX. A prior coop session the game crashed when the boss did its slam attack, which we were also close to beating. It should be easy to see that I have now beaten the game on all 4 difficulties and still do not have the rewards for beating it even after every Vendor to be sure.

--After the Awakened king DLC

I reinstalled the game after taking a break due to the server instability, and I am still getting disconnected at the end of the game when the credits start :/ I beat the last boss 3 more times after the patch, on nightmare and 2 times on Apocalypse, and still do not have the weapons, amulets, and rings in the shops for beating the game on both difficulties :/ I have the traveler archetype, so somehow it was able to unlock that even though it crashes, but is unable to give me ANY OF THE IMPORTANT GEAR!!",1690938687,1700184761,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you liked the first game chances are you are going to love this one, because the devs have gotten everything good about it and greatly improved upon it in the sequel.

There is a dual-class system which in combination with the amulets and rings allow you to build differently depending on your preferred play-style. You can be pure dps ranged, summon minions, blast your way through with spell-like abilites and mods or even go melee. You can even build as a tanky healer that heavily supports your team-mate and still be able to dish respectable damage due to the clever perk system. You have active and passive skills, mods, mutators for your guns and melee weapons, rings and amulets with passive skills/buffs, traits... you name it.

There is healthy variety of mobs, elites and bosses that are carefully crafted to fit in each of the different biomes, all with different attacks for you to learn to master the combat. The bosses really shine when it comes to variety of attacks and mechanics, and provide nice challenge on higher difficulties. 
 
The levels are masterfully crafted, there is quite deep lore and history to all the worlds which you can piece together from NPC dialogues, interactions with notes and item descriptions. There is a lot of replayability due to the random nature of the level generation where certain items or events might or might not spawn and some items might be used in different ways to get certain loot. World bosses can be killed alternatively similar to the first game so you can get different loot in forms of weapons and mods, which is a strong incentive to replay certain biomes. The Adventure mode is an excellent way to target-farm items without resetting your campaign progress, or just to visit again a favourite world if you need some variety.

The co-op play is fantastic, as a guest to your friend's game you do not share campaign progress due to the random nature of the level and quest generation, but you fully share the loot. You can have a random event spawn in your world and host for your friend to have the associated loot and vice-versa since every world has one of two main quests that will lead you through different paths and on top of that there are the random events and dungeons that might or might not spawn on this playthrough. I was a bit sceptical at first since I am not a big fan of random generated  content, but the devs have actually implemented random generation extremely well here.
