although i enjoy the game from time to time, cannot recommend it to any new buyer.

the developer has taken too long to develop and expand on actual additions to the base game, such as weapons, vehicles, and maps. the developer has also not developed the supposed core feature ""conquest"" since its release.

the developer is relying too much on the modding community to build his game, neglecting adding things to the game. the most recent thing to be added would be a 'story' feature, although it seems that it's more-so for modders to make their own story, or for said modders to make missions for the developer.",1708017187,1708296741,False,0,0,0.434782594442367554,5,True,False,True

This game is an absolutely incredible low poly tactical fps with great guns and modding support. This game is still in early access which leaves room to grow, i personally feel that most early access games are much better than even triple A titles with huge development teams, you could have a team of 1,000 people with no passion at all versus 1 person a lot of passion and love for their community and the 1 developer would win just for their heart alone. Believe it or not i would much rather play this than Call Of Duty or Battlefield. I think 20$ is a very fair price for this game and would buy it in a heartbeat if it ever was took away from me. This game has a few expected bugs such a performance issues and etc. but they do not effect gameplay. this game has brought me lots of joy over these 3 years and I would absolutely buy it!

Like i know they spent a long  time... and I'm not gonna rate this negative... but i will put it out there that they take a long time for updates. (why does steam think I'm is an incorrect spelling.)

Edit 1:  (like two seconds after i posted the other paragraph.): Ok so I’m gonna describe this game now. This is a fps sandbox  AI game. The graphics are meh but in my opinion its better for this game because the maps are HUGE and the AI is really advanced. So like its good but the original part of this review was talking  about  the update, which is my bad i should  have said something  more, but  its true.

[Strike]OMG I HAVE TO STOP COMING BACK TO EDIT IT TWO SECONDS LATER, anyways, Edit 2: HOW CAN I NOT SPELL REVIEW RIGHT EVER ALWAYS HAVE TO USE AUTO CORRECT!!![/strike]


Edit 3: I realize that ""im"" is incorrect but its in correct grammar not spelling. I went back and fixed all the ""im"". I also changed all the ""cuz"" to ""because"", just to make it less joking. Removed ""Edit 2"" because it was dumb. I turned on comments because apparently it wasn't on. I want to put into context, I don't like how long updates take for this game. The updates can take up to a year. Like the game is cool but please put out updates more often. This is kinda the only game that I don't like the updates for, the update that took a year was unfinished and the campaign that it added was not very good in my opinion. As of February 4th 2024, the only other update was a bug fix so I'm really sad that this good game is being updated at the rate it is. Also mods are good, by good I mean, if you want to get more that 50 hours in this game you have to at least download like 20 mods.

Edit 4: Sorry, I forgot to mention that they added custom missions after like 6 months so it was updated like about six months ago (this is as of the same date as the last edit).

I play this game since the Beta, and when your game is fun even in its very early stages, you know you got something good.

The world is yours to shape in Ravenfield, and with mods you can truly feel the game's potential. Will it be Star Wars ? World War ? Modern Warfare or Vanilla blue and red dudes everywhere ? Yours to decide.
Many perspectives and fun in sight, except if you don't want a FPS game, I guess.

Currently waiting for the Conquest mode, the idea is interesting and it can bring some serious stuff in a world that was very goofy until now (these square people from the Beta, love these guys and their ragdolls).

I spent so many years playing the free [i]Ravenfield Beta 5[/i] (which you can still download for free [url=https://steelraven7.itch.io/ravenfield]here[/url]!) and that was so much fun. One of my favorite things to do was go up to people trying to get on ATVs and whacking them with a wrench (comical ""thwack!"" and all), watching them as they flail about on the ground.

So when I finally got my hands on the up-to-date Steam version, I was taken aback even further. This is probably one of the most polished FPS games I've ever played to-date. And I think that says quite a lot about the care and dedication for this project. I'm assuming it's just one guy, which only makes this all-the-more impressive.

[h1]This is a game about shooting bots.[/h1]
There is no vanilla online mode apart from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1104390/Ravenfield_Multiplayer_Mod/]a multiplayer mod separate on Steam[/url]. However, this mod seems dead and might even be outdated.

But not to worry. You [i]will[/i] enjoy the bots in this game. I'll be honest, I absolutely suck at PvP games. I've always been better at PvE and co-op stuff. PvP games are often littered with hackers and tryhards, especially since games care more about competitive play rather than casual nowadays. So I've always loved bots in games. Unfortunately, bots have been lacking in a lot of games for a long time. You can play stress-free as well as just ultimately screw around as much as you'd like (flashbacks to [i]Counter-Strike: Source[/i], messing with the fun bots and console commands, or large scale battles on [i]Unreal Tournament '99[/i]), and they're great for training yourself too, especially when the bots are well-implemented.

While there [i]is[/i] a work-in-progress campaign of sorts, the basic [b]Instant Action[/b] modes are still great, allowing you to choose between various game modes that determine how to score a victory. You can change what types of vehicles and weapons each team can have as well as their infantry skins, and can use various mutators to change how the game plays. You can also set how many bots you want (I don't think there's a limit, because you can literally have [i]hundreds[/i] of them), as well as how evenly split you want the teams to be (defaulting to 50:50, but you could even set it as far as 100:0 or 0:100 and have all the bots on one side). From large scale wars to tiny island battles, the world is your oyster to play however you'd like to.

The bot AI is fairly good for what it is. Relative to bot standards in general, I'd say it's exceptional. Of course, while they can only do so much, they still get the job done superbly, and they're satisfying to fight against. [i]Ravenfield[/i] focuses on bots quite a bit, and while some games and gamers alike will dislike offline bots, [i]Ravenfield[/i] wears its badge with honor.

Vanilla weapons feel really good to use for what they are (they lack reloading sounds as of the time of this review), and it's hilarious pressing TAB to go into slow-motion and watch the bullet you fired sail across the map and into an enemy's head, especially if it's while they're on a Jeep or ATV so they get ejected off the vehicle.

Where this game shines especially however, is its mod support.

[i]Ravenfield[/i] has [i]Steam Workshop[/i] integration. This allows for creators to make all sorts of content, ranging from maps, weapons, vehicles, skins, mutators, you name it. There are plenty of videos online that showcase weapon packs that are [i]Call of Duty[/i]-esque in quality, particularly in animations and sounds. There are tweaks to make the gunplay more realistic and satisfying, as well as QoL changes to make the gameplay itself more fun. It's entirely up to you how you want to go about things, whether its simple vanilla tweaks, or total game conversions. Go nuts!

[h1]All-in-all, [i]Ravenfield[/i] is a great game that provides hours of fun and content, as well as limitless replayability with all of the things that you can modify.[/h1]
If you're unsure about this game, give [i]Beta 5[/i] a try, linked above. It's free, and while it doesn't have much content compared to the full version (for obvious reasons), this version definitely still gives you a general idea of what to expect (and hey, the blocky dudes in this version have a charm of their own), and will still give you a lot of fun.",1705497609,1705497609,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,True

If you enjoy the Workshop scene for games like Gmod, such a community of creators exist here in Ravenfield as well providing a plethera of new maps, vehicles, skins, weapons and more to engage with (recently Scripted Missions.)

The main issue with Ravenfield currently is that talking about said mods, they can cause the game to easily take minutes to initially load up, making having a lot of mods as much of an annoyance as they can be a source of enjoyment. If a new system can be created that can significantly decrease the loading period during the beginning, that would make the game much better.

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter. Stir in sugar until well combined.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add this to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.
If desired, fold in chocolate chips.
Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs (not wet batter).
Allow the brownies to cool in the pan before cutting into squares.
Serve and enjoy!",1633032465,1704432542,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ravenfield isn't a complete game, which is a good thing because of the strong modding community. The game is clearly built to be modded. And at the moment (Jan. 2024) its not campaign based, although the rumor is it might be at v1.0, it is an instant action game. If you don't like instant action games or want a campaign or mission based game, than the current Ravenfield isn't for you, but it sounds like you'd like v1.0. if you add to the game with mods you can get all sorts of fun moments. btw the AI in the game is amazing make no mistake your not playing this game with a group of minecraft villagers you playing with legit teamates.

1. **Accessible Gameplay:** Ravenfield's straightforward controls make it easy for players to jump in and enjoy the action without a steep learning curve.

2. **Large Scale Battles:** The game excels in delivering large-scale battles with AI-controlled soldiers, providing a chaotic and immersive battlefield experience.

3. **Modding Support:** One of Ravenfield's standout features is its robust modding community, allowing players to customize and enhance their gaming experience with a variety of user-generated content.

4. **Single-Player Focus:** The single-player mode offers engaging bot-driven matches, providing a satisfying experience for players who prefer solo gaming.

5. **Diverse Maps:** Ravenfield offers a range of maps, each with its unique layout and challenges, adding replay value to the game.

*Cons:*

1. **Limited Graphics:** While the game's graphics are serviceable, they may not meet the expectations of players looking for cutting-edge visuals. Ravenfield prioritizes gameplay over high-end graphics.

2. **Lack of Storyline:** Ravenfield lacks a deep narrative, which might leave players seeking a more story-driven experience wanting.

3. **AI Behavior:** Although the AI is generally competent, there are moments where enemy and friendly AI actions may seem predictable or lack strategic depth.

4. **Limited Game Modes:** While the game provides entertaining battles, some players may desire additional game modes to diversify their gaming experience.

*Conclusion:*

Ravenfield is a commendable first-person shooter that shines in delivering accessible and enjoyable large-scale battles. Its modding community and single-player focus contribute to its longevity, despite some limitations in graphics and narrative depth. If you appreciate engaging combat and are open to community-generated content, Ravenfield is a solid choice.",1703860375,1703860375,True,2,0,0.519535362720489502,0,True,False,True

I will admit the base game just bare bones is not all that fun. It gets old very quickly and isn't the most polished thing. Although this game can be turned into whatever you want with mods.

Since 2017, it has served as a steadfast sandbox-style battleground for me, particularly enhanced by the diverse mods available. Even on my modest low-end Dell, churning out a ""smooth"" 20fps, the game has been a source of enjoyment during my late adolescence, thanks to titles like these. I highly recommend it, especially for those seeking additional content through the expansive Steam workshop. It's worth noting that, despite my nearly six years of play, my recorded time on the game is only 60 minutes. This discrepancy arises from my initial experience with the pirated version, I downloaded and played the pirated version, on occasion re-downloading an updated beta. Originating from a developing country, allocating funds for gaming was initially beyond my means. Moreover, lacking access to credit or debit cards made physical currency a more practical option for my family. However, with the positive changes in my circumstances, including a well-paying job, I've made it a point to rectify this by officially purchasing the game, thus making this purchase my first-ever online purchase. I want to express my gratitude to SteelRaven7 for creating such an engaging experience, and I extend my sincere apologies for resorting to piracy in the past.

Ravenfield, at its heart, is simple as heck. Blue-clad soldiers called Eagles who somehow bleed blue blood (where'd the iron go?) fight red-clad soldiers called Ravens who actually have iron in their bloodstream. There is no real lore excepting for some tidbits which can be inferred from map details, there is no campaign, and no real reason why you fight. ""We're here because we're here because we're here because we're here...""

However, the game really proves its worth when you look on the Workshop... with enough mods (and trust me, there are [i]plenty[/i] of mods to choose from), the game can become pretty much anything you want. Download some items from the Vanilla+ series by Sofa, Erazer, Dustron, etc. and the game becomes a modern-day combat simulator. Download the [i][b]expansive[/b][/i] mod that is the WW2 Collection and you can play battles really from both World Wars. In my honest opinion, Sofa's Second Leersog War collection is a must-have: a quite immersive completely fictional world, adjacent to our 1930s, with enough lore to have two Fandom wikis (one official, one community-made)! Another advantage of these mods is the concept of 'what-if'. You want to see Caesar's Legions charge a trench full of Waffen SS soldiers? Sure, do that. [i]Someone[/i]'s probably made almost every skin out there imaginable...

The process of modding itself is, from my experiences, a somewhat steep hill to climb in terms of learning curve, requiring use of Unity as well as Blender, though the game does have a (somewhat limited) in-game map editor. Skins are, in my view, easier than weaponry.

To put it simply, Ravenfield is a simple game with simple mechanics and simple gameplay, until you visit the Workshop and load your game to the point of crashing with 400+ mods (been there, done that) and transform it from a cartoonish shooter to an alternative to Battlefield I, complete with callouts and HUD.

In the shadows of a war, shrouded in despair,
A pure white soul, a boy unaware.
Soldier in innocence, in a war undefined,
A genocide's echo, in the corridors of the mind.
Blackened data, veiled in obscurity,
A tale of horror, in the kid's purity.
Friends and kin, erased from the tome,
In the silent cataclysm, a soul to roam.
Bloodstained battlefield, where innocence bled,
In the war that wasn't, the young were led.
Hundreds fell by the pure white hand,
A young lad's heart stained in the barren land.
Comrades lost, in the crimson tide,
Silenced screams, on the war's cruel ride.
A voice forever muffled, cannot articulate,
The tragedies witnessed, a heavy weight.
In the dark of night, a knife's cruel embrace,
A dance of blades, in the shadowy space.
Stabbed and forsaken, in the war's cruel snare,
The young soldier fled, escaping the nightmare.
Waking in silence, in a sterile bed,
A hospital room, where dreams have bled.
Rejoining society, a semblance of normalcy,
Yet haunted by echoes of a blood-stained legacy.
A tragic narrative, etched in the youth's gaze,
Innocence lost in a war's wicked maze.
Unspoken horrors, locked in the heart's cocoon,
A pure white soul, bearing a war-torn tune.
For the small soldier, the tragedy untold,
A tale of bloodshed, in memories enfold.
In the fabric of society, a thread so frail,
A magic pure white soul, a tragic tale,
A letter to send, wounds to mend,

I find immense enjoyment in this military-themed shooter game. The time invested here parallels the hours spent in combat scenarios within the vicinity of Pisngqiu, a small village near my hometown of Zinquai, accompanied by my faithful hound, Sereghetti.

Among the various maps available, my personal preference leans towards Archipelago. Its depiction evokes memories of our troop engagements during landings, reminiscent of operations in Taiwan.

However, regrettably, I find the campaign within the game to be lacking in quality.

Ravenfield is a very fun game, to put it simply. I think my hours speak for themselves. However, it really is the modding community which gives this game it's unlimited replayability and without mods I would have stopped playing ages ago.
Modding support has always been good and has improved since I started playing with updates introducing mutators and ravenscript making all kinds of things possible. Updates used to be fairly regularly but have gone dry recently ever since EA 26 dropped. I have no idea when the game will be completed however it's clear that Steelraven7's vision for complete Ravenfield has far surpassed it's original goals. Strangely enough, despite 26 large content updates, the store page doesn't seem to have been updated since the game's initial release in 2017 and the planned completion date still says 2021, which hints at Steelraven's disregard for moving the game beyond early access. Despite this issue the game is definitely worth it's price. Improvements to Raven field would be a complete campaign, weapons with switchable fire modes, the ability to switch sides in game, better mod support for custom game modes and of course, some form of  multiplayer. However, if you know anything about this game you probably know we will never get an official multiplayer. In the meantime, I recommend RavenM instead of Ravenfield: multiplayer mod for the best multiplayer experience: https://github.com/iliadsh/RavenM",1589561726,1702463040,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

You can play vanilla Ravenfield with no issues, other than the weapons feeling a bit boring after a while. But if you take a look at the hundreds of mods in the workshop, the game begins to evolve. You can turn Ravenfield into pretty much any other game through some of these mods, or make your own. The ability to add in almost anything to suit your needs makes this games so fun to play. The vehicles, maps, and the ragdoll physics made this game such a great experience. One of the best parts of the mods is the fact that SteelRaven has actively tried to make it easier to develop mods for this game, meaning almost anybody can make what they want.

There's a veritable boatload of Workshop content as well, backed by a passionate community. I prefer to keep the game vanilla+, but you can turn it into any kind of shooter you want. You can even design your own maps in-game, something I've spent an unhealthy amount of time doing. Sky's the limit. 

And if all that wasn't enough, it's cheap too. If you like FPS games but don't have good internet for multi-player games, then this is a must-have.

It's okay but I think you are still better off just booting up the old Battlefield 2 with bots.

Can download a bunch of decent mods from the Steam Workshop, players have made recreations of maps from Battlefield series and other popular games like CS. You can also get some custom skins and weapons on there.

Needs a seperate download of a mod to play multiplayer with friends as it's unfortunately not directly built into the game, luckily it is available through Steam so it's super easy to install and keep updated.

Ingredients

200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa)
175g butter, plus extra for greasing
120g soft brown sugar
100g blanched almonds
2 tbsp cocoa powder
a pinch of salt
4 large eggs
150g self-raising flour
100g fudge
Crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream

Method

Preheat the oven 160C. Break up chocolate, put it into a food processor with butter, sugar, almonds, 1 tbsp of the cocoa powder and the salt and whiz until smooth.
Add the eggs, on at a time to the processor and add the flour, whiz again until smooth.
Butter a deep baking dish (approx. 25 x 25 cm) really well and sprinkle the remaining 1 tbsp cocoa over. Shake it around so the cocoa light coats the dish surface.
Pour the cake mix into the dish. Break the fudge into pieces, and sprinkle over the top of the cake mix, pushing larger chunks into the mixture.

It's better than all multiplayer games I've played,i sometimes play it as if was Warthunder,or enlisted or any game you have played,plus since it's offline no lag,cuz thats a huge problem lol,but don't download to many MODs in workshop or the game will load a little longer,also some MODs may have weird glitches so it's not the game.and i would recommend watching more map,or vidoes on mods on Ravenfield,their are some good Close quarter maps and big maps including weapon's,if you're thinking about buying this game before any other game,don't,buy this first,you will feel like you just walked into a donut shop and a hot cop offers to share her donuts with u...a magical experience you will feel,trust me.


Update-
This game IS GREAT FOR MAKING EDITS :D
and this game will spark some nostalgia for me,and i have noticed that the mods get better and better each month,maybe each week or day,but the vehicles are crazy looking aswell as weapons.No complaints,this will be the best game u will have in ur steam library.",1684223698,1699075312,True,20,1,0.638034522533416748,3,True,False,True

[b] Ravenfield [/b] is still up for 7 years despite being early access and rarely update due to single developer are ongoing working stuff, fixing bugs and adding content to the game.

Singleplayer madness with amount of decent game modes, maps, weapons, vehicles and set the amounts of bots AI to battle around endlessly. But some of the best highlights are:

Getting trade-kill by either grenade or rockets
Destroying the enemy helicopter with Nitro Express
Spamming a f**ktardly ""The True Patriot™""
Spamming a sh*t tons of grenade in CQB maps or Operation Metro from Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4
Making ""spaghetti man"" feature by using a correct weapons or the game itself
Spawnkilling Coach by using Fat Man from Fallout series at the last sector during matches while in Battle game mode
Crashing helicopters or planes together by it's either friendlies or enemies
Use rocket launchers or shotguns as a ""Sniper Rifle""
Teamkilling moments by your friend after threw the grenade or fired any explosive weapons
...And list goes on!

The game always support Steam Workshops has sh*t tons of mods to play around in case if you're boring with a base game vanilla. Like more guns, more maps, more vehicle and literally anything else to download it. (Mind the RAM tho if you are downloaded too many of them resulting affect the gameplay and your computer too)

So if you are fans of Battlefield series or MANY of you are stuck with the current state of CoD or OW2?

But damn is it fun.

Pros:

- Extreme moddability (I'm talking like Garry's Mod level)
- Large and talented modding community
- Game is approachable (no blood, gore, or swearing)
- Solid FPS shooter, has leaning and bullet drop
- No steep learning curve
- Infinite replayability
- Decent graphics
-Worth the price

Cons:

- Lacking a lot of features that other FPS games have (I understand it's in early access, but come on)
- For example: No bullet penetration
- Game seems it would be perfect for a little destruction, but you can't even destroy bushes
- You can't shoot the pilot of a helicopter, you need anti-armor
- AI is good mostly, but is sometimes really stupid

There are a ton more things that I haven't listed here, but all things considered I give this game a solid [u]7/10[/u]. If you're looking for realism or an epic experience, go play Battlefield.

My personal favourite version of Ravenfield is, and due to this version, always will be, Beta 5. The real fun of Ravenfield was it's lack of realism. no one can just scale a sheer cliff, rifle in hand, and sit atop a mountain and pick off opponents like burning an ant hill with a magnifying glass, and no one can survive falling down that same mountain when you inevitably get hit and plummet to the bottom again, yet in Beta 5 you could do that, and it was hilariously fun, in the same way you could fall from the top of the sky box from a helicopter and get up without so much as grazing your knee. 
Yet all of that is gone in this version. You can no longer climb any incline greater that about 50 degrees, and falling off a machine gun platform is enough to damage you. That alone makes this a vastly inferior version which I need no more than 25 minutes playtime to tell you. But it gets worse than that. Now the helicopters have flares, so the entire advantage of the Scalpel guided rocket launcher is null and void, your one guaranteed shot becomes ""best I can do is maybe"".
Now, I understand that the point of all this is to make the game more realistic, but here's the thing. If we wanted a realistic or simulator grade FPS, we wouldn't be here. We'd be on PUBG, CS:GO (rip) COD, Halo, Doom, or any other FPS you care to name. Ravenfield's appeal was, and always will be it's blatant ignorance of the laws of physics, and the exploitation thereof.
And just to add insult to injury, one of the greatest additions to the game, mounted weaponry, has more than enough disadvantages to make it something I would only use if I had exhausted my carried ammunition. What good is a mounted machine gun, with only 180 degrees or rotational arc, with absolutely no cover whatsoever? The infinite ammunition is cool, but the reload time (which doesn't show up on the HUD btw) makes it painfully slow to use, and with no armour of any sort, you'd be better off with the RK-44. At least that packs a punch with a lightning fast reload, and you can still move.
And as for the AA cannon, well. Pathetic, would be putting it politely. Great against Helicopters, yes, absolutely. Entirely unaffected by flares, and efficient. But do you really expect me to believe that unloading it into the side of an armoured vehicle at point blank range will take SIX full magazines to disable? That's absurd. I understand that the armour is thicker, that's fine, but they are (or appear to be) 20mm cannons at least, possibly larger. That's more than enough to take out a tank that's 30 feet away from you, but nope. Also doesn't even one-shot opponent AI on the ground, so that's nice.

But enough of my ranting and complaining about how this is definitely a step backwards, let's get on to some good things about this game.
Weaponry: Absolutely outstanding. The new weapons and possible loadout configurations are incredible, and I cannot fault them. I've yet to attempt finding any secret weapons, but I swear to all that is holy if the gold wrench is gone I will have a fit.
Vehicles: The updated skins are incredibly well detailed and a joy to look at, and the addition of the tanks being amphibious is a nice touch. Again, the lack of ability to climb any angle steeper than 50 or so degrees makes the quad bike a lot less fun to use, but hey ho.
And the addition of planes is just brilliant. As a seasoned War Thunder player, I can certainly say that planes are a great asset to this game, and they're basically the only thing I have left to look forward to trying out in this game, now that basically all the fun stuff has been stripped clean away in place of the usual generic FPS gameplay that we came here to escape from.
Named AI: Genius, absolutely love it, and hilarious that you can even give them the ability to complain if you TK them.
Naming the bases: Finally, that took long enough. But another step backwards being the fact that you can no longer choose which one of them you spawn at.
The updated HUD: Sleek, tidy, no bells or whistles. Does what you want, when you want it. (Except for a reload timer on the mounted MG's)

In summary, Is this an enjoyable version of the game? Yes, just about. Is it a *good* version of the game? No, not really, and if you want to play Ravenfield as it should be enjoyed, download Beta 5 from Itch io.
This game started out as basically a giant paintball battle, with little to no regard for physics and gravity, and it really should have stayed that way. We don't need flares on the helicopter, we want to shoot them down. We don't want to be standing at the bottom of a cliff, ranting that we can't climb, we want to scale them like a deranged goat.
This was not a traditional, realistic FPS, and that was it's appeal. It gave us something different, something new, something that was familiar to pick up, but different to play, and it worked so well. And now look at it.
And on a closing note, whilst the ability to change the skins back to the blocky cuboidal humanoids of old is an incredibly nice touch, I do miss the introductory flyby of the helicopter that the game used to have.

Final word: Do I recommend this game to people who enjoy FPS games? Yes. Absolutely.
Do I recommend it to people who enjoyed Ravenfield Beta 5? No. Absolutely not with every fibre of my soul. 
Cling to the old for as long as you can, because the new makes nothing but a mockery of it.",1697492781,1697493261,False,2,0,0.4196891188621521,0,True,False,True

1. Commanding each individual team, not the whole army
2. Joining teams, not making them by pressing G to each person
3. How different sometimes between ground texture and objects texture
4. No multiplayer ( community made MP is dead i guess ) but MP is optional
5. Missing settings for bots like health, classes, behavior
6. No mini map 
7. The bots sometimes just grouping in one place not enough fluid decisions
8, Bots sometimes can snipe you from other side of a mountain but can't see you when from just 2 meters away
9. Etc.

The core gameplay is what makes the game worth the price. its fun and chaotic. also this game has workshop that adds more content to the game. for those who wants to enjoy playing casual battlefield game, this is the game for you and this game is quite heavy actually. for low end systems maybe consider playing with around 30 - 60 bots.",1638270627,1696836053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It still looks/feels very rough, with minimal function/working everything. Feels like a long-in-the-tooth Roblox game.

There's a lot of various baffling things in this game that make it frustrating to play.
A few examples:
-almost non-existent options to communicate with squad (if playing with bots/AI)
-your respawn location at times will not be where your own troops respawn at, and you can't change it.
-enemy AI will use vehicles to their advantage, whereas your units will ignore available vehicles
-enemy AI is practically at an ""aimbot""-level whereas your units just spray and pray
-enemy AI will advance, whereas your units will hang back firing wildly
-if you go into water and come out, or exit vehicle and come out, your character will re-ready your weapon but waste time ""reloading"" when it's already loaded. (In one battle, I snuck behind enemy and went to ambush them from behind, but due to this stupid extra, senseless and waste of time animation poorly placed, they get the drop on me first)
-enemy AI seems to have omnipresent knowledge of player location
-enemy AI seems to single out the player (as mentioned your own troops spawn elsewhere and you spawn in middle of nowhere, well, several enemy units skipped attacking my team and went right for me like 10sec after I spawned) 
-when a match starts with bots/AI, everyone spawns except the player, who spawns last
-extremely limited options of weapons in matches

Ravenfield can be credited with popularizing low-poly battle games. Yet, several years later, it's still ""Early Access"" and not much has changed. Maybe it's time to call it finished and move on to a Ravenfield 2 or something else? Or will this remain as feeling like an ""unfinished classic""?

It's worth checking out if you're into mods. There's a huge ton of them. That's where you'll find the most interesting things as modders have made custom vehicles, weapons, you name it. But don't expect to see much in the way to those some how magically being ""better"" when the core issues and jank remain as they are.

The developer has been slacking off for a very long time on this game, just last year he went on a ""ski trip"" that lasted for many months. He just now only came back and barely pushing out tiny updates every few weeks or so.

Yes this game is fun (after it has been modded with a few dozen mods)

To be honest, this game is reaching its end pretty fast with the new unity pricing changes, but the community will continue to back it up saying that ""progress is being made"". No it has NOT, the push from EA25 to EA26 took a YEAR and the only major update made was to upgrade the Unity Engine version, honestly a joke that people still defend this game and the developer saying that this game will be done any time soon (in the next decade perhaps).

The main reason is that it can reproduce and emulate many different videogames genres. In fact, with the appropriate settings, you can:

1) stand in a corner of the map and command your troops, possibly, to the win
2) get out on the battlefield and have a ""standard"" all-out war experience
3) easily and quickly install some of the most crazy mods from the Steam workshop and solo defeat the enemy army, Rambo style
4) defend some key points on the map from hordes of enemies
5) choose a map and stealthily complete 3 random objectives
6) play the campaign mode, which lets you avoid battling altogether and just focus on conquering different objectives on the map, much like Risiko.
7) all that is to be added: to this day (30/08/2023) Ravendfield is still in the alpha stage of development

Ravenfield, to me. is the ultimate single-player sandbox FPS where you can create anything out of it. An ultimate framework for tactical-theme arcade shooter and the ultimate toy box you can have fun however you wish. The real fun is coming from your own creation. Modded weapon and assort of maps from different era that doesn't really fitting together but fun to experience nonetheless. It's one of those game you came back every couple of months to check out the mod scene and have some light-hearted fun.

So imagine my surprise when instead of keep their focused commitment and working hard to bringing more fun ways to play and expanding the framework. They... spend entire year working on a linear campaign. Instead of keep working on Conquest, a unique mode that no game has done it since 2004 Battlefront 2. Or finishing up the game and do this whole campaign thing elsewhere. They decided that it's too difficult and instead spending their entire year working on a fan-fiction of their own fantasy military LARP. And you can tell this game was never build to be that kind of game. The update was out a few days ago. I tried it. And as i expected, It was full of jank mostly coming from its own sandbox nature. 

I will never understand what drove the creator to shift their own vision toward something else. This is something noone ask from this game. They want more toys to play around. Not your fan-fiction. And i wish he did that to something else and leave this game the way it is. To me, this is like that time when Midnight Animal turn itself from becoming a bad-ass Hotline Miami spinoff to Persona-lite rip off about 'love and lost' or whatever. You are killing your own fanbase by attempting something that work against the game itself. And for that, i decided that the creator has lost his own vision and thus, it is no longer worth a recommendation from me. 

It remains to be seen what lies ahead of this game. But the way i see it. Unfortunately this is where i leave the negative review and decided that the vision of this game and what i wanted from it is no longer aligned. Thus prompting me to move on from the game itself. And that is a shame.",1694861866,1694861930,False,10,1,0.563466668128967285,0,True,False,True

I am the sole guardian to my offspring, who is now in his 140th cycle. My progeny received this simulator for the Galactic Celebration in 4021 from his guardian-kin, so we integrated it into his neural interface and he began simulation. By the end of the week, he had 24 cycles immersed in this simulator. This concerned me, as it was already challenging for me to engage in shared experiences with my offspring, as he is always exploring virtual realms or absorbing data streams. So, I decided to create a Neural Link account and access this simulator to see if I could perhaps synchronize experiences with him. 
I initialized the program, calibrated my mech and environment, and commenced the simulation but was unsure of the mission objectives. I sent a data query to my offspring for guidance, and he established a co-op simulation for me. It was exhilarating, marking the most meaningful synchronization I had with my offspring since my partner went offline. 
This simulator has, since then, bridged the distance between me and my offspring, and now we even share moments outside the virtual realm. This experience reminded me that joy can be found in every simulation, and it has encoded many treasured memories for both me and my offspring.",1692953260,1692953260,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

WW1? Sure!
Modern warfare? let's do it
Dogfights? Sure
Tank battles? oh yeah

Steam workshop is seamlessly integrated with the game so you can quickly begin to build up your database of stuff to use in game, weapons, soldier skins, new maps, new tanks, apcs, jeeps, airplanes, everything

You can then easily set quick to use configurations so you have custom modes available.

I have a preset to quickly set me up with weapons and vehicles from ww2, ww1, modern, etc.

Perfect canvas for those looking for a fun single player military option and the AI is quite decent + you can add as many bots as your machine can handle.

Sadly, the game has really gone downwards, the dev recently released a new update after roughly a year of no new content, and all it adds is some story/campaign tech demo no one really asked for.
I mean seriously, i'm willing to say most people bought this for the singleplayer sandbox elements, you fully abandoned the thing that makes your game unique, and you waste a year doing fuck-all only to pump out a mediocre mission template?
And on top of that massive layer of disappointment is the fact that the update breaks 90 percent of workshop mods.
You know, the one thing that kept this glorified zip file of lost potential alive for the entire year.
(Also seriously, those anime eyes are disgusting)

Edit: Mods luckily haven't been affected that much, mostly a couple hud mods that broke, but my opinion remains unchanged, cut the story nonsense out, if I wanted to play story focused missions i'd play COD.",1690818843,1692285729,False,9,0,0.49537968635559082,0,True,False,True

stuff that ive done using mods/mutators:
-spec ops/milsim missions
-ww2 d-day invasion
-dogfights in fighter jets
-strafing/bombing runs in an a-10 warthog
-invading a vietnamese camp in a stealthy way with a custom squad RoE and formations mod
-forest warfare (very fun if you find a good map)
and a lot, lot more.

the only thing id really suggest for the game is multiplayer support but at the same time you wouldnt be able to use mods unless the other person downloads the same mods as you, and it'd be areally big hassle so im not expecting it and i dont think its ever coming in the future, but even then playing with ai is still so fun",1592362356,1691399724,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The developer, SteelRaven7 has done very little in terms of updates in relation to the amount of time this game has been in early access. From what I understand it´s just one dude putting work into the background stuff like AI behavior, UI, and gameplay coding but that's no excuse for the lack of meaningful progress for the game. What really ticks me off is the fact that the only glimpses of actual passion and progress in content for Ravenfield have been made free of charge by the community. I´d like to point out a content creator for the Steam Workshop in particular, a dude named Sofa. He has single-handedly put out more content and lore for this game than the actual developer. In the time that Sofa has made at least 3 content packs; including tanks, apc´s, helos, skins, maps, etc. SteelRaven7 has updated his horrible models a total of 2 or 3 times max. 

I find the sheer number of positive reviews baffling. There is basically nothing to do in the base game with the limited number of maps, weapons, and vehicles. It doesn´t even have achievements to unlock to at least compensate for the time and money people put into this singleplayer game. Hell even a multiplayer mod was community-made because SteelRaven7 didn´t even bother trying to implement it.

The one on itch.io is Beta 5, at the time of writing, we're on early access 26, but the beta is still very fun nevertheless.

As for the game in this state? It stops being fun after a while but what keeps me coming back is the workshop, without it, the game wouldn't be what it is.

Also something I should note is that I'm able to run this game on an old lenovo x240, that's a laptop from 2012... It's not 60 FPS and the quality is... decent. I enjoyed it more on an actual gaming computer!

While I didn't find many maps like this, you can find minigames too ^^

The battleground was a chaotic symphony of destruction - ""pew pew"" - as energy weapons unleashed their deadly force, claiming lives and leaving devastation in their wake. Each faction was driven by a thirst for power and an insatiable desire to conquer the other.

Through the long years of conflict, laughter had become a rare sound among the soldiers. The once vibrant spirits were now worn down by the never-ending cycle of violence. The cost of war weighed heavily on their hearts, but they couldn't see a way out.

Countless battles had been fought, and the casualties were immeasurable. The landscape had become scarred with craters, and the ruins of once-great cities bore witness to the futility of their struggle.

In the heart of the Red camp, a weary warrior muttered a hollow ""haha"" as he watched yet another attack being launched. The laughter held no joy, only bitter irony at the absurdity of their situation. Each victory only fueled the hunger for more conquest, perpetuating the cycle of destruction.

Across the battlefield, a Blue soldier sighed heavily as he saw his comrades fall one by one. The constant loss had taken a toll on his spirit, but he couldn't bear the thought of surrendering to the enemy's relentless onslaught.

The leaders on both sides were too consumed by pride and stubbornness to consider peace. They held on to their beliefs that only by vanquishing the other faction could they ever find salvation.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the battlefield glowed with the eerie light of the moon. It was a haunting reminder of the countless lives lost and the countless more that would follow.

In the midst of the chaos, a young Red and Blue soldier found themselves facing each other, both barely old enough to be on the battlefield. They locked eyes, and in that moment, they saw the reflection of their own pain and suffering.

""Pew pew,"" they exchanged shots, but as the battle continued, something changed. Their hearts were heavy with grief, and they no longer saw each other as enemies, but as fellow victims of an unending war.

With a sudden realization, they dropped their weapons, ""Haha, isn't this madness?"" one of them said. ""We fight and die for what, exactly?""

The other nodded, tears streaming down their face. ""I don't know anymore. But I don't want to fight you. I don't want to fight anyone.""

Their decision to stop fighting rippled through the battlefield. Red and Blue soldiers hesitated, unsure of what to do. But the message of peace slowly spread, and war-weary warriors from both sides began to lay down their arms.

In a moment of collective understanding, they decided to end the endless war. Their leaders were furious, but they could no longer ignore the cries for peace from their own people.

United by the desire for a better future, the Red and Blue factions turned away from the battlefield, leaving behind the wreckage of their past. It was a small step, but one that held the promise of breaking the cycle of endless war and finding a path to coexistence.

I can confidently say whether or not a new update comes the game just is not it.

It has some pretty unappealing and lackluster gunplay, no real kick to the guns or people dying, whilst it is funny the first few times the ragdoll system is just really ugly and unsightly to look at as people flop around like fish or fly fifty feet in the air, in one of the base gamemodes conquest, enemies can spawn on contested flags which is another lengthy discussion of how that not only makes such fights the worst but a slog but that is my additional point.

The A.I I feel isn't smart becuase of the high bot count, The A.I is just straight up not good and the game lags regardless even on a high--end machine I upgraded to to play games like this one.

The artifical intelligence will run into eachother, run past eachother stand around and not shoot, they seem to actively go out of their way to be useless on the side of the allies and outstandingly frustrating on thje side of enemies, your squadmates will fail to land any hits but ai on the enemy side can casually use snipers to take out just about anyone, no one will take cover, no one will use vehicles and transport more effectively then crashing right into the combat zone and killing everyone with the wreckage.

And the dogfights are horrible because missiles are quite literally programmed to be undodgeable, you need to use flares which brings up the bigger issue of flares being an annoying counter the ai constantly use a gazillion times.

All in all the core foundation of the game sucks, needs improvement and more advanced features to make me actually feel like im fighting and not just having a dumbed down gmod npc battle with the artificial intelligence of a source engine crow.",1690943625,1690943625,False,4,0,0.491553783416748047,0,True,False,True

This hidden gem packs a punch with its unique mechanics, entertaining gameplay, and a brilliant concept that captivates players from the get-go.

One of the most appealing aspects of Ravenfield is its modest size, as it doesn't take up much storage space on your device. This allows players to dive into the action quickly without worrying about clogging up their hard drive.

The game's mechanics are a delightful blend of fun and chaos, and one standout feature that sets it apart is the inclusion of friendly fire. The hilarity that ensues from accidentally firing upon your own team adds an unpredictable element to the battles, making each match a thrilling rollercoaster of emotions.

Despite its low-poly graphics, Ravenfield manages to create an immersive environment that instantly draws players into its world. The game proves that you don't need photorealistic visuals to deliver an engaging and enjoyable experience. The focus on gameplay and design over hyper-realistic graphics sets Ravenfield apart from many other titles in the modern gaming landscape.

Moreover, the concept behind Ravenfield is sheer brilliance. The game allows you to engage in epic and intense battles with AI-controlled soldiers, creating a dynamic battlefield experience that keeps you on your toes and your adrenaline pumping. Whether you prefer going solo or teaming up with friends, Ravenfield offers an exciting array of possibilities.

But what truly elevates Ravenfield to another level of enjoyment is the limitless potential of mods and maps that the community has crafted. Even as a newcomer to the game, I was astounded by the incredible variety of custom content available. The modding community has breathed new life into Ravenfield, introducing everything from new weapons and vehicles to entirely new factions and environments. It's mind-blowing to witness what talented individuals can achieve with the game's framework.

While Ravenfield's vanilla experience is already fantastic, the addition of mods takes it to a whole new dimension. With the plethora of user-created content, players can tailor their experience to suit their preferences, allowing for hours upon hours of replayability. Whether you're a history enthusiast wanting to recreate famous battles, a sci-fi fanatic eager to pit futuristic forces against each other, or simply seeking wacky and humorous additions, there's a mod for everyone.

The beauty of this modding community lies in its inclusivity and creativity. Players with a passion for game design can easily contribute their own creations, fostering a collaborative and supportive atmosphere. This constant influx of fresh content ensures that Ravenfield remains dynamic and engaging, even for seasoned players who have spent countless hours on the game.

In essence, Ravenfield's brilliance extends beyond its core gameplay and design; it is a testament to the power of community-driven content creation. The developers' decision to embrace and support mods has been a masterstroke, allowing the game to evolve organically with the contributions of dedicated fans.

So, whether you're a long-time Ravenfield player or a newcomer like me, exploring the ever-expanding world of user-generated content is an adventure in itself. It adds an extra layer of excitement and surprises, turning an already amazing game into an ever-changing and boundless experience. Don't hesitate to dive into this vibrant world of creativity and make the most out of Ravenfield's potential with mods and maps – you won't be disappointed!

Overall, Ravenfield is a great game that stands out as a shining example of how simplicity can often outshine complexity. With its excellent mechanics, entertaining friendly fire feature, and creative low-poly graphics, it's clear that the developers poured their hearts into this title. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a casual player, Ravenfield's accessibility and engaging gameplay make it a must-play.

If you're looking for a game that balances simplicity, fun, and innovation in perfect harmony, Ravenfield should be at the top of your list.

The community is the main aspect of this game they continuously make brilliant mods which improve on the games mechanics and introduce fun maps, weapons and game modes.

The game however has quite a few bugs and glitches as it is early access but these will get fixed with later updates.

I would like to see a sound mod from the community which improves the quality of the weapons because most of them sound like bursting popcorn. On the other hand some weapon mods come with great sound quality and visuals. Some other weapons need polishing and reload sounds as well as weapon scopes and attachments which could be very neat as you could actively switch out one attachment for another rather than respawning.

At first the base game might seem like it isn't worth the price, but the modded content makes it worth every penny. There are a lot of very talented modders in the community, who are constantly putting out new content for you to try.

The AI is somewhat competent, being able to follow orders, proning when engaging distant targets and such. After some time with them, you begin to learn how they think and act, and you can use it to your advantage.

Graphics: It's made with Unity, not too much to expect here.
Gameplay: I've got hundreds of hours in this game, I think the gameplay must be pretty good.
Audio: Base game is ok, the other sounds are up to the modders.
Audience: Anyone with a little free time.
PC Requirements: Depends on the map
Difficulty: Inverse Dark Souls

despite the game probably not going to be seeing any future updates, its still worth your money if its on a sale.

AI can get a bit klutz sometimes but it adds to the charm of the game. think of this game as if your toy soldiers you might've had as a kid were actually real and fought on their own.

final verdict: great gameplay, but game is dead. get on sale asap if you want to have the time of your life.

Conquest mode is not better , after you eliminate all enemies in the war room map  , there is no ending or pop up screen , you have to press ESC again and exit the game .

Steam should delete this ravenfield for the reason more than 5 years (2017-2023) the game is still work in process , that is ridiculous , if you can't finish the game then steam has the responsibility to delete the game and void the developer right to upload any games in the future .",1690608844,1690608936,False,4,0,0.427241981029510498,3,True,False,True

I really like ravenfield. The modding community is amazing, the physics are funny, and the gameplay is fun. I've been playing Ravenfield for years, and that's part of the problem. Early Access should not be the default state of the game, and five years in Early Access with more than 6 months (edit: 0 months lol) since we've heard any news about development is unacceptable.

i've had this game for a while, and in my time it's proven to be one of my favorites. the workshop is full of amazing creators and maps and the general quality you can bring the game to is astounding. from the looks of it, ravenfield is on its way to becoming a full-fledged double-a shooter if you get what i mean.

my biggest complaints however is that the character does move rather slow. in spec-ops this does help the stealth aura but on the battlefield the game lacks energy and i mostly enjoy the game with a sliding mutator to make it fast enough.

secondly, the default arsenal is rather lacking. while there is at least one weapon for most categories (assault rifle, dmr, shotgun) there's usually ONLY one for said category. only one shotgun, only one sniper, only one ironsighted assault rifle, etc.

lastly, the models for said weapons appear to be the same they were since launch and compared to what has been rendered with mods, are less visually appealing.

other than that, great game and i'd love to see where it's headed :)",1690577060,1690577060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Unlimited content with workshop which adds thousands of hours of playtime

Custom Map Maker/Battle Scenario Creator with configurable nav-mesh and built in assets that is easy to use somewhat.

Custom Weapons, Skins, Player Skins, Vehicles, Assets, Maps, Mods, Attachments, Audio & Voice-lines, Music and even multiplayer if you wanted to play with your buddies. 

You can setup custom battles from WW2 to Sci-fi Star Wars battles with support to up to 599 bots lol. Pretty much an offline custom Battlefield 4 with workshop support lol.

Needs optimization, QoL tweaks. Game is CPU intensive watch for the bottleneck.

The game on it's own is slightly lacking in content. I understand that may be a problem for some, but there are updates, and I'm convinced that there will be a story coming soon. (I write this in July 2023, for the future humans) Like that, it's a fun game, though. Where we really get into the heart of the game, in my opinion, is when you install workshop mods. There are thousands to pick from, so can suit your fancy no matter what you like. The game can run on a potato, so there's also that. It is singleplayer, though -- before you add in mods. There was already a defunct multiplayer mod, but there's a new one called RavenM. Everything's easy to use, interface is beautiful, and the one man whose running the show, the elusive SteelRaven, is doing a great job.

Ravenfield is a sandbox Battlefield-like game filled with as many friendly and enemy AI bots as you want are the basis of the game, with complete freedom of what map, weapons, and vehicles to choose. Keep in mind that this game is singleplayer only and that adds to the positive experience of not getting yelled at by other players. 

You can make Ravenfield however you want via mods. It's highly achievable because the modding community has all that you can find. 
Weapons, vehicles, and anti-aircraft cannons from nearly every era are available to download and try out. These can really bring out the ""sandbox"" aspect of the game when you make your own preset. By this, I mean that you can carry a M249 SAW with an AKS-74U on a level with WW1 soldiers vs Americans - all while using a mix of cars, WW2 Panzers and modern T-90s. 

The AI in this game is decent, and you can command them to go different places. They aren't too smart, as they run in and die, and they often get stuck in some places and have all sorts of other problems, but most of this adds to the fun of the game.

My main complaint is how nothing can fix how loadouts can't be saved, so you have to manually change each weapons every time which gets cumbersome when you have 400 modded weapons to choose from. Other than this tiny QoL issue, everything else makes up for it.

Overall, Ravenfield is a great game that I'd personally recommend to anyone looking for a great sandbox-shooter type game. On top of that, it's made by an independent developer who is very worth supporting.",1612066723,1690079391,True,3,1,0.553571403026580811,0,True,False,True

But sandbox mode on the other hand, feels like It's no longer about nations, ideologies, or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles, fought by soldiers and machines.
The War--and it's consumption of life--has become a well-oiled machine.
Preset soldiers carry Preset weapons, use Preset gear. 
Workshop addons and skins on their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities.
Gamemode control, Map control, Weapon control, battlefield control…everything is monitored and kept under control.
The age of deterrence has become the age of control, all in the name of averting catastrophe from addons of mass destruction, and he who controls the battlefield, controls history.

- Extremely Mod-Friendly
- Basically Indie gaming's *second* best answer to Battlefield
- Has a Built-in Map Editor
- You can ride tanks, Helicopters, Planes, Boats and many more.
- Allows you to decide how many AIs you can fight.
- Easy to adapt into if you're familiar with battlefield and other FPS games.
- Has an Unique Turn-Based game mode (very unpolished right now)
- Can be run by any modern Computer
- Very Replayable
Cons:
- No Multiplayer as of now.
- Everything is Low-Poly and some maps look pretty ugly and under-detailed like one of those old roblox games.
- Slow development.
- First Person Movement feels sloppy and too basic.

In a genre where you would expect games to be thrilling purely because of the online aspects and the ability of other players, such as those of games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, Ravenfield recreates an online experience purely through the use of bots of differing numbers which you can add to, and decrease, the number of. I have played Ravenfield for approximately 140 hours as of the time of this review's publishing, and I cannot emphasise how exciting this game can be with the different modes and styles of maps. I have played only the battle mode, and the non-linear ways that these battles take place are always extremely exciting. 

First of all, let's talk about battles purely on the base game. They are great, you can often enjoy the original vehicles and weapons without much issue, and you can add a different number of bots to your game in order to recreate very large sized battles. If your computer can handle it, you could easily add 300-400 bots in which can all be battling at the same time. The base game does not have the same abilities as modded versions of the game, but I'll talk more about that in a little bit. The base game has a very nice number of vehicles that can be used, including different types of vehicles: Jeeps (and Machine Gun variants), Quad Bikes, APCs, Tanks, Fighter Aircraft, Bombers, Attack Helicopters and Transport Helicopters. There is a number of nice stationary weapons such as an ATGM, AA and Stationary Machine Gun. You will not miss out with the base game, which includes a nice number of large-scale maps, even seen on the Conquest [1] mode.

Let's talk about mods. On the matter of mods, there is way too many. You can experience ALL types of combat in this game with the assistance of mods. You can start off in the Roman Era, where you can absolutely find character models and different swords and shields that you can use in combat. There is also a horse mod that you can find. Then, with a bit more modding, you can be in the U.S. Civil War, fighting Confederates (or the Union, I don't judge) to try to gain victory for your ideals. Then you can be in World War Two, fighting the Axis or Allied powers. To put it simply, if you're looking for something, you'll find a mod for it. The modding scene for Ravenfield is extremely expansive, with a mod being released every two to three minutes on average. There is a few MILLION mods available for Ravenfield. 

Now, let's talk about the game's online abilities. I am unfortunate to say that Ravenfield does not actively have an online mode, however I have high hopes that the developers are working on a way to implement a multiplayer access to the game. 

Onto the system requirements. If you're someone who plays on a low-end computer, I only advise getting the base game if you're close to the minimum for the game's system requirements. If you're on a high-end computer, I absolutely recommend getting mods, for example the LETMS system which allows you to use modern-day tanks. Now, I know some people are afraid of mods, and for good reason, but I can assure you that the most popular mods will be very safe to use, and don't ruin the game in any way.

In terms of the game's graphics, as I've said before, it's very simplistic. There is a very simple low-poly set of weapons and characters that are very pleasurable to look at and are also very easy to identify. You can tell which team is which based off of the colour of their character's uniform, which is either a bright red or bright blue, unless you set it to be a different colour whether it be through the use of mods or other means. 

Now for the controls. You can learn the controls very easily, you can absolutely get used to this game with 15 minutes of experience. You don't have to spend too long to play the game like a pro, and all the controls for aiming and moving are very easy, and they're very similar to other games you may have played. All you need is to find your perfect loadout, and you can get very good at the game.

I've come up with a degree as to how easy a game is to learn and play a game, and I've put the levels down here:

[b] Learning the controls [/b]

[  ] You will be unable to play this game because the controls are too difficult.
[  ] Get ready to have your game controls screen printed off to keep referring to.
[  ] Games Informer Magazine would be a nice thing to have on hand
[  ] Somewhat simplistic, you will have to spend a little bit of time to learn the controls.
[X] Simplistic, you can learn this game's controls in 10-15 minutes.
[  ]  So simple that even your child could play it.

[b] How much you can play the game before it gets boring [/b]

[  ] You can play this game for hundreds (possibly thousands) of hours before it gets boring.
[  ] You can play this game for a few hundred hours before it gets boring.
[  ] You can play this game for a hundred hours or so before it gets boring. 
[X] You can play this game for ten to fifty hours before it gets boring. [2]
[  ] You can play the game for a few hours before it gets boring.
[  ] You could do anything else and have more fun.

[b] How much would the game require mods to be enjoyable [/b]

[  ] You cannot play the game without mods.
[X] You need mods, you will be very bored if you don't add any mods.
[  ] Mods really will enhance the game experience for you.
[  ] You should probably have one or two mods on hand.
[  ] You can play the game with a few mods, and it'll be fun.
[  ] You don't need any mods, you absolutely do not need mods.

[b] How hard is the game [/b]

[  ] Dark Souls would be envious.
[  ] Dark Souls level of difficulty.
[  ] This game is challenging.
[X] You'll enjoy this if you like a bit of a challenge.
[  ] Play if you're scared of a challenge.
[  ] Daddy, can I play on the computer game now?

So, what can we say about Ravenfield? It's a great game, a certain degree of challenge can be expected depending on the type of bots you go up against and what weapons and vehicles they have at their disposal. I wholly recommend you buy the game if you are someone who likes a bit of combat, but doesn't like the difficulty of fighting against real people who are probably ten times better than you. Thus, I recommend that you try the game. You can always get a refund if you don't like it, but I doubt you'll be getting a refund for this one, the degree of chaos to which battles can develop into makes the game absolutely worth it.

[b] Notes: [/b]

[1] Conquest mode is a mode that you can access which allows you to slowly make gains and losses against an enemy commander. You slowly compete in battles whilst actively choosing which theatre you attack in, whilst your enemy makes lots of different calculated moves. I haven't played much of conquest, only one round or two, but I can assure you that it is absolutely an excellent game mode for those who are interested in it.
[2] You can play the game and enjoy it for a lot longer, however this is based off of the base game, which does not yield as much experience as you would expect, since the game is technically still in early access.",1689535923,1689536215,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,True

“The full release of Ravenfield is scheduled to happen around 2021.”

The release date is 18 May, 2017, and you dear developers said that around 2021 it is going to be completed. But now it is 2023. Why the progression is going so slow? The Conquest is not complete yet, and the bad thing that i noticed is that the game doesn't have the capacity to load multiple, even heavy mods at the same time. If you don't want to go further, alright, it's OK. But think about the modding part of the game and do something. Do something for the game to load mods easily. In my opinion the unique feature of such games is being highly dependent on modding. Correct and revise the game modding and leave it to the modders.

I first discovered Ravenfield through watching BaronVonGames on Youtube (who I highly recommend if you enjoy Ravenfield), and fell in love with it every since. It's a wonderfully creative game, with a wonderfully creative community.
One of the best parts about Ravenfield is the modding community that surrounds it. There is near limitless mods to play around with, and so much fun to be had whether you want to engage in daredevil dogfights, or storm the beaches in a hovercraft.
Ravenfield is a beautifully simple First Person Shooter, with hilarious rag doll mechanics paired with dramatic flair, and I highly recomend it.",1689136303,1689136303,True,39,1,0.784524738788604736,0,True,False,True

The modding community is absurdly large, however, the game is just as fun in vanilla. There is a pretty decent weapon and vehicle catalogue, although people complain about weapons/vehicles being bad. In reality, it's the player being bad at using it. Before you form opinions on stuff, check out the wiki to see the stats, and try changing up your strategy.

I found myself dying way too often, so I'd recommend refraining from aggressive behaviour to prolong your time in combat.

If you go to Library > Ravenfield > Properties > Betas, you can get a sneak-peek at the next update. Speaking of which, as of writing this, a story is in development. The first mission is accessible via the Early Access 27 Beta.

Also, I see people blindly buying games, resulting in minimal enjoyment. If you want to have fun playing a video game, check if it has a tutorial, wiki, and subreddit.  Always do your research before buying. This applies to everything, ESPECIALLY Ravenfield; as the game presents no info about it's contents internally.

Ravenfield also has a massive amount of easily accessible mods through the steam workshop that are most the time good and can add a new element to the game.

However there are downsides to the game. Most importantly it is practically abandoned by the devs and so near never gets updates and I doubt it will ever have a full release. The game is also very repetitive and the campaign is not an actual campaign it is more like a strategy turn based game in which you fight the battles as a soldier so it is not a story line if that's what you thought, the different game modes in sandbox are not that great either and are generally almost the same thing except Halloween mode and spec ops mode but they are not very special either.

Despite its flaws the incredibly fun game loop and modability makes it over all a very fun game and i would recommend as I have, despite its simplicity, spent 190 hours in this game and have always enjoyed it.
If you could get to the end I hope this was helpful (despite my bad spelling i am not a small child)

The guns are typical, the vehicles are basic, the maps are somewhat simple. But this, I think, is to the games credit, as it provides a way to easily experience the  perfect shooting game power trip without wacky powers or annoying other players. It's one unique mechanic is the ability to slow down time: not so that the player moves faster, but simply so as to give the player time to react, thus providing a much needed edge against the otherwise superior enemies, this contributes to the games power trip feel.

However, the whole experience of Raven-field can be completely altered by a single aspect: the modding. Raven-field mods, from cosmetic to functional to both, can completely change the way the player interacts with the game, aided by the talented and dedicated mod makers working on it. The mods can add maps, skins, guns, vehicles, even special functions called mutators which allow the player to add cross-hairs or artificial chat boxes in the vanilla game, but when modded can allow teleportation, extra weapon slots and potentially even more.

Vanilla Raven-field is by no means for a wide range of players; it fits into a specific niche, but when modified by the community, it allows for practically anything that fits within the single-player (sometimes not even first person) shooter category, and the level of allowed customisation serves it well in a rarely seen show of creativity from the community.",1688641941,1688641941,True,2,0,0.517488598823547363,0,True,False,True

I was interested in BattleBit to get the feeling I got from Battlefield2 but I did not want to pay for an online only game that would cut Linux support any day. I found Ravenfield and I could not be happier. The game has satisfying gun play, vehicles, the AI is not garbage and will take cover when available. Mod support is great, including Workshop support. Conquest mode is barebones, but still great, best recreation of Galactic Conquest from SW Batllefront 2. Mode is still in development and has so much potential.

its just so good, the core gameplay is good, so mods just improve it even more
also the fact that its so mod friendly, maps,guns,skins,vehicles, and even behavior mods (like when a vehicle burns, the people inside it burns, gore when you shoot a dead enemy and so on)

i pirated the game first but it was so good i just had to buy it, and the best part? if you can't find the mods you like, then you can make them yourself (the dev has literally shared the script in which things are made in and even animation and 3D models)

And im not 100 percent certain why iv'e played it so damn much, i think one of the biggest reasons would be the AMAZING workshop, this game is fueled by the outstanding community and mods. you can make the game into a WW2 game, a modern warfare game, a futuristic game, a silly game, a star wars game, literally anything you like and its easy and accessible! And another thing that really differs it from other war sandboxes is its such variety, there's cars, skins, planes, tanks, jeeps, ATV's, bombers, boats, machine guns, anti tank launchers, chat, names, tons of guns, maps, modes, teams, and everything is customize-able to make the war simulation of your dreams! now i only see two downsides too this game... 1, once you've gone crazy with mods like i have it'll take a while to load into the game but its not a big deal at all. 2, The game can be a lil glitchy when you have planes, tanks, and boats, and 100s of NPCs running everywhere wiiiichhh is understandable but it also depends on your Specs on your pc. but other than that its a great game! theres so much to explore and do youll be spending hours playing like me, so i HIGHLY recommend you purchase and download and start killing some aliens with WW2 era tanks and modern m4a1 rifles!",1687966463,1687966463,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As a game, it's wonderful, and I highly recommend it. It's got a few things that are jank like the optimization (when it comes to mods anyway), the over reliance on mods to make this game good (I don't want to hear how it compares to gmod, since gmod was made as a mod platform first), amongst other things, but the gameplay is solid enough to where it doesn't bother me, but as stated, the optimization can be a massive turn off if those don't have mid to high end PCs on some of the mods that require heavy resources on your PC. There are games I believe that take the sandbox aspect and execute it better, but RF is a game that I enjoyed for the game alone, even if I found the base game lacking (even for 18 dollars). Feels more like a game for modders to clean up than the developer making a quality product.

Anyways, onto the community. Now what do I mean by the community being not the sharpest tools in the shed? Some of the community can be rather a bit toxic in the way that they are just egotistical, and having a holier than thou approach to things alongside just being pure gatekeeping morons about it (especially on Discord), and certain big time modders (won't name who) will feel obligated to go behind people's backs (like myself) and dump on some for the sake of it, and it's just disgusting. Had to leave most RF related servers (including RF main) because of this and I wouldn't be surprised if people were to do so without me noticing. I will say not all of the community is bad, but some of them throw me off to a point where I stopped making stuff for about a few weeks.

TLDR: Good game, but not the best community out there.",1562902925,1687802385,True,3,0,0.560563385486602783,0,True,False,True

ravenfeild, A sandbox battle simulator, recreate the Napolienic wars or recreate the war crime committed by japan in WW2.

the modding community for this game is insane, and while the base game is fun, nothing beats flying an A10 warthog through a pile or blue people or turning the battlefield into a soup factory.. MMM soup.

A variety of maps and so many options there is unlimited fun to be had in this game all we need now is a multiplayer. 

Still in early access so there are some bugs, and your game may explode by hitting the wrong enemy at the wrong time, but man is it fun.

It's focused around a highly-customizable skirmish mode essentially, with the games playing out like a singleplayer version of a Battlefield match, where two teams fight it out over capture points using a selection of weapons and vehicles including aircraft. The gameplay is the tried-and-tested Battlefield formula and it works very well.

The graphics are hardly photorealistic, but they have a charmingly simplistic style that allows the game to run very well even with large numbers of bots, and they nonetheless give a good feel of a raging battle as blood splats and bullet holes mar areas that have been fought over for quite a while afterward. 

Perhaps the area this game shines most is its mod support. With Workshop integration, modding this game is child's play, and it has a large and dedicated community of skilled modders making new maps, weapons, vehicles, and player models. No matter what era of history you want your game to look like, you can probably find it on the Workshop somewhere.

If you loved the feel of the old Battlefield skirmish modes and their moddability, you can't go wrong with Ravenfield. As someone who even now still plays Battlefield 2 sometimes, I highly recommend it.",1685654529,1685654529,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

[h1]Gameplay: [/h1]

The game is a battlefield simulator. It does the battlefield simulating part well, but the game part is lacking in all aspects:

Gunplay is confusing. Weapons are highly inaccurate and feel unresponsive to use. It is not at all clear where your shots land due to lack of bullet effects. Bullets stop at everything, which is a weird design choice. By default the game has hitmarkers and kill feed like in a multiplayer arena shooter, which is as stupid as a design choice as it sounds like. Luckily you can disable these.

Even if there is a huge fight going on, you can only play as a single soldier: You cannot order AI soldiers beyond ""go here"" commands. Even in the planning menu you cannot plan maneuvers, instead only tell soldiers what control points to focus on.

You cannot take control of other soldiers, you must respawn. You can't even lead a squad, unless you recruit random people around your spawnpoint every time you respawn. 

The latter issue is fixed in the Spec Ops gamemode, which feels like a cheap attempt at Ghost Recon mission. Which seems like a great idea except you lose the instant you die, as you cannot take control of other soldiers. And you can't order this squad around, they can either hold in position and die, or follow you and die.

Other than Spec Ops, the game is mainly only control points maps. Some maps are fine enough to play on, but most are very boring and incomplete. It would've been fine to have smaller king-of-the-hill or capture-the-flag maps instead of forcing these small maps into control point gamemode.

[h1] Technical side: [/h1] 

The technical side of this game is a mess. It's not very  laggy or unplayable, but it is not well made. Bullets will hit invisible walls around objects constantly. There is no difference between a steep ground you can walk on and a ramp you will slide off of. You can change your speed whilst jumping as effectively as you can while on the ground.

AI is stupid: It never does tactical maneuvers and never goes for cover, instead running away at a straight angle or sitting still in some pre-designated spot. 

[h1] Potential: [/h1] 

Lets get the obvious out of the way. It's early access, so you shouldn't expect perfection. However, there's no potential here either. The game mechanics are weird combination of battlefield and call of duty series, without the appeal of either.

It's not unplayable. But it has no real benefits compared to those games. Battlefield 2 has one of, if not the best singleplayer instant action experiences. The reason for this is the detail put into every level. There is none of that here. Maps with fun ideas like a lab hanging above a ravine in Glacier are only 2% of the map, rest of it but empty wasteland. Come on, place an underground complex drilled onto a cliff, add some scientist outposts, hell, even basic trenches or forests, anything but empty nothingness.

This game's minimalistic style is it's biggest downfall, don't get me wrong, it isn't bad, but it's utilized incorrectly. The soul of a battle is created through constant sound effects and musical score. This is understood by big battlefield games like Battlefront and even small-scale tactical shooters like Ghost Recon. I am not expecting orchestra from a solo dev, but I am expecting some effort. Hell, this game's trailer has more effort put into it's sound design that the entire game itself.

The battles are confusing and big, so maybe some deep and loud echoes of the distant explosions and constant chatter could be juxtaposed with effective use of natural sounds of wind, birds and grasshoppers in order to create some sort atmosphere? Use less realistic sound effects to get across the feeling of wackiness in these color-coded wars, or utilize loud deathscreams as some distant dude's bodyparts were torn off by an explosion to get across the gritty feel of war. Use music stings when things happen in gameplay, not only when the game has ended.

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] 

[b]As the Ravenfield stands right now, there is no soul, there is no engaging gameplay, there is no effort. There is no game worth your money.[/b]",1684262010,1684262257,False,3,0,0.534310221672058105,1,True,False,True

This game has proven itself to be a great joy over the last one or two years, and for the price tag of $17.99, Ravenfield can bring you hours of fun. However I can't fully say to you buy it full price for you not to use the steam modding community, as it pains me to state this; the base game is pretty lackluster.

For the game though, it's truly a work-of-art in the Indie genre, coupled with the amazing modding community you can turn this game from two LEGO teams fighting, into something that somehow rivals mid-budget AAA FPS. (As far as I can tell, outmatches Vanguard.)  
Also for an Indie game, the content and graphics are pretty decent. Even still, Ravenfield can sometimes feel to bright or dark depending on the map or graphic settings. Sadly for me the mouse sensitivity can really make the game unplayable or unenjoyable if not fixed immediately, also the key-bindings could get some improvements.

All-in-all, Ravenfield is a game that seems to be another run-of-the-mill shooters, but in the end it truly is the best indie game I have ever played. I also would like to thank BaronVonGames for revealing this game to me, so if you're reading this Baron, thank you for the almost 100 hours spent on this game..

RFMP do not include any bots, and RavenM allows only to play battle. Also there are some issues with grass - it does not hide you from enemies, and some structures - they are only penetratable for bots' bullets, so you cuold be killed thrue some boxes, corners etc. No bullet penetration for bodies even for hight callibres.
But there are workshop with hundrets of maps, thousands of gun, a lot of skins and mutators, custom vehicles and etc.
In summary, the game is in early access, so what did you wanted from it? Could be better, but already ok.
