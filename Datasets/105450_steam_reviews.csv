Graphics. It's a great looking game, particularly considering that in a few years, it'll be old enough to drink in most countries.

Cons:
Zoom disatance. Even at the greatest zoom distance, it still felt like the buildings were right in your face all the time.
Price-tag. It is, at the time of writing a 16 year old game, yet the price tag still reads 37€, almost twice what the much better Age og Empires 2 DE costs, and ond 3€ cheaper than the much more recent AoE4. And as I've yet to see it on sale (of any kind), I cannot in good concience recommend it.
Bugged. Multiplayer is not working, and my understanding is that with the next game in the series out, it likely won't ever. At launch it asks for Activation Keys that Steam does not provide.

It wasn't the AoE game that many expected. Not just a copy of the old ways that the AoE series offers. Some new decisions are excellent and interesting and some are questionable in the best-case scenario.

I like the new period of time that developers took! I like new heroes and their opportunities(not just units with a unique name and more HP like it was before).

Yes, it's not the old AoE games, but it's good to have the new point of view for RTS on the whole.

The variety of units, buildings and maps makes skirmish after skirmish very enjoyable. Some factions have more variety than others, but all feel fun and rewarding to play in their own way.  I have only ever dipped my toes into other Age of Empires games, because I always found myself drawn back to this one, even while playing Age of Empires IV.

The campaigns were enjoyable but pretty simple and linear, with no real creativity allowed to progress through them. But they are fun short historical fiction stories that are a good way to learn how to play the game.  If you are looking for a simulation game this is not really it. The game focuses entirely around the strategic battles and resources essentially only exist to build your army.  Overall 10/10.

They were way to harsh as Age of Empires 3 may not be as complex as 2 but 3 is an amazing game in it's own right. Age of Empires 3 campaign is based less on historical events and battles that happened and was more like trying to tell a historical fictional story with real historical figures and factions like the Knights of St. John and the Ottomans. The Asian Dynasties is the best expansion in the whole Age of Empires 3 package as it has the most game play mechanics and content. I highly recommend this game and everything that comes with it! This is a perfect Age of Empires game for newcomers who may be intimidated by the pacing and mechanics with the first two Age of Empire games excluding Mythology. Age of Empires 3 is an amazing third installment and one of the most graphically beautiful games I've ever seen. The music and soundtrack is also so beautiful and calms you.,1599076788,1694671516,True,32,0,0.751044929027557373,0,True,False,False

On virtual lands where warriors compete.
With muskets and canons, our armies would clash,

In Age of Empire III, we found our delight,
Building colonies and waging epic fights.
Yet amidst the battles and strategies grand,
It was your smile that truly took command.

You were my ally in times of war,
Together we'd conquer, that's for sure.
But when the sun set on our virtual land,
You held my hand, and I knew you'd understand.

As the ages passed and civilizations grew,
My love for you, my heart, it knew.
No matter the epoch, no matter the quest,
With you by my side, I felt truly blessed.

So here's to our love in this digital age,
Built on teamwork, laughter, and courage so sage.

Why is it in some ways a *far* more graphically and sonically engaging, entertaining spectacle when destroying enemy bases? in a release made 13 years before the latest one? why did they take out the buildings blowing apart? why did they take out that rad 'ZZT ZZT ZZT' arrow flight sound effects; why does the newer version cost over ten times the disc space than this? WHY, DAMMIT?!?

I think I'll always prefer AGE III over all the others. even II. it's just the one made most for me. time period, block-unit production, the weirdness of the card system that pissed me off at first but now is totally legit . . . who knows why. it's just in my DNA. 

I LIKE Age IV, but damn, man -- they used to make really FUN games. you can customize the towns for each of the different cultures you're working your way through. the game loads into it, making a real attachment with both the game and your favorite faction. it's awesome. 

still like DE, but it's really missing a few things that are baffling to think were left out. on purpose. (my cynical side says modern corporate sensibilities thought the old-style chaos was ""too vicious"". too vicious for a game where you end each match blowing absolutely every innocent farmer away with canons. just a theory, but if not . . . but why leave it out?)

- The nations don't feel as generic as in the AoE 2 but the map and army scales are smaller. It plays more or less the same as the previous games, with some smaller tweaks. E.g. you can now train up to 5 soldiers at once. Graphically the game looks very good and the battle animations, especially when attacking buildings  or ships, are great. That said, the game feels mediocre in comparison to AoE2 or AoM.
- The campaigns have interesting scenarios but the story is very childish and historically inaccurate for the most part. Not to say that AoE has ever payed too much attention to historical accuracy. (Quite the opposite.) There are some scenarios that depict the historical events but even those are tweaked so they would fit the made up stories. Ensemble studios probably wanted to repeat the success of the AoM campaign, but that one was full of monsters so it wasn't that big of a dieal. While fighting russians in apalachians during the early 17 century, and selling it as history, goes a bit over the line. Or fighting the Ottomans in the Caribic.

The game has a variety of civilizations to choose from, each with their own unique units and abilities. The gameplay is deep and strategic, with a good mix of military and economic decisions to make. The game also has a robust multiplayer mode, allowing you to compete against other players online.
One of the standout features of Age of Empires 3 is its campaign mode, which follows the story of various civilizations throughout history. The campaigns are well-written and offer a good mix of story and gameplay. The game also has a number of new features, such as home cities and cards that allow you to customize your civilization and armies.
The graphics in Age of Empires 3 are excellent, with detailed character models and beautiful environments. The game's music and sound effects are also top-notch, adding to the atmosphere.
One downside to Age of Empires 3 is that the game can be a bit overwhelming for new players. There's a lot of content to take in, and the game doesn't do a great job of easing you into things. That being said, the game has a helpful community and there are plenty of resources available to help new players get started.

It has the options of gold, wood, & food one needs to earn or find to build some sort of big town out in a wilderness area. AND, there are also cheat codes for those who just want to trounce everyone. The only problem is, that as one goes along, one can earn only 20 extra products to super strengthen one's town. In the other version with ""the War Chiefs"", Indian tribal villages, one can earn 25  extra products to make one's town stronger. The problem in that game is that the Indians give up too easily on every level up through moderate. While I like to win I like a bit more of a fight. Once I get to the hard levels it seems like my armies react slow or not at all. The enemy walks right past them & no one moves like they do on other levels. The enemy attacks & my armies attack back but the cannons do not react to the fighting right away; or they seemingly get confused & can't figure out which way to go. Everything has to be micro-managed, which is ok in most cases. But, imo, there needs to be a single toggle or some such, where tightly packed troops spread out. There may actually be one but I haven't found it yet. There is one in AOE2. The other thing is, my individual armies attack without being prompted, & march right into deadly fire when I want them to march close in front of the guns & rockets. I use the stop toggle but they don't listen for long. I line up 2  lines in front of the cannon & they tend to group up  again with any movement, even when in separate groups. They will not stay in the 2 lines I've place them in. I don't need my armies charging into another army who's guns are set up to eliminate them while my cannons decide they need to turn into their faster movement modes & then reset a few seconds later. There can be many shots fired into my armies & at my cannons before they can reset. At other times they will move in ready mode going halfway across the country. It's slower of course, but they are ready for a fight right away. Why they usually won't do so in a BIG fight, is the problem.
Overall I still like the first game & second game version of AOE3. The Oriental level is too confusing to me. I've tried it several times but can not figure out how it's supposed to work like the other two levels.
 Just as an aside I like playing the AOE2 game as well. It is simpler. And, while the figures still tend to wander off, or like ten armies go out & attack a single enemy soldier, it is still fun for me to play. I try to separate them, but during a battle it is too difficult to continually keep micro-managing them to send just 2 or 3 of my
armies after a single enemy soldier. I've tried some of the newer 3-D kinds of battle games & am not that impressed with them. Mostly because they end up giving only a limited view of whats going on & one has to continually be switching to other angles to see if someone is coming on your flank when all of my concentration is on trying to separate my armies & big weapons & keep them from bunching up.  Thus I have only a few actual games. Buying others only to find out that they are not what I like is too expensive for my budget.",1670725519,1670725519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Revisiting it is like riding an old, comfortable bike.
It's like a good friend that never lets you down.

While games today are incredibly complicated, with ever changing metas and constant groaning as new bouts of content are added or missing - Age Of Empires III is a complete package and well worth the price.
While it is missing a few quality-of-life features that could bring it into the new age - it's a solid experience that can give you hours upon hours of enjoyment with or without an internet connection.

7/10

It will never let you down.

However

What I enjoyed about the AofE was the careful, rewarding resource management, and I could see the developer attempting to balance this with combat...but coming down more on the resource management aspect.

Then we come to this iteration of AofE, which proves that the rot which exists in AAA franchises existed then - namely, the simplification of games to appeal to a broader market.

If I could depict this as a percentage, I would say resource management is a paltry 10%, and the rest is flashy gimmickry.

As one reviewer pointed out - one or two farms provide limitless resources...which in a way I would understand because the developer intended for the player to then concentrate on combat

HOWEVER

Combat, with essentially limitless resources, is essentially moshing a mob of units at a target.

There is no finesse or skill required; thus, the simplification of combat for the mass market extends to the combat also.

Thus, this game attempted to please everyone, but in the end pleases no one.

I am a huge AoE fan, played every single one of them since they first came out on disc back in my childhood.  Although it says I've only played 2.6 hours of the game, that is ONLY my time playing it on steam as I wanted to see if there was any difference between that version and the microsoft version (which there is not).

If you love any of the other AoE games, or any of the other games in the genre than you will completely love this game.  There is so much to do, so many ages to live thru, and so many cultures to explore.  The story missions are great, and the sandbox games are super for learning and upping your knowledge, but where the game shines is the multiplayer and the ability to ""create"" your own game within the game itself.

The modding abilities of this game and the ability to create whatever your mind can think of (within reason of course) is a great addition and will prolong this games life by so much.  (And it already has)  The graphics are great, the sound is spot on for the age you are in, and the fighting is a pleasure to portray even though you are only creating the units and sending them off to fight for you.

I have loved these games and they will always hold a special place in my heart.  I completely recommend this game to anybody who enjoys base building, rts games, and learning about different cultures from ancient times.",1668086846,1668086846,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Although DE advanced a few steps forward it still won't take the place of the classic AOE3 for me. 

DE has added more paid content, which is not that bad in terms of civs, but cosmetic microtransactions are making their way into the game and it just doesn't feel... right. Sure, that doesn't break the gameplay but it also has performance issues and more color saturated, cartoonish graphics that I'm personally not a big fan of. 

This is a game I casually play because of nostalgia so my opinion is naturally biased towards this edition. If you're a singleplayer enjoyer then I can wholeheartedly recommend that you get this one (Still playable with friends tho). The ""attractive"" things from DE asides from its new civs I'd say is that it is cheaper and has official servers running, in case you're more into multiplayer with randoms. Both editions can be modded but DE has official support for that.

Yeah, AOE3 is not as popular as AOE2 but it's still fun in its own way. It's always worth a try

My son recently started playing and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.

-Less villager micro, the main reason I can't get into AoE2
-Each civ is capable of many different strats thanks to the card system. Some cards are capable of huge effects like transforming units into other units or decreasing the cost of upgrades or even giving upgrades for free
-Trading posts provide ""free"" resources, encourging expansion
-The game centers around a time of history that isn't talked about very much, especially the asian dynasty expansion. The time period allows an interesting mix of melee and gunpowder units.
-Any special effects a unit has are told to you through its tool tip or stat page, something AoE2 doesn't do (at least when I played). 

Some of the negatives?
-Some units are extremely overpowered. Shipment only units are infamous for this.
-It costs way too much to advance to the last age. And its almost like the devs knew because there are no new cards in the imperial age.
-Some civs are missing units and I don't really understand why. Germany for instance is missing both musketeers and grenadiers. And while I like their unique units I don't think they're strong enough on their own to justify that.
-Low unit cap on navy units. Can make naval battles a bit boring. Some cards help a little bit with this.

And why play this version over DE? More stable for one thing. And you actually have to unlock new cards which adds more replayability imo. Lastly, and this may just be me personally, but I just don't feel comfortable supporting DE after they decided that partaking in revisionist history was more important than fixing actual issues with the game. Terrible things happened in history, and we acknowledge it so we can learn from it. Trying to cover it up is self-defeating.

Age of Empires games have always introduced new things with every release, and this one does not shy from introduced a whole lot more than ever before, making it almost feel like a completely different game.

I've always thought that modern/colonial age games would make no sense in an RTS format, as we have sound breaking bullets that travel faster than you can devise any plan or strategies on the fly, but, Age of Empires III begs to differ, there was so much new to offer.

The varying civilizations and how greatly they offer not only in building/unite models but also gameplay features. And don't even get me stared on the Asian Dynasties and Fire and Shadow DLCs, literally games inside of a bigger game.

I still get dozed in by how amazing the graphics look in this game. For a game from 2008, it's insane how the visuals have aged, the lightning, water shaders, and destruction physics were an experience in and of themselves.",1651430617,1651430617,True,6,0,0.523974180221557617,0,True,False,False

I played Age of Empires III a lot less than Age of Empires II when I was younger, so I can't help but be biased. AoE III is a great game yet to me, it does not live up to AoE II. 
For new RTS or strategy gamers, I would recommend this game yet, there are better options out there. 
Also, for a 40$ it's definitely not worth it, either get it on at least 70% sale or just don't buy it. The definitive edition is only 20$, so if you're worried about price, get that instead. I cannot however vouch for the definitive edition, since I have not played it.

Normally persons don't like changes, and that's why this title was not that successful as the others. 
I think this game goes in the right direction, in its time this kind of 3d was disrupting, many mechanics change inside the game. The addition of ""home cities"" improvements/perks to help the progression of your campaign its a big game changer, is IMO the best campaign by far of AOE series.

I love the fast pace of the games, where seconds can make or break your matches (This is also nice for someone who doesn't have hours to kill and wants to get a quick game in). The mechanics of the game are very unique compared to the former AoE titles, especially the home shipment mechanic. It makes you a bit more invested into each civ; it's nice to mix and match shipments to find an optimal deck for your playstyle. In addition, each  of the 14 civs play so much differently so I rarely get bored when experimenting with civs. 

My only beef with it is some civs need rebalancing (I'm looking at you, France & Japan) because they are so much more powerful than any other civ if in the right hands.

DE has better graphics, updated balance and UI, and working online multiplayer that doesn't require a patch because Microsoft lost control over the ESO domain. Plus it has more content. Not much, but still. I know that some players will sell the fact that you have to grind for the home city cards as a positive, but I don't. I hated that grind even back in 2007, because if you play multiplayer, you start with a disadvantage compared to other players, purely in terms of available options for your homecity. Having everything unlocked is a big positive and encourages trying different civilizations. And even if you want to grind, you can still do that for cosmetics.
And last but not least, there is the price: Age 3 (2007) is 37€ (or your regional equivalent), while Age3DE is 20€. Microsoft keeping this version on sale and not just quietly removes it is a good move, but the price wasn't great to begin with, and with DE in existence it makes absolutely no sense.

The only reason were I can see this version to be useful, is if you want to play a mod that isn't compatible with DE. But even then, wait for a deep discount.",1640598679,1640598679,False,0,0,0.47501412034034729,0,True,False,False

AOE 3 isn't the worst game, nor is a waste of money if you get it on sale, however it lacks the depth of the last two entries before it and doesn't feature nearly enough maps and mechanics to live up to the others in reputation and sales. 

AOE3 does have this.. the Card system, something i am really fond of and would have like to see more of in previous games. These bundles of joy are truly awesome and offer a dynamic and rich playthrough for anyone who enjoys RPG aspects in an RTS game. 

I do also have to compliment the developers on the trade routes and native settlements that really put an emphasis on holding certain areas of the map despite vital resources elsewhere. Their bonus are somewhat overpowered but awesome. Having trade route victory seems silly but makes sense for the time period, for colonialism in the new world.

  overlook this game cause of the standard that the 2 first games of the saga drew. 
 I would not say this game is the best of the series, but to be honest is one game that should not be forgotten. Its 
  mechanics   are totally different from the others and they add a fresh perspective to the game. The shipments are a plus 
  for this game, adding a new factor of surprise which, depending on the civilization, can change the fate of the battle. 
  Another important  but  understimated mechanic are the treasures. At first they seem to be trivial and not really 
  determinant but when   resources are at stake in the early game they can become essential for players to start making a 
  huge difference or preparing an early rush.
 Some say that this game can become monotonous for some players and that its civilizations are not well-balanced. To that   
  I personally believe that though the game can become that way when mastering a civ but there are thousands of ways of    
  actually winning a game, like trying different combinations with your teamates or developing your own new strategies. As   
  for the second aspect there are some civs that are better than other but this always depend on the situation, there is not   
  a civilization which can completely defeat another by itself. There are some units that can be overpowered, like the french   
  cuirassier or the japanese ashigaru musketeer, which can be both considered the best normal units of the game without 
  taking into account super special ones. They are very powerful by themselves but against the right units they can be 
  pretty weak. All civs and units have their purpose and functionality and they are great at it but used in the wrong 
  situations they become pretty much useless. Due to this I can say that this game is great, independently of your civ skill 
  , critical thinking and a complete analysis of the whole game can make you win almost every game regardless of the odds.
 Though the game itself offers a vast and varied types of campaigns, after completing all of them the game can become a 
  little bit dull to the ones looking for a challenge and battles based on historical events. For this there are lots of original 
  mods and creative scenarios created by the community throughout the years.
All things considered, Age of Empires 3 has nothing to envy its brothers, having played both the sequel and the pre-sequel   
  I can finally state that the 3rd one was special for me. Therefore my almost 400 hours I spent enjoying this game. I would 
  not really reccomend it to everyone because it is not a casual and friendly game or at least that is not the way the devs 
  built it to be. It is a hard and demanding RTS, there are no time for breaks during the battle and so that is why I would 
  only reccomend it to RTS fans and history-lovers, because believe it or not the game also offers a lot of insight into the 
  different historical backgrounds of every civilization.

The AI, pathing and formation mechanics are a step back from AOE2... but anyone who can remember units getting stuck on each other in age 1 can forgive that. 
The differences between Civs is pronounced but it appears each civ has a hallmark build you need to use to win. 
Played the campaigns from vanilla to Asian Dynasties. Switching between difficulty levels on the scenarios has a impact dependent on the mission. On Hard, some missions played really well and was quite enjoyable but others just stacked on huge armies which hunted your villagers every couple minutes. If I wanted that, I'd play a multiplayer game. 
The story of the black family over the ages was great fun, except where some weird auto spawn wiped me out and required a restart.

10/10 Would play again and I looking forward to AOE4 being very little like this game. Give me a glossy reskin of AOE1 with aoe 2 unit tactics, aoe 3 resourcing and AI from....Total War Warhammer 2.",1635676371,1635676371,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its gameplay holds up despite being over a decade old; and while the graphics aren't incredible, they hold up far better than many games from the same era. Like Age of Empires II, there are hours upon hours of content to be had across the campaign, sandbox, and multiplayer modes. New game mechanics like the home city system and streamlined resource gathering add a nice twist to the formula. The strategy of the game hasn't changed all that much as the AI is still easy to funnel into choke points and will rarely change its strategy. Ultimately, Age of Empires III is an easy recommendation though I would recommend either Age of Empires or Age of Empires II more.

In this part you follow life of Mel Gibson as he easily defeated by superior kamel at Maltese foreskin barbecue and then only realise that he is bad guy when meeting Ottomans in US of A.  I not find this part that realistic because white guy never realise they are bad guy.  Somehow America is very small because Gibson and his descendants appear all across continents just as key historical events occur.  Lucky guys.  Mel Gibson drink water from fountain and gets opportunity to develop sexual chemistry with great great grand daughter Amelia.

WarChiefs add on includes more stories about Blacks.  These Blacks are children of original Americans too so you can wear war paint like Washington Redforeskins.  The stories again show how Blacks are always lucky to see historical events like when British storm troopers fight American rebel scum.  Game also add new feature where you can make villager dance.

Asian Dynasties contain three different story.  Japanese just want to fight everything that walk.  If you get defeat then you must balance body on sharp sword.  Chinese is crazy concept that they go to America before Chris Columbus finish directing Home Alone.  McCallisters did not answer so Chinese go back home.  In final story you see how Ghandi develop blood lust and hard on for nukes because British make him eat pork bullet.  All three Asia story also show different features like you need to send bobs, vagene and wood to make Indian villager.

Spoiler alert.

I spent thousands of hours since the game launch (i.e. before purchasing the Steam Version) I love the effort Ensemble Studios put in to build a piece of history into a game for fun! Simple to play easy to get in, hard to master. You can play as the ever strong European civilizations like conquistadors from Spain, the tribal and speedy raiders of Sioux tribes and the ever majestic and honorable Samurais of Japan! 

Original Campaign:  Vanilla and cohesive story-line focuses on Morgan Black (Act 1), John Black (Act 2) and Amelia Black (Act 3); characters that you want to support and play from start to finish!

Warchief Campaign: Not my cup of tea, if you like American Revolution or playing as Tribesmen then you might like it.

Asian Dynasties Campaign: Comprises of 3 campaigns which are in order; Japan, China & India. 
Japan is based on Shogun Wars; China focuses on a fictitious explorer and his friend travelling around the seas and India is based on India's fight for independence against their British Colonial Master. All are fun and unique in their own right!

Multiplayer: I did not play much as I am mainly a solo player. Not applicable.

Above average.

Age of Empires III is more of a step to the side rather than a step forward in the Age of Empires series. The game play has been revamped to be quicker, in addition there is far more a focus on combat. Exploration is a nice mechanic that was added to reward players who like to scout the map with various ""treasures"" which provide various resources and even additional free units. Pathfinding has been majorly improved and combat A.I. is far better than it was in previous games. Due to the game changing more than I liked personally, I consider this a step sideways than a step forward, as it doesn't quite add entirely new mechanics but rather, it changes or reworks old mechanics into ""new"" ones.

Overall I would certainly recommend this game to anyone interested in a Colonial era RTS game, but I'm not sure I would recommend it outright to a hardcore Age of Empires fan.",1558845120,1627799076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's lots of maps you can pick with beautiful scenery, different nations each with their own leader that automatically quote funny taunts at you in-game, as your enemy or ally (for instance, if you destroy the Portuguese's town center, their leader, Henry the Navigator, can say,""You have razed my town center, you filthy swine!"" or Queen Isabella can say, ""You play to rough. I would like to stop now.""), and, unlike, Age of Empires 1 and 2, there are only 3 types of resources in this game: Food, Wood, and Gold. In Age of Empires 1 and 2, the resources were Food, Wood, Gold, and Stone, but Age of Empires 3 doesn't include stone in this one. If you've played Age of Empires 1 and 2, you'd know that you have to build a mill at food, a lumberjack at wood, and a mining camp at stone and gold, just so your villages can drop off the resources. But in this game, you don't have to do any of that! You don't have to build any annoying buildings at resources just so your villagers can drop stuff off, you can just tell your villages to harvest the resources, and they'll just simply do it, without needing any building to drop off their resources! So much better! :) 

And not only are the graphics in this game much better than Age of Empires 1 and 2, so are the campaigns! In Age of Empires II, just about all of the campaigns require you to be an enemy of Jerusalem, which is just shocking. But in this one, the campaigns have extremely exciting, fictional stories. I don't like the Japanese, Chinese and Indian campaigns, but the Black family campaigns are awesome! There's 5 parts to the Black family campaign (each part has a bunch of levels), and each part stands for a generation of the Black family:

Part 1 is about Morgan Black, a Scottish Knight, in search of the Fountain of Youth. He runs into enemies and friends along the way, like Elizabet Ramsey, a pirate, Sahin, an Ottoman general, Alain Magnan (who Morgan takes orders from), and Spanish conquistadors. 

Part 2 is about Morgan's grandson, John Black. A villain called Warwick kidnaps John's uncle, Stuart Black, because he knows Stuart is one of Morgan's Black's sons, and might know the whereabouts of the location of the Fountain of Youth's water. So John and his best friend, Kanyenke, set out to try to rescue Stuart, and hunt Warwick down. Along the way, they meet George Washington, the United States' first president, and receive his help. John is married to a Native Indian, Nonahkee (who is actually Kanyenke's sister), and at the end of Part 2, she has a son, Nathaniel Black, which leads into Part 3. 

Part 3 is about Nathaniel Black and his army of natives fighting back against the British and especially the vicious Hessians, who take their orders from the cruel Colonel Kuechler (pronounced Kooch-ler). Kuechler even kidnaps Nonahkee, Nathaniel's mother, and Nathaniel and his uncle, Kanyenke, set out to rescue her. 

Part 4 is interesting, because the protagonist is not a man this time, but a woman - Nathaniel Black's daughter, Amelia Black. It starts with Amelia Black owning a railroad company. She meets a sinister Frenchman, Pierre Beaumont, who says he knows of a cave with gold, and will let her have a share of it. Amelia agrees, but, unkown to her, it's a trap, Beaumont is only leading her there to kill her. Kanyenke, the native from Part 2 and 3, knows this, though, and gets there in time to reveal Beaumont's plan to Amelia, and who Beaumont really is - the leader of the Circle, who wants the Fountain of Youth's water. Beaumont flees into the caves, and that's what Part 4 is about - Kanyenke, Amelia and her friend Cooper chasing Beaumont down, to bring him to justice, find out if the Fountain of Youth is real (only in a game :D), or just a myth, and, if it's real, get to the water before Beaumont does (Amelia says at one point, ""What will the world be like if Beaumont lives forever?""). Along the way, they run into Simón Bolivar, who agrees to help them with Beaumont if they will help him and his people be free of the Spanish.

And part 5 is my absolute favourite, every single level is really fun to do. The story is about Chayton Black, Amelia Black's son. Amelia Black married a Native Indian (you never see him in part 4 or 5, Amelia just mentions him when she visits Chayton, in Part 5), so Chayton has native Indian blood in him. Amelia has retired from the railroad company, and Chayton takes over. He meets an old man, Billy Holmes (who becomes Sheriff later on), and they work together to defend colonists from Sioux attacks. The Sioux attacks deeply concern Chayton, so he goes up into the mountains to meet with the Sioux's leader, Crazy Horse, to find out what is going on, and try to stop a war from starting. As you go through this story, you find out why the Sioux are attacking, and who really started all this fighting. Eventually, Chayton is faced with the choice to either ally with the Sioux, or with Sheriff Billy Holme. What will he choose?",1549749976,1627122923,True,2,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False

And after the release of the updated version, my opinion has not changed. This game has a special spirit, atmosphere, realism. These are not cartoonish textures and bright graphics, this is something completely different. Playing with friends brings unforgettable pleasure and memorable moments, sometimes you are convinced of the accuracy of the phrase ""never underestimate your opponent.""

The fan community after 16 (!!!) years after the release lives its own life, creates mods (I suggest you trying Wars of Liberty, which allows you to play as one of 43 civilizations). The huge array of community maps are easy to install, and the level editor makes creating them easy.

I started this game, not understanding the basics, and lost to bots even on easy difficulty, I abandoned it several times, but ... This only inflames interest in the game, in new strategies, research, tactical actions. It will appeal to both experienced players and beginners who find it difficult to decide on the first game of the genre.

Often the game is simply underestimated against the background of the second part, which is very wrong, because BOTH games deserve attention and respect. Age of Empires II won the hearts of players (quite deservedly), but personally to me it seems slow and difficult to master all technologies and strategies, game sessions are long. The third part is simplified in some aspects (as example, you have no need in creating fields for mills), but this does not make it worse.

Talking about the topic of single player campaigns, there are 54 interesting scenarios ( including warchiefs and asian dynasties add-ons). In amount of scenarios, Age of Empires II takes gold, but AOE III shouldn't be underestimated. You'll enjoy playing them or even creating your own campaigns.

Graphic effects are not far behind from the technologies of 2005-2007 years, the game still looks fresh and has flexible graphics quality settings (for both 32/64 bit systems).

Definitely buy this game, call your friends and enjoy it! Age of Empires III will not let you get bored :)",1511453166,1624882401,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I couldn't find that game, and I couldn't play the second game of the series because I spilled coffee on the computer at home. I searched everywhere for this game but couldn't find it. When I was little, I would sleep with dreams of this game, and sometimes I would see other people and envy and cry, but when I had a computer exactly 8 years from now, I bought and installed the game. Once I couldn't even play easy, now I play in master mode and I participate in tournaments when appropriate. Even if your dreams are far away, remember that you have a pair of feet.

It can be almost impossible not to compare AOE3 with AOE2 and the debate is in many ways understandably hardcore.
Both are historical RTS games with a 'base building' mechanic and each game offer campaigns based on the era they represent (though the historical accuracy of the former is quite head-tilting).
When compared with other historical RTS games from other developers and RTS games of other genres (fantasy, SCI-FI), in my opinion AOE3 offers an interesting game-play.

STRENGTHS: The GRAPHICS for the time along with a unique HOME-CITY look for each of the 8 civilisations (compared to the abundance allocated for AOE2) are its strongest points. The TRADE and NATIVE posts and 'playful' yet 'taunting' AI DIALOGUE, along with an explorer (with his own witty dialogue in their own native language) that can collect some nice early game rewards from TREASURES (G0-GO Spanish wardog) while you manage your exploration age colony brings a 'NEW WORLD' sentiment to the game.

     ""Aanvallen!"" (Attack) - Dutch explorer - in game.

WEAKNESSES: However, the CARD system (though rewarding)can be unbalanced and the AI unlike AOE2 fails to adapt to what you throw at it. Certain AI also fail to live up to their namesake and are awful allies (Sulieman fails to capture his historical counterpart's military prowess and seems to set about only collecting resources).  Simple ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS dynamic could push away players for 'dull' uncomplicated strategy. 

     ""This food is almost as good as my own chefs could cook."" - Napoleon Boneparte - Emperor of the French

Each AI CIVILISATION has noticeable strengths and weaknesses that creates for a very skewed game-play! Between the booming defensive Dutch, infantry spamming Russians and Cuirassier crusading French, I find each team offers a unique way to play with their own obstacles and unique skills to contend with.

I will admit parts of the game are dated, certain controls are stiff and the graphics can be clunky at times, but as a fan of RTS games I will forgive dated graphics for enjoyable gameplay. 
There are two main components; single player and skirmish/multiplayer.
SIngle-player is always fun, you follow a story of a family line from the age of exploration into the industrial era. Missions can have varied objectives and unless you have forced limitations can easily be solved with build a large army and attack. It does a good job of teaching you the general game mechanics and you meet several hero characters with different abilities.
Skirmish mode allows you to play as several nations each having special units that favor a certain playstyle. You can add features/customize a port-city which is fun to show progression along with building a deck of cards to activate in game. Portugal has some of the best light infantry in the game while China has a funky system of rather than buying a unit you buy a group of several units (unless you use a fort). Naval combat is very simple, with only a few ship options, yet there is something fun about the daring small ship with very vital forces sailing through the waters as larger ships blast each-other at the same time.
The main drawback is the unit population. There is a cap of 200 and foot units count as 1, but cavalry can easily take up 3 per unit, and artillery takes up even more. Unlike AOE II where you could have as a cap of up to 500 or more which allowed for some large armies, you have to build you economy and an army with a smaller batch. 
Overall, if you want a fun, relaxing game with a very slight learning curve that has a smaller scale then other installments I would recommend it.

I have been a fan of the Age of Empires series ever since the first game was released in 1997. Despite my fairly low play-time on the Steam Aoe3 Complete Collection, I played the original AoE3 release (and expansions) for hundreds of hours before purchasing on Steam for a nostalgic fix.

[u]Game Basics[/u]

AoE3 is (IMO) the best game in the series. It has an engaging and interesting single-player campaign (if slightly clichéd). I personally found the three Asian Dynasties campaigns less engaging, although mainly because they were standalone stories which were not linked to the main campaign narrative arc.

Compared to the previous games in the series, the differences between each civilisation are much more substantial, requiring a different strategy for each - particularly so with the native American and Asian civilisations. This increases the longevity of the game significantly, as you learn the nuances between the civilisations and explore different playstyles. In addition, the rock-paper-scissors between unit classes is much easier to understand and is clearly indicated in the user interface (e.g. 1.25x damage against heavy infantry, 0.75x damage against cavalry etc.).

The home city adds an interesting new dynamic to the series - every action (gathering resources, constructing buildings, killing enemy units, destroying enemy buildings, etc.) earns XP which will in turn permit you to choose civilisation-dependent shipments from the home city (free units, resources, economic bonuses etc.). The XP earned is permanent and unlocks new cosmetics for that home city.

Each civilisation also has an explorer hero unit which is designed for revealing the map and discovering various treasures across the map for a tactical bonus. In addition, trading outposts can be built on trading routes (for resources or XP) and native villages (for unique improvements and units which do not count towards your population limit).

[u] Why You Should Buy the Definitive Edition Instead[/u]

Better graphics are a given. The Definitive Edition also has an improved user interface, and much better multiplayer stability. Further, all of the expansions are rolled up into one coherent version of the game, whereas with the Complete Collection you need to select which expansion you want to play when booting the game.

The single biggest improvement with the Definitive Edition is a change to the way home cities operate. In the Complete Collection, you could create as many home cities for each civilisation as you liked but once the city was created you could not change its name or explorer name. Each home city had to be designated for Supremacy or Deathmatch, and could only be used in that game mode. Further, single player home cities could not be used in multiplayer and vice versa. Home city shipments were dependent on level, so someone playing with a low level home city would be at a competitive disadvantage because they would not have access to the best shipments. This could become frustrating if you don't play exclusively either single player or multiplayer (and/or one game mode).

The Definitive Edition shakes this up. You have one home city for each civilisation and you can change the city or explorer name in the game settings. You do not need different cities from single player / multiplayer and Supremacy / Deathmatch. Most importantly, all shipments are unlocked from the beginning.

There are also periodic limited-time events for the Definitive Edition (much like the AoE2 Definitive Edition), giving you access to new cosmetic items (mods and profile pictures).

The Definitive Edition is simply a more polished and user-friendly experience.",1613858467,1613858956,True,11,1,0.592832684516906738,0,True,False,False

What does this offer that game 2 doesn't? well, every single faction will look different, have different units and most importantly: play differently. Graphics are still good, the style is still beautiful and the gameplay is still awesome. I sunk so much time into this on the dvd version i'm ashamed to admit. Most importantly i revisted it as an adult and it holds up very much like it did back in 2008 when i bought it. 

About the two expansions that come along:

First is Warchiefs. You get three native american civilizations that are very unique and cool. The technology they lack they compensate by new mechanics and pure awesomeness. Aztecs are a bit OP to be and to fight against, but no problem. I love the Iroquois but most importantly i love the SIOUX. it's like mongols. 100% horse army. Mad fun with them. This expansion also bring mercenaries into the game and the option to have a revolution in the last era. Not my cup of cofee but the more the merrier. 

Second is Asian Dynasties: Three very unique civilizations that play in interesting ways. Japan only has 5 units and some weird rules, but that makes for interesting gameplay, India has elephants (need i say more?) and then comes my fav faction of age of empires 3: CHINA. So many unit variation, so many possibilities. it is the hardest to understand yet simply the greatest. Altho they use the controversial Qing Flag, they are awesome in every aspect. 

To conclude: Age of Empires 3 was part of my life for many years, and i may be biased, but see for yourself if it's not worth this much praise. It is, in my opinion, LEAGUES ahead of game 2 simply because every civilization is different. More is not better. Better is better. 

11/10? nah. No rating system would describe this game. 

On a personal note: My three favorite factions are Dutch, China and Sioux. But it has a faction for every single taste. Versatile game that is both amazing in single and multiplayer.

Why no Imperial Besteiro upgrade for Portugal and the list of small things goes on and on. And for last the glitches, the game can have so many annoying bugs, that till this day haven't been fixed.

To put that into perspective, Black Ops 2, a major success in the Call of Duty franchise in 2012 (which had over 100,000 players online at any given time in its heyday), now has about 700 players online on average. This game is from 2005 and it has more active players than Black Ops 2 currently does...

This is testament to how great the game is. From the panicking micromanagement at the start of the game, to the early rushes, to the late game cavalry charges, to the explosive finales within the enemy's base, AOE3 offers matches that feel accomplishing. You look at the clock at the end of the game, and you think to yourself, ""No way that was 50 minutes, I felt as though I just started!"". AOE3 keeps you engaged THROUGHOUT the whole game, if you feel bored, or are sitting around twiddling your thumbs at any point, you are probably going to lose the match. The graphics are outstanding for their day, and still hold up today. I have never gotten a headache from low quality graphics while playing this game.

This game is also an absolute blast if you are playing with friends, you HAVE to work with your allies in order to win. You will likely have to send reinforcements to your friends' towns against raids, and may have to share resources with each other to keep your team afloat. In my opinion, nothing is better than fighting a losing war and having your comrades literally send in the cavalry to save you, then counterattack with hundreds of troops into the enemy's town... In conclusion, AOE3 is a brilliant, masterful, real-time strategy game that I would 100% recommend to everyone interested in the genre.

TLDR; AOE3 is fun, engaging, and popular. Why haven't you bought it yet?",1575141099,1610826568,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

First of all, whenever you try to join any multiplayer game you'll get the error message 'Failed to join game' and there is no working solution to this on the internet or on any AOE3 community. I tried all the solutions I could find like adding the eso.com host details on your host file, port forwarding and none of them worked. 

However, using a VPN called 'Windscribe'  worked. But it reduced internet speed from 180-200 mbps to 5-10 mbps and I couldn't join any game again as I was repeatedly kicked out because of low ping

And there is patch called 'CC ESO patch' from AOE3 support which is supposed to fix this problem. But none of the other players has this patch so it creates compatibility issues and again you won't be able to join any game and you'll see the message - 'CRC Mismatch'

I'd say i have over 1k hours total in this game (in fact i got level 50 in every civ in singleplayer, all legit, no cheats).
That being said, i can give some opinions on this game. They are very controversial, and will enrage everyone around — specially AoE2 fans. 
Important to mention: i played a f*ckton of hours in both games, and i reviwed then both as negative. It's just that one is way more negative than the other.
Also, i got to rank 24 in multiplayer (from 50) and i got there with a victory ratio way over 50%. So i'm not complaying of multiplayer because i'm a clueless noob.

1. AoE3 game design >>>>> AoE2 gamedesign
Several things included in AoE3 make the game superior to AoE2. But the nostalgia glasses, the never fixed bugs and the lack of balance support eclipsed the new features. AoE2 was a mess at lauch too, but the devs simply decided to not fix stuff in this new game. 

2. Civs are better designed in AoE3 than in AoE2
all civs have unique techs, unique features, sometimes more than 1 unique unit, etc. Ottomans are completely different from any other civ, same as japanese, chinese, indians, french, germans, russians... You get my point. The more ""alike"" are portuguese spanish and british, but there are a lot of factions, so you can kind of excuse.

3. card system can be fun and enrich the experience:
You can select the cards before the game, so you can customize your colony. You can have a economy focuse, military focused, defensive focused or naval focused deck, and the cards actively can change how you play. Combine this with the unique civs, and you can play in any way you want. Except...

4. You can't play how you want:
5 minutes in a game and you lose. There's no tactic you can do, no counter you can pull. You can only do the same thing your enemy does, except faster. AoE3 is as close to a ""solved game"" as a modern game can get: the recipes on how to win a game are set in stone, and not playing by these recipes result in total anihilation. Overpowered rushes 'impossible' to react to are very common, and can only be countered by a even earlier rush (which you can't do with all civs, effectively turning the games into mirror matches to avoid these broken strats insta winning).

5. Broken units & techs;
I could complaim about the cuirassier HP, but i wont. I will, instead, complain about instant training of units. Due to bad coding, the player can literally train instantly cavalry or infantry. Love or hate balance/realism, this is broken and should be fixed asap. It wrecks the game flow and completely invalidates suprise attacks — why keep a standing army if i can train 40 dragoons to defend my base from a surprise attack that got me completely disprepared? 
Here is the deal tho, THIS makes the units broken. Cuirassier are good units, compensated by their cost and the time you need to get then. Instant training just negates the waiting time lol.
(guess what, this isn't fixed in the definitive edition).

6. Historical Accuracy:
Campaign is fantasy. They say it at the very beggining. But even AoE3 fantasy campaign is more historically accurate than the entirety of AoE2. the Thirteen colonies, the Armada, the native onslaught, the expansion to the west... The background very well portraied in AoE3. Meanwhile, AoE2 fails to portray the 100 Years Wars or the Reconquista in a meaningful way.

7. Campaigns:
The japanese and India campaigns are awesome and really do teach. If you are buying to play singleplayer, then adquire the game in a deal (non americans websites offer singleplayer-only copies 100% off). The fantasy ones are meh, i didn't liked the ones with native americans. It doesn't have as many like AoE2, but the AoK nerds who hate on AoE3 campaigns don't even know who Joan of Arc is.

AoE3 is a terrible game to get into today. It was excusable before 2016 or something, but not today. Multiplayer is a mess never to be fixed. If you want to play AoE3 multiplayer, try AoE3: Cash Grab Edition, i mean, Definitive Edition. I played the closed beta of AoE3 DE, and i don't recommend it too.
But if it had one entire year focused to fixing these things, the game would be a thumbs up. Unlik AoE2, AoE3 can be fixed (but it wont in the definitive edition, because screw it)",1609021131,1609021131,False,5,1,0.48353809118270874,0,True,False,False

And I remembered why it was my favorite RTS.
The game isn't perfect, even with nostalgia lenses on, has A LOT of balance issues. But it still is a blast to play with friends. Haven't hopped in the online multiplayer yet, can't say if there is a lot of action.

There is a steep learning curve with this game. The expert AI is very easy, but once you know what to do, you will learn enough to be able to beat 7 other expert AI teamed up against you solo. You will be able to play online and have some success if you are willing to learn the unconventional strategy this game requires. You cannot adopt a ""Turtle"" strategy in this game. It does not work. I love Turtling in RTS games but in Aoe3 you MUST control the WHOLE MAP with walls or units/millitary buildings. Your success relies on gathering the RAW resources not the infinite options like mills or plantations and KILLING enemy settlers to stop them from getting access to those resources and Tradeposts. If you are lucky enough to be the one on the attack then 9 times out of 10 you have already won. If you are defending you have to survive and pray your opponent will make a mistake. You must know a basic build order. Once you understand what a build order is you must create your own, because there is no build order online that is perfect. They only work if play in a certain way so by making your own build order you will optimize your strategy eventually. Make multiple ""Decks"" and try them out. No civilization is worth playing until you lvl them past lvl 50 so play on easy to get the experience unless you enjoy a headache. After lvl 50 build your deck and switch straight to expert to see what it is like. You will learn that the expert AI actually does not understand the strategy of this game at all and you will have fun. Then try online play. I wrote all this because I absolutely love this game, all 3 of its campaigns, Original, War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties, I love just playing against expert AI to relax, I love playing online with the small but friendly community and i love trying new strategies.

It was one of the last things my father purchased for me before he passed, because I asked for it for Christmas. I like the fast pace that training blocks of units and playing home city cards makes. Rushing in Colonial is always fun. 

There were a couple of politically correct bits in the campaigns added in that I don't like - the stilted narrative of the Turks telling an order of Crusaders to ""get with the times"", Washington referring to ""the holidays"" rather than ""Christmas"" (like most English speaking people before 2000)... it's not VERY annoying. But the main campaigns of AOE3 and The Warchiefs come off as politically self-conscious fanfiction rather than any real story about the periods being portrayed, and it's just not as compelling. The Asian Dynasties campaigns are the best in my opinion. 

Online play is where it's really at. You don't have as many options as AOE2, and deck-building can be daunting for new players, but I remember playing many hours online. Plus there have been several custom maps and RM scripts, my favourite being LoSt (a custom random map where you sail around with an explorer picking up treasurers to get enough wood to make a town center). I had the most fun with Colonial Age rushes and paradoxically no-rush 40 minute matches where you build your base and then have at it. Ah, good times.

Personally, I prefer the simplified resource and tech tree compared with AoE2. Does AoE3 require less skill to manage than AoE2? Yes, but it still has enormous depth and requires careful management of resources just like AoE2 and micro managing correctly early will provide huge advantages over someone who does not (think for example, having you settlers/villagers shoot game so the game moves towards your town centre).

I prefer this over AoE2 because it lets me focus more on the things I enjoy - the combat, large armies and indeed, very unique armies depending on the race. Units and races have genuine strengths and weaknesses. That you can choose your homecity deck provides a level of depth not available in AoE2. Do you stack unit cards to get an early rush? Or do you risk economy or unit strength multipliers that over a longer game provide you with advantages over a unit stacker? Such options! I love getting natives involved for a unique edge (harassing, cannon fodder or whatever you choose) as well as fighting for control of trading posts.

For anyone new to AoE, or indeed strategy games like this, you will not be disappointed as this is the most accessible of the AoE titles available

Single player:
Main story: all acts were good, i really liked 1 and 2 though.
DLC: Asian Dynasties: Japan was nice, China was fun but ended abruptly, wanted to play more. India: good (predictive slightly, but fun)
DLC Native Americans: Both acts were really good. 
Multiplayer:
I ever had friends in this game so never played online, LAN was fun, but mostly i play against AI/computer.
Overall, it's good, game has many settings, I wish it had more ""alliances"" options when playing with teams.

Not a lot of people play online, and many who do play with modded versions of the game, which fragments the playerbase.  Single player is a bit dull due to AI that will make very questionable decisions.

I enter the LAN House, pay R$5 (less than a dollar) for an hour of time and go sit on one of the brown stained office chairs in the back. I'm not here to read and write emails, and I don't have friends to play CS 1.6 over LAN, so Age of Empires 3 it is.

Unironically, I had decided to follow my Dad's advice to stop playing violent video games (GTA San Andreas) after he found out what I'd been spending my lunch money on. Play something educational and real instead, he said. Naturally, a game about pillage and conquest; New World Order conspiracies; and hundreds of bodies seemed a better fit so I fired this up instead.

Ten year old me was never good at resource management, so finishing the campaign took an obscene amount of time, if I didn't get frustrated with a mission and call in cheats instead.

Skirmish mode kept me busier for even longer, but it was all the same and it grew boring eventually. Factions had a few different units a piece, but to be competitive you had to collect cards for each nation. Cards allowed you to send provisions to your colony, such as resources or powerful units, that you couldn't get elsewhere. The only way to collect new cards was by playing each nation, putting you at a disadvantage compared to a high level nation that you'd been playing for a while. And some cards took a long, long, long time to acquire. It didn't help that the AI was very passive on the lower difficulties, or a souped up monster on the higher ones (because it cheated). 

Returning to it nearly 12 years later has been nostalgic, but not in a good way. Limits that were there before are still there. Limited cards in your deck, limited unit counts, limited buildings, limited outposts, limited ships... Naturally, there are mods that address this, but I wanted the experience as intended. The campaign itself has good structure, but the missions usually boil down to a simple formula. You, the player, start at a very disadvantaged and underpowered position and have to go fetch, build, or destroy something. There's not a lot of variety to it. And when they do try to add variety, such as the mission in the Andes it is just plain awful. For example, in that mission you have to go hopping from campfire to campfire to avoid dying from exposure. On top of that, you can't recruit any soldiers, just 'find' them on the map. Perhaps a good mission for Company of Heroes, which is a game all about tactics. But in AOE 3, you often have little control over your units and who they attack. And if you try moving them away, most units slow down to a crawl, so the enemy can hit them without taking damage (even cavalry).

Overall, I'm happy with the entertainment this provided to me as a kid. But, now this one needs to go back in the dusty old toy bin of sacred childhood memories.

-A wide pick of civilizations to choose from, and it is recommended that you play the Asian Dynasties version as you will get 6 more nations.

It gives you Sandbox mode to see how it's play easy is enemy will attack but with a very small force, but if put any harder if you will need to be ready if you have no idea where or when it's coming.

As for the graphs, its Blocky but readable, the buildings when they get hit pieces fly when they get hit.

This game is something else. The graphics are striking even today, with really cook Havok-based physics, sweet graphics, it has a soothing effect stemming from its setting, the wonderful map design and down to its artistic style that make it a great game. The saddest thing about the game's history is that its developer Ensemble Studios has been shut down by Microsoft (the utter despicable cretins), but the best thing is that Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition is dropping on the 15th of October. 
From a gameplay standpoint, it is very complex, expansive, the Home City Card Deck is a strategy-deciding element and you are extremely motivated to play the game a lot, only to unlock cards and build your deck. You end up with utterly unlike decks if you are going against one opponent, if you are part of a team, if you play on water or land or if you decide to rush, turtle or boom. 
All-in-all: Awesome Game with almost endless replayability, thanks to it being a package in which you can fight your very own way by using your own strategy and perks. 
11/11 I will always recommend it and Definitive Edition will fix any crappy ESO internet matchmaking issue, to make it even Awesomer! \m/",1600005878,1600006094,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Instead it's more of an RTS deck-builder where you play and get allotted new cards to further establish and improve your home city. While in game, you can access your home city for shipments that can ship anything from resources to troops to you colony. 

Speaking of resources, there are no more mines, farms, and wood-mills. Instead the villagers will just automatically collect wood from the trees without having to walk it back to your village, and if you want infinite gold or food, you can build a plantation or farm, where you place villagers to constantly gather goods at a slow rate. This streamlining of the grind for resources allows for less micromanaging and more troop building and exploring.

Oh did I say exploring? Yes I did. At the start of every match you get an explorer who's soul purpose is to wonder the map and establish trade routes that help you accumulate extra resources periodically, and to capture treasures that are scattered about the map, usually guarded by enemies. Proper utilization of the explorer early on can get you an advantage in resources.

All in all, solid game, but if you're looking for AOE II but improved, you will probably be disappointed. All of the changes that the developers implemented completed change the infrastructure of the game, making it feel different on a fundamental level.

If you don't think your PC can run the new version, or you just want an in-depth review of the current one, keep reading.

If you still want this game before October 15, I'd say it's pretty good. It has 14 civilizations, a card/ability building feature, and really cool physics. If you're looking for a game like AoE2 though, this feels completely different, from the playstyle to the units.

-Card/Ability System: Each civ has tons of cards they can unlock, from free units, to new abilities. Each group has a lot of cards to choose from. You start out at level 10, and as you play more and level up, you can unlock more cards. You can also create multiple decks, like a deck comprised of eco cards, or a deck containing a lot of military ability cards. Overall, it's a really cool system that adds some pretty neat progression to the game.

-14 Civilizations: There are 14 civilizations currently in the game, each coming in a group. 
   -Europeans: The Europeans have access to the late game building, the Capitol, 
        containing some late game techs that have fairly large bonuses. They also have 
        access to forts, which are very powerful defensive structures, and they have access to 
        factories, which produce resources or artillery.

   -Asians: The Asian civs come with a wonder with each age, giving each civ unique 
        bonuses. They also have access to the consulate, granting them access for a few other 
        civilization's units. Each Asian civ has very unique bonuses.

   -American Civs: These civs tend to revolve around campfire dances, which grant unique 
        units and resources. These civs also have bonuses with building outposts with native 
        tribes.

-Graphics/Physics: In terms of graphics, this game doesn't seem too outdated. the Definitive Edition will definitely look a lot better, but for what this has it's not too bad. Cannon balls have hitboxes that send units, trees, and pieces of buildings flying. The physics of buildings falling looks awesome. Pieces of buildings are slowly chipped off as they are damaged more, and completely collapse once they are destroyed. This game is also 3D, so it is possible to rotate the camera (though I wouldn't recommend it - it's hard to move the camera in the default position once it's moved). 

-Gameplay: In terms of gameplay, this game is really cool. There are 5 ages, each allowing access to new cards, techs, and units. There are a decent amount of units to choose from for each civ, and all of them have a unique purpose. Each civ is different from the others. Each one has unique units, unique access to unit upgrades, and unique bonuses. There are lots of maps to pick from, and every experience is different. My only problems in terms of gameplay is the static population limit of 200, and the fact that there can only be 2 teams in a game.

tl;dr: I'd give it a 9/10. It's an overall awesome game with unique gameplay, awesome mechanics, and unique civilizations. Again though, I'd wait for the definitive edition unless you don't think your computer can run the new version properly (you can check at the bottom of the AoE3 DE page to see if you can run it).

 Among many this game has some weaknesses that make it not so good. Some things were simplified, such as gathering resources - now there are 3 instead of 4 of them and your villagers don't have to come back to the lumberjack or the city center to store them. 
Many smaller tweaks and adjustments, and of course a heavy focus on musket fights, artillery and the transition from Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution and fatrher away into the 19'th Century.

 It's a shame that there weren't any additional elements added to the Steam release of the game thus far. Maybe in the future...
Controls being one of the more touchy ones. For instance, to change the hotkeys you need to manually go through each tab. There is also no Steam Cloud either.

Moreover, the persistence of the hometown leveling feels like a gimmick. It's useful in the singleplayer campaign for a sense of progression, but not so much in the skirmishes/multiplayer part. 
Also, it's a shame that the Steam release does not bring any unification of the multiplayer accounts. I always keep forgetting the login/pass for this game. Microsoft seems to focus a lot on AOE 1 and 2 remasters/remakes that it forgot about how bothersome online multiplayer can get in this game.

This game is 10+ old. But this edition is by far the best one yet (until GOG publishes it). You get all the expansions. Working multiplayer with a community that still lives. And of course that same old strategy many remember and honor as ""one of the best"".

The modest presentation of its ancestors passed away. I'd say that the magnificence of the soundtrack itself says a lot. The Musical score is composed by musicians Stephen Rippy and Kevin McMullan. 

If History is of any interest to you, if the New World conquests/Asian campaigns were something you're keen on, get this, especially when on sale!

Age of Empires III stands as one of the best RTS games, and with good reason. It offers so many ways to play offline and on. 

Make your own custom battles pit people from different eras and culture against one another for your own twisted amusement. 

Play the campaign where you'll be treated to decent stories set in historical times, with a few cameos from actual historical figures. 

Play the skirmish mode pitting yourself against AI commanders. 

The expansion packs are well worth the money too as it gives you so much more to work with,

I recommend this game when it is working, but not in its current state on Windows 10. Right now the game stalls when saving, gradually loses unit sound, voices, and eventually music. You lose control of your grouping, selecting controls (like adding a person to the selection, etc.) and eventually the game can even lock up. Even when exiting and forcing Steam to close it can still make it so you have to reboot. I have fooled around and fixed some of the issues, but the game is still a dud in its current state. If you have an older OS you may be in luck. OK, enough warning, now a review.

This game, while not its predecessor, is still a great game. The single player story line is not historical, but is still a fun story that takes place over several generations of a family through a historical setting. The add-on War Chiefs follows the same family, but a different storyline. The Asian Dynasties add-on features 3 different Asian countries in their own scenarios. I didn't care much for multiplayer, so I won't review that. The overall game mechanics are decent. Path finding is decent, but units still often get stuck, twirl around, etc. It's easy to get attacked and not realize it. Sometimes there is no warning other than a small amount of ""bad"" color on your mini-map and you all of a sudden realize your base is being sacked. Difficulty is settable and I recommend Easy for people new to the genre as it is pretty easy for new people vs. many other RTS games. A last meh moment is when you realize resources are littered EVERYWHERE, and I do mean littered. You'll want to harvest stuff just to get it out of your way. Fortunately in this game the characters can harvest where they are rather than having to run back and forth to a building, so that's a big difference vs. many other RTS games. Overall a good game (when it works), but make sure you know how to get it working or that you have an older OS that it may work on before you buy it.",1595381244,1595381244,False,6,3,0.49101141095161438,0,True,False,False

A good introduction, in fact. I don't play online, I just like messing with the AI, building my base until it's a fortress that I'm proud of and I'm not even going to attack until I'm deep enough in a skirmish or if someone goes aggro on me. But hey, that's just me and my preference. It's my way of having fun. And I recommend this to anyone with a similar taste. Some cons that it does have is that 200 population limit, maybe some other civilizations may have more, but I've yet to encounter it. Yeah, I just want more troops I guess hahaha. Also, maybe the camera can have the functionality to be zoomed out a bit more.

 If you like the Command and Conquer series, I'm definitely recommending this one. Not just this game either, but the whole franchise! I hope AOE3 does release more expansions and feature other nations/civilizations. Cheers!",1594567349,1594567349,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When it first game out, I don't think the RTS community was ready for many of its novel developments--at the time they seemed more like gimmicks than depth-builders. After a decent amount of multiplayer, I can say with confidence that Age 3 gets away from multitudes of redundant research and unit types, and that it instead hones in on a multitude of play styles that work well alone or in groups.

Pros:
+Strong campaigns
+Solid, highly replayable multiplayer
+Home cities give needed sense of progression/collection
+Games are easily (win or lose) doable in small chunks of time, perfect for aging or new gamers
+Most races play differently enough that you can choose how you want to win, build a strategy identity, and coordinate different styles and bonuses with human players

Cons:
-UI did not age well
-Graphics are okay as long as you don't zoom in
-Weird sound glitches that will blast your eardrums out periodically
-Can't build walls over trade routes
-Some units are highly overpowered, like horse guns (although all are able to be countered)
-Some friends on Linux have connectivity issues with Age 3's proprietary online system (ESO)
-AI does not do so well on maps that leave them landlocked sometimes

Highly recommend, even if you don't remember liking it years ago.",1594140624,1594141111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. Low online player base: Hard to find players specially when i play Asian Dynasties. 

3. 'ESO Connection was lost' : Your ESO connection can get lost even after Victory Now. So no matter how hard you try to rank-up, you cant.

Everything in the UI is oversized as if designed for the elderly or visually impaired - AH, but the icons themselves are convoluted enough that you really cant tell what you're building all too well.

Gone is the soft gridding system where you could measure your placement of objects in the world. Now things snap-to, which is great for building houses, but terrible for building literally anything else.

I like that my people, the Cree, have some soft representation in the game, but that would be it's only redeeming quality. 

The movement speed of all units is sluggish at best, and ""light cavalry"" on horseback hardly outpaced ground units. Conversely, mortar/artillery units move even slower and take up much more room on the screen.

Zooming is awful. You're pushed in about 50% further, removing much of the tactical advantage you had in AoE2. The weird concept of ""receiving supplies from home"" is bad. Just...bad. 

I'm highly disappointed that I couldn't return this game fast enough. I'd rather skirmish endlessly on AoE2 than play this game another minute.

But the unfortunate thing that everyone with a newer computer must know before buying. The game does not support higher res. It will crash every time you change the res and every time you try to put it into windowed mode. The work arounds online don't work at all. at least they didn't for me. Going into config files and changing the res on each game of the AOE collection didn't work either. i highly recommend anyone with a newer computer just wait for the definitive edition of the game to come out. so until then i have to give it a thumbs down since there are problems present that are game ruining bugs,1593548733,1593548733,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros-

#1.Old school strategy game

#2.Many units to pick from and upgrades

#3.For a game that is almost 16 years old the graphics still look decent



Cons-

#1.2020 price of $39.99 full price you got to be kidding me.They clearly think they will make money off players who played and liked the game before vs getting new players to try it for that insane price


#2.The graphics are almost 16 years old so better check them out first



The Bottom Line-


This game is still good for people that love the genre.You into starcraft? You into command and conquer? You into age of mythology? You like stronghold hd and stronghold crusader? You into dawn of war? You into company of heroes?


Get it on a steam sale though I am not sure they ever have one?

If you can get the game for $10 or less you should be happy with that.

The world looks good in the updated 3D aspect, and the factions are very interesting, but there's something missing here in terms of personality and efficiency of play. The setting is still a fantastic idea, however. The art direction is strong, and you get a pretty exact sense of where you are supposed to be and what you are supposed to feel, that being a sense of colonial adventure. The sound design is solid but not as tactile or well-placed as the last game. The gameplay itself is little changed, and the changes they did make streamlined gameplay somewhat. This gameplay is sometimes stubborn and unit commands sometimes unclear, but beyond that functions well. Overall, Age of Empires III is a respectable installment in the Age of Empires series, but not really quite as good as some of the other options available to the player.

Behold: a mediocre game dwarfed by the shadows of its predecessors.

I wish I could tell you Age of Empires III were an awful game. That would make things a lot easier, wouldn't it? But it's not quite terrible. Don't get me wrong--it's not a good game, either. It embraces mediocrity in a way that few games ever do. And in most contexts, that would be fine. There's plenty of room in this world for mediocre RTS games, after all. Just... not mediocre Age of Empires games. That's just sacrilege, really.

So, what's the problem? Half of it is Age of Empires being one of the greatest real-time strategy games of all time. The other half of it is Age of Empires II being one of the [i]other[/i] greatest real-time strategy games of all time. You can see why this is one of those games diehard fans like to pretend does not exist.

For me, personally, two things made Age of Empires II: Age of Kings such a memorable, standout experience. First were the incredibly engrossing combat mechanics, where you were given large, fairly open maps with free reign to tackle as you saw fit. Virtually any strategy could be accommodated, and particularly dynamic contests between equally skilled players could last more than an hour, with dozens of different tactics and counter-tactics being utilized. And the other thing? The brilliant single-player campaign, which taught an entire generation of players--myself included--to love history. Age of Kings' single player mode was divided between several different campaigns, each set in a different historical period (and, very refreshingly, many were set in non-Western histories which are usually overlooked in popular media). Each campaign typically focused on a specific historical figure, usually a great general, and served equal parts character study, military history, and cultural primer. The game took many liberties with the history in service of accessibility and gameplay, and while I may not, now, agree with all of the decisions they made... for the time Age of Kings' campaigns were very progressive, very unique, and--most importantly--very refreshing.

And you know exactly where this is going: Age of Empires III has none of that. The maps tend to feel small and linear, the available tactics at any given time few (a real-time strategy game with little in the way of strategy) and the campaigns, such as they are, go full Hollywood. There's no respect for the history being depicted here, nor (by extension) for the players. Where prior Age of Empires games used their gameplay to explore history and make the stories of our past come alive in a way that static text could never hope to parallel, Age of Empires III sees its historical settings as mere backdrop. Set-dressing. It's uninspiring and inconsequential and utterly, relentlessly intolerable from any game bearing the Age of Empires game.

Age of Empires III is a disgrace.

It's a good starter RTS game for those who are new to the genre. It's simple and has straight froward mechanics which are easy to use and enjoy.
Compared to some other RTS games, I still come back to this because of how enjoyable it is and how how little I have to micromanage as well as not having to use massive brain tactics all the time. It's also more faster pace than most other RTS games, but fast as in not tediously slow where most other RTS games have very slow movement and less fighting.
It's also quite unique in the way that you get to build multiple structures all over the map and the treaty mechanic is really nice to have so you could build up peacefully until the treaty is over.

The sound design and animations holds up quite well for a game that is over a decade old as of this review in June 3rd of 2020.
There are many other features as well, not found in the regular game until it is open in the options, such as more HUD on production queues, detailed descriptions and advanced formations, which are really neat to play with, especially trapping enemy AI villagers who are deforesting everything lol.

I'm surprised that there's still a large community playing this outdated game lmoa.
There's even on going events as well as an Age of Empires IV in development as of this post, which I'm hoping to play with even more better graphics, mechanics and features on an already well designed game.

Overall, it's a great game that was well thought out, with a lot of unique nations to play and their own play styles, which is not common in other RTS games. Everything also comes with actual historical info which describes how they were invented, used and how they functioned in what era.

One big change between 2 & 3 is resource management is easier. In 3, gold and stone is simplified to one thing. Also you don't need to worry so much about your villagers carrying stuff back to base.

Select between many countries and defend your home city/colony in skirmish mode, play online multiplayer with up to 8 players! Create a home city and level up to customize it! Make cities, forts, and train soldiers and war ships to defend your base with over 35 new maps to try out and explore! Create your own heroic explorer for your country and use him/her in skirmish mode!
Play the exciting 3 original campaigns stories with 2 new campaign stories to enjoy with the DLCS installed!
There is loads to do in this game and it just never get's old, always loved playing this game. One of my all time favourite!

In-game music is great and the graphics are pretty good and you can create your own levels/maps with the scenario editor! Have fun using brand new hilarious cheat console commands lol :-D

Classic World war game, much fun and is absolutely fantastic! Best age of empires game by a long shot!
This is a must have game for your steam library!
This is a really great game this but I would most like to see an James Cameron Avatar age of empires game as well, be even cooler :-D

Obviously it all turns into a zerg fest of units, so that doesnt matter, the setting or time period as i have stated is boring, the campaigns and ""upgrading"" your home city does not redeem the boring and only adds to it. it was a mistake buying it hoping i could like it, they need to remake AOE2 with these graphics, maybe even add in a choice to slowly upgrade yourself from the feudal age to this time period but its been years and all they made was a failed cash grab of some online free version of itself dumbed down for 8 year olds.

Its just not worth it unless you like this time period, I dont, the ages before and after it were much more fun to me.

Takes elements of Rise of Nations and combines them with the classic gameplay of AoE2, add a customizable deck building element, and add a dash of Warcraft 3 style asymmetry.

The economy resembles RoN, where each settler provides some trickle rate of resources, this actually makes the difference of food types meaningful as the trickle rate of farms is separated in tech from the hunting and herding ones. This is exacerbated by some civilizations having different approaches to economy (subtle, but changes game play enough to make it a unique experience) for example Indians require wood for villagers and receive them with any card from the deck building element mentioned above, Ottomans have free settlers for the cost of a slow spawn rate, and the Dutch require Gold but have a building that generates free gold.

When it comes to unique units, this game has a unique spread that really forces meaningful army building and considerations when teaming up with other players to account for your weaknesses. For example the Ottoman tree is nearly unique, they only share artillery units with the rest of the European civilizations, each civ get unique techs and unit upgrades that further accentuates their strengths and weaknesses. This leads to some really interesting army compositions, the Dutch favoring Ruyters (Dragoons), Skirmishers and Halberdiers, whereas the Russian player might spam a crap ton of Strelets only to use one of their unique civilization cards to transform them into Musketeers. Even unit tactics are diverse, for example Musketeers range attacks are great against all enemies, but for maximum efficiency you actually want to set them to meele and charge them into Skirmisher lines or even after shooting cavalry. A historical nuance that is delightful to consider.

When it comes to the Native American and Asian civilizations there is a lot of unique offerings as well. The Sioux are like the Huns in AoE2, and provide a really interesting game play variation, they are banned from a lot of MP tournaments as they are be exploited extremely well.

That is another note, AoE3 has a vibrant community called ESO Community. They have a standalone installer for a patch and provides plenty of interesting tools to play with.

Mods such as Wars of Liberty add to the content and extend playtime by adding even a new Age to play with.

I absolutely love this game and have thousands of hours on it across the ten years I've owned it. The price point is awfully steep to be honest, despite my bias and love for this game I think 40 USD is overpriced. Game goes on sale relatively frequently for about 75% off which is awesome, wait to buy it then and THEN play the shit out of it.

The multiplayer in this game is awesome, it's a fantastic game to play with friends especially during current events. If you have no friends, (like I did when I first started playing) you will inevitably make some. Still a good amount of loyal players playing the game.

Classical AoE game with a Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanics of units. It's not maybe that dynamic like other RTS games (Warcraft, Rise of nations, Command & Conquer) but it has a lot of options like Deathmatch where the game is more dynamic and less economic focused. 
Being good at this game requires a typical RTS skills but also due to Home City also skills of building a deck that suits your play style.

Campain is pretty boring, easy and short but was fun after all.

Graphics with this all cannon animating is beautiful also the sound effect of firing guns.

There is one main theme which is good, but other soundtracks are decent and nothing special.

The main problem with Age of Empires 3 starts with the campaign. Age of Empires 2 has a captivating campaign based on real live historical generals and battles. Imagine playing Montezuma, Joan of Arc and Vlad Dracul Tepes. It's amazing. Age of Empires 3 is completely fictional and they pretty much introduce the Illuminati into it. It's like watching a bad Nicholas Cage movie. The balancing in Age of Empires 2 is next to none. I doubt DOTA 2 is as balanced as Age of Empires 2. Age of Empires 3... Not so much. The completely different build orders, units, strengths and the card system lends itself to giving decade long players a huge edge (and incentive to spam the same civilizations and units). A lot of strategy was taken out of the game by  removing mining camps and lumber camps. One of the very best features of Age of Empires 2 was the midgame and endgame strategy based around harassing other peoples resource camps. Ya know... Killing their peasants that tried to sneakily build a commune stashed in the corner of the map by sending a few hussars. Age of Empires 2 succesfully manages to make each civilization unique for different types of gameplay.. Going to rush? Pick a civilization with starting farm technology and extra food. Going to boom economy? Build a civilization with an economical edge. Going to be defensive? Pick a civilization with stronger buildings and walls. Age of Empires 3 probably can't really be played this way because a few civilizations completely dominate the game, and a few players who have been playing them for years have full card decks for them. If you don't have the cards then I guess you have to collect them but competitive play shouldn't give long time players a handicap. It should give new players a handicap. At any rate, I'm hating the campaign. I'm playing it and I hate it. It's depressing in every way. I play Age of Empires 2 campaign and I get to live vicariously through the great Inca warlords. I play Age of Empires 3 and now I'm suddenly battling a secret organization controlling the great non-existent battles between the Ottoman empire and the Scottish. I mean......... Seriously?! 

If Age of Empires 4 turns out like Age of Empires 3 or Dawn of War 3 I will never play a Relic game again. Relic is still one of my favorite game publishers despite their attempt to use Dawn of War to break into the MOBA esport market. They will be my least favorite if they try to turn Age of Empires 4 into anything but an enhanced version of Age of Empires 1 and 2. Crossing my fingers.

GAMEPLAY _
If you looking for classic AoE 3 gameplay, you got this here. With same building as previous old AoE3, but just with enhanced 3d graphichs.

SOUND EFFECTS _
Sound effects aree cool and historic, i mean in aoe franchise,

GRAPHIC _
Graphic is good with 3d Graphic

CONTROLS _
If you play other aoe series you'll stuck will terrible control of this game.. the control is worst, if you try to assign the new key, they will reset when you leave the game, and it will be set default when you start it again. ESC button is not plenty being use in this game.. you need to click the damn Menu button up there tu pause the game, or just click the game worst hotkey.

USER INTERFACE_
User interface in this game doesnt even have HD picture, its stretched.. and its not cool..

ACHIEVEMENTS_
THERE IS NO ACHIEEEEVEMNTSSSSS !!!!!

Conclutions
If you wanna buy this game, better no, if you looking for the gameplay, good control, Massive units style just buy 2nd series of Aoe.

but if you have lots money, its so up to you...",1586169622,1586169622,False,0,0,0.438246995210647583,0,True,False,False

A lot of the gameplay elements feel very crisp. The home system in this game does make the campaign quite a bit easier but in skirmishes and multiplayer, it adds an interesting dimension to your strategy.

Despite the good points, I would not say this is better than AoE II. Everything in AoE II felt a lot more polished. Graphics were better. Music was better. And the campaigns were better. AoE II was better made, and yet it's not as fun as this one. If you're looking for top of the line RTS games, AoE III probably would not make the list.

So for £7.50 GBP I thought I would give it a go to see if it works I got 4 hours out of it and I enjoyed it.",1585989382,1585989382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I reccomend AOE3 to anyone wanting a casual, colonial RTS with musketeers, cannons, forts, mercenaries, and so on. The original game includes 7 European civilizations and 1 Asian civilization (although is plays like the traditional Europeans), Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. The expansions also include 3 Native American civs, Iroquois, Sioux, and Aztecs, as well as 3 Asian civs, Chinese, Japanese, and Indians.
The game also includes the ability to ally with natives, and offers treasures which are guarded, but grant resources, units, and upgrades.
The campaigns, including 3 acts for the original, 2 from The War Chiefs expanding the story, and 3 for each of the Asian civilizations in The Asian Dynasties, are fun and have decent story to them, but have little in the way of challenge.
Finally, you gain experience from killing enemies and building units. Experience is used to increase home city level which allows you to pick new cards to add to a deck, and gain shipments which can send a single card per shipment.

Amazing stories, albeit a bit cookie-cutter as they all follow the same model of one main character who gets backstabbed by another main character, and you almost always have a companion of some sort. The fictional stories are told quite well though, and are usually intertwined with historical events like the Revolutionary War or India's fight against the British, and even speculated events like Chinese visiting the New World (I don't know why they would sail Westward through the Indian Ocean, under Africa, then through the Atlantic though instead of just going East through the Pacific lol). Some of the campaign maps are challenging and unique also, for example Valley Forge has you chopping wood and building houses in the beginning with your soldiers, but you have to make sure to go near a campfire to regain your HP as the ""cold"" will drain your units life slowly until you have enough houses built. All in all a great game, it's a shame that multiplayer has issues with it as I worked pretty hard back in 2006 to get all my home cities to lvl 100 or so to unlock all my cards in vanilla. The expansions are great though, Japan has a strong eco, India strong units, and China just masses tons of units cheaply. The Native American civs are probably the weakest though, but that's to be expected. Buy this game, whether it's on sale or not, if you love RTS you will love this! Also to the people saying it's MORE complicated than AoE2, this game is actually LESS complicated, 1 farm for 10 villagers thats infinite, 1 plantation (coin or gold) for 10 villagers thats infinite, I mean how much simpler can you get in terms of micro-managing your eco? The home city cards and decks look daunting and big but once you read through them all and know what they do you realize most of them you will never use, and other certain cards are must-haves, so deciding how to make your deck is easy, especially when you gradually level your home city and start replacing cards for better ones.",1583788426,1583788426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AOE 3 may not have as large a roster of civilizations; most notably European ones, which is why I believe there is such disinclination towards this one. I feel that AOE 3 introduces a unique spin to the series with the card system of home city management. Each civ has it's own respective units, passive abilities; as well as buildings. The two expansions brought three Native American tribes and three Asian civs, each with their own unique type of playstyle. I would also like to make mention that your worker units don't have to carry resources back to the town center, they collect right on the spot where they're gathering.

It's somewhat like AoE 2, where you explore and expand, and stop your foes from doing the same.
(no such thing as Wonder victory or Wonder race; you win only by domination.)
The game offers several ""archetypes"" of random maps, each of which is based on a geographical region in the Americas. In the beginning of a random map game, you are always informed what archetype is chosen by the game, so you know very well what geographic features and distribution of resources to expect, but still have to explore as you do in other strategy games to know how things are actually laid out.
The computer-controlled players can get pretty smart with their strategies. They don't cheat and manage their units on a per-unit basis, so in battles it's often possible to outmaneuver them when outnumbered. It's not easy though, because duh, micromanaging is kind of hard, and the game doesn't assist you a lot in this aspect. Also, computer players taunt you A LOT.
Since AoE 3 is based off the history of colonization, it features a ""home city"" system that supplies extra units, productivity or technology in-game for your colonial economy, via ""shipments"". Two elements in this system make it unique (not necessarily fun):
1. In each game, your home city can only supply you a prearranged, limited variety of things. You make the arrangement before the beginning of the game, and while in-game, you choose from within that arrangement what to receive. Each civilization offers a slightly different pool of ""shipment cards"" for you to pick and play.
2. The more you play as a certain civilization (and its home city), the further that city grows, giving you more options as it ""levels up"". As a useless bonus, home cities allow you to customize their cosmetic appearance as they level up.
The game does have some other features inspired by colonization, such as explorers (very weak hero units that don't really level up), controlling trade routes and befriending native American tribes, but those are rather inconsequential.
The campaigns are decent, especially the vanilla campaign, which gets quite engaging and somewhat emotional at times. The expansions, by comparison, are rather forgettable.

I mostly play the Age of series, so I can't really compare it to any of the Shogun or similar titles. Within the Age series, I do much prefer Age of Kings. I consider it's military leanings and more diverse unit types to be superior to III. One thing that III suffers from is the time that it came out. Computers were not that powerful when this game was released. The developers deliberately went for a 'realistic' look to the models and environments in the game. Sadly, this game is a victim of the times. The unit count is low compared to Age of Kings and to try and spice it up, there is a card system that tries to variate the gameplay. It works, and allows you to have different decks for different occasions/locations/opponents. Kudos to Ensemble for trying to give you a different game experience and not just ladling out more of the same.  it's a valid way to try and get away from some of the formulas of Age of Kings. I just don't agree that it was any better than that game, and the lack of military focus has weakened it further. 

Another problem is the time frame chosen. The Colonial period gives plenty of story and character examples to work with. The downside is that you don't get the full range of bizzarely entertaining units that occur in Age of Kings. There were never any gigantic crossbow elephants roaming around colonial New York, and the game feels more hollow for that omission. Thankfully the Warchiefs expansion adds in Asian and American Indian units to spice up the battles.

So, to sum up. AoE III is a brave attempt to expand the remit and tactics of your now standard 'Empires' game.  There are problems with unit numbers and a lack of variety in fighters due to the history period chosen and the technological limits of when the game was developed. Overall it's a win though and well worth playing. 

I've been bitching about the game, but it's still a lot of fun. The voice actors have a whale of a time with their lines. Cuauhtemoc sounds rather un-hinged, as he constantly chants for ""Blood - MOAARRR BLOOD!!!!"". The voices of the other generals are suitably dripping in scorn and contempt towards you, the player. Thus further motivating you to want to march across the map and cuff them across the back of the head with a Congreave rocket. 

Although I prefer II, III is still a great military strategy game and comes well recommended.",1582404546,1582404546,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Aoe 3 is set in roughly the 1500 - 1800s era and mainly focuses on European colonization of America. The maps are all set in various locations in America with some extra asian maps as part of the Asian dynasties expansion that comes with the complete collection. There are 14 civs in the game, 8 European, 3 Native American and 3 Asian. The gameplay has a big focus on gunpowder units and artillery and the game is generally determined on how well you can micro your gunpowder, cavalry and artillery. It is certainly the most different Aoe, it takes away alot of the past mechanics, mainly with economy management, but adds several new ones, it still feels like Aoe, but it is rather different. You have a home city that you can send shipments from as you gain xp in the game which include resources, units, upgrades, and building wagons. This system is fun and compliments the games era and gameplay really well. You can also build plantations which are like farms for gold so you can have unlimited gold. You can now train military units in up to blocks of 5 as well. These new mechanics and several other new ones really change the gameplay, its fun, but for the upcoming aoe 4 id rather go back to aoe2/aom classic gameplay.

- There is progression. After each game, you earn experience for whichever ""home city"" you're playing, which allows you to buy new cards to customize your civilizations. This is possibly the games greatest strength, as it makes playing each game actually mean something.
- Each civilization feels different from the others due to their individual strengths and weaknesses, though many of their units are shared. The DLC civs are all even more different with new and unique unit/building types.
- The game's balance is off, so some nations can be better than others, which means PvP suffers. I don't play for PvP, though.
- The gameplay is different from AoE2, so don't you go into this expecting more of the same. It's still an RTS, and there are many similarities, but many things are different. (For instance, settlers instantly deposit what they gather, so there's no travel time.)
- This is a time period that is seldom represented in games (around the colonial era), so it feels fresh.
- Microsoft rarely offers this game for sale, so if it's on sale, and you're curious about it, you should pick it up.

In relation to what AOE3 provides that the previous titles don't, is the introduction of a 'build a deck' feature that allows you to customise your shipment cards as you gain XP and level up. A really good feature added in a nutshell!

Collecting resources is much faster in comparison to AOE2. Villagers/settlers now collect from the resource point. They do not have to walk to a mill or build a mine to collect various resources. The resources collected go straight into your total resources immediately. The market will substantially improve the pace of collecting resources. 
 
Advancement in era of focus means the units themselves are stronger but, much of the mechanics in AOE2 still carry over. e.g. Capitol replaces the improvements you found in castles etc. 

Ships are so good! They are big, strong, and very good at protecting water resources. Be weary as some units and buildings are very good against them! (Outpost and Fort). 

There are cannons that are deadly against infantry as long as you protect them, their high damage is crippled by their low HP to balance the game. 

Infantry are more formidable and get much stronger as you improve them. 

Different colony/factions have different strengths. British have superior navy and do get the extra settler per house built etc. 

AI is kinda dumb so dont expect it to be good enough to train you to pro level, you will need to master the hotkeys! For a game that is almost 15 years old, I can't really take points off for the AI.

Look at guides for each civilisation, but starting with the British civ is not a bad idea to get used to the game mechanics. Relatively easy to master.

Etc....

Great game as long as you dont pay full price. Wait for a sale.",1579190437,1579190437,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And like Civ IV, I think AOE III is totally underrated. Its graphics are colorful and expansive, its gameplay is tight and loads of fun, and it manages to bring that AOE quality to a more modern era. My only two big criticisms are that I wish it had more civilizations (even with the expansions there's only like a dozen total civs, which seems odd given that the civs mostly aren't super different mechanically, unlike Age of Mythology), and that the main campaign is kinda hokey. I think AOE III would benefit from a Forgotten Empires renovation, but they're understandably busy elsewhere.

Like I said the game itself is good as the overall gameplay is enjoyable and some useful changes have been made. However the story/campaign is utter crap. This is because it borders on sci-fi (when Age of empires is meant to be historical) and has some serious continuity errors. 

Basically the story takes you through three time eras: the late 16th century, the 1750s and some point in the 19th century (the story doesn't say but I assume its the mid/late 19th century). Across these time eras you follow multiple characters and the main plot revolves around a fountain that can alledegely provide immortality if drank from. This alone is stupid because as I said, Age of empires is meant to be a historical game. For example in the Age of empires 2 campaigns you get to follow some well known historical figures from the medieval era as well as take part in some famous historical battles from that era. Whereas in Age of empires 3 you follow the some forgettable fictional characters looking for a mythical fountain. The campaign barely gives you an explanation about the eras that your in so after completing it I felt like I had learnt nothing. My advice is if this is the first Age of empires game you are buying, don't buy it and buy the earlier entries instead as they are much better. Only buy this one if you are curious to see how dull it is compared to the other entries.

P.S Originally I wrote the explanation of the continuity errors in the campaign in this review but it was so long that it looked like an incoherent rant and you would honestly deserve a medal if you took the time to read it.

It lets you play as 14 different civilisations, each of which are unique in their own way (8 original and an extra 3 each in the two expansions). It also adds new features which the series didn't have before like:
+ Home Cities-from where you can send shipments
+ The concept of Experience Points(XP)
+ Trading posts and alliance with natives according to the map you play
+ Collecting treasures etc.
It also has other minor changes like five ages to advance through instead of four and each civilisation having more different/unique units.

Lots of cool units, full 3D, interesting setting, challenging missions, expansions, awesome destruction physics and punchy sound design make for a really great RTS experience. It's way more fun to me than RDR2. Could use some remake or at least remaster, pathfinding fixes, full steamworks integration.

Some cons: pathfinding is pretty weird and buggy, it's way too expensive for such an old game that isn't well integrated into steam. Thankfully I got it really cheap with winter sale and additional 20% off with winter tokens.

Also note: the expansions are separate .exes, you have to go to the game's install folder in order to play. Theoretically steam should display choice dialog when you run it, but it doesn't always work the first time.",1577560982,1577667298,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The civilizations are significantly more unique than Age of empires 2 (problem i had with AOE2 is that every civilization feels the same other than civ bonuses and castle units) and very different in strategies. I've owned the physical game since 2005 and got the steam version in 2013 on my other account and mostly played offline. Recently about 4 months ago i started playing online and wow I've been hooked since. For people who have never played AOE before i recommend playing offline and watching youtubers such as samurai revolution and learning some strategies. I've seen new players struggle and its mostly from not knowing the basics, but gaining experience through playing is the best thing you can do. It might seem overwhelming at first so try and use the same civilization to master one then move on to another. All in all 10/10 and currently with the winter sale this is the perfect time to get your hands on the game if you haven't already as its only 10$ while its normally going for 40$ (my only complaint about the game) which is my pretty ridiculous considering how old the game is.",1577626400,1577626400,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
