This game excells at bringing together the total war type of battle system with a more realistic campaign mode. They did really nail the realism with the units, their models and the battle system. The only two drawbacks I can point out are the old interface, and the litte variety in time and campaigns. The second world war as a setting provides a lot of room for variation, yet all the possible campaigns in this game play out in the very same 10 days of operation bargration.

919640,159406252,76561197972418588,0,26,474,176,474,1708968538,"One of the better WW2 strategy games available today. Other than certain 'sticky' UI elements (like not being able to click off units, not being able to get rid of the giant red attack-vector lines after issuing an attack order, etc), this game is both immersive and easy to interpret/easy to experience.

The singleplayer campaign is not the smoothest, and the strategy map UI makes it a bit tough to understand what's going on. But once you get into actual battles this game sings beautifully.  The core gameplay (positioning units in proper line of sight, and deploying assets based on their weapon type, the terrain, etc to execute battlefield tactics and real-time maneuvers) was done brilliantly in their other games--WARNO and Wargame.  This just skins it for WW2, but it doesn't feel half-baked. This is a full plunge into WW2 and you can feel the devs' passion for WW2 in every ounce of this game. Nothing is obviously re-used, and everything is surprisingly authentic (considering it's a video game).

Downsides?  The DLC format is a bit greedy--they put effort into it, but a lot of units are just slight variations on stuff you already own, so other than buying the DLCs that unlock American and British forces, most DLCs are for WW2 history enthusiasts and NOT your average gamer.   That, and they still haven't found a way to do random-seed maps (or at least partial-random), so you'll get tired of the same old battlefields over and over again.

I REALLY REALLY want these devs to continue with this game or with SD3. This formula is great, and they beautifully canvas the Eastern Front here.  I want Western Front + Italy. I want North Africa. I want Japan, using Wargame's naval warfare. 

Great game. Can't wait for more.  I just wish they weren't so slow with their development of games. If they could hire more staff and get more robust up-front funding, we could get more of these games and that would be a dream come true.",1709056234,1709056234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Battles in Army General, even on easy, just become a nightmare of spamming units to combat the AI rush in a desperate and boring contest of attrition to see who runs out of decent units first. After the main units run out, it's then just throwing every cannon, supply truck, and recon unit just to be the last one standing. Smaller battles have so much micro-management that you have no time to do anything else because you have to monitor every unit to keep an eye on terrain, vision, range, etc. with no degree of actual autonomy. Larger battles? Forget it. You basically have to just throw everything wherever they're needed with no hope of being able to micro-manage anything before it blows up. Artillery is cool, until the AI counterbattery fire hits you back with pinpoint accuracy from across the map. Only the air power feels decent to use. Basically if you hated Wargame, you'll definitely hate this.

That all is a huge shame, because Army General is a phenomenal game mode. It lets you take command of largely forgotten operations, using the historic Order of Battle of both sides, including some very unique and cool units, in a mode where flanking, logistics, reinforcements, reserves, and careful management of available assets is paramount to success.

I can agree about the dlc, though. It is borderline theft and designed to be confusing to get you to buy more imo. Other than that, and the fact that the game runs very hot for no reason even if graphics are on THE LOWEST setting, save resolution, it's fun. 
3.89 out of 5 stars. I would recommend Wargame RD with dlc first and maybe the first SD: Normandy 44 with Back To Hell dlc before this but it is close.

I constantly had the feeling the war was spinning out of my control, because 1) the game is insanely complex, and 2) the map is so big, I was always worried that zooming in on a specific area would make me miss something in another area.

While I'm here, my 3D rant. Hundreds, maybe thousands of hours carefully modelling the units, and you barely get to look at them. The game is best played completely zoomed out and those 3D units become a floating icon that the graphics department maybe spent a couple hours on. Sure, you can always replay the battle if you want 3D, but who says, ""man, i spent an all nighter last night watching replays and digging on the cool graphics."" Most likely they were playing the actual game and having fun. Money not well spent.

The only game that has actually used 3D correctly is XCOM. The game looks great from the overhead map, but as soon as the shooting starts, you get the cinematic, you see the guy shoot and you see the alien die. Or vice versa.

It is this kind of game that one find good but at the same time there are so many frustrating parts that it is difficult to recommend it at full price. I advise you to buy it on sale.

As a solo player interested in WWII equipment and history, I enjoy playing it, because there is no other game that combines this scale of combat, with a lot of units on the map, (you see the whole battlefield at once, and the distances represented are large) with such an easy way to give orders. Zooming out to the maximum range and in to soldier level is one big plus for this game,
[b]but, …[/b]
attention to detail is the main issue:
- Very minimalist user interface, ugly, as if it were a mockup or still in a draft state. It's a big downgrade comparing to its predecessor Normandy 44.
- Sorting of lists does not work correctly, filtering of lists is not persistent
- Page layout it not consistent (or even seems not finished for tutorial page...)
- No user manual (there was a ""Army General"" manual in the game at one point but it has since disappeared...)
- Many errors in equipment that takes ages to be corrected
- Inconsistency in modeling quality

You first have a wow effect when you enter the maps, which are large, with roads, rivers, villages, forest, a nice atmosphere,
[b]but …[/b]
on closer inspection you realize that they are not realistic in the sense that the ground is perfectly flat. No gullies, no gentle slope in a field. There are certainly slopes, but they have exactly the same gradient and are only put here and there in a multiplayer perspective.

The line of sight tool is very useful, simple and quick to use, a bit more evolved than Normandy 44 but less complex as in WARNO,
[b]but …[/b]
if you enter an enemy's theoretical line of sight, then you are spotted, even if you were behind him. Each unit has a 360 degree line of sight, always.
As soon as a unit spots an enemy, all units instantly know the exact position of said enemy, despite the fact they don't have communication device to speak to each other. If the spotted unit disappears, because the observer is dead for example, then everyone forgets this target, even if it engaged it!

The ""Army General"" is an operational level map, with hundreds of kilometers of sides, where each of your units is a battalion and where you play on a turn-based basis; it's a nice addition compared to Normandy 44,
[b]but …[/b]
- The art direction is weird in its color choices and interface appearance. It's just not pleasant. Again, very simple boxes with no borders, no frills. For example, the colors of the Soviet troops are roughly the same red as the roads and also the arrow representing your movement possibilities. Difficult to differentiate. Very far from a [i]Unity of Command II[/i] or a [i]Panzer Corps 2[/i] in terms of pleasant interface. 
- Left-click, right-click are not always clear, and the lack of a cancel button makes mistakes common.
- The distance you can travel is calculated based on the terrain but you are limited with the squares (no HEX) delimiting positions on the map anyway. Half-baked system.
- Confusing system where units move right away but combat readiness (phases / ability to participate in a battle) is based on their initial positions.
- Lack of map variety when it comes to tactical battle. It doesn't represent where you're supposed to be on the operational map, and you're often fighting the same maps over and over again.

The developers are now flooding us with new divisions, being sold as DLC, with plenty of details about said units, when and where they were engaged, etc,
[b]but …[/b]
the DLC is just those units. No map, no historical battle with all the details given to us on many dev blogs for months and months before the release. Your units from France, Britain, USA have to be used on the same Eastern Front maps… very unrealistic and disappointing.

In conclusion, good game, but you have to ignore a lot of inconsistencies, ugliness and  botched work. That's why I don't recommend to buy it at full price.

The game looks gorgeous and really manages to convey a sense of scale to the battlefield (which I appreciate as many WW2 RTS games feel far to small for the conflict they're trying to portray). There's very little wrong with the game, the only two standout things I can think about are:

2) The eternal curse of having Paradox be anywhere near your game: the DLC's. I don't mind DLC's if they're done right. I do mind them when its pumping out overpriced content which also screws (slightly) with the game's balance.

As far as gameplay, it feels like Wargame: Red Dragon but in WW2, which is a really good thing. To me, it has the perfect ""zoom"" level of a strategy game: Big enough for battles to feel epic, involving a large number of people and assets coming together in unison to win, and small enough to see the gritty details of the fights, to micromanage and appreciate the importance of things seemingly as innocuous as a single rifle squad or tank. Coming from Company of Heroes 2 and a brief try of WG: RD, this game feels incredible.

Of all the RTS games I've played, this one has the most fun system of deckbuilding. Instead of countries or ""doctrines"" (like in CoH2), the game centers around choosing a specific division or regiment, each with their own twist on a central national doctrine. The USSR, for example, has a huge list of divisions that all follow similar concepts (infantry focused on storming enemy positions and CQC, armor meant to close the gap and engage at close range, heavy artillery to suppress the enemy at range) but in radically different ways - some units will focus on heavy casemate assault guns like SU-152 to make breakthroughs, others provide specialized sapper units meant to rout the enemy in urban environments, others use crushing waves of tanks to overwhelm the enemy. This variance goes for the other nations present, including Germany, USA, Commonwealth, and minor Axis/Allied nations.

Because of the aforementioned diversity of divisions, there really is a division for every playstyle. Hyper-aggressive players will find the maneuver warfare/light infantry divisions most satisfying, calculating players will likely most enjoy the more static infantry divisions, while anything in between has a division to suit it. 

The representation of minor nations is also quite admirable and often very unique. The Finnish, as my favorite minor nation to play in the game, usually lack armor - which tracks with their real life struggles to fill out armored units - and instead usually have extremely capable infantry in large quantities, rewarding clever players who set up great infantry ambushes with panzerfausts and Lahti anti-tank rifles. Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and even South Africa all get at least one or two divisions to their name, and most are pretty fun.

All this said, there are three main issues I have with the game:

1) The map design is okay, but it could use a bit more spice. I'm not of the opinion that maps need to have insane terrain features to force entirely different playstyles on a whim, but some extra variance would be nice, such as a bit more height difference and a snow map? (c'mon, the game's set on the Eastern Front of WW2)

2) A lot of really cool units, including the aforementioned minor nations, are almost always locked behind DLC packs. On this, I would recommend waiting until a sale. One DLC can cost like 20 dollars normally, but I picked up half of the game's DLC for ~3 dollars per piece during a Steam sale, and it was well worth it. It's definitely worth looking up each DLC (there are buyer's guides for the DLCs) to single out which DLCs would give you the most interesting divisions and units that you'd wanna try the most. 

3) AI difficulty hits a brick wall at Hard (which is not the highest difficulty). Suddenly, after this point, the AI will crank out insane numbers of units, way beyond anything a player could get, as a way to artificially inflate difficulty. this is, in my opinion, very lame. However, the three lower difficulties - Very Easy, Easy, and Medium - are very palatable and fun. For extra challenge, I'd recommend just outnumbering yourself with Medium AI instead of going to Hard+ unless you really want to suffer. Medium seems like a decent enough challenge for non-seasoned RTS players like myself and my friends, so your mileage may vary.

Overall, great game. I really enjoy it, the flaws are easy to look past, and the game is just solid. Give it a strong 8/10.",1701404079,1701404295,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

- If the game calculates that tank round should hit the target, then it will hit the target no matter what. Changing your vehicles speed, direction or hiding it behind the building in a attempt to avoid getting hit while round is still in the air won't do anything. The round will follow you like a heat-seeking missile.

Also positioning your tank behind the terrain so only turret sticks out doesn't seem to help. Still works like the whole tank is visible from enemy's perspective. If one unit sees an enemy, then whole theatre of war will instantly see him and open fire.

Truly perfect strategy game would be something between Men of War: Assault Squad 2/Gates of Hell: Ostfront and Steel Division 2 with proper ballistics and penetration mechanic.

This game has plenty of pros and cons, listing them all out individually would take a long time so I will focus on what I consider to be by far the biggest upside and the biggest downside of this game. 

Starting with the downside, this game is hard. Like, really hard. If you intend to play this game in MP (which I would consider the best way to play, though if you are an SP fan this might still apply) you will quickly realize this game is unforgiving in several aspects. If you do not build a well balanced deck, if you do not micro your units well, if you do not learn the intricacies of the game (some of which are hidden stats that you have to find out from community sources) then you will almost certainly have a terrible time. Losing in this game can feel extremely frustrating, more so than other games, because the game is very confusing to a newcomer.

With that said, as you begin to master this game, you will realize that this game is truly a unique experience. That, is this game's biggest attraction. I genuinely believe there is no other WW2 RTS that captures the sheer scale, diversity of units and complexity of gameplay this game has without being a bloated hyper-realistic simulator game. If you want to experience combined arms warfare using famous pieces of WW2 equipment then I can think of no other game that offers what this game offers.",1699598192,1699598192,True,10,0,0.627329170703887939,0,True,False,False

Game is a bit janky sometimes, has an uninviting UI and a few essential hotkeys you will have to learn how to use and play with. What your units can see (fog of war) similar to other strategy games is not shown to the player directly and you will need to use a unique line of sight hotkey constantly to determine good positions and what units can actually see. 

The game has a bunch of divisions, units, and customization. The deckbuilding in this game is quite in depth with a lot of options to customize each division to your liking. There are many divisions that vary quite a bit in what they are good at or what they have available to them, although the large choice of divisions and units is nice - the balancing of this amount of divisions, units and customization is questionable.

The game is a strategy game focused on positional play and combined arms. You are provided a steady source of resources (the amount of which you receive in each stage of the game can also be customized), there is no base building like a traditional RTS and no macro cycles so there is a minimal amount of APM rewarding gameplay. Hence the game's strategy is entirely focused in unit micro, positional play, tactics and unit matchups.",1699565490,1699565490,True,6,0,0.557275533676147461,0,True,False,False

Attacking a tank from the side that has 10mm side armor pump 20 rounds into an it does not do anything , Then the next game you might have tanks with 90 pen taking out tanks with 150mm front armor and Tanks with 200 pen not able to kill tanks with 60 front armor . Most the AA will not fire half the time ( no matter where you position them ) even with a plane circling for min right above them . It is just silly really.

I could try to list all of the troop short comings i have come across in this game but then i would just be wasting another 250 hours of my life. Save you money unless you enjoy games that the Units and Balance make pretty much zero sense.
I  decided to keep trying to play the game , even tho it has lots of short coming , and it actually keeps getting worse,  For example , last nights games, targets would start to shoot and just have full target time circle and never fire, just sit there  tell they died, this just did not just happen once, it happened entire game, So i restarted game thinking maybe it was some kind of bug , Next game did the same thing. Game 3 of last night seemed to work fine. Then i played some more tonight , Tonight units were able to fire  from 500 meters north of dense trees directly to targets 1000 meters on other side of trees.  No line of sight for units firing , and unit being fired on never fired a single shot , because of no line of sight. Like it should be , So i restarted computer chose different divisions , and it  guess what ... once again enemy units could fire thru trees 1000meters thick even tho they had no line of sight , and unit being fired on could not fire back , It is just BAD . Not sure how they F'd this game up  but it is all jacked up . So that will be enough of this garbage for me.

It looked somewhat fun and had cool things in it however it was and still is a very underwhelming WW2 RTS that pales in comparison to War Game Red Dragon and other WW2 RTS games. I preceded to ignore Steel Division 2 for many months because it looked the same as the first one. My friend however got it and said it was good, so I preceded to go full consumer and buy every DLC right off the bat and try it out. I can now say that Steel Division 2 is a very good WW2 RTS game and I have been playing it way more than Wargame Red Dragon.
 The game is somewhat similar to Wargame however there are major differences in terms of gameplay and pacing. The game is much harder than Wargame and much less forgiving than other RTS games however this does make the game very unique and interesting. One of the things I like the most about this game is the nations that you can play. Most WW2 games have a habit of having just 2 or 3 nations that took part in WW2, most of the time Germany, America and the USSR. This is fine for games that take place on a very specific theater, but for games like Company of Heroes, Hell Let Loose and others it gets very stale.
 Steel Division 2 at first was very focused on the Easter Front and it still is, however after many patches and DLCs the game is filled with many nations that you usually don't see in WW2 games. Aside from the big players like the USA, USSR, the UK and Germany the game also features Italy, Romania, France, THREE types of Poland (communist, Pro-West and resistance home army) Hungary and many others. The game also has some units from some of the forgotten nations of WW2 like Belgium and Estonia. These nations give the game more flavor and greatly increases gameplay variety. Aside from that the game looks and runs good, is somewhat balanced, has a large amount of maps and a massive amount of units.
 The game has many campaigns that can be played alone or with 3 other people. They are all very difficult and take a massive amount of time to complete however they can be very epic and fun. Sadly all of these campaigns are set in the Eastern Front. This, combined with the fact that many battles will involve near endless hordes of Strelki, Grenadires and artillery will make some of the campaigns stale and lackluster. Thankfully there are a number of very unique and interesting campaigns such as a Finland campaign, a defense of Romania campaign and a liberation of Warsaw campaign.
 Other noteworthy things that I enjoy about the game are it's ace units (the virgin Michael Wittmann, the chad Oskin ect) the game mode where one team attacks the other has to defend,the ability to see the line of sight for your units, the voice acting (sometimes it can be odd though) and the fact that units can hide in backyards. There is a large amount of things to enjoy, however the game has it's issues and some deliberate gameplay decisions that are both strange and unfun. One gripe I have is the lack of Western Front maps. Every map in the game takes place on the Easter Front. The maps are good and fun to play on, but it is a shame that there are no maps for other fronts and there are no snow maps either.
 The time to kill for some units can be very strange and at times very bizarre. With the way game works infantry can survive a absurd amount of punishment. Machine guns like the Maxim for example will literally need to use thousands of rounds of ammunition to kill one squad of infantry. I understand that HMGs in this game are more for suppressive fire, however it should not take mountain of bullets of kill a handful of poorly trained reservists sitting in the open. There is also no way to repair/heal your units.
 This is a major problem in my view because you will need to be extra careful with your expansive and more difficult to use units and you will have a hard time keeping your well performing units alive through a battle. Have a Panther ace with dozens of tank kills? Too bad you just lost it to a stray mortar round. Speaking of mortars artillery is very annoying and at times op. All artillery, from the smallest mortar to the largest howitzer is very powerful and can change the tide of battle.
 The biggest problem is the AIs use of artillery. The AI is very good at hitting your units with artillery and you need to keep moving your units around otherwise you will lose units left and right. However even if you do move the AI will somehow know where your units are and continue to fire on them. There have even been times where my units have been attacked by artillery even though they were never spotted. This is annoying with just a few artillery guns however there are times where the AI brings a massive amount of artillery and you have need to deal with 20 or more howitzers and mortars constantly attacking you.
 Air combat can also be annoying. I like the air combat however dogfights can be very stupid. At times my fighter pilots will fail to shoot down enemy aircraft due to a number of dumb reasons such as turning away from the enemy, overshooting the target and refusing to fire when in range. AA is also very powerful, one mistake can cost you all of your aircraft. Some other bad things of note are crashes that happen from time to time during co-op play, a rather shit tutorial that does not do a good job of teaching players about how the game works, a bug where you will end up getting a draw instead of a victory, another bug where you wont get achievements for beating certain missions and the fact that troop transports that do not have weapons on them will just end vanishing after they drop off troops.
 This game is not very friendly for new players and can be very frustrating, however even with these issues I find Steel Division 2 to be very fun and unique WW2 RTS game and a superior sequel to it's underwhelming predecessor. Fans of WW2 RTS games and fans of Wargame should give this game a try. It can be annoying and difficult however the large amount of content and the solid gameplay make up for it. The soundtrack is also worthy of a spotify playlist. 8/10 will be 9/10 if they remove AI artillery X-ray vision.",1676287542,1696669212,True,24,0,0.68966907262802124,0,True,False,False

If you like battlefield tactics and a realistic battle simulator, and want to play a game which gives Axis and Allies both a decent representation, then buy it. Really enjoy the developers efforts to make Steel Division 2 more historically accurate. Multiplayer is always fun, as despite some individual players spamming certain units frustratingly, the large amount of players and a generally good spirit of cooperation across the wider battlefield go some way to reducing the impact of this. I would say the anti-aircraft guns could do with being improved. The single player campaign games are great, too, as they really tax the strategic grey-matter. It would be good to see more Axis Italian units included in the game, at some point. I prefer to play infantry, anti-tank and mortar-heavy defensive lines to help stave off tank and massed infantry advances. The smoke feature of mortars is really helpful for protecting units advancing (or being fired upon by line-of-sight tanks and support weapons). Overall, the micro-management of the game becomes more fun the more you get used to it. It's a steep learning-curve and while solo-skirmish games with AI are as good a preparation as you get, playing with flesh-and-blood mortals on the multiplayer is the most fun way to play, once you get used to it. Very satisfying. 

My only gripe is how long it takes waiting for multi-player games to fill up - if there was a way to automatically remove AFKs, perhaps by having players press a button before the game starts to confirm they're there, then that would help with games where half the team surrender shortly after the game starts, because they've found something else to do while waiting half an hour to an hour! It's worth the wait, but if it could be made shorter, it would greatly improve the experience. One or two 5-7 vs 5-7 servers for slower periods could help, too.

Until the developer responsible for balancing the game was replaced with a monkey from the nearest zoo. For a long time, from patch to patch, from DLC to DLC, some ""a super-powered mind who rescues the day from sure destruction"" turns the game into his world of madness.

Are they introducing new divisions? Amazing! But they often make divisions from previous DLCs completely unplayable. Have you always been defeated by a grenade at short range? And here is a patch in which the Molotov cocktail wins. Entire divisions that who played by a grenade suddenly become unplayable at a short distance. Has the tank always been a valuable combat unit on the map? Whose loss was significant for both you and your opponent? Don’t worry, the price of tanks has been reduced so much that there are tanks that cost 10-15-20-25 points (a standard infantry unit costs 25-30 points) Do you want to play with heavy tanks? You won't play with heavy tanks - because buying a heavy tank in 90% of situations is a waste of money. Spam! Spam a lot, spam constantly, spam cheaply and confidently. This is all that the monkey who did balance can offer.

Have you read the history textbook, where the Soviet tank corps drove the enemy to the west? Have you read a history textbook where German tank divisions broke through the front and carried out encirclements? There are these corps and divisions here, but you won't use them! Because in some new brilliant DLC they will add disabled collaborators who were engaged in robbing grandmothers in villages, but there are an infinite number of them and they cost pennies. Which means there will be SPAM, SPAM, SPAM. This spam can only be stopped by, you know, what? SPAM, SPAM, SPAM.

When the game first came out it was a breath of fresh air. An interesting idea with six different types of income, for different gameplay on the same divisions. That is, you can take one build and remake it many times to suit different playstyles. This is a super cool idea, because there is variability.
And most importantly, the balance was built in such a way that if you play on rush income, it means you have few troops, but a very high income. That is, you can win very quickly if you know what you are doing, but the cost of error is very high. After all, if you lose, for example, Flak 8.8 at stage A, then you will no longer have another, but if you use it correctly, it will allow you to close an entire direction. What is the monkey doing with balance? It doubles the availability of Flaks so that there is a spare one. On rush income you have little infantry, each unit has value, and the loss is often irreplaceable. What is the monkey doing? It increases the number of units on the map in those divisions where there were problems with the number of infantry. So that there would be spare ones. And so it is in everything. The whole balance in 1v1 comes down to quickly breaking through the defense, capturing the flags and winning in 15 minutes. They played like this before, but as I said, before this could be dealt with by effective exchanges. Now the exchange fades into the background, because your opponent will have so many troops that you do not have time to destroy them. But winning the flags is not going away. You just need to inflate the idiotic bubble with an armored car for 5 kopecks and you win. The whole game comes down to one single income, because it is the most justified mathematically, under the current balance system. The developers themselves are burying what they painstakingly built over a long period of time.

The behavior of tanks in the game is broken (You roll a heavy tank onto the road, it attacks a unit on the flank, which does not pose a threat, twists its body and gets hit on the side by the enemy on the road in front of it). The behavior of aircraft in the game is broken (If you give a fighter an order to attack an enemy aircraft, the fighter makes numerous maneuvers in different directions, but the target attacks every other time). The front line is broken (Blowing bubbles on the floor of the map with literally one unit). Logic and common sense are broken. It gets to the point that a person with a rush income can assemble more than 100 infantry units for the entire game (The average normal infantry assembly for a balanced income is 70-80 units)

Until these people come to their senses, I will not give them money. And I don’t advise you!",1695900682,1695900682,False,161,15,0.8744964599609375,12,True,False,False

I have not played the campaign, or Multiplayer (which I imagine is the main point of it), but have played 40 hours vs AI on different maps and settings.
The mechanics of choosing a Battlegroup, deciding the deployment rates, and setting up the deployment are great - and the attention to historical detail will appeal to strategy gamers /WWII enthusiasts. I like - in principle - the idea of dividing a battle/game into 3 deployment sections, but in reality the battles I have played have tended to be decided in the first 20 minuted (making the third deployment phase redundant). I have tried adjusting the AI difficulty, and tried adding extra AI battlegroups, but I have yet to have had a long-fought battle.
   The maps are excellent, and discovering the best locations for your MGs and AT guns is interesting and challenging, particularly on the Breakthrough mode. I imagine it's a very steep learning curve if playing mulitplayer against anyone already familiar with the maps - but that's true of any multiplayer game.
   I should love this game... and yet I don't: There is a high level of micro-managing needed (which has been partly addressed by a 'smart order' command),, which is fine in single player (pause and issue commands), but nevertheless divorces you from the action. To control a battle you are forever zoomed out - to get the big picture - and issuing move orders to your many units. Even the sound effect disappear.
  Zoom in, however, and the game plunges you into the action in wonderful style.
   But you can't have it both ways - to experience the strategy means that you lose any immersion in the story of the battle. This is my main issue: As a strategy game it doesn't immerse you, hours are not unaccountably lost; it's not suddenly 4.00 am. Despite the wonderful historical detail it's impossible to care about platoon/tank/emplacement etc because they're dots on a strategic map. There is detail without empathy.
   It is possible, however, to re-play any game in impressive cinematic style (I think games are auto-saved for this), and although this is an excellent feature, it doesn't compensate for the lack of any feeling of real-time involvement in a battle. This might well be the experience of  genuine Generals, but we're not Generals, we're Gamers.",1695544443,1695544443,True,4,0,0.568721413612365723,1,True,False,False

SD2 is very similar to the Wargame series (same developer, heh) as you can build a deck of units to bring into battle, these units serve different purposes and you really need to think out your strategy to defeat your opponent. This isn't like say, C&C where you can just plow hordes of units until victory, as your armies are limited, enabling caution and strategising to take hold.

I also on a sidenote have to mention the soundtrack. It kicks ass. It's just the perfect soundtrack for when you're out there going on the offensive with tanks and infantry and taking over towns and getting into massive skirmishes. 

The graphics are also very beautiful for an RTS game, the detail on the units and maps are stunning, and being able to zoom in on the battlefield really lets you appreciate the visuals up close. The maps, like wargame, are massive in scale, stretching kilometers, allowing massive battles to occur across a large front, it is very interesting to watch and partake in.

SD2 (again, like wargame lol) has a variety of mechanics with each unit. For instance, being able to set positions to hold, setting fire positions for artillery and katyushas and such. While getting to grips with these mechanics can be hard for new players, it is absolutely worth your time, it is very rewarding.

My main gripe with SD2 is honestly how the matches are timed, it can feel very sucky. Especially if you're playing CTF, it feels like a janky tug of war sometimes. That being said, I strongly recommend SD2, it's an RTS worthy of your time

Wait time in lobbies are horrendous as everyone wants to play the Germans so you will sit there waiting for people to play the allies only for them to quit 10 minutes into the game. This is due to the German divisions fielding impenetrable king tigers and elefants and they get alot of them. like 8-10 per division and usually there is a minimum of 4 per game.

I've had this game for many years, progressively it gets overbalanced to the Axis every patch every update.
 The allies won by numbers, but in the game allied units are almost as expensive as the Germans which means you are fielding the same amount of tanks as the Germans but it is inferior armor. If you play allied divisions you have to follow around your anti tank guns with a supply truck to allow it to shoot 2000 meters which is the standard for germans. This is easily countered by mortars.

 All together ranked is kind of balanced but then you have to take in account that all German infantry divisions *you will come across* have 2 lmgs and will instantly suppress your units in the open field, however allies are better in close combat. within 150 meters. But! again that is countered because eugen gives the axis sturm troops that do 5 damage compared to the close range allied troops of 2.5 damage. Most 10v10 games still end up with half of the allied team as bots. You genuinely have to be smarter and more skilled to play as the allies.

If you're interested in a game like this I would suggest Warno, better balance and they work on it a lot more. The wait time to get into games is 1/4 of SD2 ww2 games like this are better off in the hands of call to arms or men of war. They actually understand that a side shot on a tiger or king tiger at least kills crew members or damages something. In SD2 they just tank the shot and then turn towards your tank and kill it.

Let me give some positives, though, the maps look fantastic, it's on the Eastern Front, and the graphics look better. Other than that it's a spam festival. I'm a single-player player and it feels generic, both the maps and the units, and how it plays, even compared to its precursor which in itself had lots of issues.

Artillery is ridiculous shooting from the edge of the map to the other side and I can't reach it with planes because the AA/AAA is OP. The mortars' distance is absurd. Anti-tank distance is way too long, tanks are either way too strong or made of tissue paper. And then there's Blobs of tanks, blobs of infantry, blobs of artillery, it's blobbing all over the place. So little strategy and tactics, especially compared to Graviteam Tactics. It's a constant click-fest to bring out, yet another, unit to the one I just brought out minutes before.

I really want to enjoy this game, it does have some good things about it, but I keep installing and unistalling it realizing in the end that there's better alternatives.

I've only ever played the Allied forces (either Soviets, or US with Free French). The controls can be maddening.

I have never been too good at the devs games (The Wargame Games and Steel Division 1944) but this one is so much fun, and its easy to pick up. It's got regular content drops and constant bug fixing and balancing as the devs strive to make a great game.

The Deck Builder in this one has vastly improved compared to the Wargame series. The new 3-phase battle system makes it so much easier to plan out your deck, and comparing units is also easier as the menus are less convoluted.

The game-play is sharp and interesting and generally really well balanced. Despite the Germans edge in everything save air power and arty the allies make up for it with cheaper and more dynamic units. German anti-aircraft guns are AMAZING weapons but they are very slow and can be artied by basic mortar crews. The German tanks are nice but you can see why they failed to win the war in the east. Yes they can punch through t-34s while receiving no damage but they cost almost 3x as many command points. Even the king tiger can get popped in the side by an Anti-tank gun that cost about 7x less. The trade-offs between availability and quality is executed very well. 

One think I think could really improve the game's immersion is to make the number of units in a stack actually matter. What I mean is lets say you have an anti tank gun team of 7 men. The gun team gets a direct hit from a tank and kill 4 out of the 7 members the gun team still operates the exact same at least from what I can tell. I have seen 88 mm flaks still be moved, fired, and operated by a one man team which should be impossible or nearly so. Even worse are infantry squads that will be down to one guy and still be able to use every weapon in their squad. Now it is feasible that if squad was killed except one soldier he could grab the machine gun from the dead squad member and that would make sense because its the most important weapon as an infantryman in almost every situation. But there is no status effects for infantry or any non motorized units. Something like ""Machine gun destroyed/jammed"" would be awesome.

 I have noticed an overall lack of status effects for tanks that although annoying really help show the challenges of battle in WW2. It could also be useful for balancing out some of the German super tanks like the king tiger. The king tiger was infamous for it horrendous reliability. Maybe having to worry about the tanks engine breaking down and being a sitting duck could be an really interesting battle mechanic. Or how about flat tires or slipped of treads or gun crews getting stuck in the mud? Half of the actually fighting in any war is the logistical SNAFUS that make the best laid plans subject to change. That is the peak of strategic thinking is to adapt quickly. Guns jam, ammo duds, and things fall apart and i think that would be a cool feature. I understand its a lot to ask and involves a lot coding and math to be done but its more like a goal to shoot for.

Content wise I am not a fan of army general mode. I loved Wargames campaign and would rather a more jazzed up version of that. Army general is just a bit strange. You fight all this short battles with this godawful looking war map overlay that is bland and ugly to look at. I get the idea behind it but it does not really get you into the battle. The wargame campaign was just more intuitive and interesting. 

My final point is the era and tech aspect. This game is pretty much just 1944 onwards which is less interesting in my opinion. It also takes a lot liberties with the actual tech involved. For example almost every infantry unit has motorized transport and it does not add anything to the cost unless it a half-track or armed vehicle. But even by 1944 a lot of german and soviet unit relied heavily on horses for transportation of supplies and moving of guns. Most infantry just marched in long columns to the next fight and would lag way behind the fight unless they were needed in which case the tanks would stop and wait for the infantry to catch up so they could clear a wooded area or town. I think if the game had more heavy wooded maps or any real mountain maps horses would be more useful from a game-play aspect. That would be a really cool way to incorporate that bit of history in the game but I understand why it wouldnt make sense from a competitive or design aspect. It would also be nice to see more nations other than European nations featured although that is where most of the fighting took place. I would love to see my marines as a deck. 

Overall a great game Eugene should be very proud of what they accomplished in this game. My complaints are minor and my comments about desired improvement stem from my desire to see what is great become greater.

Than you might think - ""oh there are campaigns and historical battles - they probably intended to teach me various game mechanics"". You will be very disappointed. They are the opposite of that. You go to those modes when you already understand what all those different unit types do and how to play them. 

I don't think this game will ever become noob-friendly. It is quite complex at its core and it would take enormous effort to create smooth learning experience via dedicated missions \ scenarios. 

And that is quite sad. I like the concept, the idea, all that historical realism.

Historical divisions are not fun or balanced why is shit this in the game, since you can't control more than single division, combined arms is out of the picture entirely alot of the time.

The Developer have being trying to feed people this 'historical division' dogcrap since wargame, nobody used themed division in wargames because they are dogshit and custom combined arms division is king. Now they've made it non optional and we got to enjoy charade of commanding 30 infantry squad with no AT weapons while the AI sends its 30 tanks to random fucking places.

Divisions back then are unbalanced and lopsided due to technical limitations and are expected to work with other divisions to conduct combined arms.

Every minute is a contest between asymmetric resource and unit availability, limited information, psychological deception, strategic planning, tactical execution, careful allocation of your attention, and the relentless pressure of time's inexorable march.

Losing is very much Tuesday and the complexities underlying the differences between the hundreds of units available are not easy to grasp, it took me well over a hundred hours to become what you might consider 'barely competent' in the multiplayer space. Don't be fooled by high armour values and big guns, virtually every unit in the game can destroy or disable any other unit, and there are an abundance of ways to 'soft kill' or otherwise eliminate key enemy assets without having to bring out a bigger, more expensive gun. You can't take account of everything that's going on, and every success entails liabilities, the execution of a flawless encirclement or rapid combined arms offensive is orgasmic, but such feats are rare and failure may devolve into a brutal attrition with hundreds dead for a worthless patch of trees.

Very often it won't be one mistake or decision that you made which determines success or failure, but a pattern of behaviour, or even a mentality. Caution and boldness both can spell defeat if executed without finesse and forethought, and almost every game I play there's a window when, had I merely known the enemy disposition and had at least one testicle, I could've swept them from the field. But imperfect information breeds imperfect decisions.

I play multiplayer 1v1s and 10v10s mostly. But I love the units they have, it feels well balanced, each side has units that are like ""Dude, oh god that must have hurt."" And ""Ho $hit! I have to take care/watch out for that.""

Heavy tank meta, just get a side shot.
Artillery, use counter battery.
Infantry, use MGs.
Tanks just get a side shot. (Or arty/ambush/air support)
Aircraft, get a better division that has AA.

Ha! You can counter everything if you know how. The micro is challenging and really takes your focus sometimes. But the movement is at the right pacing, you have time to watch your IS2 die to a 20 pt infantry squad. It's actually sad, but you know it's your fault.

Then you learn.

Take a breath, Because the game is slow enough to allow you to. It really does have the right pacing. A phase, B phase, not even talking about that, but that is also good. As well as various income levels. Looking at you Maverick. 

But the actual speed in which the units move across the map gives you space to breathe without being boring or ""Slow"". But the game is slow in comparison to Starcraft or Planetary Annihilation. But faster than Supreme Commander.

Personally I feel like Motorized infantry is the most useless thing in this game. Trucks get blown up extremely fast and thank god for the snail paced infantry running speed! 

I understand trucks go boom easily, but what I dont understand Is magic AI artillery spotting them far before they reach the front line and shelling them. 

In my opinion the only real fun you can have is when you're on the defensive and that's just flat out boring. 

i'll go through a whole regiment just to take a small town on a tactical battlefield map. It's pretty retarded, considering (as far as im aware) you cant replenish your troops. What. The. Fuck.

If you REALLY want to play a game by this developer. Literally play any other one other than this Game.
(Red Dragon, Warno) Red Dragon is older but somehow way more fleshed out than this game and the Majority of the units are unique, take away a few modifications for other variants of tanks and IFVs.

I feel like youtubers have been playing this game alot recently because this game just doesnt have  large playerbase and it's very subpar compared to what they could've done. (How the fuck did you guys not add replenishment????? Who fucking cares if its historically accurate??????) 


This game is just extremely Subpar. I can kind of see how other people can enjoy it for like 10 minutes, but like I said before, its really only for defensive operations. Launching offensives are just frustrating and boring as hell. I'm sure some smooth brain is going to rack it up to a skill issue though lmfao.



Only reason I still play this dog water is because it's sadly the only major WW2 strategy game like this.

No new maps... You cant even make your own maps. No maps available in workshop.
Every DLC is new divisions that are really pointless, No New Maps.
Same set of maps every time you play.
Normandy DLC, doesn't have any Normandy maps.
The AI must be able to see the entire map during battle its the only way I can explain that the AI can target my hidden or camouflaged units. AI airpower seems to have some sort if advantage not 100 percent sure. My planes never make it to target, AI planes always make it to target and manage to hit target every time. The only way to prevent this is to have more and more anti-aircraft to the point that you spend points that are needed on the front line.
No new maps. 
Anti tank guns target and shoot targets far away even though their are closer and more threatening targets close by, or even worse attack a way off target instead of the tank that is actually attacking them.
Did I mention no new maps. 
DLCs don't really add much to the game or fix any problems with the game, and they are overpriced.

Let's adress the elephant in the room:
The amount and prices of DLC may seem off-putting (which is understandable).
It is a shame that some of the most iconic and interesting divisions of the war are locked behind a paywall (Großdeutschland, Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa), 5th SS Wiking, Task Force 45 and many more). The DLC also blocks off some of the singleplayer/multiplayer campaigns, such as the Romania campaign. I wouldn't recommend the DLC off sale unless you play a lot of multiplayer or really care about the divisions featured.
That being said, what is provided in the base game is quite a lot. The base game campaign is quite good and fun, and the free divisions from the free DLC and the base game are soe of the most powerful and popular divisions that are being played.
Therefore this game is an easy recommendation, especially on sale.

I can't honestly give this game a thumbs down, because I play it and love it so much.

We perhaps need a sideways thumb.

My biggest gripes with this game:

The devs advocate that they are trying to make this game historically accurate however ignore the following:

1) King Tiger availability in 10v10. Only 490 King Tigers were ever made in WW2, but in a 10v10 game every single Axis player can bring a KT div in and you literally can be fighting 10 KTs in a single game.

2) The cost of allied tanks is not properly balanced. 34,000 T-34 85s were produced in WW2 and 6,000 Panthers, but in game Panthers cost 150 and T-34 85s 110. The ratios are wrong.

3) They recently nerfed two allied King Tiger counters in the game. The SU-152 which they increased the cost by 10 points from 60 - 70. They also nerfed 81mm radio mortars on the allied side, they fire slower and less accurately (a useful counter to KTs in the game).

4) They openly refuse to introduce the M26 Pershing to the allies, because it's not within the historical story-line of Operation Bragation. However, we have Western Divisions in the game.

5) They have not introduced a re-connect button to the community after several pleas from the community. If you suddenly get disconnected from a game, you cannot ever rejoin the game.

6) They do not make new multiplayer maps for the community, because they won't get paid to do so. IE make a new map only open to people who pay will divide the community, so they don't make new maps and only focus on DLC where they reskin old units and introduce a few new ones with new voice acting.

Other than that, the game is great and is the only viable WW2 RTS I play due to the scale and amount of units/weapons available.

Playing against the computer is like punching yourself repeatedly in the stomach.   The AI has an unreal ability to pin point your high damage assets.  I called in 2 TD's they didnt even shoot one shot got to their staging area and taken out from across the map with arty, no prior shots no prior engagement from area.  NO RECON IN THE AREA. NO RECON FLIGHT NO WAY THEY KNEW OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THE COMPUTER PLAYS A DIFFERENT GAME THAN YOU DO.  The AI will place themselves in positions that are impenetrable making your push into said territory a slow and very costly affair.  THIS ISNT BALANCE.  The AI knows EXACTLY where to place itself to have full fields of fire with limited flaking access then on said flanks they have pak guns defending them with no real way of pushing infantry through to their positions either.  Anti air capabilities on the german factions are also over powered like i said the AI is UNREAL.    The AI is harder than actual players.  Playing this game online is also a nightmare one faction reigns king.  THE GERMANS,  might as well title the game steel german division.  I give this game a 2 outta 10 core gameplay features need balancing badly.  How can the AI have pin point accuracy on their arty.  Huge let down for what it is.... THIS ISNT A SIMUALTION game so there isnt a need for the ridiculous attempt at historical accuracy.  Please dont get me started on that either.  Good attempt but company of heroes, warno (which isnt balanced either), broken arrow and world in conflict all do it better than this game.  NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.   I would not suggest this game to anyone its a cash grab with broken and unbalanced mechanics.

Well fear not because Steel Division 2 offers much more than you can imagine, for example:

-Land lease valentine tank surviving a direct hit from 88mm pak 43
-MG team leaving trenches without order just to run to some $hitty bushes 100 meters away
-Infantry not being able to attack armored personnel carriers even though their gunner is exposed
-Enemy AI telepathically knowing locations of ALL your gun, artillery, infantry (say goodbye to you hidden anti air gun that is about to be nuked by 10 airstrikes 2 minutes into a match)
-Genius, well balanced stress system (it's not)
-Buggy vehicles and anti tank guns that sometimes refuse to shoot enemy despite seeing them and having max ammo
-Unrealistic rifle ranges (stg 44 with max range of 200m great stuff)
-Fog of war vision thing that just doesn't make sense (heavy tank hiding behind 1 small tree is apparently invisible to my units standing not far away from it)
And last but not least my personal favourite - giving artillery gun ""fire at will"" order makes them run about 300 meters away and then shooting their previous location with smoke shells for no reason

The only drawback I find now is in campaign mode you seem to be playing on the same 3-4 maps which get really old since you are fighting countless battles in campaign mode. Now granted I was the Germans always defending so territory did not move much but wargame red dragon seemed to have much more variety. And I really miss the naval warfare. The aerial warfare is lacking mainly due to the fact that planes in this era are basic and there are no helicoptors. It really limits your play to infantry and big guns which over time just gets boring.

.
To explain where I come from : I own all of Eugen Systems' strategy titles since the Act of War series, and I particularly played the Wargame Ssries, culminating in the inimitable Red Dragon - possibly one of the the best strategy games ever made. I somewhat dropped out during the Steel Division : Normandy 44 - I game which introduced some great new concepts albeit  lacking as an experience in many respects. I am back into the Wargame series with Steel Division II and I look forward to Warno (hoping that some of the design limitations I mention here will finally be addressed)
.
Eurgen Systems have done a world class job recreating the armies and OOBs of the period in Steel Division II realistically (such as they have done with the title's predecessors). The RT battles that ensue are intense and realistic down to a miniscule scale, and the graphics and performance are vary satisfactory. The level of detail for each unit, down to the various rifles, arms and  modules is simply stunning. I don;t think that any other game studio has managed to do this in such stunning detail, ever, and SD2 is perhaps the peak of this effort.
.
The huge disappointment, however, comes from an apparent insistence of Eugen Systems to create their games with a primary focus on their online multiplayer, while their Army General/Grand Campaign mode, which should have normally been their strongest suit - is still a second priority after all these years. This isn't new - the fan base has been begging for more diverse campaigns since the first introduction of campaigns in Airland Battle and Red Dragon. We have been asking for a campaign map editor so we can make use of this fabulous combat system and perhaps add various theatres to the lore, ensuring perpetual replayability - but they never did that.
.
I understand that to some degree, they aimed to offer additional campaign maps and formations as DLCs - and they did, especially in SD2. But then what you essentially get is an ok Army General map and reinforcement system for a basic a set of predefined multiplayer maps which you have to battle in over and over again over the course of a campaign. This is because those stand alone multiplayer maps are core to that community - so they can be having fun rushing and arty dominating those well known maps with their mates, as opposed to ie procedurally generated campaign battle maps that would make each confrontation  awesome and ultra realistic for those who prefer the Army general  mode. Or perhaps the combat/campaign  AI is not up to scratch to manage procedurally generated maps ? Then perhaps the Total War Series have done a better job in introducing the element of surprise and replayability in their game.         
.
So you get to fight over a handful of maps, again and again, without persistent damage. So each time, after a long battle has destroyed the infrastructure and the woodland has been bombarded to a crisp, you start again from the same point of entry with the same brand new villages, hills and woods. It's a bit like Groundhog day, and very frustrating, because it forces you to think like multiplayer - rush that same village, cap that same flag, fortify that recurring chokepoint and the battle is yours. Imagine the possibilities if you actually had to study each brand new map before you deployed, or if a map had completely changed since the last time it was fought over.  
.              
Another part that I miss from past titles is the lack of a reinforcement pool. What has ever been the problem with having a pre-determined number of refit points to bring your battered divisions back to strength ? Of nursing or and combinging your squads back to coherent formations? Giving them a couple of mortars and a tank to replenish their losses? There used to be a Refit & Repair option til Red Dragon where one could spend campaign points to bring battered units back to a fighting formations. Now your soldiers and armor just die forever  and your squads just sit there empty, without even the option to create a temporary mixed squad out of the remnants  of various brigades, or being able to field-promote a  squads to leaders or spotters, or replenish some of their equipment. The kind of stuff that would normally happen inside a week of close combat. 
.
As wargame simulations, Eugen Systems' games seem to get better and better. My positive review is just for that. But as grand strategy games, they seem to get dumber and dumber. But that's just me - I always wanted wargaming realism at its finest. instead, I'm getting glorified Fortnite for 20th century conflic buffs. So a bit meh, with the sincere hope that they will focus on the Amry General Community at some point in the future.

- replay system is very nice to have but with no FF or RW it’s almost useless
- the sound in the battlegroup building screens is horrible
- more options for game hosting (size, restrictions, etc)
- the range circle is great but it’s hard to read in many situations
- the need something like the rage circle for elevation (topography)

Great game and one of the few that I will be getting all the DLC for (eventually).

a few things i dislike though are the smart orders for units, they do not work well at all and usually get your units killed, stay away from them but other than that, get the game, its a good time, for a similar game id also recommend Wargame: Red Dragon by eugen too.

I have played War Hammer 2 total war, COH2, All the total war series, Command and Conquer-all of them, Stronghold-all of them, and this is by far the BEST.  Their has been ALOT of thought put into the game such as armor penetration, artillery, aircraft, everything!  Even speed!  All units spawn at the bottom of the map on a road.  My Tiger tank is a beautiful thing but its slow and will take some travel time for it to get into the battle. (even the type of road determines speed- paved or dirt) If I need to reinforce an area quickly my beautiful Tiger tank might not be a good solution because the area needing help might be overrun by the time it gets there. I might want to use some lighter faster armor or mounted units.  Artillery! King of the battlefield! For example, when you use your artillery you choose the artillery unit and click on target if you have eyes-on the target or target area if you don't have eyes-on the target with recon units, the artillery will take time to align the guns in the new direction, take time to aim, and then fire.  Take time to reload then fire etc.  The round in the air takes time as well before it finally hits the area around the target, all of which can be extremely frustratingly long because your infantry is being over-run and needs arty NOW, but very realistic and so very satisfying when you finally demolish the target area.  Friendly fire is very real and danger close is sometimes danger too close!  That goes with close air support as well.  Every type of unit has a purpose and specialty and you need every one!  A column of tanks by themselves are extremely powerful but will get eradicated quickly by hidden anti tank guns and hidden infantry in the woods or in a building with anti tank weapons.  They are also fodder for anti tank aircraft as well.  You need to balance your attack groups with tanks, infantry, assault guns, recon, anti air, re-supply and close air support and artillery-smoke is a bonus as well.  Sometimes you need to send in everything available 'ready or not' because your out of time and will simply lose the battle if you don't do SOMETHING FAST!  Expect heavy casualties and hope your troops win the day! oh yeah, did I forget to mention the timer for each battle?  The more strategic points (flags) one side owns over the other the less time the timer has which means the other side had better capture those points back because the timer is ticking down.  If the timer reaches zero the battle is over and the side which owns the most flags wins.  If one side owns 13 flags and the other owns 13 (both sides even) the timer goes away.  When one side own 14 and the other 12 then the timer is on - minor victory in ex. 15:00 minutes - ticking down.  When one side owns 15 flags and the other 11 the timer goes way down to say 10:00 minutes still ticking down.  So it becomes more and more desperate for the losing side to capture some flags.  If they capture another flag the timer goes even further down.  If the losing side recaptures a flag the timer increases giving the losing side more time to react to either recapturing another flag-making it even again or taking the advantage and putting the other side on a timer.  Time is a factor. Sitting back and playing defense is fun and satisfying when you wreck unsuspecting units when they stumble into range but unless your attacking and capturing strategic points which increases or decreases the timer you will eventually lose.  They will suffer more casualties by attacking your defensive positions but you will lose the battle because they will own more strategic points when the timer runs out. The strategy aspect in this game is deep!  Single player is extremely fun and the AI is adequate for a challenge even after you are experienced, maybe not fanatical experienced like some of the level 40 online players but for the average strategy war gamer it is great!  Multiplayer Level 40 Online players are absolutely fanatical and have studied and gamed every board with every unit available for every tactical advantage they can squeeze from each and every board - both sides- too time consuming for my taste.  Do not expect to win against them. They are an unpleasant lot to chat with as well.  They tend to take the left or right edges of the board with dozens of mortar units and off site artillery- unrealistic but effective if you have studied and gamed the boards like they have- so stay in the middle of the board and enjoy playing against players like yourself with a balanced and fun to play deck.  On multiplayer I've also designed and played a support army group in which I supported my other allied players with anti air- artillery- close air support, and resupply with a splash of reinforcements here and there when a hole appears on the line.  It was fun to play and effective I think for the team win.  Purely reactive and only good for large multiplayer games and would have lost outright playing  1 vs. 1 but shows the versatility and deep strategic aspects of the game.  10 vs. 10 multiplayer is pretty cool.

In fact for most of the vanilla divisions, this seems to be at least somewhat the case.

The problem with the game is the monetisation model completely throws all the complexity under the bus. You can have neatly set up ambushes, painstakingly bandbox your units and set up combined arms attacks - with more options for stance and fire than nearly any RTS - and watch in dismay as a group of Shermans completely ignore 88mm AT fire at point plan blank range because they bought the latest DLC checklist from the developer and their tanks have Siler Stars.

There's this rather obnoxious and frankly broken minigame that seems to be a hall mark of the franchise called ""deckbuilding"" - where decks are divisions; and each deck has a limited number of pieces available to it. This wouldn't be so bad except ""Divisions"" are how the game is monetised through DLCs - you buy essentially a checklist of weapons you are allowed to bring to a match. In many ways, these divisions are essentially negative content.

So all that realism World in Tanks in micro WW2 simulation and realism goes out the window when you go to play multiplayer and realise that the other guy whose forked out 200 bucks for all the meta divisions is playing  StarCraft. 

I had tried playing mtuliplayer when I got it but I had quit for some reason but then playing again today I realised that what was what most multiplayer was. Aside from the randoms cheesing the ladder, by quitting until they find a match they like (i.e. horribly imbalanced); the toxicity and egotism; then to maybe find a map on an ostensibly balanced map only to play for an hour and lose to a guy who just stacks all his offmap abilities ... I realised why I quit the first time around...

...  because despite the promise being there in the engine and the technology, the unit and weapon design - it all goes out the window for the monetisation model. When the premise of the game is WW2 realism but you are selling tanks with some PoS old Hungarian tank Krogothing shitonnes of AT and tank fire; it breaks the entire game.

I think the parts of the game that do well, lkike the campaign and the AI are simply ignored in favour of trying to appeal to a 1v1 me bro Ranked crowd that seem to have accepted these 'decks"" completely breaking the premise of the game. The campaign seems to offer much more fruitful ground for multiplayer and competiton but there's very little support for it. A little more effort with the UI and the game rules would've gone a long way.

I can recommend it as a diversion or professional experiment in learning how to manage this many different units, abilities and synergies and positioning; but all of the great details and potentially great and tricky combat get completely washed out by the importance of managing offmap abilities and owning the right deck. It's like Chess with the Offmap abilities from Zero hour added; they don't suit each other well. It seems these balance issues might sort themselves out over campaign but maps are quite limited and unfortunatley they don't have modding support for maps and are pretty stingy when it comes to existing ones.

It's got a lot of potential, I'll keep playing it, maybe I'm wrong, but every time I try and get into its depths more it seems that it really is a lot more shallow than it looks. Worth it on sale at best, maybe if you have the time to really sink to fight your way into an insular community where it might get good. Campaign and skirmish is decent but even then there's issues with matches being way too short (which can be fixed with a mod found in the workshop, but still).

Here is why I unwilling to dis-recommend this game, lets say you are a huge fan of a RTS game or historical stuffs, which I am for sure, but me and most of people are not rich, and probably are interested by other games, so the money is limited.

If you buy the base game, and you decided to upgrade to Deluxe or Total Edition, you can't, due to you had ""same item"" which is the base game, I can say that I was wrong and I should by higher edition rather then just buying a base game.

But since I really love this game, I was thinking to buy DLCs separately, and I just can't.

(currency will be displayed by CNY, also in Winter Sale, every item mentioned in this comment is around 70~78% off)
SD2=47, Deluxe Edition=82, Total Edition=94.5, SD Franchise Pack=129.35, History Pack=47.04, all 4 history DLCs(Death on the Vistula, The Fate of Finland, Black Sunday, and a history DLC which are not included in HISTORY PACK, Burning Balistic)=20.4 each.

So if you are to buy all HISTORY DLCs after you brought SD2 base version, you will be totally paying 47+47.04+20.4=94.44
The price itself is okay to me, but the way how it sells is not.
  1. you have to buy a historical DLC even you brought HISTORY PACK;
  2. in this way, you paid almost the same money as Total Edition, buy you get without other things.
  (3. I can not refund base game to buy higher edition due to the ""2hrs policy"".)

I accept I am not a rich guy, that I in fact have limited budget on buying games, I also admit I should buy higher editions rather then just buying base game.
But I just can't pay like a fool......

Again, the game is really decent, but unfortunately the price or the way it sells is not okay.

The pacing seems perfect, allowing you to macro a frontal assault with smart orders, while micro'ing your flanking tanks or artillery barrages. The map sizes are excellent for the army/engagement sizes in my opinion. The visuals just add to the glamour of the game. Sound is something to be desired however, and I chuckled when I discovered the default soundtrack is just a mashup of various independent epic music artists' songs.

Does the AI cheat? You bet it does! But we consider that a proper challenge. My buddies and I only play Hard AI to experience the truest of blitzkriegs when the Germans spam Stug IIIs and Tiger Es with their increased income rates. For those complaining of the cheating stats of the computers: you're right, it's not fair that an enemy light tank can go all Fury and hold off your advance. That being said, I've managed to swat the heaviest of AI assaults by careful placement of engineers for a TNT kill, or finding just the right vision for my M57 AT/M2 .50 cal combo to prevent a flank maneuver. I think the primary complaint that people don't realize they're making is that the AI is intelligent on top of being a flagrant cheating machine. A fair reason to be upset for sure. My only recommendation would be to continue playing; you'll find ways around the computer's tactics. I've played plenty of single-player skirmishes to speak from experience.

If you like WW2 games, give the Steel Division series a shot (especially if it's on sale). If you like strategy games, then this is definitely one for your library. If you like WW2 strategy games, then I'm disappointed that you're even reading reviews for this gem prior to purchasing.

Firstly, the game plays similar to that of Wargame and the Steel Division: Normandy '44. The concept of 'Divisions' is very well made and brings a sort of order and balance to the game. Some divisions are easily playable and have a good balance of all equipment (i.e. AA, Arty, Tanks, Infantry, etc.) while others are more driven by armor, or infantry, or mechanized builds. 
Pros:
Division system is fleshed out and provides good quality game-play while also maintaining balance. 
Graphically, it is stunning.
Variety of units to choose from and to play with.
DLC's are nice, can be nice if they are on a sale.
Free content is quite frequent with upcoming DLC releases.
AI is quite challenging at times to provide game-play unmatched with that of other RTS games.
Cons:
DLC's can be quite pricey for what they offer. (Check the reviews of the specific DLC page for reviews).
Sound design could have been done a bit better in my honest opinion.
Not a lot of tutorials to go off of, mainly you will need to Google or search Youtube for answers to some answers.

I hate it.

Most of that hate is because I liked the previous Eugen games so much, especially SD44. But it turns out Shakespeare is wrong, it's *not* better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all -- I suspect I'd simply be ""meh"" about this game had I not loved the previous ones, but seeing Eugen once again fail to live up to their potential has sent me screaming in anguish away from the game.

I liked SD44 the most of the Eugen games because it shifted them away from multiplayer-first games into we-spared-3-minutes-of-thought-for-single-player, and because it was WW2. (I also liked the original, Wargame:EE, for the same SP reason). I was expecting great things from SD2, especially with the new ""Army General"" mode, as it looked like it took the solid single player of SD44 and pushed it to an epic scale. But it turns out everything about it extremely poorly implemented and is nothing more than style over substance. 

Why do I hate it? 

For starters, the tutorial content is beyond bad. Thankfully I knew how to play the game, but I imagine new players are screwed. The music attention bugs when the tutorial VO happens is enough to drive me insane on it's own, but then we look at the fact that the in-game tutorial text is outdated when compared to the unit stats it was meant to be teaching me about! I can understand that updates happen, but perhaps update ALL of your game, rather than a single part? The Army General tutorial was completely lackluster. For the sake of argument, let's say you need to knew 20 things to player Army General properly. The tutorial teaches you 3 of them, and they are along the lines of ""use the keyboard to move and the mouse to select!"" kind of thing. Rather than actually teach you anything the game lazily just lists hours of fan-made tutorial content on the menu, as if that's an legitimate way to teach players. (One of those videos, from the excellent VulkanGaming, is literally him just going through the menus. THANKS)

They've also messed up the keybindings, and you can't rebinds some of the new AI-selection keys and they'll clash :(

(Crap tutorials are a constant Eugen problem. You'll notice their player counts are the same for every game, because they give no shits about new players and just expect the existing fans to buy their latest game through gritted teeth as the old ones are slowly abandoned). 

The in-battle UI is quite the downgrade as well from SD44. Everything is biegy grey. There is no contrast. I can't see anything. The font is tiny. I hate it I hate it I hate it. 

The mission design is now awful as well. Everything is on a timer, and if my multi-battalion battle ground is smashing up 3 enemy platoons spread across an entire map what you'd expect is a complete route, but instead what happens is the 15m timer suddenly becomes a 3m timer because you capped an additional flag, but you can't capture the rest in the next 3 minutes, so time runs out before you can find the sods or cap the flags and so it becomes a minor win, which is absurd. You can't disable this crap mode either. It makes phase C entirely pointless now, because the only time you get to spend there is if you managed to have a drawn out battle that sits at 50% for the entire match AND then you only get phase C for at most 5 minutes.

Also the way companies are split across AI team mates is pretty annoying, and they steal all the points.

Army general is basically pointless to play. The AI is brain dead and easily encircle, and encirclement just destroys them and they can't do anything about it. It's feels abusive to play.

Map selection is TERRIBLE. In the first campaign I played the same map something like 8 times in a row, despite battling in different areas of the campaign map. I guess it was the only one with a river and a town in it, or something? One I attacked with enough companies that I could spread out into the 5v5 mode, but that didn't help freshen the fact that I PLAYED THE SAME DAMN MAP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 

The maps themselves are pretty dull, from what I saw. They're all perfectly balanced, which is fine for MP, but I don't want balance. I like in SD44 that they took the balanced maps and gave you a tiny corner of them or whatever for your mission, it made each battle fresh and interesting rather than they exact same deployment that you just pass off to the AI.

Speaking of AI: the auto resolver in AG is terrible. You can have unfathomably overwhelming odds and you'll still loose a million tanks, so instead you've got to play EVERY battle, and spend 20m placing units and driving tanks everywhere to shoot the near-deserted enemy in the face. And then you win with 0 loses. You can even hand the entire battle off to the tactical AI and it'll get roughly the same results. But the strategic level auto resolve? You'll lose everything.

The battalion design is also pretty absurd. Like, you have an entire battalion just of tanks and one of infantry. Why can't I donate a company of tanks to the infantry, and vice versa? Instead they all have to clump into the same battle. Similar to AA or AT guns. Why do they exist entirely in one battalion when it needs to be spread around?

As for Eugen, all they do is pump out new division DLC for the game. But all they are is unit lists that take the existing units and jumble them around, and give them a different badge. What the game desperately needs is new maps.

I can't really think of a reason to recommend this game, at least from a single-player point of view. MP is similar enough to SD44, ignoring the awful new beige graphics.



Pros:
I like the new entrenchments. But again they half implemented those as you have to place thenm EVERY time. Ugh!

I also like what they're doing with the tactical unit automation. Eugen have always been excellent in this regard.

I spend more time, in the RTS skirmish games, adding soldiers to the fight than I have time to plan a defense or a counter attack. I do better in the General's game because it is slower, it is turn based, and I can actually see what is going on with my units. One reason I have trouble with the rts skirmish games is that I have a low end system with 4mb ram, and a matching low end video system, so zooming in to see what is going on is almost impossible to accomplish. I have downloaded a DLC about DRVAR, yet I don't know if I can even access the DLC or if the DLC is mixed in with all of the other skirmish/Generals games. 
Yet, when I luck into a random skirmish game that does not have bridges I have to cross or take (The casualties taking a bridge are astronomical. Whole units vanish in the twinkling of a pixel.) and my system burden is not that large a resource drain, this game absolutely rocks at the skirmish level. I have been 'lucky' in a few scenarios and have some how won awards for somehow winning a skirmish. In reality though, I usually get a minor defeat decision, which makes me feel like I have accomplished something important, even though it is a defeat. 
The system of buying units is tiresome, and at times that is all that one is doing to replace all those units that have disappear from your order of battle. They vanish, and the game does not inform you, and then you lose victory points and ground to an AI orchestrated counter attack right at the empty space left in your line.

All in all this game gets a thumbs up, yet be sure you have a system that meets or exceeds the max requirements so that you can zoom in to a spot to see what is going on combat wise without waiting long, long seconds, for your system to respond visually to zooming in or zooming out. (keep in mind that the AI is still waxing you butt while your hardware is struggling to keep up).

Does the AI cheat in that it does know what you are up to. Probably so. Yet the AI is fighting to win, which in any combat situation, is what you are supposed to be doing.

All in all, for me, this is a good game to pull out and see if I can somehow pull off a minor victory in either the General mode or in the skirmish mode.",1666485840,1666485840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It looks lovely, the campaigns are interesting and really draw you in but, sadly, the gameplay just doesn't deliver. There are many downsides:
- on large maps with lots of units you simply can't control everything so you either continuously pause to micromanage units (meaning a 20min battle takes hours) or you group units and use 'seize' and 'hold' commands. Sadly, the AI is awful. 'Seize' causes your troops to do insane things like move into single file and go through the choke point covered by enemy machineguns and handing artillery over the AI results in truly terrible targeting choices
- when fighting the AI it will target your artillery with its own. It does this by seeing the puffs of smoke when you fire because the game has an overhead command view. Ignore the fact that you're fighting a battle where neither side has any aircraft for spotting, that your artillery is at the back of the map behind several kilometers of forest... the AI will still see it and kill it.... sigh....
- The replen mechanic is terrible. If you have a battlegroup dug in on the same spot for days and get attacked, you can only place a fraction of your troops - you then get redeployment points every 60 seconds to call in more. Ignore the fact your troops have been dug in for days, you're only allowed to place a tiny fraction on the field to hold your flag points. Every 60 seconds you can trickle in a few more, but they have to start at the back of the map and move all the way up to your positions while enemy units start much closer (the defender has more of the map so attackers spawn in areas are immediately within weapon range of the first few flag objectives). I've actually fought battles with non-mechanised defenders where my first wave of reinforcements took so long to walk from the back of the map that all my trenches etc had been overrun well before they got there.
- The replen mechanism just leads to samey fights. Place a small number of units, send them forwards then, every 60 seconds, spawn some more and feed them into the meatgrinder
- This is even worse on multiplayer where there is no pausing so you have to rely on the AI and it's just a race to dribble more units than the other guy. Because it's a pain to click through and select reinforcements you spend all your time doing that rather than actually enjoying watching the units fight
- The target acquisition mechanic sucks. If one unit sees an enemy, everyone sees it and can shoot at it. If that unit stops seeing it, suddenly no one else can either. So, one lone rifleman with no means of communication can spot an enemy in some woods then every other unit can start engaging it. Get the rifleman killed or move the line of sight and, suddenly, every unit that was happy shooting accurately and scoring hits stops because the target they just had went invisible. This is particularly annoying with aircraft. They can set up an attack run and even start firing the first few rounds when the unit that spotted the target (that has no radio to actually speak to the plane) moves or dies and the plane will cease firing or switch to shoot at an empty piece of ground.

I wanted to like it very badly because i like these kind of games but this is one of the only games that crashes for me out of my entire steam library which is quite a headache after you factor in that the game is not good.

Save your money, my friend. 
Here's why:

The original Close Combat games from like 1995 had amazingly much more depth both in battles and in campaigns. The destructive effect of a Nebblewerfer (sp?) hitting both tanks and infantry in CC3 was amazing. You saw soldiers who had individual names, experience levels, health levels and morale, suddenly dead on the battlefield.

it was 1995, the bodies stayed the entire battle, if you came back to a map in a follow up battle, there would be tank wrecks from the exact spot they were destroyed at. Mortar craters stayed in the map exactly where they struck for the duration of the campaign.

AAA developers cant even do basic stuff like that anymore. It's pathetic. 
It literally is one of the worst games on my steam and i have MudRunner on there. I played OoTP baseball 22 and ragequit yesterday, it was still more fun than playing steel division 2. There is also a million clones of the same game now with Regiments, Steel Division, Warno and all those other spin off of the exact same game done 10 million times until you hate yourself for noticing that.



Now consider Armored Brigade, a game that when i compare the purchases i've made, one i sincerely regret (Steel Division 2 - i want my money back) and one i can play right now, enjoy and not feel like im taking a generational leap back in strategy or rts games. In Armored Brigade, there is workshop support, you can actually download a mod that lets you change the entire game to World War 2 for free. There is no workshop in Steel Division 2, everything is behind DLC paywalls. In Armored Brigade, you can choose a map, choose the units you want, all types of customization. And i understand that Steel Division 2 is trying to be ""historically accurate"" but it is about as historically accurate as Fortnite with how units have these ""firing cycle"" things, they move either extremely fast or too slow, artillery because it has drone support (you) is now brutally effective, beyond even the effectiveness of the current war in yugoslavia (rip boris nelson).... okay im getting off topic.

Basically in a nutshell other games are better.



Leaps backwards listed:
-Campaign general AI is beyond dumb at all difficulties
-Units look really ugly i.e. company of heroes or call to arms units
-No real sense of unit progression with regards to unit experience unlike other games
-Men in unit are just a number, the way the interact in a unit is as a number, not with statistical modifiers based on any specific traits to that individual ""number"" (feels quite autistic)
-The sounds in the game are like 20 years outdated, from the ambience being a really horrible loop to the actual gunfire sounding like a cheap mobile game.
-The way the campaign map works is kind of dumb, it feels very cartoonish and simple minded. Try the CC4 campaign, it even had spies, the enemy would attack like a devious madman. In steel division 2 they attack the way bacteria attacks, without much thought and very frontally... actually its not as smart as bacteria, im not even gonna lie about that.

-the map moves based on who is dead, so if you have a unit and you take an objective, the line will move up...
... but if that unit dies, the line of battle automatically moves backwards, wherein other games or real life, you would be expected to actually move a unit towards that area or objective to push up the frontlines... but i guess when you make a game for 5 year olds, you have to make it realllllllllyyyyyyyy easy and simple. because THAT my friend, is how war works. Imaginary lines move according to their own will and volition, you can actually google that, in WW2 Rommell was famously quoted as saying ""I'm gonna snap if that line keeps bouncing everywhere, hand me my ruger.""


-Artillery.. When you land a successful artillery strike in the close combat series, it feels rewarding, yet you also know that you probably haven't stopped the attack, just stalled or damaged it lightly. In Steel Division 2, it just wipes everyone out, it has a kill rate of %100. Every single mortar, believe it or not, is actually a wire guided ATGM fired from the sky gods of Valhalla and there is absolutely nothing you can do if ... no you can move actually... but the enemy wont. they let you just wipe them out. they dont do anything about it. fun.

in Armored brigade, they will hit you with counter artillery and a whole fleet of jets with napalm and very large ordnance. In CC they will also try to counter battery your artillery. In Steel Division the units move so fast like they all snort meth but the mortars and artillery move through the sky so viciously slowly that you can literally just move your units out of the way before it lands ----- because for some genius reason, you can see mortarts just sailing through the sky the whole time...

unlike other games.. you get the point.



The worst part?
I can keep listing things that are steps back, im not even close to running out.
It really is that bad.

Oh one thing i forgot to mention
There is aircraft in the game
There is an air raid siren in the game that goes off EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. an aircraft attacks your units, i cant figure out how to turn it off because there is no ""air raid"" slider in the sounds menu.
But more importantly, the aircraft are like kids with down syndrome flying around in bumper cars in the sky just doing weird nonsensical stuff. It's really painful to watch, they shouldn't have included them. And tell me when you see that part of the game, that it's 2022-worthy. It looks like it fell out of a loose squishy tumor attached to a dying kids head. 


So in conclusion.
I lost my money playing this game so you don't have to.

I think this game is fantastic.

World War II units, in fantastic levels of detail!
So MANY different units, all with their strengths and weaknesses...
Mass combat and gameplay that focuses on effective use of your units instead of trying to manage some form of income generation back at base...

You don't need the DLC to be competitive in PvP (If that's something that interests you)
You get many hours of gameplay with the maps, campaigns, and divisions available in the base game if Single-Player is what you're after.

However.

I'm irritated by the needlessly steep learning curve to get into this game.

Yes the controls are intricate and complex. (compared to most Non-Eugen strategy games)
Yes there's a ton of different units to consider.
Yes there's many different aspects of the maps, units, weapon systems, and so on that impact gameplay.

So yes - there will be a steep learning curve regardless of what Eugen or the playerbase does to try and mitigate it.

But this game's ""introduction"" to new players? Is practically non-existent.

The tutorials included in-game are nearly worthless.
The tutorial videos linked on the main menu are so out of date - they also leave new players woefully unprepared.

The unit cards don't mention many *very important* details about the units themselves:

- Any mention of weapons classified as MGs not firing at targets within 100m? But Automatic Rifles do?

- Any way in-game to see the improved stats of a unit at 3-star veterancy?
   - Any indication or mention that other stats *also* improve with veterancy, not just the three or four that change on the card?

- Why do AT guns, Tanks, Tank Destroyers, Infantry Guns, etc - display penetration values, ranges, and damage numbers for a weird amalgamation of their different ammo types?

- Does the game explain the ""Agility"" stat on aircraft?

- What ARE the benefits AND drawbacks of:
   - Heavy Cover (While Stationary)
   - Heavy Cover (While Moving)
   - Light Cover (While Stationary)
   - Light Cover (While Moving)
   - No Cover (While Stationary)
   - No Cover (While Moving)
Other than ""The more cover, the better!""?

(This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the things I had to learn from patch notes, reading through guides, tournament casts, personal experimentation, an so on.)

You have to do so much out-of-game research to learn the intricacies of this game, I'm not surprised the active playerbase is pretty small.
Combined with the release of similar games by Eugen - the playerbase is splitting even more.

This is a challenging yet rewarding game. It allows player customization of its battalion ""deck"" of units letting cool and bold strategies to develop and get tested in the battlefield. You have the freedom to attempt several approaches to challenges that you will face online or against AI.

At the time I first reviewed this game I would have easily given it an 8 or 9/10. SD2 has provided me with some of the most fun moments I've ever had playing strategy games and my friends and I have spent many nights playing team games against ourselves and others.

Unfortunately that was over a year ago right after the release of one of the best DLCs Eugen ever made: Burning Baltics. Since then new content has slowed into a stream of occasional 2 division packs, a whopping TWO MAPS, and the much hyped but very disappointing Italy and Drvar DLCs. 

Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is still the top-notch Eugen RTS style, but when that gameplay consists of the same 10-15 divisions on the same 3-4 maps for hours and hours on end? It loses its shine and begins to become frankly unfun when experimenting with ""non-meta"" divisions is met with failure and harassment by other players.

The main issue facing SD2 is the incredibly stagnant map pool. Above I mentioned how in a year and a half we received only two new maps. Of these two, one is definitely top-tier and very fun to play and the other is...decent I'll say. Not good, not bad. Now this wouldn't be an issue if in that same period of time we had say 3 or 4 other maps releasing 1 at a time as free DLC or alongside big paid DLC like Tribute to Italy. But instead we've got 1 standout map accompanied by a slew of mediocre division updates and 1 ok map that the devs already had laying around in the files.

One last point I'll touch on before I wrap this up is that if you, the player, want to get into Steel Division 2 in 2022 you must be prepared for frustration. Frustration at a slow development cycle, frustration at a very fun but very difficult style of game, and frustration as the developers take months to release tiny updates and occasional DLC content. 

Overall in 2022 I would have to give Steel Division 2 a 7/10. 

Pros:
Fun and Challenging Multiplayer
Battle Scale 
Good Performance/Optimization 
Satisfying Gameplay Loop
Insane Customization
Lots of cheap or free DLC
Decent Balance

Cons:
Mediocre Tutorials
Mediocre Singleplayer
Stagnant Development
Occasional annoying bug or mechanic

While I would by no means call myself good at this game ( I mean have you seen the SD League players? ) I feel that I am decent enough and have seen pretty much everything Steel Division has to offer and will freely give my opinion an almost any feature in the game. If you are a new or prospective player considering buying then feel free to leave a comment and I'll try to respond in a reasonable time.

I will be leaving my older review below as many of the points I made there still apply to the game in 2022. 



OLDER REVIEW (More detail oriented)

I have to start out by saying I love this game, it is so much better than the original Steel Division and has sucked me in and convinced me to buy all the DLC. However, there are a number of gripes I have with the current state of SD2. 

**(These gripes are based off my personal experience both in public and private MP sessions.)**

MAPS

Too often maps are the deciding factor in how a game will go and if you end up on the worse side or with the wrong deck then you start the match at a disadvantage. Also of note is the map pool, there have been no new maps in several months other than Tannenberg which is a 4v4/10v10 map. The 1v1-3v3 pool is limited and randomized selection almost always picks the same two or three maps. A map creator or even a couple new maps with each major update would be amazing for this games longevity.

AA

Next, the AA buff, or How I Learned to Stop Playing Air Decks and Love Heavy Flak. In the current state of the game, 2-3 heavy AA pieces will shut down almost any air wave a non air deck can muster. Even when attempting to manually space out planes and bring them in from other angles, heavy flak tracks and spots so quickly and has such a massive amount of suppression that you are likely to lose several planes. I do think air decks before this change were extremely powerful, but the scales have been tipped too far and now decks that need to rely on air often find themselves on the back foot when facing any decent AA presence.

SUPPRESSION

Buckle up because I have a lot to say about this. Relatively recently, there was a change to how suppression worked with infantry/support weapons both dealing and receiving massively increased amounts of suppression. While an interesting change to the gameplay and overall not a bad change, I believe that much like the AA buff, it went too far. German MG teams are incredibly powerful now as they have an insane amount of both damage and suppression, even the squad based ones (which we will return to later). On the other side, Russian MGs in general are awful and in some cases will lose at long range against normal german squad MGs. The only exception in my experience is the Doushka team as the .50 cal puts out an insane amount of suppression. The change has also made sapper/engineer units incredibly important. Where before they were good but not necessarily vital units, they are now the end all be all when it comes to forest fighting. Oftentimes, I will see engineer units throw satchels at enemy engineers only for both units to either die or be suppressed immediately. This has turned what was a useful and fun type of unit into a very strong gimmick that can only be countered by itself or other gimmicks like flamethrower troops.

SQUAD MGs AND SQUAD ""MGs""

Another relatively recent change, MGs now have a minimum range of 100 meters. Combined with this was the reclassification of most Western Allied (W.A.) squad MGs (Bren, B.A.R., etc.) into auto rifles, effectively having most W.A. squads dodge the CQC nerf. This nerf applies to almost every other faction in the game, meaning standard W.A. infantry is now more effective at close range than almost every other standard infantry in the game. However, there are some positives to come out of this change, such as infantry now standing a much better chance against armored vehicles at close range and dedicated close range infantry being much stronger and less situational. 

THE .50 CAL DILEMMA 

With the release of Burning Baltics (the most recent major DLC) .50 cal MGs and others of similar caliber were incredibly overpowered. Before the MG rebalance and range nerf, decks that had American half tracks or tanks were basically impervious to air assault as the .50 cals blot out the sky. The devs quickly caught on to this and released a patch nerfing the overall range of .50 cals as well as they're air attack range. Unfortunately, dedicated AA trucks which used .50 cal or similar were also caught up in this which makes them effectively useless.",1631053067,1663175996,True,19,2,0.682542264461517334,0,True,False,False

Why reasonable and not great, specially considering the hours put in. Frankly with the amount of man hours that went into creating this game and how many dlc nation packs they put out I just think they dropped the ball with single player. There is a large cohort of people that just want to play against the AI and Eugen don't seem to care that much about them or the dollars in their wallets.

But sure there are those who would say they release the odd campaign for single player. Yeah they do. But they really haven't done much to fix the AI. Not even talking about inside combat. They have yet, as far as I can see, done little to improve single player so the AI makes terrible mistakes like attacking with a regiment of tank destroyers and a regiment of AA guns etc against one squad of infantry that wandered to far from the front line. Essentially alot of really good units against cheap as chips infantry. But the AI doesn't send them in with infantry support oops and the bulk of the enemy prized armor gets taken out. Cant remember the last time I had a really good tense nail biter armor vs armor.

Course they could fix the AI but thats a fair few man hours again needed to bash it into shape so they let it stay like that. Course the main problem is the game was designed significantly for Multiplayer and Army General seems a bit kind of hashed together to make it playable singleplayer. 

I hope Warnos' singleplayer campaign is much better built from the ground up.

Some may complain that units- even heavy tanks could be one shotted if exposed but that adds to the element of hidden danger and good scouting on your part. It punishes failures sure, but it also rewards good planning that exploits what they gave you.

The campaign has poor AI and the battles are pretty long which makes the campaign overall take a long time that's not a huge issue though.
My real problem is the amount of micro needed which has completely put me off 1v1 multiplayer which is usually what I play in RTS but it's pretty unenjoyable. You can obviously get far better than other players but it's really difficult to make a strategy when you're constantly needing to call in new units and micro them all over the map which is very large. 

I really like how historically accurate it is, they clearly care but your only real choices for multiplayer is 10v10 or 1v1 unless you want 30+ minute lobby to get a game. The 10v10s have maps far too small for 10 players and just turn into everyone spamming out arty or heavy armor.

If there were 2v2/3v3 auto match I think the mutiplayer would see a lot more action especially if there were units you could have deployed at the start of the match instead of this weird gamey thing where you rush all your stuff as far up as you can.

 Might be the weirdest bit of the multiplayer really that instead of starting out with two frontlines already established like you would think a ww2 rts which is trying to be as realistic as it can be instead especially in the comp scene you just have two frontlines running into each other with everything to cap flags",1661386423,1661386423,False,10,2,0.564564287662506104,0,True,False,False

HOI4 lets you be the government and the joint chief of staffs. You decide what the economy should produce, what troops should be made and where they should go. When micro-ing, you're telling divisions where to go and who to attack.

TOAW4 takes you from the strategic to the operational level. While you can reproduce whole world wars, the game really shines on its rendition of operational-level battle, or what happens when you're telling that division to attack in HOI4. You're not the government anymore; you're a four or five-star general in charge of a specific front, and you're telling specific battalions and sometimes even companies where to go.

Steel Division takes it one degree further. The Army general mode certainly gives a good simulation of operational-level decision-making, but the game is really all about making you a Colonel in charge of conducting the attacks you as general are ordering in TOAW4. Now you must actually conduct the attack or hold the position, using whatever military assets your general gave you. 

Steel Division is hard but rewarding. Things make sense: you need to see where other units are, you need to understand what type of units are effective and what the range of their weapons are -- as I learnt the hard way, there is no point telling five squads of antitanks to run for a mile through an open plan to destroy tanks: the tanks will kill them way before they get in firing range.

You need to think about terrains and lines of visibility. It felt very satisfying to trap dozens of Soviet infantrymen and kill them all with the ruthlessly efficient MG42. 

You need to maintain awareness of what is going on at the map level - and it's not that easy, and requires pausing often in the beginning. The opposing AI is smart, even on medium, and will not perform suicidal moves. 

It's the closest to war as it is from the perspective of a colonel or lieutenant-colonel: fighting field by field, road by road, farm by farm. Keep attacking when you're smashing through lest you lose some momentum. Know when it's useless to send reinforcements to a doomed position. Follow each of your squads and make sure they act to support each other. The enemy is ruthless and fast, don't get so caught up in one engagement that you lose sight of what's happening somewhere else.

From a graphics perspective, the game is absolutely beautiful and vivid. You do feel like you're taking parts in those engagements. You can zoom in fully and see the enemy decimated by your machinegun, or your tank being burned by an enemy AT.

Steel Division 2 falls right between the Grand Strategy of Hearts of Iron and the Tactical Strategy of Company of Heroes. It is a blast, although the variation of maps, fights and the AI Commands could be improved.

I started this game awed by the fresh take of SD2, managing a few hundred units in fights deriving from your decisions and encounters in a strategic / campaign map. It is like the classic idea of the earlier Total War games taken to WW2. I thought I'd be tired of it after 30-40 hours, as you can see in my original review below. However, regardless of the mentioned points that can be improved through DLC and sequels, the structure makes it hold for a much longer play time for non hardcore players. The Campaigns are long enough to be meaningful, but short enough to change to a different chapter (you can choose the order and side of the campaigns) to avoid too much repetition. I'm on my second campaign, with the opposite side, and fighting (not auto resolving) around 2/3 of the encounters. It is marvelous.

Pros:
-Realism: historical campaigns, units, places.
-Controls: Overall, easy to control units and give different kinds of orders. Some complain is too much micro managing. I disagree, but I'm biased as someone who enjoys HOI3 for example. However, you have grouping, selecting by class of unit, different kinds of orders with hotkeys and different default behavior for units when moving or opening fire. You can pause, give orders, slow motion, double speed, etc.
-Very well-thought tactical battles: the system of units deployment and the reinforcement every XX time to bring more troops to the combat is great. It works in every aspect. Maps have different terrain and tactical-strategical challenges.
-Promising campaign system: I love the Campaigns as a way to weave together your battles and challenge the player. To be honest, if it didn't have this, I would've been done with the game after 20hours. Just setting up a battle is not challenging or fulfills me enough to persevere for a long time. It's the combination of both that makes the game most fun. It is still a bit light, bare bones, but it is good enough to enjoy.
-Graphics: Pretty to look at!

Cons:
-AI system / orders: Although the AI orders generally works to cover basics (take this area, defend this area, fire at will, counter battery, hunt, etc.) it can be refined. When defending, units often won't move to the best side or point in a spot of trees for example. I also found Hunt a bit silly sometimes (hunt means units will move to the desired area but stop and fight every unit they encounter) as sometimes they will stop in open ground and engage the enemy instead of moving a few meters ahead or to the side to an area with cover.
-Campaign: As I said, this is still light, but it proves great and I expect the developers working further on this (as SD1 didn't even have this).
-Maps: I do feel the variety in each are / campaign are bit lower than I'd like. The first campaign I fought 3 or 4 battles (out of 12 ? ) in the exact same map. Also, would love Urban maps, like actual cities. So far haven't seen any.

Also, my recomendation to the Developers: Please, please, please! Develop more Army General campaigns. I don't mind other DLC with historial divisions, but my money goes to something where I can play longer, have a series of battles and challenges, with new maps and divisions, that represents historical encounters. I will keep supporting this kind of content.

Original Review:
Only played for a couple of days and I can tell it's a good game. 
The strategic map, or campaign map, it's simple (maybe too simple) but makes the overall strategy mechanic work. Wish it wasa bit more ""sandbox"", like a Total War with HoI complexity. Anyhow, it's ok.
The tactical battles are a blast and tons of fun. If anything, they can become too chaotic. i wish the interface was more helpful to help you organize your dozens of units, and provide a few more elements (like defensive direction of infantry squadrons, as the AI system doesn't work that great when several enemies enter your range). In any case, the ""smart orders"" work well enough to save a lot of micro managing (Paradox themselves could learn quite a few things, with their horrible AI Battle Plans in HoI4 -reinstalled HoI3 last week myself-) and you can lend the AI whole brigades if you wanna have an easier managing at first, or just more fun watching the upclose combat.
It's not a perfect game, and might get me tired after 30-40h, but well worth the price and time. Challenging enough without losing the fun. Score: 4/5.",1643476123,1659119875,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Be weary of DLCs as most of the Steam community thinks they are overpriced and I'd say 75% of them don't include new maps--just new troops, armor, and artillery. As usually a solo player, I'd say it's not worth getting if you don't also get the History Pass and playing as the General on  massive maps. However, plenty of enthusiasts thrive on multiplayer. I think the Baltic DLC includes a map so I'm going to review that as a possibility.

Tactically, the game seems a bit quirky and unintuitive, but there are plenty of Youtube videos on the various nuances of the game.

Love the history and attention to detail. I think Eugen blundered on the DLCs though.

Tactically, I'm really enjoying the Call to Arms series more as there's more variations of what you can do,with  tons of campaign material--many single segments last hours. But SD2 is also a win in my book. I think you will find issues with the AI in both games--to each his preference.

I don't care if I am seriously disadvantaged strategically in fact I may even enjoy that.  OK not too much and I don’t want it to be too easy either.  So here’s my suggestion: create a random map generator or a public map creation mod tool that can only be used in single player mode.

That is so much more satisfying that creating a generic division based on what you think you might need in a battle that follows a historical storyline.

Because of the new army general game mode, you can now really use logistics to defeat your enemy without a shot being fired in some cases. Keeping logistics lines of communication open are essential. For example, In one campaign I defeated the entire enemy army almost without a battle by flanking and encircling their forces while avoiding battle and waiting for their supplies to run out. B. H. Liddell Hart would be proud.

The one downside for me is how the real time battle maps are situated. Why are we struggling over these arbitrary capture flags randomly dispersed throughout the map? If the enemy's objective is to dislodge me, why am I forced to protect several flags on the opposite side of a river that would serve as a great defensive position? Doesn't make sense to me. Other than that, this is a great game and a must have for any military strategy enthusiast.

the game is still very decent and fun to play but the main problem is the ignorant and offensive devs
  since devs just removed the regional prices they selectively restricted their market to EU and USA

besides that, devs are selective on their own discord & in-game rules and you can't expect them to bring justice when an argument happens, I wanted to support them by buying their new unfinished barely functioning game called warno but these gold diggers really didn't deserve this support

That makes it, unfortunately, feel  unrewarding, at least for singleplayer against AI.  So you won your battle, but lost the war anyway. Again. Again. Again.  I know, ""git gud"". But ""git gud"" is not the problem, it would be more a matter of put in more effort to win and multitask.  But multitasking isn't fun. Surely, other implementations were possible to, like freezing aspects of the battle field so you can fight it out in smaller, localised maps.

The DLC is usually 2 shitty battlegroup unlocks for 5$ and larger dlc packs for 15 or 20$. I suppose its meta with 2022 gaming, but you would think the devs would push actual updates not just DLC that cost money and arent very good or add very much to the game anyways. they have probably made more off of the DLC than the game itself, and the DLC or game never goes on sale. Also some of the tank metrics for pen are a bit wonky at times. Sometimes shells that should penetrate bounce and sometimes shells that should bounce penetrate. The maps are fairly decent but TBH I think the game and the DLC are overpriced but still good. Reccomend if you like large scale battles. Note: there is usually only 1 or 2 lobbies of players online at a time and half the time when you start a match people quit and you get bots on your team or the enemy team. In review I think that the game is fun, but low playerbase, and the DLC for historical battle unlocks is annoying. Could care less about unlocking DLC battlegroups, but when I play with my friends, and we cant play a historical battle because one of us doesnt have the DLC is really annoying.

Steel Division 2 is all about mixing all those aspects together into one game. 
The single player campaigns really do make you feel like a General, the soviet campaign mainly being about driving forward in great numbers and overunning the German defences whereas the German Campaign is a lot more of a realistic feeling grind against the Allies war machine at a time that the Axis were starting to become unable to produce enough weapons and equipment and also were running low on numbers in comparison to the many countries of huge numbers fighting on the other side. 

Anyway... back to the game... the multiplayer is great fun with 10v10 battles while you control one division of your own making based on historical accuracy where possible. 

I mainly play single player games apart from a few others with friends but Steel Division 2 is one game i see myself entering online battles time and time again in between the Army General Campaigns.

With the base Soviet VS russia it is okay, but when it comes to any other allied country you start to see how germans are broken AF. 

I play against AI Hard and above, and its often literally impossible to do anything when playing as Canada, USA, british etc, heres a list of the most common BS you will encounter:

1. German 88 will literally one tap most planes out, not only that but they touch multiple planes, if the enemy pulls only 2 of them in the same area NONE of your plane will never make it through, they also have a pretty insane range and can shoot and destroy any tank with ease.

2. When the AI starts pulling Tiger Es the game is basically over, they will outrange anything you have except 76,5mm AT guns, are not penetrable by wolverines or fireflies at medium/long range, and of course has a big gun. 

3. Im not even going to start with their artillery... lets just say they get some that fires a single round and kills a medium tank with impressive accuracy.

When i play as the germans its pretty much just a ssnowball against anything that isnt soviet, which is really a shame.

These problems happen every single game i play, playing as anything other than the 2 main factions is imposing an even greater difficulty upon yourself. 

I think its still one of the best WW2 RTS you can have, and is a really big improvements over previous installations.

They all tie together for the position, the 'Eugen games' as I call them. Steel Division 2 is my favorite, though, and I'm gonna explain why.


First off, the setting. While the barren steppes and frozen tundras of the Eastern Front of WW2 might not be the most aesthetically pleasing battlefields to find yourself on, they are some of the most tactically / strategically interesting. One of my least favorite aspects of games that focus on the Western Front of WW2 is the tendency to constantly be fighting bogged down in hedgerow hell, with nothing but bocage in sight. Between the hedgerows and bocage are small villages, bits of open field and some water. That's it for that setting, almost entirely save for a few windmill areas.. and there's a lot of tactical limitations that come with fighting in terrain like that. The wide, open Eastern Front on the other hand? Different story entirely, you now have rolling terrain full of hills, mountains, forests and villages galore. The battlefields of the East feel like proper battlefields and you can position and utilize your units accordingly.. they also lend themselves much better to the 4 vs 4 and 10 vs 10 formats these games tend to live and die by.

But that's only scratching the surface. If you own all the DLC which I do, there's a massive amount of variety in this game. The DLC can all be had on various sales or off key resellers for not a whole lot in scope of how much they add combined. You'll see lots of spoiled, angry children smearing Cheeto dust all over their keyboards writing bad reviews for this game + the DLC and it's all based around DLC pricing. I got the base game and EVERY SINGLE DLC for somewhere in the $100-120 region on sale at one point and to be honest... that's a damned steal for all that you get. There's an IMPRESSIVE amount of unit variety in this game, if it was used in WW2 by the division represented, bet your ass it's available. The DLC's add lots of Western divisions and such so some of the equipment and units are anachronistic / out of place for the maps but that's to be expected. From the Italian resistance to Soviet partisans to captured and repurposed French flame tanks to obscure German AFV's to the Italian shit-boxes.. it's all here.

What is most impressive however, is the attention to detail. Every, single, piece of ingame equipment used by your units is modeled in at least a semi-realistic if not totally realistic fashion. Weapons have realistic ranges, you won't be shredding in CQB fights with LMG's nor will you have units sniping with SMG's. Tank armor feels good, for the most part, some aspects are definitely 'gameified' but overall the armor system feels like it makes sense and stays to a mostly realistic tone overall, only sacrificing small bits of realism for the sake of not screwing up game balance entirely. For example, AT infantry rocking rifles like a PTRS-41 can take out German heavy tanks if they get close enough.. pretty unrealistic but if they couldn't the game would get MUCH more lopsided in terms of balance in certain divisional matchups. Overall it doesn't feel like an issue though, if a light tank rolls up on a heavy and starts shooting it'll bounce shots like no tomorrow and most engagements between armored units feel grounded.

There's also smart orders, something specific to this game and WARNO.. and it's also part of the reason why I prefer these two games the most. While there is TONS of room to micro your units in this game via moving tanks in and out of cover to snipe AT guns or other tanks, or carefully positioning and maneuvering infantry into ambush points or whatever else.. you can also use smart orders to give temporary control of certain units to the AI while you focus on another part of the front. This is HUGE and is crucial in larger games with much more going on in my opinion.

Then you have the amazing singleplayer side. No I don't mean skirmishing with the AI, that's a mistake you should avoid at all costs. However, playing the Historical Battles or Army General campaigns is a different story entirely and there's a lot (and I mean a LOT, some of the AG campaigns are quite long affairs and there's still more being added) of content and gameplay to be had there. My Steam play time doesn't save right (GeForce Experience has my playtime at 137 hours where-as Steam has it at 25) but I probably have over 50-60 hours in AG alone playing by myself against the AI.

There is just so much to love here. The maps, the unit and division variety, the grounded realism in the design whilst not completely losing sight of the fact it's a game that needs to be fun / semi-balanced, the overall setting.. this game and all of the Eugen titles are a rare treat for fans of RTT / RTS and Wargames and I think you'd be a downright fool to not get all of them and experience them for yourself if you haven't already.. assuming you like these kinds of games. Don't let the negative reviews from salty idiots who are mad the DLC's don't include entire new games worth of content (armchair developers love leaving Steam reviews) or come at zero cost dissuade you, because I don't regret a single cent I spent on these games.. because they're near and dear to me. Some of my absolute all-time favorite titles. The only downside is the smaller community, unfortunately.. but otherwise I have nothing but amazing things to say.

Amazing game, do yourself a favor and buy it + the DLC.",1649498305,1653966078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With the new released [b][i]Steel Division 2[/i][/b] Eugen Systems, on the other hand, ships us to the Eastern Front, more precisely to Belarus.

You have more than 600 different, historically accurate units at your disposal from which you can create your own battle group - including anti-tank guns, attack aircraft, flamethrower tanks and assault guns. For example, you should rely on a balanced mix of tanks and foot soldiers, but also don't forget to carry enough reconnaissance units and also keep an eye on the costs and movement speeds of the troops. Equally important is to pay attention to ranges and ammo supplies, and to keep in mind that heavy barrage will freak out soldiers and they'll either go into shock or take to their heels.

The real-time battles themselves play like in the Wargame series or in [i]Steel Division: Normandy 44[/i], i.e. everything is simulated as realistically as possible - including vehicle damage, cover, line of sight and types of ammunition. At the beginning you place units in the field for a fixed number of points and then continuously receive additional points during the battle that are not dependent on success. The winner is the side that holds more capture points over time. [b][i]Steel Division 2[/i][/b] is already a challenge against medium-heavy AI opponents, as almost nothing will forgive you. If you let a tank column drive through a street in a hurry without reconnaissance, soldiers with bazookas could hide in the houses, who send all the steel colossuses across the Jordan within a few seconds.

The battles are also divided into three phases that determine which units you can use from your battle group. In the individual battles, the heavy troops such as tiger tanks or heavy artillery usually become available in the last phase, while the light units can be used right from the start. In Army General mode, the new campaign, the division's distance from the battle counts.

The new campaign mode would be a welcome change, especially for single players. But even so, [b][i]Steel Division 2[/i][/b] entertains at a high level, especially in the multiplayer mode.

Steel Division 2 is an awesome strategy game with a wealth of free and DLC content that, while potentially near the end of its lifespan, has provided me with so many hours of gaming and passed its best traits on to WARNO.

I won't comment on multiplayer, as virtually all of my in-game time is on Army General mode, AI skirmish battles, and games with friends. The multiplayer community appears to be similar in nature to Eugen's other popular series, Wargame, and the multiplayer community there is a direct result of the radioactive runoff from the Chernobyl disaster and should be avoided at all costs. As such, this will be almost entirely single player focused.

Pros:

Steel Division 2 is a unique game, and the only modern, high-quality game of its kind. The Army General mode has a somewhat steep learning curve that, with patience, is never daunting. It is far more approachable than, say, Graviteam Tactics but that doesn't mean it's simplistic. You just don't have to spend a whole afternoon to learn how to enjoy the game - no disrespect to the Graviteam fans out there. :) Apples and oranges comparison in many ways.

It is highly unique and in how it blends RTS and army management. The fact that you can make strategies on winning specific scenarios and then fighting that out in battle is arguably the best way to blend a more modern strategy game where combat happens daily and a lot changes in a day, and the era of pitched battle is over. Campaigns such as Burning Baltics and Death on the Vistula are absolutely perfect in size and scope I think.

There is still a good amount of unit variation that is hard to find in a World War II game compared to their Cold War Wargame series. There are a great many divisions that play in very different ways, and even down to the unit level the differences are immense between factions and divisions. In terms of the Axis, there are also a great many countries to play as well. In terms of the Soviets... more on that later.

The AI has, for me at least, always given me a challenge in the RTS portion of the game, and can provide a solid challenge without being particularly easy to cheese in both the strategic campaign and in battles.

The graphical and sound quality is very good, with the voice acting for units being quite commendable. The sounds of battle are loud and overwhelming when you zoom in on the fighting. All aerial units and armored units look and feel very unique and real and infantry looks and acts very real.

I originally mentioned that the Army General AI starts to falter later in the campaigns. This has not happened since late 2020-early 2021 and offers a very respectable challenge (and that's not to understate - it will seriously hurt you if you don't pay attention, or get unlucky).

It is arguably the only game set in the WW2 setting that accomplishes this niche and isn't either rarely updated, twenty to thirty years old, or actually terrible. This doesn't diminish SD2s value whatsoever - it only enhances it for me. I hate looking for a game, such as my insane desire to see a deeper Napoleonic strategy game in the style of Ultimate General, that either doesn't exist or is...just, not very good.

Cons:

The map design is in need of serious work, and is by no means good for competitive gameplay. Furthermore, the map variety is criminally small. This is one of the two biggest flaws with the Army General mode, as you will fight battles on the same battlefields over. And over. And OVER, especially if you are playing a campaign on the defensive (most Axis campaigns). This has gotten better, but still...guys please add like 10 new maps or give us a map editor, I am begging you. This is the biggest issue. There are plenty of maps but you can only defend the same position for a few hundred hours, especially as a campaign player who prefers defending! (It's partially on me for that)

The Soviet unit variety needs a lot of love. There are only so many ways you can make WWII era divisions unique, but it definitely feels like the Axis units look, sound, act, and feel far more varied. The Soviets do have Polish and Estonian units/divisions and are getting Romanians in the next division, and I could be forgetting some, but the Axis historically incorporated a lot of foreign troops from Finland, Romania, Hungary, Estonia, and of course Germany and their variety is admittedly notably better. It's historically accurate though so I don't expect Eugen to go back and send like an expeditionary force to the USSR.

The infantry in this game looks... weird. It is a definite downgrade from how they looked in the first Steel Division and Wargame, and I don't exactly know what they did differently but their faces are kind of grotesque. You don't look at them often but like... they're there. Watching. I think.

Neutral:

There are a LOT of Wehraboos who play this game and so you will inevitably see people mad that their Tiger did not single-handedly win them the game. Not a flaw of the game, just annoying. Just remind them of Bomber Harris and they'll piss off.

Breakthrough battles and how they work. Basically, there's a timer that counts down and you and the opponent have to occupy flags, or strategic positions, across the map. Whoever has more at the end of the battle wins. As the attacker against a fortified enemy you have zero and have to capture the majority to win, and initially 12 minutes to do so, however with each flag you capture the timer goes up and eventually starts ticking down for the opponent until they lose. Basically, if you have more flags you have more time and if you have less flags you have less time. I like this because it keeps things spicy, some people hate the rush but you have a free planning period to place units and issue orders and in SP you can pause so it's never impossible at all, and it's always fair.
TLDR: breakthrough stressful, capture flag for more time to win, stop enemy from capture to make them lose and you win depending on if defending or attacking.

-----

Ultimately, Steel Division 2 is a very fun WWII RTS/Large-Scale strategic game. The gameplay is fun, though the map variety can make it stale. Even so, the sheer volume and variety to the game is so damn good and sets it above all of its competitors.

I think Eugen is lucky to some extent that there just isn't any other game that fits this niche as it gives them the opportunity to comfortably take their time making new content perfect while also dominating the genre, however it would be nice to have more content for the game in general. They know this too and are always cooking up something, and I've never perceived SD2 to be in a content drought compared to massive AAA devs like CA.

8.5 / 10, it fits what I am looking for almost perfectly, and if they make even larger strategic games with the same formula, more maps and countries for each side, I think this would be the only game I play.

""Coming from playing Red Dragon and loving every minute I have to recommend against buying this game.

Single player is a bore, AI will blatantly cheat in autoresolve scenario's and will exploit ruthlessly for technical win conditions on the operational level screen. Yes, if you are a cheesy play to win at all costs player you can force these same technical conditions, but I'm here to play a company level battle game, not Hearts of Iron.

The ""Frontline"" mechanic is completely worthless, telegraphing ANY attempt at engaging enemy forces en enfilade and your own forces will surrender en masse when caught in a cul de sac. The Phase mechanic works well with Eugen's idea that their games are all about the meeting engagement, but it enforces that playstyle in a VERY heavy handed manner. This is not about player options, and is even less about gentlemens agreements when playing with friends.

The myriad DLC options and their obscurity of what division actually has what can be viewed as a positive and negative, those interested in the minutiae of the individual regiments will be either pleased or horrified that that one little detail of interest was included / excluded. I would have more preferred an option to select an archetype of a division and then be able to make trade offs to specialise to a specific regiment. It also feels like I'm punished for not knowing what Guards Army had what tanks when I'm building a list, maybe a system closer to Tabletop Flames of War would make this more approachable?

The saving grace for this game (and the reason I can be bothered to write this essay) is multiplayer with friends, either competitively or in comp stomps, the game shines with a good level of balance and unpredictability. Multiplayer against random internet strangers is not recommended unless you like playing against *JooseBaker1943* and *DidNothingWrong1488* but at least this game punishes trolling game play like tank rushes and infantry spam.

Finnish campaign is great in coop, as is Burning Baltics. Because there is so much going on and so many details, everyone can take care of one part of the front. It's pretty overwhelming at times, but still a lot of fun. 

All in all, it's a good Eastern Front game that is mostly realistic, yet fun and accessible. Remember to play with original battalion names to get all the cool unit names on the map.

Even with the ""History pass"" you don't own all the DLC's and this is almost as expensive as the base game.

You should choose the most expensive version when buying so as not to be disappointed. These DLC extra costs will certainly scare off many RTS players... and rightly so.

I really hope that Eugen won't make the same mistake with WARNO because you probably have the best RTS in front of you and when it gets old you won't find anyone to play with because nobody is willing to buy a lot of extras for an old title.

A lot of games turn players off because of this IG shop mentality.
If you're asking money for a full game, the DLC's should be significantly cheaper.

Very difficult learning process.

This was a great game with a excellent multiplayer system. unfortunately the developers have massively unbalanced the system by introducing 'Mary Sue' German units. 

These are units that when you approach from cover can turn, aim and shoot faster than you can. Even though you know their position and are effectively ambushing them. I get that the first shot may not be effective due to the armour, but the situation has just got out of hand.

 A common tactic with these units is to simply park them in an open field, safe in the knowledge that you are virtually indestructible. 

If you join a 10v10 multiplayer match now, you will see the German side completely filled (10 players) whilst there are 1 or 2 lower ranked players queued for the Allied/Soviet side. It has been this way since the introduction of these units and the developers steadfastly refuse to acknowledge the situation.

The single player scenarios are worth the price of the game alone, but the main attraction of the game was the multiplayer, which has been broken for some time now. 

Also, reinstalling wiped out my rank. I don't really care about that but thought I should mention it.

I suck less and less every hour I play, don't expect to go in and beat the AI straight off the bat in the campaign mode. The campaign mode strategic map mechanics are still pretty confusing. I think this is one of those games you start to really get the hang of after about 100 hours.

Update as of about 750 hours into the game..... I LOVE IT! 

Lots of quality of life improvements, new campaigns etc improved the title but for me the game became more fun the more I played it and the better I got at it. 

This is one of those games where when you first play it, start a campaign and don't invest emotionally in your success too much, spend your first couple campaigns just experimenting and getting a grip of how all the mechanics work, especially campaign mechanics.  I used a campaign of just moving around and doing things on the campaign map to really get a handle on how that side of the system works.

If you want a strategic level of complexity in a war game then this is for you. If you want something more tactical where even shit units can be good if used right then look elsewhere. For example, shermans are still shermans and when engaging a tiger for example, they will loose 10 times out of 10 if the tiger has any range between it and the shermans. Unit veterancy helps but only when they are vet 2-3. Vet 1 seems like where units become actual fighters and less units straight out of boot camp. Veterancy makes or breaks this game for me. If you have veteran units then you have a MUCH higher chance of winning the fight even if the unit you're up against is technically better. Which really kills the fights for me personally, as even if you have 10 squads against say 3 squads, if the the 3 squads are equally equipped but vet three vs vet 0 squads or even vet 1 squads then they will mop the floor with your squads. Not saying numbers should be everything but they should play some part. I don't seem myself coming back to this game a third time. The only reason I came back a second time was because there is not really any compelling RTS's out that play on a tactical level.

Truly awesome and a great overhaul to the previous game. But I hate to say this is never populated enough and I actually feel lonely playing this.

(2021/3/3)""600 hours? That's rookie number."" If anyone tell you this, don't be demoralized. However it's still true especially this game has such a community that is full of passionate and supportive players. This is still a bit underrated.

(2021/5/5)I don't see the potential of most infantry divisions after the update. Maybe that's how it is in reality, but balance wise it makes little sense for (mostly) 1v1 scene.

(2021/5/24) And now there's inf meta all over again, but with different flavor. It's either how wrong I was just a few week ago, or eugen fixing this really hard so the game's never been at a stable state.

(2021/9/22) I think I was right the whole time. Moreover it's harder to master general soviet divisions in 1v1 situation, as lower range of guns, harder time against german infantry since the arsenal isn't decent at best, while offensive stance need to be taken with extra care without being caught by a single pzgren squad. Maybe I'm just a bad player after all.

(2022/3/7) Probably turning off this game unless I can find my way back to a competitive status... not just bashing new players when going matchmaking makes it a bit dull, but also consistently losing when an even match comes.

DEVS ARE ARSE

NEG review till the mods that make the game playable are updated ""half a year no updates""

Dont get me wrong its a good game but man did they really fail at a lot of stuff.
The A.I is horrible. the armys are built like a deck of cards and the amount of absolutely nothing on some factions sides really just makes you think "" Huh you really didnt want anyone to play this game did you?"" 
now this wouldnt be a problem cause of mods...but..thats a problem as well. as of now 90% dont work, dont work with each other or have just vanished mainly cause what appears to be a dieing community. example, the mods i use to help improve the game were the developers failed horrendously like with AT range for infantry ""you have to litteraly walked them right up to tanks the standard range is that bad"" deck buffer mod "" like i said these armys literally come with like 5 dudes and a Safety guy, you will run outta troops and equipment fast cause of this so a deck modder mod is needed but ive never been able to use it cause...well it dont work. none of em do. 
Infantry cons-
useless against armor- AT range is like 5 feet so AT guys are pretty much useless unless the tank decides to drive right up on em even then you can bet your boys are pinned and will not make a single effort to save themselves they will just lay there and die. 
German infantry seems to stomp russian infantry in 1v1s. 
but the russian armys are practically endless compared to the germans, you lose 5 tigers or any armor you feel that pain where as the russians are sending wave after wave after wave of tanks "" which is very realistic"" and the german tanks do seem to have an edge and by edge its the tiger everything else is like a tin can to the russians. 
artillery- 
it can dominate the fight but you gotta pay attention to em, they run outta ammo almost immediately and deplete supply trucks even faster. the smaller the caliber the arty the more accurate it is "" except 50mm morters those things blow, they have no fire at will so you have to baby em, theyre useless"" then the self propelled 105,120mm artys fire slow, and they generally miss badly at what theyre firing at but they scare tf outta the Ops.",1620314189,1646372911,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not a mod-friendly game. (big turn-off for me)

Units have some solid flavor (even if the voice lines can get grating, due to their low variability)
Gameplay mechanics are fun and in-depth (though quite a few of them are not explained to the player)
Battles are varied and map selection is ok (though a map editor would be greatly appreciated)

Ability to build decks and the phase-model of play are both great concepts
Graphics are nice and scale well
Balance is solid
AI is ok, but still needs to be improved (a lot)

Historical battles, army general are both pretty cool and greatly benefit from co-op
Co-op in general is a fantastic feature of this game

Game rating: 6.5/10

Would only recommend it for a strategy nerd with a flair for WW2. Otherwise, not good value and to be avoided.

Going to give it a downvote, because outside of a small group of dedicated people, this game has little to offer that other RTS games don't do better. For me, it is a solid game, for the average consumer, it isn't.

Developers are mediocre (by industry-standards)

DLC is Eugen-standard, being very minimal across the board and not responsive to the community at all. 
But I am not rating DLC here. Can't recommend many DLCs, so pick whichever you like the most. When they are on sale. 
Gameplay won't change much, you just get some more units.
They have pretty much confirmed that they won't do any more time-frame shifts or added maps or modes, so the growth potential of the game is close to 0.

The best part of the game, next to the massive and complex, but not complicated, battle scenarios, are the Divisions and Battlegroups. You can design your own Division based on real Battlegroups and their Men and Equipment, while listening to the epic main theme.
I can recommend this game to anyone who is interested in WW2 games or strategic and tactical games in general. 

About the DLCs: the content of the DLCs are very nice and a cool addition. The free ones add really cool maps. I would not recommend buying the others when not in sale because they are just too expensive, although containing really epic content. Although everyone who is interested in WW2 history will eventually buy them sooner or later.

Hope i could help in your decision.


Edit:
February 2022


This game is great. And i still stand behind my first review. But there are two big Problems. If Eugen doenst take care of this, the game will die. 
So first of all: Lack of maps. This game needs new 10v10 Maps.
Second of all: The Community sucks Ass. Nobody seems to know how a 10v10 or even a 4v4 is played. There simply is no Teamplay. But this is a teamgame so the Matches suck. Why are there no Tutorials on how to play a 10v10 game? Different lanes, how to mark your Position etc. Nobody seems to know. They buy a KT and drive into a town, while an infantry Division is forced to fight on 3 unplayed lanes on open Ground. 
There can always be ignorant dudes that just dont care. But at this point in time, its half your team in every Game that acts like they didnt play the game before.
And dont get me wrong. This game needs new players to not die. And I am more than willing to give noobs a pass on noob Mistakes. Everyone gotta start somewhere. But how are they gonna learn if this game doesnt even teach you the fundamentals? 
So please, if anyone of you Guys at Eugen see this, please spice up the game with new Maps and please let the people do a 10v10 or in general a MP Bootcamp of some sort explaining the Dynamic of a MP game.",1577455303,1644661101,True,22,3,0.706802427768707275,0,True,False,False

Dusted it off 2 mths ago to try play with a friend as a Co-Op game & have never looked back. Once you invest some time to learn the basics (which I initially didnt do) you uncover an amazing depth that few RTS games have, & I have been addicted every since - clocking up > 150 hrs in short order. 
The beauty is the scenery & scalability - you can zoom into the small tactical encounters & out to the whole battle at Divisional level.

For a long time I have been looking for a game that provides a realistic or semi-realistic experience into combat on the Eastern Front. Steel Division II does provide some elements of that. The unit models (with the exception of the infantry) have been meticulously recreated. Someone poured a ton of passion and energy into creating the ""lore"" pictures, unit histories, and otherwise all-around awareness of events and battles of the Second World War. For these elements I give 10 out of 10 stars, and also, in a general ""basic"" sense the game is fun, and I would recommend it for those gamers. If you enjoyed Men of War / Assault Squad 2, probably you will enjoy this game.

The specific issues which I have are related to the gameplay. There is a timer, there are ""phases"" to your combat with a certain amount of points. There are ""zones"" of control, like flags you have to control. These to me are not realistic, especially a combat timer. In this game there is sort of a Zerg rush which is fast-paced and not necessarily realistic to what a battalion commander would have to deal with. Very rarely was a commander in WW2 responsible for this level of real-time engagement; regardless of which side he was on the commander would typically have to relegate those engagements to sub-commanders, lieutenants and captains and such would carry out the orders. In real life combat situations both sides may take hours, indeed, even days to position and reposition their forces before committing to an attack, and even then, a set ""zone"" of control wasn't always the objective. That's why I find these more ""game-y"" elements, for lack of a better term, to be quite unrealistic.

These maps should be arranged where there is no timer, no zones of control, and also the units should be able to utilize real cover and concealment. They should be able to ""dig in"" for hours and await enemy assault, allowing friendly forces / flanking units to strike from various angles on the main strategic map like in Rome Total War. Again, some of that is present here on the main strategic map, but I can't help but feel there could have been some way for someone to read about how actual engagements happened in WW2 and to put those into playable possibility. For example, there are stories about single assault guns being able to knock out dozens of enemy tanks because they were concealed or were mistaken initially for enemy tanks. There are firsthand accounts of front soldiers withstanding hours of artillery fire, a ragged band of 120 or so men with no tank support, being assaulted by vastly superior numbers with tanks and then actually turning them back after a hard fought battle because pioneer support was able to get close to the tanks to knock them out with handmade mines. I'm not sure that could happen in this game because the developers haven't deeply read those same books that I have and haven't built this kind of battle possibilities into the gameplay.

In summary, Steel Division II is a beautiful game, well-researched, and probably will satiate those gamers who already love these types of games. And, I did find it fun.

Ill run through a quick list of pros and cons with this just for a example of how this is about equal to SD1944.

Pros-

Units are diverse and specialized, I would say a bit more so that 1944

Tanks and other armored units are depicted well both in accuracy and implimentation

Maps are diverse, though somewhat lacking larger more open maps

The unit transport, phase, and experience altering is genuinely amazing being incredibly useful for more speciailized strategy

Cons-

Some infantry weapons are pointless due to hopelessly short range such as most SMGs and the STG44

The STG44 is utterly pointless if you ask me, it hurts the feeling of more experienced units thanks to it leaving panzer grenadiers and anyone with self loading rifles just better off

The panic system can sometimes feel unbalanced 

Map diversity is a issue, the maps feel the same despite being different with different features and sizes. It never feels like you get the most out of a guns range with a flat open plane for them to use

Now for closing remarks, I would say that this is one of the better WW2 strategy games out there with a somewhat unique perspective. Most are up close and personal with the others being grand strategy, but this falls in the middle of the two giving it a very unique and refreshing feel.

In terms of a WW2 strategy game I would give it a 9/10, but comparing it to all strategy games and not just ones in its genre I would give it maybe a 7/10.",1566467146,1643953004,True,0,0,0.479622751474380493,0,True,False,False

I really liked that game and i wish it was developed a bit more, i wish it had some more content in it. Whats in that game is already great but compared to whats in here ? I feel like Steel Division 2 has a lot more content in it. And obviously its a lot more fun.

+Tons of cool and weird units from a lot of different nations.
+Even the smallest map feels huge.
+If you've played Steel Division Normandy 1944 or Wargame Red Dragon then you already know what the game is like.
+The deck building system, just like always, is incredibly fun.
+The game looks, sounds and plays well. I don't think i mentioned this in my Wargame Red Dragon or Normandy 1944 reviews but i really like the voice acting.
+The frontlines system from Normandy 1944 is still here and i love it. Seeing the frontlines on the mini map is really hard tho the colors blend into each other.
+You can choose what vehicles your units will be transported in. This is incredibly cool. So for example in Wargame Red Dragon you'd have 11 different units of Rifleman right ? These Rifleman were not different from each other. The reason there was 11 of them that you could choose from was because each unit would travel in a different vehicle. Its not like that anymore you have 1 unit of rifleman and you decide what they get to travel in. This is really cool and sometimes it can be really funny. You can make your own artillery pieces travel in transport vehicles that can carry ammo for them. Or you can tow a Russian AA gun behind a Russian AA truck. You basically get 2 AA units for the price of one !
+Comparing transport vehicles is actually possible now ! You don't have to memorise their stats ! You can COMPARE THEM ! Finally !
+The Army General game mode and the historical skirmishes are really fun. And hard. Or maybe i just suck at the game.

+/- Wargame Red Dragon had fuel and ammo as supplies. Normandy 1944 made it a bit simplier you only had to take care of ammo. Its the same situation here your tanks have infinite fuel but they need ammo.
+/- Some transport vehicles the ones that have guns will stay on the battlefield after your infantry in it gets out. While some other transport vehicles the ones without guns will dissapear from the world after your infantry gets out. This can create problems for example if you are transporting an artillery piece with a truck that does not have guns then as soon as you set up the artillery the truck will dissapear which means your artillery is gonna have to walk now if it wants to go anywhere. The only way to prevent this from happening is like i said either use transport vehicles that have guns or use transport vehicles that carry ammo.

-Seeing the frontlines on the minimap is hard. The colors blend into each other. Thats just a general problem with the minimap i can't see anything on it. The minimap sucks.

Honestly this game is incredibly fun. I already love Wargame Red Dragon and Steel Division Normandy 1944. Steel Division 2 just feels like the last evolution of these games with a lot of improvements and more content. I wish Steel Division Normandy 1944 was still getting some attention from the Devs but looks like they'll only be focusing on Steel Division 2 instead. There is already some Western nations like USA, Britain, Canada etc. in the game and with the upcoming DLC ""Tribute to the Liberation of Italy"" it looks like they want to merge both the Western Front and the Eastern Front into one game. Personally i'm cool with that i like the idea and even if they don't do it Steel Division 2 by itself with its Eastern Front is tons of fun anyways. They can either make Steel Division 2 focusing on Eastern Front and Normandy 1944 focusing on Western Front or they can combine both the Western Front and the Eastern Front into one game whatever they decide to do i still recommend both Steel Division 2, Normandy 1944 and even Wargame Red Dragon if you want something a bit more modern. Tho i must say the most comfortable one to play is definitely Steel Division 2. Like i said its like the last evolution in the series has all the best quality of life improvements.",1643187309,1643187309,True,14,0,0.643720626831054688,0,True,False,False

No, over 62 hours at the time of me changing my review.

I """"""Only"""""" Recommend this game if you are a die hard RTS/RTT fan and are into the various mods that can enhance the vanilla experience.  Otherwise I would say stick with Steel Division Normandy 44 for now.  There is such a downgrade in terms of how this game feels overall, SD2 = Super Spam Fest of Units, whereas SD 44 just had/has a better feel overall of balance and game design approach.  

You can clearly tell the Devs made some things easier because of the cry babies that could not handle certain aspects of SD 44- just like Act of Aggression Original Version being better & having more depth than the Reboot Version.     

I have a blast playing SD 44.
To back up my view on SD 2 game play- https://www.reddit.com/r/Steel_Division/comments/b86u66/steel_division_2_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly/  

Now SD 2 looks better & is much smoother with a lot of cool upgraded features that streamline the macro game play, but it plays completely different; just no fun at all for me. 

It's as if the developers spent countless hours in SD 44 testing the balance of units to make the game fun, but then started to listen to the part of the community crying how how hard it is to counter certain units & just made everything a one shot one kill unit (cheaper units plays a part in this.)  The Devs did this with Act of Aggression too (went from 3 Resources to 1 Resource on top of Less Upgrades- aka watered it down.)  I can see some ""slight"" tweaking & ""slight"" balance adjustment with units in SD 44, there were some legit complaints, but not to drastically create the ""One Shot One Kill Unit Spam Fest Game Play"" that SD 2 has.


My main issues with SD 2 are the following:

For the Love of Common Sense- Allow us to Turn Off the Notification Sounds- THUNNNK, THUNNNK, THUNNNK............... honestly Eugen, who there thinks this does not get annoying?

1) Camera
I know lets be the first studio that designs an RTS camera that drives people up the wall and flat out makes it harder to see what is actually going on.  SD 44 camera was fine.

2) SD 2 is essentially an RTS Unit Spamfest Simulator
Overall Gameplay & Balance was changed so drastically. You have Cheaper Units that die way too quickly which ties into the whole spammy feel of the game.

In SD 44 not everything was an automatic kill and it was ""Awesome."" It's as if the developers listened to the part of the fan base crying over certain units not being useful & then just nerfed everything to a one shot one kill type of unit which produces the spammy game play environment you have in SD 2.

3) Less Uniqueness in the Army Decks (a lot of the divisions all play the same)
There are a ton of units, but in SD 44 it was designed in such a way that each division felt more balanced based on both it's WW2 History & it's background.  You could not get every unit in Phase A regardless of the count.  In SD 44 we have Allies- 14 and Axis- 14. Yet each division still feels so much more unique in the way it plays even vs. all the SD 2 options of income & phase flexibility.

4)  Range
Going from 1000 to 2000 is ridiculous.  The maps are the same size, yet the range is so long with these units. This increase in range combined with the lower cost units & ""1 shot 1 kill"" balance and you got this spam fest of a mess.  It's a horrible experience coming from SD 44 where each engagement was a blast with small scale & large scale focus.  

5) Game Mode and Map Options
Some limitations that were not in SD 44; you can't even play all the maps for skirmish or for every mode unless it is modded in.

6) Interface Design & Unit Box Information
All this information was much more streamlined in SD44. In SD 2 all this same information is very convoluted & messy (like a new windows operating system that moves features around & makes it harder to accomplish something.) Even when you make a new deck it's almost a chore because of the design & flow of unit information. e.g.- in game when you click on the Deployment Key in the upper left, in SD 44 it went from Left to Right (Recon to Air) then you went from Left to Right in the phase selection of each unit. In SD 2 the menu drops down top to bottom & then you have to go back up left to right. Again it's like a new windows operating system that makes it harder to do the same thing in previous systems.

Note:  I have a lot more time into SD 2 then is recorded; for some reason the SD game series only records certain aspects of the game vs. other aspects.  I have over 150 hours in SD 44, but it does now show up either.

SD 2 still has the same cool layers of strategy from SD 44 and thus if the right mod comes along that improves the vanilla experience then have at it for sure.  I am waiting on that right mod and I personally will still continue to support Eugene Systems since I think they are a very good RTS Development Team & have some cool new projects on the horizon.  

Now of course I wish one of those new projects would be the one in my dreams--- an RTS game would use the ""SD 2 Engine"" with ""SD 44 gameplay"" set in the ""WH 40K Universe"" played on Excellent Maps to match the different 40K settings, with map/mod tools post game launch. :steamthumbsup:",1614359620,1642329575,False,0,0,0.506410300731658936,0,True,False,False

I am yet to see how an infantry unit with no AT can take out a tiger in the real world that would not happen. Happens in Steel Division 2 though.

There seem to be some very odd algorithms being used to calculate the battle damage and the route finding from the AI commanders is just odd. Why a panzer would ignore an IL2 heavy tank in favour of infantry that is of no threat does not make any sense especially when both are in plain view and the infantry are too far away to be able to use any AT capability. And since when does a 45mm AT gun take out a Tiger tank? A 45mm AT gun has never been credited with a Tiger kill EVER. A 45mm AP round, at best could only penetrate up to 60mm at very close distance. The side armour of a Tiger is 80mm thick.

Some of the aircraft will not press home the attack in the last minute of the tactical game and just wander around the battlefield even after being given instruction to attack the same ""VEry Easy"" target numerous times. AI commanders sitting on huge resources and not committing them to battle when the enemy is weak.

The cursor pointer is far too small on high res settings and completely blends in with the background on the strategic map in the ""Generals"" gameplay. It is almost impossible to see.

Another thing is the AI, I went in expecting to have a multiplayer experience but the game is almost as dead as SD44, so I went to play against the AI, and it's just as stupid, they make it pretty obvious that they know where your things are despite fog of war being one of the focus of the game, for example once my recce was in a bush and it was never spotted, however 5 enemy tanks just stood there at the edge of the forest for no reason, it was not a strategic spot for them mind you, and I know coding AI is hard.

Update: tried with a friend to see if the campaign get's better, we ended up rage quiting after we were enjoying a battle then the ai started artying our spawn when our units had just spawned, after that the battle ended, which was disapointing to say the least.

Maps that I played have a lot of open terrain so good luck playing something without much tanks, and sadly the lack of variety, I would prefer maps from other locations as it would make sense to see other nations fighting there, this is a fault of the engine most likely, but maybe design as too much resources is focused on making terrain pretty could have been allocated to making other fronts, also the game is too heavy in my opinion, one way this could be solved is having a more lightweight version with less detail, that being said the models are georgeous.",1615541365,1641416404,False,2,0,0.519730508327484131,0,True,False,False

The Bad: I love WWII RTS, strategy, and 4X games, however, I cannot recommend Steel Division II.  SDII feels clunky and unfinished when ordering units around and wrestling with the UI.  I'd be willing to look past that if the game wasn't so micro heavy.  This is largely due to the fact that units come in fireteams for infantry and single vehicles for everything else.  It's hard to feel like a Company Commander (as the game advertises) when you're doing the job of two dozen squad leaders, individually managing each and every tank and fireteam.

The Good:  The campaign map is a step in the right direction even if it is a little reductive and unrealistic.  I hear good things about multiplayer, but I'm not a multiplayer person.  Unit models look good and I like the division builder mechanic.  Also, the battles happening in phases as each side commits more resources to the battles is a good mechanic.",1641392163,1641392163,False,1,0,0.50107872486114502,0,True,False,False

If captured there would no longer be a location to deploy out of (understanding that each map would have a different quantity or supply/ assembly areas) and thus be limited in there ability to repel and press an attack.  the main problem of lighting off arty, even in WW2, is that the enemy will know where they are almost the min the first splash happens this is where you got it right that you would have counter battery.  but identifying troops in a wooded area 2000 meters away would be impossible without modern day things like IR or night vision (even night vision would be extremely difficult).  Today we still use scouts and force recon to find enemy movement but it is rare that they call in fire mission for such a thing and we also have hundreds of them out there, secondly when it comes to scouts (meaning the scout planes) we used scout planes to look at BDA, battle damage assessments, determining how many tanks were destroyed how many bridges were destroyed how many are still intact and of good working order for tanks to cross.  Other small mistakes were the states of things (with respect you can make them what you want or need to make them for the code and meta to work correctly but this is in regard to the logic of it) you cant have a 75mm main gun on a panther do more damage than an 88mm main gun on a tiger there is just no logic in that.  Also if you are going to go with things like armour thickness then you need to account for sloping armour like we did in WW2 and still do today.

Very similar to Wargame series if your familiar with them, the game is still distinguished from those by having different mechanics - to a point. If you've played any games from the Wargame series you will familarise yourself quite quickly, but expect some differences.

For multiplayer, there deck building system based around historical divisions from WW2 rather than simply pick your nation and go ham with whatever they have. I'm not sure how accurate these are to the actual divisions, but it puts a nice spin on the usual style of RTSs.

The real selling point for me is the 'Army General' mode, basically a turned based grand campaign style mode that allows you to play out some major engagements from the Eastern Front with pre-set units and fight the battles using the game's RTS system. It is a lot of fun, and slamming thousands of soviets into German lines or trying to stem a never ending horde of T-34s rolling over from the east offers a lot of fun and replayability.

It is the season of Christmas miracles so here's how I went from playing SD2 on and off for 20 hours 18 months ago to playing it 51 hours in the past two weeks!

Short Version: Get some friends to play with you

Long Version:

I've really liked Eugens's Wargame RTS series of games - played a lot of European Escalation when it came out nearly 10 years ago. Was never really good at it. Couldn't click as fast as most online guys but it was fun. Got Air land Battle - never really played it much, then Red Dragon at which I sucked even more. I'm too old and slow to really compete or enjoy these multiplayer.

Then came SD1 Normandy and my historical wargamer side said ""buy it"" (on sale) - did - I was just as bad at it as the others. Shelved.

SD2 came out 2.5 years ago and it advertised that it had an ""Army General (AG) Mode"" which allowed the RTS battles to be linked in a campaign. You now can predict what happened - I bought it on sale about 18 months ago. I watched a few videos, putzed around with AG mode and eventually realized that it is just a bunch of RTS battles (at which I am terrible)  linked in an interesting campaign. Despite LOVING the campaigns (the detail and scope are the best I've seen in an RTS game) I gave up after 19 hours, realizing that I can't really control the RTS battles  - too much micro-management.

Fast forward to the Black Friday sales this year. I have about six Steam friends (all aged 45-65) who have dabbled with Wargame Red Dragon (we all suck at it), SD2 was on sale and one had bought it. I bought it for a couple of the others as I saw that Eugen had added multiplayer co-op to the Army General mode.

This is when the Christmas miracle began.

Playing this game with a group of friends controlling the RTS battles was a revelation and mini-miracle. Each of us could focus on a smaller part of the battlefield or s specific task (artillery or air) and the previous ""micro-management overload"" was replaced with less frenetic battlefield chatter - ""his artillery is here - I need an air strike"" - ""tanks on the centre road - pound that village"" - ""my guys are getting hammered on the right - anyone got some tanks to plug the gap"".

Up to 5 people can play co-op in Army General. We've done that once but often it's been 2,3, or 4. It REALLY works. 
I've also played AG solo a couple of times and by letting the AI control at least half of the forces I can really enjoy the RTS battles. Sure the AI is maybe not as good as a human, but we're playing against AI! I should have thought of this earlier rather than trying to control everything and be overwhelmed with micro-management. 

Now that the RTS battles are enjoyable the real brilliance of Army General mode can be experienced. The campaigns in the base game are 7-10 day segments of the Soviet Summer Offensive against Army Group Centre in late June and early July 1944. DLC can be purchased that add campaigns such as Crossing the Vistula, Attacking Romania in August 1944, the final offensive in Finland, and trying to rescue Army Group North in Courland. 

You may think that these are all lop-sided ""lost cause"" (for the Axis) campaigns and, of course, strategically they are, however, the Soviets are ""on the clock"" and must make significant territorial gains to succeed. The Axis, particularly the Panzers, have plenty of counterattack ability and I have had several Soviet regiments destroyed by local German counterattacks (by the AI!).

Without the misery of micro-management looming over each RTS battle, I have been able to savour the impressive depth of research into the orders of battle in the game. The Axis fields anything from scratch forces of foot infantry to elite Tigers. The Soviets are more standardized but they have an interesting range of equipment from lend-lease Valentines and Shermans to hordes of T-34-85's. It's always fun to see how your Hungarian Cavalry battalion will fare in the next assault! They're better than you might think, but they're not elite PanzerGrenadiers!

I would recommend that any wargamer buy the base game of SD2 on sale on Steam for less than $10 US right now. Take it slow - pause the game a lot - use the AI to control part of your forces. Get into the Army General campaigns like a true wargamer and immerse yourself in the two weeks of hell that culminated in ""The Destruction of Army Group Centre""

Yes there is many things that can be annoying and it is very frustrating at times but the game is very satisfying when you for example are able to completely outflank the enemy army group and completely take the whole frontline. 

Some of the frustrating parts that can really grind my gears are how the Ai is able to see where my commanders and where my artillary is even if they havent fired. They are able to with pinpoint accuracy bomb my units. 

If that wasnt something that we all are used to by now from the previous games then it would really have been a major turn off fror me but its something i can get around. 

But to conclude id recommend this game 100% but as a warning it will take a little bit of time to learn.

3. The spotting distance is huge. 
4. If Arty is bad you have to see the airplanes. 
All this problems are since the launch and they never address this points in my humble opinion.

Here's another important thing. Tell me this, all the DLC equals 60 dollars. General deluxe edition is 70 dollars, total conflict edition is 80 dollars. Now, on sale, total is 20 dollars. Sounds like a good deal, it says ""Total conflict"" you would expect the bundle to have all the DLC + more given the high price, there isn't any mention of what DLC the pack has, now. 

I bought the total conflict edition thinking oh, i'd be getting them all. Wrong, you don't, infact, you only get 5 DLC, leaving 7 DLC that you have to buy off the store as it's not on the Total conflict edition.

BUT, the first three ""missions"" that you get are to learn how to advance by giving your unit a smart order to get temporary controlled by the AI to achieve what you want them to do (I am aware that simply pressing it is no garant for success in a real match but in the tutorial it should work), call reinforcments and in the fourth tutorial mission you have to use the newly learned to achieve victory in a 5min phase tutorial battle.
Fine.
So, I smart ordered my 2 Panzergrenadier units do seize point A on the left and once they arrived, smart ordered them to hold position.
The units than started to go back and sit in a house for a few seconds until the front advanced near them and without even seeing enemies or making contact they decided ""very smart"" to leave the houses they where holding their positions in.
Than sit in houses next to them, and so every few seconds they started leaving their newly seized homes for other hiding places a few meters back going constantly backwards and leaving the point, letting the enemy push the front and seize the point, instead of HOLDING the POSITION what I smart ordered them to do.

I also smart ordered two Panzergrenadier Groups to seize and hold point B in the middle, worked like a charm.

On the other hand I did smart order 2 PzGr Groups and an MG to seize point C on the right in the woods.
Now they started running into enemy fire without returning fire, my MG team just casualy walked through the bulletstorm and got destroyed, instead of at least trying to set up the MG and firing back.
So I decided to call in more PzGr Groups and a new MG, now 6 PzGr Groups and a MG Team are dancing back and forth on not more than a squaremeter at the border of the forest, and trying to seize the point what I smart ordered them to do.
They just didnt move forward, it looked like making a step forward, turning, make a step in the opposite direction and turning again, repeating the process for as long as you are willing to watch it.
Only manually clicking on the point seemed to work, the smart order to seize just kept them dancing around, sadly I didnt make a video but thats so bugged I had to take manual control of it.
After seizing the point without smart orders (allthough the tutorial wanted me to use my newly acquired skills) I told them to HOLD POSITION, and guess what..... they moved out of the forest, and out of their green shield aka good cover and moved into enemy fire now with now a yellow shield and just standing their getting shredded to pieces.
What kind of smart order system is this? Thats the dumbest thing my units could have done, on point A and C.
I couldnt even finish the tutorial and alt+f4-ed out of it, not even going for the campaign or the multiplayer.

When I find the nerve to try it again I may update my review, but for now I'd like to say the game got potential from what I played during the beta phases, I did even preorder it because the first game was pretty good.
But now that I tried the tutorial just to get a hand of the mechanics again after not playing for a while it was jaw dropping what I had to witness, and not in a good way.

Update 27. November 2021
This game is a mess, sadly, because the first game was good in every aspect.
The AI just sees your units, everywhere, anytime, I cant even find the recon units of my enemy. Artillery is bombing your units away, first 2 shots everybody is pinned, second 2 shots everything is dead. Pin point accuracy and no chance for counter battery because you're pinned down and killed faster than anything.
Same for Air Battles, before even unloading the bombload my bombers are falling back to get instantly hunted down by enemy fighters and taken down in a matter of seconds.
Your counter planes or escort fighters are falling back and beeing shot down so fast it is just not an enjoyable expirience.
T34 Recon Tanks, do I need to say more? T34/75 just wrecks your infantry from over 1000m distance, because it's a recon untit he sees way more than every other unit.
A tank? A T34 that sees more than  a 12 man infantry squad? From over 1000m?
Through trees and everything? Come on..... And again pin point accuracy. Your mortars, your supply trucks, your everything is dead, gone and lit up in seconds because the T34 just sits in the back enjoying its day and wrecking havoc because you cant counter him. It's to far away and nothing can touch it. 
My first review was from december 2019 and I played a whooping 75 hours since almost 2 years because this game is just not fun to play. 
Fix the pin point accuracy on every stupid piece of russian equipment, the recon distances and the anti air supression. At least as Axis player this game is just torture.
Sit back and watch your units get shot out of nowhere. You cant see, you cant hit what you actually do see, you cant counter, you cant advance, everything is pinned down instantly, infantry, planes, artillery and then immediatly killed. I know I am repeating myself but this is just not fun to play. SD 44 Normandy is way better.

Steel Division 2 is a Sequel of the outdated Steel Division 1944. After the flopped results of the first game Eugene have chosen the Eastern Front to be their next move.

The game is pretty much similar to Eugene's Combined Arms RTS such as Wargame Series and previous Steel Div. with wide arrangement of nicely researched military units and formations. This game follows the several 1944 Eastern (and later Finnish, Romanian, Baltics etc.) Front's Real Life Campaigns.

The Campaign is made up of 2 Modes. Turn-based Flexible Wargame and the Historical Skirmish Scenarios.

But the most interesting part is the Multiplayer Mode which allows you to play as different unique Divisions from different Fronts of the War against your friends or random players. You set up your deck in the same manner as previous Eugene's RTS like Red Dragon then field them in to battles.  

The main improvements from the previous games are the Line of Sight Meter and Before Battle Order Setup. You can set the pathfinding routes for your units before the match even starts.",1637808482,1637808482,True,11,0,0.607254683971405029,0,True,False,False

I only play single player so my review only reflects this part of the game.  Tactical battles are similar to SD '44 but the scale is much larger (I'd say 4-5 times), during a battle losing a single AT/tank or two will likely not cause your front to fold (unlike SD '44 when losing a few key units is fatal)  which makes persevering with a battle more pleasant. But the part of the game I really enjoyed is the Army General, there are now good video tutorials (on youtube and links in the game) available. In Army General you must fight multiple tactical battles to reenact various historical campaigns( playable for allies or axis ), and losses in each battle is persistent in the units available in the campaign, this makes the game much more re-playable than SD'44. So overall the campaign is much improved over SD'44 and I think is a better game for it.",1637804817,1637804817,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For me, the whole game exists in the Army General mode. If you're an old man like me and remember playing the SSG titles like Halls of Montezuma and MacArthur's War, then the Army General mode will seem very familiar. The main difference is that in this case, every time you launch an assault, you have to play a fully fleshed out RTS game to determine the victor. 

The campaigns (3 to start and another 4 in DLC) take several sessions to complete as each individual engagement takes anywhere from 5-30 minutes depending on the situation. More if you pause to assign orders like I do. Overall it's a lot of game and it gets deep into the history of the Eastern Front from Finland to the Ukraine and all the way out to Warsaw.

That brings me to my main complaint; There are only campaigns for the eastern front. (Although it sounds like they're working on the invasion of Italy soon.) This means that it's really only Russian and German units in the campaign. Also minor nations like Finland, Poland and Romania but no US or UK or even France. Also the AI's Tactics can get a little predictable both on the strategic map and in individual battles.

The learning curve is not just high, it's basicaly 90 degree. You will have to spend HOURS to just be able to win a basic engagement in this game. The game does not have linear campaign, you are forced to start with the command of the enitre army with multiple unit types and A LOT of units to manage. It's not like you are given just a bunch of units with limited resources in the first few engagements, like you normaly have in RTS games. It's not even a Total War experience, where your initial armies are usualy small and easily readable. You literally have to deal with everything this game has to offer from the get go. On top of that - the controls and mechanics are rather unique, so you will need to experiment a lot to figure out, what works in which exact way. There are some tutorials to help you out, which take a lot of time and are only covering the very basic gameplay side of the game - not the balance or strategy, this you will have to figure out all by yourself.

On top of that, many things will remain mystery to you, even if you will have enough patiance to sit through a campaign on medium difficulty, like i did. It's absolutely not clear, why or when do units start firing at enemy units. More then often i saw two infantry squads in the forest just sitting beside each other not attacking until i give the explicit order to do so. There are some artillery pieces, that have the option to fire at will and some that don't- don't ask me why that is. Your tank hunters will die to T 34/76. There is no indication of unit sightline or if the unit is actualy able to fire at targets or not- to find out, you will litterly have to click each of your present unit and check the range by aiming at the specific enemy unit with your mouse. 

All of this maybe might have been only half as bad, if the game at the very least had a slower pace. The rate at which resources are given is so damn high, you will literly spam units non-stop. The maps are also very wide, which means, that you will have to spread your forces a lot. Basicaly you will constantly have to control from 4 to 5 directions of attack or defence - now imagine each needs babysitting with different unit types and CONSTANT reinforcing. Then there are airplanes, which you will have to aim each manualy.

It's too hectic and too demanding from a player to be enjoyable. I also don't recomend it as Multiplayer/PvP RTS - since it doesn't realy have a lot of players to begin with.

P.S also voice acting is kind of cringy. One positive about it though, that i learned some new folksongs from the time period.",1636845451,1636846890,False,4,0,0.491612404584884644,3,True,False,False

[b]TL;DR:[/b]

A cross between Steel Division 44 and the Wargame franchise,  it takes about 20 hours of play before you get into it.

Ai artillery spam and air can be an issue until you learn to counter it i.e. by moving your own units after they've fired, etc.

[b]Detail:[/b]

A good selection of maps (27 based on real terrain, adjusted for game play), faster paced than SD44 due to the increased map size with tanks able to fire on the move and with longer gun ranges.

Like the previous games, weapon/armour stats are based off RL but adjusted for game play i.e. tanks firing on the move, infantry panzerfaust with 120m range, etc. that for the most part allow somewhat realistic strategies to be used.

The base game has plenty of content with Russian, German and Hungarian units appropriate to Operation Bagration on the Easter Front.

The extra DLC is nice to have (I play vs random AI decks) but  the base game's Divisions are adequate for MP and used for the base Army General campaign.

[b]Lessons/Training[/b]
There are 4 Tactical Tutorials and 7 Army General (Campaign) Tutorials.

They cover the basic mechanics of moving/deploying units, income/phases, capturing points, etc. so expect to still look at a few youtube videos to get the finer details.

[b]Skirmish[/b]
Is where you learn the full mechanics of the game and the maps, perhaps against V.Easy AI and using game speed adjustment to slow/stop the game while planning your attack. Once you are confident, you adjust the AI difficulty, income rate, game length, etc. to your preference. As a solo player, after completing the Historic scenarios and/or campaign, it's also where you'll comp stomp vs the AI to extend the games life.

[b]Historic scenarios (4)[/b]
Based on individual battles, the scenarios have set unit lists (orders of battle) and objectives (take/hold these points). They play similar to European Escalation's missions, so although the AI isn't scripted, you'll learn from your first attempt, how to deal with the AI or can try different strategies. The AI difficulty is adjustable, so they are suitable for most skill levels, once you've learned SD2's mechanics. However, as they are based off RL engagements, a couple are IMHO very hard even on the easiest setting.

[i]They are be ideal for co-op, as one player might get infantry/support/bombers and the other light tanks/fighters, so really need to work together to succeed.[/i]

[b]Army General Campaign SP, PvP and Co-op (in 4 parts)[/b]
The campaign is possibly one of best of the wargame series.

Strategically, it covers 4 areas/phases of Operation Bagration from the initial Russian breakthrough of the German front line to the eventual cleanup operations. These phases have different strategic maps and make up the 4 parts of the campaign.

On a Strategic map, the game is based around activation points (AP) which are used to move, attack in tactical battle or reduce another division's AP i.e. via artillery. It's turn based with 2 turns (am/pm)=1 day. Reinforcements arrive via train, so capturing a train station/depot gives you a forward deployment point for later divisions. It's no Total War but is logical.

Attacking/defending a tactical battle is auto-resolved or played out on a tactical (skirmish) map. Which divisions can join in the battle depends on their distance and/or remaining activation points i.e. have they been suppressed by artillery, etc.

- AG uses a small number of Tactical Maps, so battles can become repetitive/stale if played a lot (perhaps less of an issue when played cooperatively as there's more discussion/engagement).

[b]Multi-player[/b]
Leader boards, ranking, match making, etc. looks similar to past wargame/SD titles with the same flaws.

You can play/host Skirmish Maps or Historic Scenarios as public or private games vs other players or [i]with/against the AI[/i].


[b]Comments[/b]

If you're a historical gamer, or come from more beardy wargames, this is a disappointment. It'll likely suit you if you're more into high-pace RTS games. Probably ""Company of Heroes"" fanbase.

It starts great; the graphics look cool, you have a lot of different units, the placing/facing of them is very important, they all have their own matchups which you have to learn. The maps have choke points, and again positioning is important. Setting up the defence is quite rewarding. The reinforcement ideas and the three separate phases give the game a nice feel, as does the moving front line

And then the zerg rush starts; you end up just throwing units into gaps, you don't have time to appreciate how nice this or that model looks because you're zoomed all the way out, trying to manage air assets, and artillery, tank vs anti-tank. Twitch responses and multi-tasking go up the priorty list. This would probably be great if it was a smaller scale or slower, but its clearly aimed at time-limited and competitive multi-player.

Pretty good singleplayer. Has some flaws like immense amount of hidden mechanics and how unintuitive some of the design decisions are. This game is also really hard to get into since its so different from other RTS games.  This is the longest review I ever wrote lol.

This game is overall, fantastic and is a hidden gem. The deck building system is this game allows you to make pretty interesting choices. I have spent many hours obsessing over designing battlegroups.  I always liked the idea of RTS games but I usually get pretty bored of them. I have found the RTS game for me.

While the single player is fun, I think this game is a little pricey if you plan to never ever want to play multiplayer. Although most of my hours have been on singleplayer. The main single player mode, army general,  is a weird and kinda interesting hybrid between a grand strategy game and an RTS game. It is honestly kinda hard to describe but basically you can move divisions around on a big map and chose where and when to engage in battle. Once the battle commences, you can chose to either let the AI do the battle for you or you can fight the battle yourself. 

I like this game more than SD:44. The spotting system is much less painful and this game also has a better deck building system. The original did look a lot better though.

The in game tutorial for the actual RTS part of the game is ass. The in game tutorial for army general is alright. So i would recommend watching some tutorial videos.

People say that this game is way too fast and is just a spamfest but I disagree. This game is slower than a lot of RTS games like starcraft. The more you play the game the more manageable this game becomes. It is pretty overwhelming when you first play this game though. Units have a lot of synergy and figuring out how to use them is fun. For example, tanks are powerful but have poor spotting so you need recon. But they both suffer in close range so you also need to be careful about their placement.

The worst thing about this game is how the terrian looks. Small hills that are barely visable on map have massive effects on the outcome of the battle. It is annoying to have your tank not be able to see because you accidently placed it 0.1 on screen inches away on the wrong side of the hill.  the more I play this game, the less this bothers me though. Also there is no deselect button which is really bizarre. Some of the game mechanics arent explained very well or are outright falsely explained.",1628115665,1636030486,True,2,0,0.529411792755126953,0,True,False,False

If you are a serious strategy gamer, and prepared to put a bit of thought and time in, you really should get this game. It is a really impressive fresh approach to allowing you to fight battalion, regimental, divisional sized battles, up to commanding multiple divisions in the excellent Army General mode. For commanding company sized battles and individual men play Men of War: Assault Squad 2 (or Gates of Hell: Ostfront). For grand strategy and to be a Field Marshal play Hearts of Iron. If you want to play the levels of command in between, Steel Division 2 covers it very effectively with well thought out original game design . 

It is the closest thing to Total War WW2, with a turn based campaign map, and you can fight the engagements in RTS tactical battles with all the tanks, planes, infantry and artillery you call into the battle. If your units are further away on the campaign map it can take them more time to reach the battlefield, represented by phases of the battle A, B and C. Holding on against hordes of Soviet tanks and infantry with my Cossacks for 20 minutes until the Hungarian tanks (who were some distance away on the campaign map) arrived and saved the day was a brilliant example of the challenges organically generated by the excellent army general and RTS integration, scenarios which in other games would often be scipted missions.  And like in Total war if your units get destroyed or weakened in battle you are left with deleted forces in the campaign to fight the next battle with. So you try to avoid losing too many tanks and getting your units chewed up, as you can usually call on limited reinforcements reflecting the realistic historical circumstances represented in the scenario.

For me the best part of the game is the Army General campaigns of which there are several, they are all very well done and some are smaller in scale than others. It can take a bit of time but that is up to the personal preference of the players, if you have patience for it. You can autoresolve battles like in Total War to save time but if you don't want to risk heavy casualties I usually only autoresolve when attacking an isolated weak unit or two with overwhelming forces and air support. In addition to the campaign there are several single mission historical battles, and you can set up large or small scale skirmishes with the Ai in a custom battle any time so the game is well worth getting for singleplayer alone.

Multiplayer is also fantastic and there is an enthusiastic community. There are many divisions and factions you can play, Germans, Russians, Finns, Romanians, Hungarians etc, all with unique equipment and units. It is a eastern front based game but there are also 2 British and 2 American divisions, and French, Italian and even Polish divisions. The campaigns can be played in Co-op or Versus with multiple players. The multiplayer battles are a lot of fun. I like to play them too sometimes but I personally like the game more for the campaigns in singleplayer or multiplayer co-op with friends.  The developers listen to the community and have introduced some excellent additions and features over the years. I have all the DLC with campaigns in them, if you want to get more divisions then you can go for those DLCs too, everything is very reasonably priced in a steam sale. All in all if you want a WW2 strategy game this is one of the best released for many years and on sale it is well worth it.

If you have any rts experience and willing to spend half an hour on figuring out game mechanics with someone competent at the game, you'll go 90% winrate in ranked soloq in no time. 

Tldr: avoid. Expensive, boring, repetitive.

All that im going to say here mostly regards mp side of the game, single player is barely playable due to several core mechanic changes that were implemented because of mp and community feedback (more on that later, boy oh boy), which screw up already barely working ai in skirmish mode completely.

Im not gonna talk about dlcs a lot, you can see the list of those yourself, 90% of dlc decks are just a reshuffle of the same units, already existing in the game, with a couple of new ones. Some dlc decks are game-breaking, others - completely useless, mostly depends on how exactly units are allocated in the deck, most vanilla decks have a severe problem in deckbuilding (like no aa until minute 10, no tanks whatsoever, etc) while strong dlc decks usually retain solid all-round force for the duration of the whole game, that is playable under pretty much all the conditions.

The game balance is, supposedly, tuned for 1v1s, but since eugen lost most of its competent staff and their new formed player council called ""strike team"" mostly consists of incompetent people, not just ""bad at the game lulz"", but also completely unaware of several game mechanics and bugs, it literally takes me to make video about it in order for game-breaking bug to get fixed, so you can assume its not really good. There are few decent players (compared to other playerbase) over there, but due to community being this incredibly tiny, they are still allowed to participate in tournaments and basically tune the game for themselves in a lot of ways, nerfing the unit types they can't handle and buffing the ones they like.

Several game mechanics with an incredibly lazy gamedesign, ill give just a couple exaples to not overload this revew with tech details: remove units button in a form of offmap strike with no warnings as a counter to actually interesting command chain mechanic that forces people to blob, aa-plane damage distribution - subject of changes for almost 3 years now, never was any close to decent, right now some planes are completely immune to flak and other die like flies in a matter of seconds. 

Community is small and rather nice overall, guys really try their best to pretend they have an actual competetive game, i give them that, it leaves an ok impression for the person who is a complete stranger and maybe is attractive to someone even. There are some streamers that are half-decent at the game, altho no decent youtube content whatsoever. As a bonus you have an incredibly fun narratives that usually surround ww2 like games: perma mad USSR fanboys and wehraboos, polish nationalists and god knows what other creatures of the sea. 

Maps are one of the worst aspect of this game. This game have literally zero, even remotely, balanced maps, which in addition to some deck's complete inability to handle specific types of engagements leads to literal coinflips in ranked q if you want to have fun with some deck that is ""suboptimal"".

Deckbuilding is crippled compared to wargame, a lot of problems are unsalvageable in most decks as whole unit types sometimes being completely unavailable due to ""historic accuracy"", which eugen have literally 0 expertise in, for example giving no aa to a soviet division that was operating together with a leningrad's front aa army (quite literally a whole army of aa guns distributed to all the surrounding formations), with Madmat's reason being ""there were no aa guns there, period"". Historic accuracy in this game became a meme itself, because more often that not eugen just brushes off positive game changes using it as a reason, while having no problem with monstrous imaginary Narnia-defence-force formations in the dlc's and overall funny arcade-ish game mechanics. A lot of german and soviet divisions suffered from this.

There are also teamgames, every single one of them is a complete hour-long snorefest centered around arty, counter-arty and massive plane runs. People who cant handle 1v1's usually dwell there and have a massive beef with 1v1 ""elitists"", with both sides being incredibly funny and cringe at the same time.

The game will be decent for you if you just want to see a nice picture, with no further investigation on how different things work in the game.

Loads of weapons systems and different ways one can fight back. Makes the experience feel very realistic. Good AI. Cannot think of another RTS that is quite on this level.

With that being said, I would rank the game as intense requiring a lot of focus and while easy to learn controls very difficult to master.

I have no experience with multiplayer so I cannot speak to that aspect of the game.

Also the developer constantly makes free and paid updates to the game which are still improving it further.

In the beginning it was hard. This game is extremely rewarding but the learning curve is pretty steep. There is an immense amount  of satisfaction of executing your  strategy  right and coordinating all your troops. The gameplay is fun, challenging and  exciting at the same time.  Room for  mistakes is pretty small so you better make all your moves count. By the time the free trial was over  I had no doubt that I would buy this game. For 40$ it gives  you much more value than some of these AAA 60$ games these days.  Big shoutout to Eugen Systems for listening to their community and actually improving the game over time. 

Also do not underestimate the beauty and the graphics of this game. It is 1:1  scale after all. When you zoom in on your damaged IS-2, making its last shot onto the enemy King Tiger and you see the round bounce of the armor... The emotions that you feel can not be described.

Funny thing is that the devs prioritized new content instead of fixing the issues they and the community listed.  The way I see, the new content is utterly pointless if they have the same old issues.[/strike]

[strike] [01 May 2021] Devs do listen to some complaints =D. [/strike]

{26 Sept 2021} There is still love in this game.

[strike]Now, my personal comments, problems and other stuff about the game:[/strike]

Many things have changed, balance issues, and the way you see units and maps.

- [strike](Mild)[strike]
 {Silly} Majority of divisions are generic divisions with bland and repetitive units. If you read other comments good and bad, this is commonly agreed among all players. E.g. 2-ya Gvard. Tankovy Korpus, 29-ya Tankovy Korpus are the same div., there are so many more examples that I am unable to cite because I can't remember their generic names. {Yes this is still something you're going to see in the game, but, well, after sometime this is something that you cannot avoid. I think that is just the context in which the game is in}

- [strike] (Broken)[/strike]
 [strike] (Mild) [/strike]
 {Silly} Remember SOD from the Guards Armoured in SD44. In SD2 you have many more unit like that. Why the hell 39M Grán. 50mm, Pavesi P4 exist, 50 Krh/38, 2-in Carrier is in this game, why is it taking space in my hd. 
[It is not fair from my part to say that this issue breaks the game. These units are just utterly useless, and you're never going to use it anyway. I learned to ignore them. =/]
 {After recent balance updates, many units that were useless can now be used in a creative way.}

- [strike](Mild)[/strike]
 {Silly} Some divisions are just trash, and you will never use them. E.g. [strike]The Finns, the Polish[strike], and  I've never, ever used a single Hungarian's division in any match. 
{Recent balance update fix that in part, but yes  there still some shitty divisions. I've being using the Finns way more recently}

- [strike] (Broken) [/strike]
 [strike] The experience/elite system is utterly broken. You would rather spam two raw, inexperience units, rather than one, three start elite unit. Experience system with tanks is even worse, having no significant advantage over a raw tank working at all. [/strike]  
(Fixed in patch v.51099)
[strike] [Kind of. Raw unit take more suppress, which is good, but it could improve a little bit more =/ ][/strike]
 {It did improve more! And now with a larger officer range, you can build sparse experience buff networks with commanders}

- [strike] (Mild) [/strike]
 If anti-air was weak in SD44, to compensate, in SD2 two good anti-air in the back can negate the entire enemy air force.[/strike] (Fixed in patch v.51099)
{Well, now it fells more balance. You can air raid the enemy but it is costly.}

- (Mild) 
There are no dense maps where inf. can dominate, even in forest maps the gaps between heavy forest, and tall grass are so large that a single light tank can block an entire inf. attack. In most games, if you see a smoke corridor, that will always mean that an inf. attack is taking place 
[strike] ( tanks and armored cars don't use smoke corridors because at close range they are always one shot by any shitty anti tank unit, even IS-2 obr. 1944 and Königstiger). [/strike]
 (Fixed in patch v.51099)
[strike][despite the long range/short range combat had been fixed, the game still offers few urban/dense maps][/strike]
{Yes, there are more maps, not in Destruction mode, but... . The maps are more of the same, I don't quite know hot to approach this, but by now I think this is necessary for the style of this game, and not for the game style of each player. You still don't have large cities battles.}

- (Mild) [strike] (Severe) 
[Silly]
[strike]The maps are bland and gigantic. A few inf. units can bypass your 
main line and break your reinforcement/supply line. Oh, and the same scouting issue that SD44 had, where you need an insane number of scouts, is present here, as well as bots being all knowing gods. In SD2, all maps were design for at least 4v4, 5v5, and 10v10 matches, but the funny thing is that you hardly see this kind of match. It is extreme frustrating to start a 3v3 , 4v4 match in 1v1 map, just to one or more players to disconnect or range-quit (usually due to balance issues). Now compare that with SD44, where the most of the matches were/are 1v1 or 2v2. [/strike]  (Fixed in patch v.51099)
 [Partially fixed with the increase of line of sight of some recon units. With time, you get used to the maps, and they appear less bland. Maybe this is a personal, silly complain of my part]

- [strike] (Broken)[/strike] 
{No longer a problem}
[strike]All tanks, an anti-tanks have 2k range, which means that any tank or AT spam can easily suppress any bug tanks in game even IS-2 and big cats. The penetration mechanics is dubious, sometimes units with 40% penetration out gun a superior armor. You can win a game by spamming a bunch of shitty tanks. [/strike]
(Fixed in patch v.51099) [strike][Devs fixed like gods. They did such a great job here that changed the result of my review.][/strike]
{The tank, anti-tank nerfs were crucial, and this is one of the most important fixes made to the game}

- [strike] (Mild) [/strike]
[strike]The artillery system in SD2 is better than in SD44, but way to much. Mortars now have a huge range, which is kind of unrealistic for the scale of the map. Heavy artillery can be easily silence by a low cost spam artillery, and since  bombers can hardly reach the opposite end of the map, due to op anti-air, the match can suddenly change to a attrition war. I think that a simple range re-balance can fix this issue. [/strike] 
[strike](Fixed in update patch v.51345) [It changed, but I cannot say if it is for the better, yet. Mortar and artillery feels better, but the community/time will tell. I'm just happy that devs fixed :D][strike]
{The proper nerf to artillery. Finally, Katyusha fells different from Andryusha}

- [strike](Severe)[strike]
- [strike]Why the hell is smoke not precise. I mean, you can hit a enemy target with HE precisely, but when it comes to smoke a single bunker or AT you shitty miss it. The smoke always end up being so sparse that you stop using it. In game, you always have to use at least from three to four mortars aimed at the same spot in order to smoke something properly.[strike] 

- [strike] (Broken) Severe balance issue with a lot of units. E.g. in three matches in a row, a M1 Gun 57mm one shot a Panther G, a Jagdpanzer IV and a Panzer T-34/85, but a FlaK 41 88mm in ten shots cannot penetrate a T-34/85 obr. 1944, nor a M4A3(75)W. You easily see a spam of M5A1(Stuart) or T-34/76 with 2k range, suppress any tank that you throw at the front line. The game is neither an arcade, nor a historical simulation. I think that this issue is due that in SD44 the majority of complains were that the axis were supposedly op. [/strike]
 (Fixed in patch v.51099) [A lot of balance and price issues were fixed. =D]

- (Silly) I still think it should have more map, specially 1v1 and 2v2. Still haven't played a multiplayer 10v10, because, even with predictable bots, I find them obnoxious/attention sinks. I don't think big is better/fun. Army General mod is perfect for times when I seek a large-scale operations.

Easy go 2nd blindee, bring out all your m8, 50 cal jeeps and a bit of infantry and boom spawn point easy. Want to destroy any German/Soviet deck with ease. buy up all the infantry with 50 cal half tracks, and then send them in all at once, oh and the icing on the top. Offmap, want to use a broken ass mechanic to give you an easy win. Here is how you do it. Buy offmap, hide offmap near front. Click button bottom left of your screen, place it where there is alot of enemies. Watch the timer, when its nearly full while firing fast move 50 cal jeep. easy gg. little to no skill, just watching a time.... I have put 1091 hours into this game... Its a shame i have to put a bad review, but until, A. 50 cals stop denying air craft, or B. half tracks have just as bad optics as tanks to balance them, and until they nerf the crap out of offmap. Its gonna have to be a bad review.... 

Other than the first portion, the game is fantastic. If you like total war, play the game. Just keep in mind UNLESS you play a cheese deck like 3FSJ with there god tier/broken infantry. You can struggle, plus be ready to play the best players in 1v1 most of the time. Community is really small. 

Though alot of the good players are friendly, are willing to help new players to play the game, also dont be afraid to join the bootcamp discord and official there is good resources. There C key hotkey is a joy especially if you come from War game Red Dragon, helps you learn/see sight lines, a bit buggy though.... The fights especially in 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 are great. 1v1 tends to be a sweat fest, though if thats your thing get to it. 

The maps are limited but really pretty to look at, if you scroll in the amount of detail they did is astonishing. 


personally i am down voting this mainly to offmap and how abundant it is... nearly every deck some have over kill, and how strong 50 cal half tracks/50 cals on shermans, and 50 cals in general, at killing AT, Inf and sending planes home... Its stupid its silly, and needs to be fixed... Though the 50 cals, and offmap is what really kills the game for me. If it was not for that and they where balanced better i would of given a thumbs up, Balance matters, when you have a 15 point thing that can kill 120 point units easily. (2-3 half tracks can beat a single flak 88) then its a tad broken.",1632295900,1632295900,False,2,0,0.441072702407836914,0,True,False,False

I love this game. But the multiplayer has me super confused...there is so much (good) detail in the game and the LOS is so intricate that I cannot understand how MP battles are played so dam fast! Does everyone just have the maps memorized so they know exactly where to rush their units or is this game just played like COD where you just run  and gun and don't mind taking 3500 casualties in 30 mins?

I have just been playing solo battles and have really enjoyed the game, I'll try the campaign next and update this review. Also I'm looking for a way to slow down the game speed...the default slow option is way too slow. There are some mods that address it but they also change other things as well; ideally I think playing the game at about 70% speed would be ideal and really help the learning curve.

Edit update:
After a 100 hours or so this has become my favorite game. The learning curve is a bit steep and in my OP I mentioned  the speed...well that has solved itself with experience and now I find the pacing still a bit quick but very good. Honestly the only negative for the game is the online community. There are not a lot of players and its fairly polarizing. Many experienced players are insufferable dooshes that have no time for noobs even though the game needs new players. However, obviously that's not everyone, just don't be discouraged if you run into them. Once you find your niche or your friends, people with the same play style, the game really goes to a level others don't with teamwork and the satisfaction of unspoken communication!

What I can say is that I love the improvements overall. Breakthrough is an amazingly fun game mode. Less focus on fuel for units is a big plus. Building defenses is a great mechanic. Units feel a lot more balanced than Wargame RD in a sense that's good and not too balanced. 

My biggest gripe is that there's less freedom in battle group creation. Everything is dependent on your available divisions. You cannot borrow units from other divisions to create an interesting battle group deck like you could in Wargame RD. 2. The DLC factions/ factions you get if you owned the prior game feel unfinished and you only get 1 division of each. For example the British can only field Chruchill tanks... when the soviets can field Matilda and Valentine tanks. The french only have Sherman tanks, when there's a German division with hotchkiss and AMX tanks. 
Wouldn't be as big of an issue if you could mix units from divisions like you could in Wargame RD, oh well.

Overall I'm going to enjoy this game vastly more than I did Wargame RD. Good game so far. 4/5",1561265401,1632140481,True,2,0,0.47609284520149231,0,True,True,False

Game has excellent MP/PVP/COOP.

Game is updated regulary with dlc's, free content and maintained in general as of balance and mechanics.

Multiplayer:
You create a division by selecting template and fill it out with units restricted based on the template to use on the battlefield. During combat ""mana"" is ticking and this is used requisition troops from your deck/division.
most fights are 10v10 and objective is usually to hold victory objectives. 

Worth mentioning there is no progression as in unlocks upgrading etc, this is of course better for beginners but also dampens the experience for vets.

Campaign:
In fairness it is a good attempt for campaign but imo to much micromanagment, slow turns, depersonalized units and often one is required to play shitty formations for the meta rather then for fun.
I would have preferred a smaller campaign with one to three divisions for more immersion, and more(taller) managment within those. 

This is a great multiplayer game with a decent campaign for solo experience.

That is how germany and russia feel in the game with the amount of BLOATED dlc to introduce new divs for them with mainly the exact same units.

Russia and Germany are still fun. just saying be careful of the soviet/german DLC you buy afterword though cause it wont be THAT much different from base.

With this out of the way. SUBJECTIVELY. on both the allies and axis sides seeing as other factions are so few compared to the soviet german bloat. they will at least feel unique since they play differently from the main 2. like I enjoy the brits and new zealand more then most russian decks which feel like abit different to russia. maybe its because they feel more defensive, but on the axis I can go Finland and just rush the everloving shit out of people with trash units.

Again with the Russian and German Bloat. good defensive or less aggro needed divisions/units feel more unique to the allies. More offensive cheap spammy nonsense feels more unique to Axis. Not that you cant defend with russian units or be offensive with german. This ends me being extremely subjective in my understanding.

All in all a good game with good content even if they might..... overbloat it.......... It needs more maps. its the WW2 equal to wargame red dragon and the sequel to another game.... but map focused in russia and germany. many of the most blandest looking settings of ""open field and some woods with maybe 2 small towns"" I know of 1 map with a major sized city.... if only buildings were not made of paper and pointless with how easy they are to destroy and level a city then making it pointless to have inf in said city. Really think that needs changed cause otherwise really why bother. I do think they need to sit down and revist some maps and tweak them to make them feel more unique to each other. they really do need to add more maps for more variety though so your not replaying the same 5 maps 3 ways",1631595225,1631595225,False,11,0,0.583550930023193359,0,True,False,False

The tutorial doesn't have any dub. while its cool you can have more units on the map now the overall pace of the game is a lot faster and you can only slow the game by 0.33 or pause, so either play like its call of  duty or play it like Matrix. It seems like the dev want to go for realism, but from what ive played so far the artillary is just overpower, sniping units across the map. Units move so fast on road its hilarious.  
The biggest problem i have with the game is 'choice', there are things i dont like but others enjoy and thats totally normal, so give us more options and let us play however we want. for example, why cant i choose different premade divisions and i have to either create a battlegroup or keep switching team till i get the division i want. limited game time and resource option, i should be able to play with no time limit, tons of resources or what ever i want. Only two mode destruction and esport capture the flag, no conquest like 44, why not just add conquest in the game? is it so difficult? The maps size doesnt really matter at all, cause the only difference is the maps gets wider the bigger the size is, not the length, why not have an option to just rotate the map? 
All of the things above shouldn't be too hard to implement but here we are.
The dlc is just terrible, smart move and auto deploy are not dlc just small updates, treating your consumer like fools is not a good idea.

- excellent suppression mechanics
- deck system finally working properly (after all the problems of W:EE, W:ALB, W:RD and SD)
- realistic, but not to the point of getting tedious
- fun in multiplayer

Cons: 
- like in previous games by Eugens, multiplayer is almost dead. You can wait literally for an hour, if you want to play 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3. Only 10 vs 10 gathers relatively quickly. You wait much more than you play. A lot of pubstomper teams.
- multiplayers map for 10 vs 10 are wa WAY too tiny (except Tannenberg). Which implies narrow fronts, no maneuver and domination of heavy artillery and heavy tanks.

Still a bad game. Only, it's the only one of this kind.
Stupid developers still didn't fix a lot of bugs after all that time.

This game is really not well balanced. The AI is terrible, either too easy or too difficult. Playing online is not better. The ranked game is really not well done. You can't choose the map, you often play against player from your own side (allies vs allies or axis vs axis). And the map is too big to be really interesting, too easy to just rush which the game allow easily. Also it's very long to find a game. Custom game might more fun but it's still longer to find a game and it's usually end up being very unbalanced. Seriously I can't believe they could not manage to build a decent AI. Overall, it's 60% waiting for a game, 39% frustration and 1% of a good adrenaline rush. But seriously, that 1% is not worth it. Disappointing because the premise of the game is very good.

The game seems well put together, but it does lack a tutorial about how to put together battlegroups, but there are youtube videos out there that do a good job.  

The AI does an adequate job, but the AI does cheat at higher levels with additional units, etc.  I love the mechanic of being able to fight your own custom battlegroups controlled by the AI.  

The game plays well against other players in 1v1 scenarios.  I have not played any games with large teams.  The MP scene looks quiet, but this works very well just playing with friends.

One other big point, outside of the initial DLCs most have been focused on adding a couple of divisions at a time.  This is not a game where you need to buy all DLCs or feel like you are missing out by not buying some.  Decide why you want a DLC, for example US and UK units, and buy the appropriate DLC.

You can ignore the mixed reviews. Ivan is review-bombing the game because they are mad at the range rework patch. The changes feel great.

As mentioned above, they finally released their range rework. It generally made Axis guns/tanks have longer ranges than the Allied equivalents, along with a ton of other changes. However, there are still Allied guns with the maximum 2000m range. Overall the changes feel amazing. As I said, you can ignore the mixed review score.


This game is really good. If you enjoy the WWII setting and you're on the autism spectrum then it's just up your alley. Not everything is perfectly balanced, and some parts of the game are somewhat unpolished (all tanks have the same range of 2000 meters, they're changing this in the next big update I think) but the devs have confirmed that they are in this for the long haul, and are planning on continuously updating the game and adding new DLC. 

Battles consist of commanding air, anti-air, tanks, infantry,  and artillery units, while also maintaining logistics (units need to be resupplied with trucks when they run out of ammo) and fighting the enemy for strategic positions on a map. Positioning, cover, and line-of-sight are all very important. 

Before you go into a battle, you have to choose which division you want to use. There's a lot of divisions. Some are more focused on air superiority, or armor, or good infantry, etc.. All divisions have their own unique selection of units, with plenty of overlap for other divisions that belong to their same country, obviously. But the point is that not all German divisions have Tigers, and not all Russian divisions have IS2's, and so on. Once you pick a division, you have to design a 'deck' for that division. A 'deck' is referring to the forces of a division that you bring into the battle. Each 'deck' is made up of 'cards' which represent a unit, and the corresponding amount of that unit you can bring, and at what phase in the match. 

There's a lot more to explain here, but it's all very fun and engaging, you'll start giving a shit about the fine details of the deck building system real quick once you start finding out what works and what doesn't. 9/10",1601527661,1629294547,True,11,3,0.55672752857208252,0,True,False,False

If Gates of Hell had as many nations, units, and better air, it would probably be my favorite RTS, but since it is lacking nations for now it is Steel Division 2. Steel Division 2 focuses on Operation Bagration for campaigns/missions, which was USSRs push against Germany, but there are a lot of other countries represented. There is no base building (although there is a breakthrough mode with emplacements for defenders). It's kind of like if COH2 used commander units for all spawns, with them coming in off the side of the map, only with a larger scale focus/tactics to the battle. Wargame: Red Dragon always seemed a bit overwhelming back in the day, but Steel Division 2 has some great tutorials in the main menu to get you up to speed quickly.

Unlike most RTS games, you do not pick a nation to play as. You pick large a large division (infantry, mechanized or armored) out of a list of tons of possible ones historically based from Germany, USSR, UK, US, Hungary, Estonia, France, and several more. Honestly, I didn't even realize some of these countries participated in the war previously. You use your selected division to create a ""deck"" or ""battlegroup"" that you call in units from as the round progresses. There are 3 phases for call ins, affecting the number of units you get to call in per card and your income each minute to spend on units, Phase A is first 10 minutes, Phase B is from 10-20 minutes, and Phase C is from 20 minutes until the end of the match. 

It's a touch complicated compared to like Starcraft, COH2, or even Gates of Hell, but it is very well done. There is a ridiculous number of units available to create your armies, tons of maps (plus different size variants for some maps), great historical battles, and the army general campaigns are awesome as well. Army General is another layer to learn after the skirmish portion though. I would probably recommend starting with historical battles (pre-made battlegroups in historical skirmishes) then going to regular skirmish and messing with custom battlegroups, or try out Army General. Army General was originally built for Singleplayer but now you can also do either Coop with up to 3 players or 2 players can PvP.

I can't comment on Multiplayer Skirmish yet, it seems like it would have a pretty decent learning curve like most RTS games. I feel it could be hard to get a perfect deck (total cost, # of units, phase of unit, proper unit diversity) without prior Eugen game experience but that challenge is part of the appeal. You can easily customize a battlegroup for defense, offense, early/mid/late game etc. based on how you build the battlegroup - even with simple changes like phase/income choices and maybe swapping a couple key units.",1624307863,1629043368,True,29,1,0.730141401290893555,0,True,False,False

10 years ago, still in school times, i bought the strategy game ""R.U.S.E"". It was a World War 2 themed strategy game that allowed me to get in first contact with that era of human history. Not understanding the context of all of it i started the game that surely sparked my interest in realtime-strategy games. It was pretty casual, yet it had some unqiue depth to it that i just can't forget till this day. One of those things i will never forget is the really generic gunshot flashing your screen at the start, only to reveal the logo of ""Eugen Systems"". I barely noticed it at the beginning, but with every time i started the game i recognized it. I played over 600 hours of R.U.S.E and thus i saw that logo a hundred times, but eventually i stopped playing it. One day i found out that Eugen Systems started making a new RTS series, set in the cold war, named ""Wargame"". Naturally i joined in with my buddies who played R.U.S.E with me before. It was a blast, i assure you. 
Again, years later i found out that the ""Steel Division"" franchise was made by Eugen Systems as well, using the gameplay mechanics of the more detailed and tactical ""Wargame"" franchise, but designed in a World War 2 framework. Naturally i started joining in. This is where we arrive at the present, all i want to make clear is that Eugen Systems have experience with RTS games. They know what they do and how they want to do it. This game is the depiction of what 10-15 years of learning by doing can achieve. Let's go for the actual review.

----------------------[The ""Divisions"" of Steel Division]----------------------------
Steel Division 2 is a Real-Time strategy game that utilizes the german-russian frontlines of World War 2 as its setting. You play the game by the use of historically inspired divisions that decide which units you will have available in the round. There are plenty of choices to choose from and they all have characteristics to them that are valuable to know and exploit. You might be thinking: ""well that sounds like factions from other games"" and you are correct, partially. The unique thing is that germans are germans and russians are russians, but the divisions split the units into different branches of units. There are infantry, mechanized and armored divisions, but even in those the variety is huge. An armored divison can consist of good tanks and infantry, but lack in reconnaissance units, while the other lacks the heavier tanks, but has a good quality of air support. The divisions in this game are heavily customizable and they will make you think about which units you want to have and which aren't worth it for you. After getting some experience you will have found your playstyle and your division, which will meet your preferences. It is really entertaining to just search through the options you have at hand. It is important to note that there is no progression systems in place, you have everything (except DLC stuff - more on that at the end) available from the beginning. Once you figured all that out, you might start your first round of this game.

----------------------[Gameplay]----------------------------
A round of Steel Division always starts with the placement of your units. Depending on the Division you chose and constructed you make decisions on which positions to defend, where paths to engage the enemy are and where you need recon units to scout enemies for your guns. You will have a limited budget and thus you will have a weakness on the battlefield. You give orders to your troops and then you click that you are ready to start the game. It starts in the ""scouting"" phase. Every player/Ai has a low income rate and it is all about smart movements and getting your first grip on a defensive line, while trying to keep the enemy formations loose. Since the potent and more numerous units are not available yet, this is the perfect time to move the frontlines quickly, while lower income rates tend to leave players without enough vision to fully view the field, allowing for ambushes in densely settled areas and near forests. Units are much faster on roads, so those are natural targets to prevent enemy supplies from reaching the frontline easily. 
After ~10 minutes the game shifts to Phase B, where main battle units will be available. A few minutes in the frontlines will be fully established, while both sides exchange hits and blows. It is all about trying to counter the enemies offense while keeping track of their supplies. You can use your knowledge of enemy divisions to understand how many of their stronger units they have left to call in. It is this phase where planes and artillery become important as well. 
At ~25 minutes you will reach phase C, where even the strongest units will be available in rather high quantities. Resources tend to be skyrocketing and a large scale warzone unfolds. This phase more than any other is just an all out war to deplete enemy supplies. It is hard to keep track of everything that is going on, but luckily this game has some good quality of life features to assist with this.

--------------------[quality of life]-------------------------------
This game has some serious amount of features intended to make your orders as precise as possible. You can tell units to only fire when there is a high chance of them killing the enemy unit, there is the option to tell your artillery to specifically target enemy artillery, infantry units automatically choose the routes with most cover and so on and so on. Sometimes those features are a little to intrusive with what you want your units to do and sometimes the AI for your planes is just incompetent, but all those features improve this game massively overall. Playing against AI is actually enjoyable as well, since the AI is actually programmed pretty well. One thing to note is that the UI is functional, but really lifeless. It is mostly black and grey, with lots of information on it. Considering you spend quite a lot of time looking at it there is room for improvement.

------------------[DLC and monetization]-----------------------------
There are DLC, most of which contain new divisions to play. This is somewhat damaging to the balance of the game. New divisions are not better or worse than the basegame ones, but they have unique units that you don't really know of until it is to late. If you dont own the DLC with a division you can not see their unit roaster as well, further increasing the frustration when that armored division suddenly uses their elite-infantry against you, but over all the new division tend to be fairly balanced. Purchasing all the divsions will still be a little to expensive in my eyes, but they are fun to explore and use.

------------------[Summary]-----------------------
This game has a few minor flaws, but overall i would claim it is one of the best RTS games you can currently find. 
It is possible to enjoy it even without multiplayer, which not many RTS games can claim.
9/10.

This game will really make you feel as if you are a general trying to wage war, with great open maps that provide a lot of flexibility while allowing emergent frontlines to ebb and flow.

Just be warned, Steel Division II, as long with all Eugen games, is not point and click RTS!

  A sizable amount of material Axis forces has access to is captured Allied/Soviet tanks, small arms and artillery (British 
  Valentines, French S35s/H39s, plenty of Russian tanks along with French and Russian rifles, smgs and mgs)
  Makes the campaign very immersive!
- Front lines is a better direction vs zones of control in Wargame
- Army General is just plain awesome. I feel the desperation in Axis campaigns with how poorly armed their units are in comparision to the red tide of Soviet motorized and tank divisions. Nothing like having only 5 tiger tanks and a few platoons of mixed infantry to hold the line in the face of hordes of Soviet Shermans, T-34s and infantry
- All units are quite usable in majority of situations, nothing feels completely useless like a bunch of units did in Wargame
- Small features such as ""fall back"" and ""reverse"" are very nice to have in order to break contact

Cons:
- Inability to rotate armored vehicles is EXTREMELY frustrating. At key moments, tanks will turn themselves to face one threat while engaging another. leaving them completely exposed to enemy AT. Simply implementing a hold position order in which tanks could only rotate their turret would solve this (Men of War has had this feature for over a decade?)!!!
- Infantry take an unusually long time to exit a building when ordered to move
- Vehicles, especially tanks, have too much vision. Realistically armored vehicles had poor vision unless unbuttoned or had infantry support nearby
- Modding seems a bit of a head ache given you cannot run more than 1 mod at a time....

Overall, very enjoyable game with a lot of replay value! Red Storm 44' fixes a lot of the issues I have with the game, Eugen should take note!",1627363975,1627377885,True,3,1,0.536302626132965088,0,True,False,False

Graphics (4 of 10):  At its core the graphics are good, but not great.  It falls apart because at the strategic unit level where things are icon based many things are either absent or microscopically sized (for example recon units are not distinguished, and tank damage is not shown).  I play this on a 40"" display and I struggle to see some of the tiny text, not because the icons are tiny, but because the text is kept very small.

Audio (3 of 10):  Okay, but depressing sound track.  Combat sounds are simplistic, but good quality.

Gameplay and Interface (5 of 10):  Multiplayer campaign and skirmishes.  Easy to join games.

2 year strategy.  Already getting a new game [b]because ""new set of terrain"" ""would mean another game.""[/b]  Do you know how pathetic an excuse like that is?

Personally, I've always been okay with buying expansions for more content.  I have a lot of games, and a lot of those games have DLC.  Among those DLC?  Things like new terrain.  It's so simple, even modders do it regularly for things like the Men of War series.

That's why I was fine with the fact that [b]Steel Division 2[/b] had rolled out $100 worth of DLC on the Steam Store.  I figured they would be dedicated to expanding on this one, for once, instead of abandoning it after only two years on the market [b](as they have done with every single other game they have released)[/b].  I figured self-publishing would mean they give a damn about their customers, who have given them second chance after second chance.  I was wrong.

In fact, I should've stayed the course after seeing the disappointment that was their abandonment of the original Steel Divsion:

[code]Proof: 

Wargame: European Escalation (Feb 22 2012): NOTHING NEW since February 2013. ABANDONED.

Wargame: Air Land Battle (May 22 2013): NOTHING NEW since patches in July 2014. ABANDONED.

Wargame: Red Dragon (Apr 17 2014): NOTHING NEW since October 2016. ABANDONED.

Act of Aggression (Sep 2 2015): NOTHING NEW since May 2016. ABANDONED.

Steel Division Normandy 44 (May 23 2017): Steel Division 2 announced July 25, 2018...  ABANDONED.

[b]Follow the trend, see the result.[/b]

Steel Division 2 (Jun 20, 2019): TBD?  Bet on Steel Division 3 announced within the next 2 months.[/code]

Remember, Italy is [i]the best for last![/i]  Have fun purchasing this DLC a second time in the near future.


Did you expect them to make Steel Division 2 a great game that looks at more than just one front?  Did you buy all of that DLC thinking that it would be worthwhile?  That won't be the case because this community is going to die when the new game drops, just like Steel Division 44's died.  All because apparently, they can't make a DLC featuring terrain as an expansion pack.  So they have to create a new game because of that...

[quote=EUG MadMat;3055112065885347446][quote=sstanley1974;3055112065885331789]are you planning to expand the Army General Campaigns beyond the Ostfront at all? [/quote]
As already stated: no. 
It would require an entire new set of terrain, hence would mean another game. [/quote]

This makes Eugen Systems one of the few companies that can't incorporate new terrain in an expansion pack.  Are you really surprised that [b]terrain[/b] is the excuse for an otherwise blatant gimmick marketing strategy?

So few people play the original Steel Division, that it is a testament to long-term development and support.  They dropped it, in favor of the next game.  Just as this happened with Airland battle and European Escalation, so too have they decided to do with Steel Division series.

""Profit"" and making you re-purchase a full price new game every 2 years is the motivation here.  Not 'texture sets.'  That's a blatant lie, as is everything else that disguises [b]a blatant business practice of rehashing a product as ""new"" every other year.[/b]  I'm guessing when they decide to implement a Navy, you'll have to buy Steel Division 4 in 2023 ;)

To say that ""terrain"" creates the need for a ""new game,"" is a no.  It doesn't.  People modify the existing engines all the time.  [b]Eugen Systems has a long-term pattern of ditching a game every two years, only to release a brand new one to withdraw the community and the old one turns into a ghost town.[/b]

I actually thought Eugen Systems had moved past this blatant ripoff strategy when they decided to self-publish.  [b]Want to disagree?  Have fun repurchasing all of the decks you already own for this game when they rehash them as separate $15 DLCs for Steel Division 3.[/b]

This company just doesn't make a product good quality enough to get away with treating their customers like cattle to be milked.  Instead of ignoring it, make sure you get vocal about it.  Demand change, and demand these greed soaked rats improve this game instead of ditching it using ""new terrain"" as such a stupid excuse.

Now about that latest DLC - Burning Baltics. It is good idea to include some minor combatants on both sides but here historically they went really wrong. As an Estonian and history fan i am kind of sad that they have Doppelkopf operation here - basically the last breath of AGN before their encirclement in Kurland.

Instead the brilliant defence around Narva river and neighbouring heights early 1944 would make much more sense as a crucial battle what helped Finland to defend Karelia and forced Soviet northern flank on its tracks.

Now the Baltic forces involved in Burning Baltics are also questionable choice
1) Estonia had full division fighting for Germans -  20-th SS Pantzergrenadier division what saw action also in Ukraine before transferred around Narva. Why have Estonia represented by Soviet units what were committed after it was 100% clear that german AGN is defeated in a fear of mass desertions (in Doppelkopf of course and later in Kurland) 
2) Latvia had TWO divisions fighting in Latvia until the bitter end in Kurland - however they are not represented as a separate unit AT ALL
3) Lithuanian separate division(s) failed to materialize due to conflicting interests and bad leadership however they are in Burning Baltics in German side as a separate unit...

Has a pretty large learning curve, and not for the faint of heart. THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE POINT AND CLICK GAME. Battles are based on capturing flags for the most part and a real time ""front-line"" that ebbs and flows as your units do. If your ""front-line"" passes the flag, it's yours... and vice versa. Capture enough flags and the enemies timer will tick down, slower with less flags, faster with more flags, and not at all if you and the enemy have the same amount of flags. Once the timer hits 0 on either side, the battle is over instantly. There is a ""destruction mode"" where you win by destroying a certain amount of units, but it seems like most games if not all games are capture the flag, including in the campaign (called Army General).

Fights are based on a unique ""vision"" system that is way beyond simple fog of war mechanics like in COH. There is a range for units, but really it's based more on if your troops can ""see"" the enemy in it's field of fire. 

To deploy units you have to use a currency system sort of like COH, but based on a simple counter that is refreshed every so often, and each unit you deploy costs a certain amount that will be deducted from the counter. There is no unit cap.

There's a shit ton of micro, and if you want to be decent at the game, you're going to have to learn keybindings to quickly instruct your units in the heat of battle. In skirmish/historical battles/campaign you can assign the AI to use some of your army and it's actually quite helpful USUALLY. It is AI after all so it can't read your mind on what you want it do, but it's actually a decent AI so it will deploy units to weak areas and exploit strong areas, and be generally useful.

Unit types are EXTREMELY diverse and is probably the coolest part about the game in my opinion, there's hundreds of different units all with different armaments, backgrounds, purposes, etc. Very fleshed out, and makes the game super interesting even without DLC's.

The game can be extremely frustrating when you're losing, and extremely rewarding when you're winning. which is why you'll need to have a good handle on game mechanics before you're really able to enjoy all that this game has to offer. Some of the reviews talk about the AI being difficult, and yes, the AI can be extremely overwhelming sometimes even on Medium difficulty. To beat them you're going to have to use pretty much all your army has to offer continuously throughout the fight (artillery, anti-tank, infantry, tanks and air) which can be a little frustrating at times when you're trying to manage all angles of an entire battlefield. Slack and the enemy will break you down.

Pros
- Maps are diverse in nature and terrain and large in scale (or smaller if you prefer that). Lots of replay-ability.
- Hundreds of different historical units
- AI is good (usually very helpful on your team)
- Battles are super cool and add a lot of cinematic value to the game!
- EXTREMELY STRATEGIC, every decision you make counts (if you're into that)
- Don't need DLC's to have a good time

Cons
- Vanilla campaign is fleshed out but there's only 4 missions in total.
- Campaign can be confusing (Action points, auto resolve can be kind of broken imo)
- AI is good (will steamroll you the first few games you play)
- Not a ridiculous amount of maps. You will play on the same ones again after a while. (replay-ability though)
- Large learning curve (esp if you've never played a strat game such as this one like me before)
- MP community can be toxic at times and very ""meta"", you're going to get shit on your first few games.
- Battles can be VERY unforgiving if you fall behind.

6.5/10 is what i'd give it. Buy it discounted and it won't break the bank if you end up not liking it. Be sure to watch gameplay videos and not just reviews to get a real feel for the game.

Steel Division, for me, feels like an evolution on the Wargame Franchise that is overall leaps and bound ahead in many ways. While it can be overwhelming to get into with not great tutorials and so many units to understand, there are little things like the armor/pen power tooltips for tanks you can enable which are really handy. This is a great game for people who're willing to sit down and compare stats/equipment for your troops and choose which will work best for how you play. If you don't like doing that, you can always import someone else's deck, or look at a guide. Personally I felt like this hindered more than helped me because I didn't know what units were in my deck, or what their strengths and weaknesses were.

But if your anything like me most Multiplayer games you get hte first like 200 hours are spent VS AI. The game is ok, The DLC REALLY takes away from the game. I know the classic blah blah im poor argument here. But in all reality im O K Paying for the DLC. It's a system that EA started and it won't go away since us gamers never make a Rukus but my point is the DLC are actually to filled with stuff and the stuff is all mediocre. Like the US/Brits DLC Are just them taking those factions from Normandy 44 and porting them exactly carbon copy for cash. The Dev's aren't releasing good DLC go look at the reviews lol. None of them are very good at all. The game Concept need's a Revamp as well seeing as the Battlegroups sometimes if picked wrongly to VS Another Battlegroup is steam role for one player and a down hill battle for the other (for instance Pick a armor heavy Battlegroup your enemy not being super into the game or that faction picks a Infantry heavy no Armor division with mediocre AT and Air, There screwed. Literally 40 minutes of getting your ass kicked.

You can't deploy most of your units because they are locked behind phases and point barriers. 1v1's suck (if you can find another player your skill level, gl with that). The size of the map makes it so that all you do is run around capturing victory points. Unit costs are kind of silly. The most expensive AT gun costs 70, a Sherman costs 80, and a Tiger costs 120.

Battle, once joined, makes sense. You will become good quite quickly at determining how best to deploy your forces if you take the time to really zoom in and take note of how they are engaging. A word of warning- your forces complement each other and are weaker on their own. Send tanks ahead without scouts or infantry support and they wont last long, at all.

First off, in the beginning you have to be patient and watch tutorials and practice to even get up to a casual level. The tutorials in game covers partly what you need to know if you want to beat medium AI or slightly contribute in a multiplayer match. At the beginning I had the same feeling as I was studying for an exam, not fun, but since I had the time I mustered on. 

The graphics in this game is not good, zoom in and it looks like a game from the 90s, so steer away if you like games with good graphics.

Single player skirmish or Historical Battle in this game is boring after a couple of matches, the AI is very bad after you understand how they work. The Army General campaigns in this game is turn based, I’m a huge Total War campaign fan, but this Army General Campaign is over the top boring, the graphics here is also very poor.

Multiplayer can be fun if you’re playing with friends that are into these sorts of strategy games and have the patience for it.

In conclusion, might recommend this game to someone who REEALY have the time to put some long hours in this game and likes to study each WW2 unit. If you’re into single player this game isn’t for you, for me single player was almost boring from start to finish, there was some matches that was fun, but everything became very dull quickly after I started to understand the AI.

I really enjoy what they did with the ""phases"". You don't have to wait until Phase C anymore to get your best armored vehicles and tanks. There are so many different units and options to equip your fighting force. Tank battles are just freaking awesome. They've really done a swell job making armored combat as realistic as any game I can remember. 


My biggest complaints? The AI can be pretty stupid. I play Army General almost exclusively. Every battle the AI pretty much just zerg rushes up the roads. I'm nearly always able to blow up several units still in their trucks as they arrive. Also, artillery needs to be changed. Spamming artillery, at least in the base game, is way OP and makes the game ANNOYING. Artillery is WAY too accurate and is totally unrealistic in the game. Artillery was not used this way in reality.

Also, there is not enough maps. I really get sick of playing the same exact map over and over and over again in Army General. You wind up learning the perfect positions for defensive fortifications, so you basically become invincible to the AI if you put your fortifications in the right spots. You're not going to get diverse battles playing the same map. It's literally the same fight over and over again, just with different units/divisions.

Please note that I have not yet played the expansions, but judging from the reviews it seems they add some really good content. I'm probably going to check out Death on the Vistula. The new Army General campaigns look massive.

Overall the game is not perfect but if you like WW2 RTS you're still going to get many hours of enjoyment. Get it on sale if you can although it's kinda early in the game's release for that.

EDIT:

Coming back here to change my review to a thumbs down. Sorry if you're confused. The repetition in this game is just truly awful and really takes all the enjoyment out of the game. On Army General, I literally play the same exact two or three maps over and over and over and OVER. Start the battle, set up fortifications (same spot every time because the maps don't change), watch enemy AI suicide rush his units right into my defenses. Rinse, repeat. Nothing historical about it. Nothing strategic and nothing fun.

Eugen's ""DLC"" they've released is pathetic too. I still haven't seen a new map. All they do is release stupid ass historical divisions that I don't use anyway because I make custom divisions. I was so excited for this game before it came out. Turns out, it sucks. Don't waste your money unless it's 50% off or more.",1584330229,1625100654,False,0,0,0.599405348300933838,0,True,False,False

The German military, up to this point, had a great deal of experience in taking cities, but Stalingrad was different.  The Germans would reduce a city to rubble, making the city indefensible.  But Stalingrad was build with modern materials, the buildings able to remain standing, albeit gutted.  Each block became a fortress, and a haven for snipers.

Cities were a major factor in the conflict in Europe.

You didnt include urban maps.  On release.  In a game set in the Eastern Front.  Where the goal of your first strategic mission was to take the city of Orsha.  The CITY.  That you dont have a map for.  That you STILL, two years after release, do not have a map for.

No.  No.  This is on me.  I should have known better.  After Red Dragon, I should have expected this.  I was enjoying myself,  I was engaged.  I thought, Eugen has learned from the numerous mistakes it made in Red Dragon.  This is good.  I was enjoying that campaign.  I was getting the hang of it.  I'd managed to get revenge on the Luftwaffe, I'd flanked and obliterated the German northern position.  I'd mustered a dozen brigades outside of Orsha.  The fight for that city would be epic.

Nope.  You want me to autoresolve.  You didnt include urban maps, so you take the lazy way out and force the player to autoresolve.  You had two years to get A urban map.  Any would do.  But rather than an engaging battle over an urban landscape, I push a button.   Because pushing a button is FUN!  That's why I bought this game!  To push a button!  Yes!  I will move my little pieces to this other little pieces and I will push a button!  I am World War Two general now!  BOOM!

It has everything from the tension of Fog of War and not knowing where your enemy is hiding or where he/she is going to push your line to the thrill of sending a line of T-34s with infantry support charging into a village to root out the last pockets of enemy resistance to the careful resource management required to succeed. It doesn't end there either: Close Air Support, self-propelled light and heavy artillery, enough Infantry units to put any army to shame,  HUNDREDS (940 last I checked) and I mean HUNDREDS of individually modelled and simulated units whose stats simply boggle the mind in terms of layers of complexity and realism added to the simulation.

The AI poses a decent enough challenge to keep you busy, the Campaigns promise hours on end of gameplay time, the MP community is highly active should you ever get bored of single player.

[b] WARNING: Very long. Check header to look for specific topics. [/b]

Steel Division 2 (and indeed Normandy 44) are what is essentially spin-offs from Eugen's Wargame franchise, which in my opinion is one of the best RTS franchise ever created. While the overall gameplay remain the same, I must say even though Wargame: Red Dragon is by now 7 years old, it in many ways is still a superior game than Steel Division 2.

[b] The good: Battlegroups / Divisions [/b]

What's new in SD franchise is the inclusion of various ""Divisions"", which are historical divisions that fought in that particular theare/battles. In SD2, the focus is on the eastern front (Although there are a couple of Western Divisions available through DLC) - which means you will see many very famous divisions that fought in the Eastern Front. ""Norland"", 1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division (aka the Göring division), ""Wiking"", ""Großdeutschland"" are all names history buffs like me will instantly be drawn to when looking through the division list available to choose from. The historical aspect of this game should be commended, and well done to Eugen for putting effort into each division.

To most people who played Wargame before, the overall gameplay itself will feel right at home. You build what is known as ""Battlegroups"" (Or the so-called Decks), which consist of various units from that particular nation/division. You work within the cost limit (of 50) and try to form your own unique division in the pools of available unit. A Tank Corp will have more Tank slots and the cost of them will be lower, but at the cost of less slots for Infantry and at a higher cost; Vice versa for other types of divisions. Each Divisions has its unique limitations as well as units - some have elite but limited amount of Tiger II and even Sturmtigers, IS-2 as well as ISU-152, while some have average but numerous warhouses like the Panzer IV or T-34s; Each division has their own little quirks/niche to it. Building decks is a game in itself, and and I really like how it has evovled from the Wargame franchise; its one thing I really hope Wargame 4 (Eugen pls) can learn from.

[h1] The Bad and Ugly: Phases / Frontline / Flag system / Battle time [/h1]

[b] Phases [/b]

The overall gameplay itself is somewhat similar to that of the Wargame franchise; unfortunately, I (and evidently from the smaller playerbase of SD franchise) am not a fan of most if not all of the changes they introduced in SD franchise.

The concept itself is good: A game will be divided into Phase A, B and C. When building decks, you can choose between frontloading all your units into phase A in hopes of crushing your enemy before they have their main forces available, or alternatively try to withstand the earlier phases and pour out all the big guns in later phase, overwhelming your enemy with the quantity of your force.

Unforunately, while to an extent it encourages methodical gameplay, it is not like one can be totally reckless and spam heavy tank without it in the first place. You'd never see people spamming Leopard 2A5 or T-80/72 (late models) in Wargame because they are suppose to exotic units; why can't this be the same in SD2?

Some also argues that it would make certain units (like Light tanks) weak. For one, they [i] are [/i] supposed to be weaker; Secondly, no one is forcing you to pitch a T-70 against a Panther. Even if someone decided to field a few units of Tiger II at the start, they are not invincible either and they are putting themselves at a significant disadvantage in other areas by doing so (Air support, Infrantry, Support units, Artillery). Combining weaker units against a elite unit is nothing new and I don't see why there is a need to force a phase system into the franchise.

I'd argue with the phase system, you force people to play a certain division a certain way, rather than having the freedom to deploy specific units at specific phases. I found that totally in conflict with the intention of encouraging variety of the deck building system. I personally prefer if there is a no-phase mode where you can play just like the original Wargame series.

[b] Frontline [/b]

Frontline is one of the worst addition into the franchise, in my opinion. What it essnetially did was massively tone down the need for situation awareness, as the game basically ""tells"" you where a push is coming from even if you have absolutely no eyes on their units. 

Whats worse is that it prevents effective flanking maneuver. All non-scout units suffers a penalty when they enters enemy territory, which means larger scale flank maneuver are put at pretty significant disadvantage: For one, the enemy can see your push just from looking at the frontline, and second when you enter their territory, your units are artificially handicapped because you are 1m across that ""frontline"".

""Hey just use the scouts to flank!"" one might say. Well, many divisions' scout decks small, and usually not enough to dealt sizable disruption to the enemy; The few that has vehicles are limited in quantity. In Wargame, there are many special forces units as well as sneaky scout helicopters that can make huge plays by popping out of nowhere and destroy a command unit (of which is now missing from the game); This is not really an option in Steel Division. Ironically, despite being a WWII game, the game seems to play more like a WWI Tug-of-War style slugfest than the massive Blitzkrieg maneuvers that one might expect from WWII.

[b] Flag system / Battle time [/b]

This also leads nicely into the ""Flag"" system. As mentioned before, there is NO COMMAND UNITS in the game. You capture a flag by basically pushing your frontline over the flag, and wam-bam-thank-you-mam you have the flag. I feel that this is a massive downgrade to the zone system in Wargame - whilst by no means perfect - encourages a lot of interesting dynamics (like the fore-mentioned flanking maneuvers) in gameplay. This whole aspect feel significantly toned down from Wargame, and for the worst unforunately.

This also eliminated a lot of the drawn-out but extremely fun ""long games"" in Red Dragon, as both teams slug it out in a war of attrition, competing for whether quality will win the day or quantity will overwhelm your opponent. As CTF works a bit like the ticket system in Battlefield where you ticket slowly bleeds out as you lose sector (or vice versa), most game don't last nearly as long as they do in Wargame. This - for me as mostly a Singe player guy - is a pretty massive downgrade.

Destruction mode while is a step in the right direction, it somehow also inherits the ""auto-win"" condition (by capturing all the flags - why is it needed in a gamemode literally titled ""Destruction"" I do not understand), which still doesn't solve this problem. This needs to be a toggle option in configuration Eugen.

[h1] The not-covered: Army General [/h1]

Unfortunately, despite my best effort, I simply don't enjoy Army General at all. Nonethless I recognize that there is a dedicated crowd, and considering I have no experience in it, it would not be fair on me to comment on it. Though I commend Eugen for keeping up support for it.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Is Steel Division 2 a good game? Probably - but its nothing spectacular in the sea of WWII RTS (Company of Heroes, Call to Arms Ostront Front, Men of War, Sudden Strike etc). I would consider this game on sale if you like tactical RTS to support Eugen for hoping they make Wargame 4.

[b] Is it a good Wargame? Unforunately, I must say not really. It moves away from a lot of the things that make Wargame so great, and some areas are significantly toned down. While the overall gameplay is still Wargame-esque (which is good), there are enough changes made that one is hard to consider this a ""WWII Wargame"", and this is why I think it will always be rememberd as a Steel Division, not ""a"" Wargame.

I have since played a lot more time than compared to my last review. I really don't want to write a lengthy review(so much for that) so i'll just name some positives and negatives.

The game really needs planes to play a more crucial role than what they already do. Are you telling me 2 fighter bombers and a tank buster(armed with 12 HE rockets) can't kill a su 122 assault gun? Not to mention how unbelievably week heavy bombers are, again, are you telling me 3 HE shells from a 75mm anti air gun can make 6 heavy bombers fall back seconds before dropping there bombs? Anti air in this game is so incredibly strong in this universe, i'm surprised these major nations considered planes an option. Not to mention how annoying the AI is managing it's air force can be, I swear, I have sent out TWO planes to intercept a soviet cluster bomber. What does the AI do? They send EVERY SINGLE PLANE THE SOVIET UNION HAS IN STOCK TO STOP YOU. I swear it is unbearable. However, the feeling you get when you send out a massive air assault and the AI has nothing to send to stop you. I can't stress how good it feels to know you've won the air war.

 Now onto tanks. I don't really have anything to say except tank battles are complete jokes. Explain to me, how a panther D(130mm frontal armor) gets its frontal armor pierced by a valentine tank(100mm penetration value) at 200 meters. How do I lose a king tiger to HE shells?! Oh yeah, that's right, they implemented a patch that now determines how many HE shells it takes to kill specific vehicles. Are you kidding? Is that a joke? Is this Narnia? Whos idea was this?

Now onto the positive. planes are poweful(not as powerful as they need to be) and can be the soul reason on why you win any battle. I remember playing a 3v3 match. My line was incredibly weak, supporting no tank or anti tanks equipment nor did any of my infantry field panzerfaust, panzerschrecks or anti tank grenades. If one tank were to come to my line, I would have nothing to offer, Except my planes. Thankfully, I was being attacked with the good'ole strategy,""JuSt ThRoW InFaNtRy At ThE eNemY"". And boy, when I saw 9-11 infantry squads running toward me, I just smiled, selected my fighter bombers and watched them lose 10 minutes worth of build up. However, fighter bombers can bearly scratch tanks(please fix game Eugen).

Onto the positives about tanks. They can single handily win any battles with infantry at medium range. They very accurately represent how crucial tanks can be in any engagement. I find this aspect to be more fun then i originally thought. However, playing against AI is a nightmare, I swear to my heart, when they have available anti tank equipment, they just plant every single nook and cranny of there lines with anti tank weapons. This one thing stops 80% tank engagements. Although, the reason this is put into the positive section is because there fire gives away there position and you can use planes to root them out and kill them.

What happened about not rambling? Anyway, I have more respect for Eugen after discovering there incredibly small team size. To some this review up, Eugen, please Nerf anti air and give planes higher suppression caps. Especially heavy bombers.

- Realism and historical fidelity.
- Graphically satisfying for a strategic one.

Versus:
- I find it really difficult, especially NOT HAVING so much TIME to invest to learn about the various dynamics.
- So many things happen AT THE SAME TIME (TOO MUCH), the micro-management makes everything less pleasant.
- There is no adequate introduction.

Conclusions:
Great potential for fun at a high risk of early abandonment. 
Recommended only for non-casual gamers.
If I had not already passed the 2 hours of play I would have made it, instead I will have to try to learn how to play :-)

Update 03/07/20: The game still has the same issues; in particular team stacking by player level where high rank players all move to one team. This ruins multiplayer and so no wonder it has a tiny player base. I will not be purchasing further DLCs until perhaps rock bottom sale.

This game is plagued by a number of dire issues if you mainly want to play multiplayer. I am very dissapointed that similar kinds of problems continue from Eugen's previous games like Wargame: Red dragon. These are: 1) Stacked/unbalanced Teams, 2) Artillery Spamming, 3) Unpleasant community, 4) Lack of players/hard to find a game (especially if you want to play tactical games without tons of units), 5) Too many units to control at once (in non-tactical games). The unbalanced teams could have been avoided if Eugen did not include levels and stats on the other players in the lobby. Another, problem is that there is some kind of bias against playing as the Germans with most of the experienced players playing as Russians stacked against a German team full of inexperienced players. I usually play as the German Divisions in 10v10 games and I would say I am only on the winning team around 1 out of 10 games. This can become tiring because you always feel like your team is just being wrecked which makes the game frustrating. You would not expect this kind of win loss ratio if things were random but you see the same players always playing soviets in a stacked team against new players on the German team. I think this problem mainly results from the fact that the game has a tiny player base and most of those who are playing the game regularly are only playing as the Russians. I also wonder if the Russian divisions have an advantage in some way that make them superior compared to the Germans. Overall I cannot recommend because I am not enjoying the game, single player is better but not my main interest.",1586250056,1622234249,False,44,5,0.631882965564727783,0,True,False,False

Good things: 
1) Graphics: First is the graphics they are breathtaking you can zoom out all the way up in the clouds and zoom back in to see the solders firing there rifles and machine guns. You can see the tanks from above and get close to see the target and the gun sound. Sound i am going to come at in a moment.

2) Sound Design: Well what to say if there is everything there the amazing sounds and feeling when a heavy 88mm gun fires and fill the air with boom. Tanks getting hit has the unique sound of metal banging.

3) Addictive: Well this is a personal one as one win a victory you go back and get the drive to win again and this is so rewarding and amazing. 

4) Deck management : That is also a feature on the good side and it is amazing to pick and choose what you want and then to reassemble it when you see its deficiency in battle. 

5) Combined arms use: well if you a nerd like me for everything military then the use of combined arms is another plus. The feeling when you know you amour is going to get bombed if you do not have AA nearby and the rush to get it to safety for your flak to handle enemy aircraft is amazing.

6) Multiplayer community : Great multiplayer scene with a very big and satisfying as well as intense 4 v 4 or 10 v 10 games that will take your breath away.

Bad things: 

1) Learning Curve: it is steep to say the least you have to like spend 3 4 days thinking how to do thing and that.

2) DLC : The DLC system is a bit broken and they are a bit on the expensive side.

3) Single player campaign is a acquired experience as it take you to be a general and takes some time to understand.

Game is fun Graphics are nice lot of reliability. The amount of DLCs for feature creep is annoying. (do come out with free divisions etc)  Multiplayer is either fun as hell or damn annoying. With some people off map arty spamming or light tank rushing it gets annoying. 7.5 to an 8 out of 10 get it on sale even more value with DLCs


Longer Version 
I love the game but I do have a few issues and ill list them. I give it a hard 7/ soft 8 out of 10. 
I owned The first one and enjoy that. They fixed a good amount of issues. 

***My biggest issue is no tutorial at all*** (been fixed for the most part) 



Pros
Graphics are great 
Gameplay is fun 
The sheer scale is great
Love the new game modes(flags etc)
Game play is fast 
Air craft I am rewarded for micro actions. 

Middle(The AI is good but also doesn't understand it is in danger.)

Cons
Ranges on guns are very off (I know they are fixing) 
Pen. shots seem off as well, a king tiger will lose a 300m shot (no pen) vs t34 or su85 and get killed. 
The spamming of units is annoying and off map can be annoying.  

Ill add more in a bit. If you liked the first one you'll enjoy this or if you enjoy wargame or RUSE

1) High learning curve

4)Irritating behaviour of friendly AI, you better like micro if you wanna play this game

PROS:
1) Good mechanics, believable realism and balance, and counterplay
2) Decent historicity of rosters, units, and combat performance
3)Tonk, antitonk, and 152 mm howitzers that make things go KABOOM.
4)Long single player campaigns that can be played on both sides and that typically are released with each new dlc that really makes the game enjoyable especially when your learning the mechanics
5) Real payout to success and the ability to make even defeats be meaningful to the player

Game seems to be actively trying to fix some of the major bugs. 

PvP is where its best at for me. And Im a player who NEVER plays the competitive scene or MP scene of RTS. But the single player kinda landed flat with me so I decided to try the PvP.  Best decisiion I ever made. 

It was hard to learn, took me several hundreds hours to even be good. But I made it. Im good.

1v1 is where the game is balanced for mainly.  I write this because a lot of complaints seems to turn around the 10v10 mode about player toxicity and unbalance gameplay. This is normal.  You can find serious players in the 1v1 scene and the community is really awesome on Discord.

Far more realistic than the vast majority of strategy games, but without being painfully so. Expect a little hurdle to entry, but the introduction of  a line of sight/range preview does a lot.

Focussing on the 1944 eastern front was a great decision, highlighting the dramatically underrepresented yet by far most important European front. The campaign mode does a great job at capturing both the scale and tactical level, and is filled with historical detail.

The only downside is the large number of DLCs at this point. The game is still perfectly playable without, but the number and price point to get the ""full"" game (although with little impact on the campaign) still  gnaws on me.

I don't really understand complaints about Axis being overpowered. By 1944 German tanks were indeed better than thier Soviet counterparts, it is just that they were too few (and for Panthers prone to breakdowns), due to wrong industrial choices of the III Reich, and that Germany had lost the skies. Skirmishes are recreating something which almost never happened this year on the eastern front : a confrontation between roughly equal forces. You want something historical ? Take a half manned german infantery division, maybe with few Stugs, facing two soviet divisions with huge artillery and air support. And forbid any unit to withdraw, even surrounded and under Katiousha fire. That would be historical. But not so much fun. 

Of course, I don't say that the game have not its flaws : I am not very fond of the A/B/C system, artillery is maybe too much accurate according the timeframe. And above all, tank fight is not enough realistic for me : killing through successive hits is too much cartoonish for me, I rather prefer a system like in Steel Panthers or Combat Mission, you destroy...or not (or damage something, at least). On the other hand, damages are represented, and you can't kill a tank with MG fire, it is not Command and Conquer neither.

All in a round, it is a very good simulation, with a real depth : even the making of tactical group is almost a game by itself.",1620503304,1620503304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want something with a historical ""feel"" but don't want to struggle 20hrs with UI/watching Youtube vidoes to just PLAY a game like Graviteam: Mius Front, this might be for you. I found it fairly intuitive to just jump in and play. If you've played the excellent Wargame:Red Dragon, this is similar.

+ There's no tech tree but there is 3 ""stages"" of battle every 10min where both sides access new units; an initial contact stage between light units, then medium units, then heavy and elite groups
+ There's no silly base building but you can design your ""deck"" before battle - the units you can access in each category and stage of battle. This is as fun and addictive as building decks in card games and each division has its own units and parameters so they are all a unique challenge.
+ ""Smart orders"" means you can give generalised orders to groups and they will endeavour to follow them fairly well; reducing the micro burden
+ Terrain and line of sight plays a big role
+ The ""moving frontline"" mechanic looks/feels good
+ You can set the points/conditions so the battle ends in a predictable timeframe i.e. 30-40mins

- Infantry seem a bit squishy and evaporate a bit fast
- While semi-realistic, you need to accept this is a game rather than a simulation; there is cheese
- Scouting seems less important than the similar Wargame: Red Dragon

Steel Division 2 - one of the hardest yet most rewarding hardcore rts game i played so far. The Battles are hard, somewhat unforgiving and require a good understanding of cover, line of sights, armor and armor penetration. But once you get to know the map, know how to use which unit against the enemy, it becomes really fun. 

The Campaigns are outstandingly well researched, you actually get a good impression of the scale and how crucial the success of Operation Bagration was. Had a blast while playing all of them!

Only contra in my Opinion: By sticking very close to the actual historical events, Eugen System also puts a lot of effort in recreating regiments, battallions and divisions of the Red Army and the Wehrmacht just as they were back in 1943. I enjoyed that realism a lot, but that means, if one breaks it down to the core gameplay, you either play on the axis side, mostly defending the front line with far less but high quality units, or on the sowjet side with superior numbers of decent units. So either you defend against an onslaught of a trillion sowjets while doing a tiger or panther push here and there or try to overwhelm the axis forces with brute force. Still fun but a campaign or two for the axis side, depicting Operation Barbarossa from 1941-1942 would have been a great addition to the game.

To sum it up: 9/10 for me, a must buy for every strategy fan with historical interests! 
Still need to try the multiplayer though, so this is only my opinion for the single player.",1620061547,1620061547,True,3,0,0.541035473346710205,0,True,False,False

silly bugs like corrupted saves have given me ptsd playing the single player. I save before and after every fight since I have learned with this game if you don't you leave yourself vulnerable to corrupted auto saves.

I heard from the community people just crack jokes about gassing jews in chat so I don't touch the online games.

the AG campaign is simply too large. I understand Eugene needs to try and simulate the whole front line for both factions. But they must find ways to simplify things where they can otherwise I would drop the single player the way it is atm entirely.

all in all the AG single player is super overwhelming to a new player since its just entire unit divisions everywhere and you don't have any knowledge of what kills what effectively so people probably don't bother.

the models and sound are absolutely great. Love the shermans and the t34's, the tigers its all really immersive.

What units are available to each army group is tied to what it had in actual history. 

This has the funny effect of engrossing you in the history of it all while you prepare for a game by putting together a deck, but lets you play the game once you've loaded up a battlefield and you get to the real fun: guiding your troops to victory.

And, if you're like me, you can easily get lost in SD2s deckbuilder for hours on end.

Now that the game is ""broken in"" a little bit, I've changed my opinions on some things and wanted to update old things. So to start off, Pros of this game Vs. Other RTS Games...

Pros:
-Huge Maps, Nothing comes close unless its a game on the strategic level
-Lots of content as well as much customization
-RTS and TBS in the Army General Game mode
-As Historical as possible with game balance (and almost complete realism In Army General)
-100% free content released alongside paid for content
-Beauty Unlike any other RTS out there (especially for the scale)
-Good Variety of maps
-Sound Design and Vocals are Great
-Fun diverse Gameplay
-""Easy Micro"" but has a high skill roof

Cons:
-Can be overwhelming at first with all the different units and the size of maps / Amount of units you have to micro
-AI Spams arty like a madman

Army General:
After playing though all the campaigns on both sides, I must say they are a lot of fun if you are dedicated. I Managed to meme every mission and encircle the entire Soviet or German army, but it probably wont be an issue when multiplayer AG comes out as AI can be dumb. Fun thing to Spend 20 hours playing though all of them with a few tatical battles mixed in.

Well if none of those make you want to buy the game,

On the bright side, it had (I would like to believe still has) great potential. It is a pretty unique RTS with an emphasis on historical accuracy and I personally believe it looks pretty nice on screen. 

SDII was marketed as a tactical RTS and I guess to some extent, a WWII battle simulation. I think in the end it failed at both. It is not a simulation because in the end, the gameplay is way too arcade to be so. At the same time the tactical aspect of it is pretty shallow when you spend enough time to understand how the meta works. Because here is the thing: SDII is first and foremost a competitive multiplayer game. The solo mode is a joke despite being advertised as a key element of the game. The AI simply isn't good enough to give you an interesting challenge (the difficulty level is addressed by giving the AI arbitrary buffs in unit availability while making it more aggressive) and is by no mean intelligent. The Army general mode or even the scenarios are pretty pointless, as they will engage you in nonsensical battles where you can easily abuse the incompetency of the AI and the flawed mechanics of the strategic map. Just engage the AI's artillery battalions with any of your infantry, armored or mechanized ones, rush the spawn, win the battle in 5 minutes and repeat this pointless scheme until the campaign is done...

Anyway, the only valid way to play SDII is thus in PVP. The issue is that the learning curve is fairly steep for the everyday player and you will find yourself crushed by tryharders more often than not in 1v1 games, simply because the pool of active players is well, very small. You may wanna try team games but after a while you will probably realize how unplayable the game is in these large team battles simply because of the artillery or air spam abuse that rules in these games.

Now let's assume you are a tryharder yourself and you will get yourself up to the 1v1 challenge. The truth is you'll probably get tired of that quickly too. Whether you go with medium tanks spam, air spam or a different kind of game mechanic abuse, in the end you're not playing anything tactical. You're just betting on the right spam at the right place and hoping your CPM, original choice of units in the deployment phase and RNG will get you passed your opponent's units all the way to his spawn. In other words, wins feel pointless and losses frustrating more often than not.

I am not even gonna mention the way 90% of the maps are just unbalanced, giving a ridiculous edge to one player before the game even started, which add to the overall frustration. Eugen marketed their game saying they tried to reproduce accurate maps from the battlefield of Operation Bagration. The result is the most nonsensical maps ever seen in a RTS that is mostly played competitively. As for historical accuracy, it didn't last too long as most of the Western divisions from SD44 have been introduced in SDII, for the sake of selling you a few more DLCs. And of course, most of these divisions are pretty high up in the meta. So much for most of the Eastern Front divisions...

Now, a lot of things could be done to adjust the game's many shortcomings and some changes have come in the form of patches and fixes along the way. But the truth is that Eugen is busier selling you 50 more divisions in 20 more DLCs that will cost you a few hundredth euros, rather than fixing the many flaws the game has.

- Army General mode is awesome
- 600+ historical units to play around with
- Decent price for a new game, at 50 bucks. Most new titles these days are 60-80 bucks.

Cons:
- Day 1 DLC, which is way overpriced. Just don't buy it.
- Certain divisions are only given to you if you already owned Normandy 44.",1561587095,1614885948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

that said I would advise you to temper your expectations in regards to multiplayer and dlc content; the most recent dlc's (including the soon to released burning baltics) have taken place in areas that look nothing like belarus and have added no maps to make this distinction.

In regards to multiplayer I'v found it  hard to get into as the community is quite hostile to new players, its a relatively small and tight nit community of which the players natural have hours upon hours of experience in the meta; not knowing these tricks will get you kicked out of matches and screamed at by toxic players.

while on the subject of toxic players we have to talk about eugens long history of terrible community management. if you check reviews of every game they have put out (that still has a multiplayer community) you will see that what I'm about to say is not a new or controversial observation by any means:
eugen has consistently made the choice to hire some the most toxic members of the community to be the ones who regulate said community, putting the lunatics i charge of the asylum.
they have to know that this is an issue but don't do anything to change this. 
hot take but if you pay AAA price for a strategy game it should be competently moderated.

Pros:
Big Maps
Lots of unit types
Varied Terrain
Complex Orders
Interesting Ai command ideas

Cons:
Flat Combat
Overly-squishy units
Unbelievable Micromanagement
Boring Strategic gameplay
Uninspired sound design
Unrewarding gameplay loop
Unit strengths/weaknesses are impossible to determine without research
Units run out of supply incredibly quickly; (To clarify; resupply is extremely difficult to bring forward safely and units are too slow to pull back and resupply themselves. It is easier to let a unit die than perform logistical support for them in most cases)

I might just be terrible at this game, but as someone who LOVES complex ""Easy to play, difficult to master"" games, this falls under the category of ""Difficult to play, not worth mastering.""

The previous Steel Division is better than the War Game series, and I was sold on the premise that this would be better than Steel Division. But it is basically worse in every way. 

The graphic is worse, the combat is spamming planes and artillery. Most of the artillery seem to be much more effective even against tanks when compared to the first game. And the AI's artillery doesn't seem to rely on line of sights any more, they just hit you from miles away until your units are dead without any scouts that I can see. 

For the campaign the art style is so damn bad, 100% feel like it is back to the old War Game level. Instead of well crafted story and clearly defined goals you just get a bunch of units on a map. You are either told to hold a place or took a place, and defending is just so much better than attacking. You get most of the map from the start and get bunkers that just slaughters infantry. While most of your army are infantry, so you had to rely on the planes you get to use once each turn, without planes there is basically no way to win an attack. It is just simply not fun to play.

In the Army General mode it also crashes all the time for me when I try to auto resolve, just not a product worth buying right now.

I'm a big fan of Eugen Systems, but this game isn't really worth it and they didn't implement some cool things from other games they produced. I'll create s short lost of pros and cons:

Pros:
-the map is huge
-unit variety is acceptable, although much worse than in games like Wargame Red Dragon
-campaign maps are big
-there are lots of campaigns to choose from and you're able to play with both sides of the conflict making the game very replayable
-some nice features like being able to use the artillery and planes from your campaign map to bombard enemy units before entering battle and being able to place some units or divisions under the control of the AI, which reduces the need for micro-management by a lot.

cons:
-you can only call 3 divisions at once into battle. Exactly, even if you have 10 divisions that are able to attack the enemy, you can only call 3 of them into battle. In campaigns where you have dozens of divisions, only being able to fight with only 3 at a time kinda sucks and that makes campaigns last long enough for you to lose interest in finishing them. It just feels more like work than gaming.
-frontline system. The frontline system is acctually quite a nice idea: one third of the map belongs to one side, another side of the map belongs to the other with some space in between these two sides. The objective is to dominate the map. However, no matter what direction you attack from on the campaign map with your divisions, the map will always be divided like that, throwing the idea of flanking enemy divisions out the window. You can attack an enemy divisions from two opposite directions and you'll still be able to only spawn your units on one single side of the map.
-the all knowing AI: this has been a constant problem in Eugen games. The AI always knows what units you have, where they are and how to counter them, strongly decreasing the effectiveness of tactics like surprise attacks or ambushes. You spawned 10 infantry brigades? The AI will spawn as many snipers. Spawned many tanks? The AI will spawn tank destroyers.
-when building your deck you select a division, not a nation or faction. That means that you will never have access to all units from a nation or faction, which I think is quite a shame.
-the veteranicy system in skirmish mode. If you now want higher rank units, you can bring less of those units in combat. That's a nice idea, but the numbers of units you can bring in combat if you upgrade them by two ranks can sometimes be reduced by 50% which is insane.

All in all, I'd say this game more negatives than positives. I really miss features from Wargame Red Dragon like being able to flank your enemy on the campaign map. I also want to be able to bring more than 3 divisions into battle. I started the Iasi campaign. I've played the campaign for a couple of hours and I didn't even manage to get past turn one because there are dozens of divisions on the campaign map. It's not fun and all and I've just quit playing the campaigns alltogether. And last but not least, the developer needs to fix the AI. It's quite annoying when it always knows your weak spots and how to counter your units. Also I'd like to be able to choose rom all German units when building a deck, but that isn't that important.

My favorite Eugen Game has been of course, Wargame Red Dragon and WW2 is also an era I like very much. But coming from WGRD, I really started to miss the bigger variety of units, due to the era of course. Also I started to feel awkward by the limited range of the Infantry AT weapons and it was some learning curve there.

The game feels more balanced in the campaign, and the AI is also smarter. No more tank convoys running towards their doom.

However, pretty hard to get into, as tutorials are pretty barren and game mechanics advanced. If you hate  getting smashed, you will ragequit pretty fast. 

Presentation is out of this world, with detailed towns and dense forests and astounding detail on models (especially tanks). The ability to zoom out as far as to see the whole alive battlefield with hundreds of soldiers from the ""war room"" to instantly being able to zoom in to see individual soldier perspective is great.  

AI is superb, I have not noticed any cheating, except maybe on the ""hardest"" setting. AI knows what it's doing, capable of offence and defence, can get however a little confused with bigger battles, especially in Breakthrough mode. It will smartly position it's AA and AT guns, counter-battery your artillery and push with tanks where you have left an opening. 

Sound is uneven, with motor units and voice acting on high level, but small arms fire is a nightmare to listen to, with heavy machineguns rattle blasting. Music is very good, with pompous choirs and marches. 

The ""deckbuilding"" mechanic is addicting, with players freedom to build the composition of their battlegroups based of wide range of units and division templates. 

The ""campaign mode"" follows critical battles and gives you really nice context and authentic feel, but leaving you complete freedom and resources to accomplish your goals.  You position your battalions on a campaign map in turnbased strategic overlay, but conduct battles in real-time. No replenishment and limited support make it a challenge, but a fair one, as a AI follows the same ruleset (you can play every campaign either as Axis or Allies) 

Also, game breaks away from boring cliche WW2 with unique divisions (Kozaks, Poles, Romanians) what makes presentation more interesting and fresh. Especially with the DLC divisions, which add much of flavour, and some single-player content. 

If you want COH but on bigger scale and less arcade-y, this is your pick. If you want a simulation, that has some fun element in it, this is your pick.

Im to old for this kind of nonsense.
They introduced some sort of ""smart orders"" but they are far from smart. In fact its just random positioning with few basic algorithms. Saves some clickiness but they are still actring dumb as hell.

I myself played like this when I started and I found the game infuriating as my units would constantly die and I had no idea where from or how to stop it- without recon, your units are almost completely blind (For example a t34/85 sitting next to a building with infantry will not be able to detect that infantry unless they are shooting, same with a tank driving by infantry in a forest) and as such are incredibly prone to ambushes from an opponent with superior situational awareness.

It strikes a good balance between historical accuracy, depth and breadth (representing a staggering array of nations, units and locations) in the game's setting - 1944 WW2. The singleplayer 'army general' campaign is below the grand strategy games (like Hearts of Iron 4) in complexity and scope - you don't produce your tanks, you just use them, but well above games like Company of Heros which (which looks only at the minute tactical level) you command entire divisions (duh). This makes for some fun history lessons in an often overlooked - in the West - historical setting of the Eastern Front and great decision making. 

The multiplayer community from what I've engaged with is good fun although it is a very (loyal) small playerbase. You will be able to get games but not at any time of day or in any format - which ranges from 1v1 to 10v10. I only really have three criticisms - first, the graphics up close can be a bit of an eyesore, especially the infantry look cartoonish up close but I suppose that's the price of a game that has this scale of play. Second, the price, with all of the DLC (which in my view add a huge amount of replayability to the singleplayer, most adding new divisions and massive army general campaigns) this is a pricey game. Third, the playerbase is very small but stable. If you want a superactive community with lots of players all across the skill range you will be dissapointed. There is a strong base of veteran players (who are mostly pretty nice) but you'll likely be stomped hard in 1v1s if you're picking the game up in 2020. That said the harder core playerbase makes for some entertaining esports tournaments to watch and learn through.

So maybe both groups of gamers won't be completely happy with this (Not enough vs too much realism).

[h2]The Good[/h2]
But for me this is just a good balance:
On one hand, the realism of randomness of kills, combined with suppression and units falling back on their own if there's too much fire makes each battle different and challenging (e.g. ""Oh no, all my anti-tank got killed off at the start, what now?"").
On the other hand, I'm spared of annoying details like an observer unit requiring having to setup a telephone line to the artillery battery first before you can order barrages.

What really deserves mentioning is the extremely well done battledeck where you put together and design your battlegroups based on historic divisions. You only have a limited amount of available points, so a lot of fun back-and-forth strategic thinking required here.

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
Apart from the well designed battledeck, the only down-side of sd2 is that a lot of things feel a bit unfinished, careless, unpolished and have quite some rough edges. Be it the mediocre user experience with the menus, lackluster tutorials, the repetitive music, repetitive maps, or the campaign (army general) which lacks atmosphere, excitement, and an introduction and requires lots of annoying try-and-error on your own before you know what's important. It seems just enough patched together to make everything only just work.

[h2]The Annoying[/h2]
I'm in the middle of the match against a hard AI opponent, just about to plan my next move. Then suddenly the ending screen shows up, ""Minor Defeat""... What just happened? I was in the middle of something and about to win, just not paying attention to some tiny numbers or points :(

Next time I would wish for more consistent care for details, not only in some places, and a more polished overall game and UX design which doesn't leave me stranded somewhere in the dark ww2 forrest, and a bit more atmosphere, life and personality of the units and just a bit more rounded off experience in general.",1609766563,1609767348,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: As opposed to the last Steel Division soldiers would just run away even when they outnumbered the enemy. At least in this game the battles feel more believable. Like I felt like my units weren't running away as much. It still is a problem but a much smaller inconvenience in this sequel.

Cons: I wish this game had more organization of units. Like if you lose a unit, there should be an option to auto spend your points to replace that unit on the frontline. Instead you constantly have to look over the battlefield to guess which flank needs more men.

Pros: The map sizes are excellent. I really like the size of the maps. They just end up feeling a bit empty and with no elevation to them though. Even Illinois has hills to shoot down from. (For those of you who are unfamiliar with geography, Illinois is a very flat state but still has advantageous geographical features. Similar to the plains of Poland & Russia.)

Cons: You can't pick your units. I mostly played the General game which I really liked, it felt a bit more accurate as opposed to other games where you can win 100% of the battles yet you're still against the strongest enemy in the universe. This General game mode felt a bit more accurate but I just kept getting attacked and couldn't once launch my own offensive. Which was rather annoying since it was set during the early part of the war too. 

Cons: There is 0 modding community for this game. Most likely because every patch destroys previous mods and they didn't release mod support until 2020.

Cons: All the maps are pretty much the same, after you've played your first few battles, you will notice how short the list of maps is. 

This game is really a mixed bag but I wish there was a way to organize units and to have them be auto replenished. I felt too much of my time was spent clicking for multiple units to send to the front line and then waiting 2 minutes for them to show up, all while I was clicking to reinforce, the enemy would attack my weaker and other side. So it would be nice if you could set up a unit loadout for a brigade and just have it be automatically reinforced rather than having to click 8 times to refill it with MG's and  then having to click another 4 times to refill it with rockets, and then having to click another 2 times to refill it with mortors and then having to click another 3 times to send a supply truck, all while your left flank has been overrun.

- Alot of depth to game mechanics. You can make several approaches to accomplish a task. 
- Strong variety of units with important capabilities. 
- Realistic (as a military professional with a good understanding of doctrine) This game represents manoeuvre warfare. (Constant movement, regrouping and placement of fires in specific areas in the battle space. 
-Cognitive Development: You have to use your brain to play this game (analytical thinking, critical thinking, risk assessments, decision making)

Cons 
- For those players complaining about micromanagement, this is what it is like. If you feel you spend a lot of time on the deployment phase, you should. You need to develop a plan before you execute.  Comparing your forces to your enemy. Yes, there is a bit too much micro managment. When you command a brigade, which is what you do in the battles of this game, you have subordinate commanders leading the regiments following your command guidance. And you can do that with some of the hot keys for hunt/unload at location. So to play this game to its full potential, playing with other players can offset the feeling of micromanagement. So this is not so much as a con but you to play with some colleagues to really enjoy the tactical and strategic piece of this game.",1605962389,1609241343,True,9,0,0.564656198024749756,0,True,False,False

I'll keep giving the game a try, (maybe it's a grower & I need to learn?) but I'll probably be more likely to fire up Normandy '44 again.

I've Backed with the best edition (total conflict) since it was announced and available to buy, Coming from SD1 this game is definately a Step up in the right direction however the inital problems with SD2 has been fixed albeit fairly slow, 

Only until the last DLC (Lvov) has the recon has been useful and the game hasn't ended up just spam infantry. You will always see these reviews who either hate on the game just because they like hating stuff. 

For what SD2 does, it does well, Seeing other reviewers say stuff like ""it aint balanced"" and ""each patch breaks the balance of the game"". which tbh, aint true, i remember pre Lvov DLC the game ended up being spamming infantry and you win (not the case fully as you still need combined arms). but with the new patch infantry is still required but isn't so dominant, no longer can you spam a blob of 5 gvardia across an open field through MG fire and they come out alive and with little damage, now they get pinned down extremley quickly forcing you to adapt to your environment by Using recon, Infantry support guns and even tanks, 

However some negatives of this game are the seemingly slow process of fixing simple things, For example they added smart orders to help newer players get into the game and flatten the learning curve, aswell as adding rules of engagement. (such as standard right click being attack move if turned on, or just normal move with Q being attack move). however they still havn't added the ability to normal move by right clicking or given us a normal move hotkey for using with RoE being set to hunt as standard click,  A few other problems are showing in this game but i wouldn't consider them major.

If you are looking for a semi historical game then I'd Suggest you pick up SD2 as this could be a game you'd enjoy, But you'd need to put hundreds of hours into the game to actually get good,

Several changes in my life have cut deeply into the free time I have and I found myself just not enjoying some of the types of games I used to love because of how complicated they were.  Wargame: Airland Battle is a perfect example.  I absolutely love that game and I absolutely have no idea how to play it.  As I said before, I don't have the time to figure it out.  This game is very similar to Wargame with one huge difference: the turn-based Army General mode.  It's a turn-based strategy game where, if you so choose, you can take real time command of your units and control the battlefield.  I suck at doing this.  I play the turn-based strategy mode and give complete control of my army to the AI while I watch the battles from the perspective of individual units carrying out my orders.

where it is good, 

 first have to build a deck, it might seem daunting at first but as you play a few games you will begin to refine your decks to better suit how you want to play the session out, sometimes i go for tanks and AA, sometime's artillery and support, sometimes infantry, I found by focusing on how you want to play by the above mentioned routes you know what you are there to do and do it you shall (doesn't mean it will work out).   I still prefer red dragon, but when no multiplayer is available to play this is easily the game to hopefully find an online match. 


Skirmish mode is also excellent to test your decks out. 

Overall, there is many maps to choose and how to play as you see fit.      Buckle up for a great strategy game. 

even when you loose you will learn something for The next game.

Your always trying to design the perfect battle group or try using a division in a new way. There is a good variety of units especially thanks to the fact that Romania, Hungry, and Finland are in the game which lets you play with weapons you never even knew existed. I am able to run the game fine even though I have a potato PC. The graphics are quite nice when you turn them up and for the scale of the battle its fantastic that you can zoom in and watch a fight between two tanks or infantry squads. The Game is not perfectly balanced but the developers listen to the community and there is not any units or divisions that are incredibly overpowered or do not have a counter. The devs do listen to the community and lets us vote on what divisions we wanted in the new mini DLCs. The game has a very friendly and competitive player base and many of the experienced player are happy to help new players out as the game does have a bit of a learning curve. The dlcs while a bit pricy do not add op divisions and instead add content and you can get arguably the three best ones for a pretty fair price with the history dlc. The dlcs are not neccesary and the base game does have a very good variety.

If for example you are obsessed with the units and equipment that were involved in the Ostfront campaigns of WW2. The game design team have really studied the Ostfront campaigns carefully and there is plenty to get stuck into in terms o the detail they have put in. The modelling of the equipment is superb at least in the workshop. 

However after just seven hours playin I am beginning to think 'meh'. Why?

The transition between the strategic and tactical is more than a bit problematic. And that frustrates my enjoyment of the game. 

For exmple I was playing the Wehrmacht on a strategic retreat. I got all my forces to a town on a major river while my panzers fought a gallant delaying rearguard action. Then, as the Russians approached my town with its one bridge across the major river... they attacked individual brigades of mine despite me having lots of other brigades immediately adjoining and clearly there to act as one force. Moreover the bridge and river was completely ignored. The Russians just magiced themselves across the river to attack me. All my forces there to defend the bridge but the game acted as if it wasnt there at all. Hmmm! So there was no point in grouping to defend the bridge behind the river - I might as well have been on flat territory with no river there. So there is a lack of recognition of geographical features in the transition between strategic and tactical maps. 

Such aspects make me dobt whether it is worth the steep climb to learn this game, which aint simple to master.

I will play some of the historical battles, but the campaign has lost a little of its shine for me. A very good attempt at a strategic to tactical WW2 game along the lines of Rome Total War, but there remain some disappointing aspects for me.",1603123313,1603123313,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

COH isn't aiming for realism of course, but the idea that the tanks can only fire a few times their own length is an RTS trope that's been around forever, only set aside in rare gems like Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander.  The idea that you have a vast map to play with, to hide in bushes and do some macro strategy is really appealing to me (even if I'm not great at actually doing so!)

A nice improvement on Steel Division: Normandy.  I preferred the lush green maps of the first in terms of aesthetics, but this is the eastern front after all, so I can't complain.  The hedgerows and terrains in the first meant the long tank ranges were irrelevant in many cases, and it wasn't till I played this one that I realised that in hindsight.  

I'm a fairly casual player, so memorising exactly what beats what isn't something I'm likely to do.  But with a few basic tips and watching a vid or two you can get to a point where it's fun and you don't get your ass handed to you every time...  Also good is the ability to customise units - what transport they have and what veterancy/phase you want them in.  This is far preferable to SD44's method where you get what they prepared.  I would say though that adding veterancy looks too costly to me.  You go from a card with 8 green units, to a 1 veterancy card with 4.  Or with 2 veterancy and 1 or 2 units.  Steep.

The detail of the maps is always nice.  Zooming into townships and seeing the fine details they've put in really shows the love they put into these games.

I do think the fact all the tanks seem to have a 2000m range is a little odd considering how realistic everything else tries to be.  But I can imagine it would be frustrating if they all varied and you had to know that the blah 123 has 200m more range than the blob 321, so it sits there picking you off while you sit there.

I have played many strategic or combat based games in my life, but also always wanted to try a game on tactical level.

In the same time, this gives it a charm. If you get the hang of it, you could spend 100s of hours on this game. (Excluding multi)

I have to mention that it is extremly hard to start playing the game. The tutorial is meh, there are recomended tutorial videos. I bypassed them, but it was a mistake, game mechanics and controls are hard and not really intuitiv, you can't just learn them as you go.

The main, biggest reason for this is the unrealism, as well as the AI to a lesser extent. Despite the fact SD 2 markets itself as a realistic RTS in practice it's really just a glorified arcade game.
For a start ALL gun (tank and anti-tank guns of sufficient caliber) ranges are identical at 2000m, giving an 88mm FLak gun the same range as a Valentine tank, which I think is idiotic.
The gun/ballistics mechanics are also idiotic, I have seen some real BS tank exchanges. For example I have seen a KV1-S with frontal armour of 95mm block multiple direct hits from a Marder II tank destroyer whose AP has a pen of 190mm and not only that but the Marder, with virtually non-existent frontal armour (40mm) was bouncing shots from the KV-1!
There was also an instance where one of my 88mm guns came up against an IS-2 obr 1943, the 88 has 160mm pen whilst the IS-2 has 160mm frontal armour, the 88 shot the IS-2 repeatedly and every shot bounced off, allowing the IS-2 to after a few shots kill the 88.    
The AI is never going to win any awards either. One time my allied AI thought it would be a good idea to (when defending) deploy some lone isolated mortars, separated from each other not in groups, at the top of the deployment zone and when the battle started march them alone into the path of the on coming enemy who then predictably killed them all in the space of 10 seconds.
I don't like the way infantry work in this game either. Infantry strike me as just being little more than cannon fodder and are too easy to kill. Making infantry firefights, for instance, more realistic and increasing infantry survivability would be a good idea. It would also be cool if infantry squads (as well as tanks maybe) could move together in platoon sized units instead of just having isolated squads off everywhere and allowing infantry squads to replenish numbers and get replacements from supply trucks would also be a must. 
As I say, I want to like this game, but it's mainly the above things as well as it's overall lack of realism stopping me. I would love it if the dev's made a 'realism mode' or something of the sort, a hardcore realism mode much different to the standard arcade mode to satisfy that desire and appease people like me.

THE FOOKIN BATTLE TIMER

45 mins and thats it, game over.  no fighting any battles of attritions, its all rush rush rush.
I dont play multiplayer, just single,  and when i used a no timer mod when i first started it was great. 
Now i cant find the mod, and games are over just as im getting stuck in. 

i should have learnt my lesson when i bought the battle of norway cold war game by the same devs, all rush rush rush like a bloody RTS , that didnt even have a pause, at least this does. 

If you like a clicky game where you have to rush all the time, you may like it, if you like to take your time, do recon, then build up for an attack, or play a game of defence and attrition, then DONT bother with this, the battles over before it begins. 

Im not the only one saying this, people just want to turn off the timer, but the devs still havent put it in. 

wont be buying another title of them, its all DLC , BUY MORE DLC,  but whats the point, they cant even turn a timer off.  (if i could play this game slow, with tactics,  i would already have bought ALL the DLC )",1599003784,1599003863,False,119,5,0.80656886100769043,0,True,False,False

When it needs to wait until a bunker is suppressed it rushes under its fire, and when it is necessary to push it acts passively. 

In defence it is opposite. The place where it chooses to put its forces is terrible. For example, the enemy advances from the North. There is a very good place to where the enemy has to pass a narrow road so it is a good opportunity to put some people with PTRD-41 to kill incoming vehicles or even tanks with flanking fire. AI puts anti-tank rifle squads behind of a line of houses so they can't see anybody and can't file at anything. So they are sitting and waiting until the infantry dismounts, enters the buildings and kills everybody.

Another issue in defense, instead of going to the places where choke points are located and where all the battle is happening AI spreads its forces evenly over the map and here they are, sitting 3 km away of the actual battlefield doing nothing, or wandering somewhere far from the enemy, while I am battling against the whole German army that is as twice a bigger than mine. Even the most direct stupid rush from the friendly AI would help, but there is nothing, like it doesn't exist.

It is just makes me mad seeing how the battle develops. The enemy (2 battle groups) concentrates assault in one direction, while I can only engage 50% of the forces available to my side. Germans simply steamroll my defenders having x 2 advantage in numbers.

So the conclusion is that when you are playing with an AI companion you are essentially commanding a part of the forces and another part is mostly useless. The main problem is that the game does not allow you to take the control over all forces.

Its complexity (and the way its been implemented) is its strength, but it can be intimidating for new players for sure. Very worth the investment! 

Compared to SD 44: Larger battlefield, more units (this has pros and cons depending on your style), overall I really like it and enjoy it and they did implement some new mechanics which I think work great and a step up from SD44. 

Cons: AI seems to me less smart than SD44, but solo play is still fun, with army general mode, breakthrough. Real fun is in multiplayer for me though.

The things that this game does extremely well is immersing you as commander of a proper division. A massive battle takes place across thousands of kilometers of land fighting for territory and strategically important terrain, utilizing a vast arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and troops in combined arms warfare. Normandy 44 got close to the feeling, but SD 2 fully fleshes it out.

In specifics, I like the sheer size of the maps. Sight lines, reinforcements, and timing become even more important because of the scale. A mistimed push, an exposed flank, failure to scout out an ambush, all these things become more prominent, and more punishing. Although, it sounds like it would be frustrating to play, it isn't. You understand why your losing, and realize quite quickly how to prevent that, and then use it yourself. 

Without any shenanigans, losing is fun. And, that's the real big takeaway with SD 2, you can enjoy yourself even when your getting your butt kicked by the AI.

Unfortunately, it suffers from several design decisions and its' wonky vision mechanic that holds it back. 

Firstly, the AI. The AI is not as obviously cheating in previous Eugen titles, but it is still obvious if you pay even a moderate amount of attention. 
It has perfect no Fog of War vision across the whole battlefield, and simply pretends to not see your units until revealed by their own. Multiple times I've seen the AI roll tanks up to concealed infantry that it has never seen or scouted before, but knew it was there and determinedly tried to expose them. Because of this perfect vision, it exploits the wonky vision mechanic in the game so it can fire from the low ground against your units on the high ground, without being exposed to return fire. It is literally detrimental to hold the high ground against the AI because of this.
Because of its' perfect vision it also knows where your defensive line is weakest and will proceed to bumrush whatever the line's weakest against right against it. It is easily exploited, but rather annoying and not immersive.

The Deck building is a step back from Normandy 44's deck building. In Normandy 44, the phase system and constricted nature of the cards meant that phases mattered, and immensely impacted the experience of each phase. Phase A isn't the tense scouting and skirmishing, and husbanding of resources as it was before. Phase B isn't the general battle phase, where you'd see pushing and pulling across the front, with lows and highs in intensity of the battles. And Phase C doesn't feel like when your war machine is finally revved up and you and your enemy are destined for a titanic clash. All the phases feel the same. There is nothing that really distinguishes them anymore. Made especially poignant because recon isn't useful at all, all units have excellent detection ranges and infantry suss out everything else just as well.

And my final criticism, is the engagement ranges of units. Every single big gun has a range of 2000m the only difference is how quickly they aim and load, as a result units lose their distinctiveness. Why should you choose an assault gun when a tank does just as well. Why choose the IS-2 to flank when the BA-10 armored car can crush tank side armor just as well. Why bother at all with Tank Destroyers or infantry mortars when there are other flatly better options for the same task. Unlike Normandy 44, where every unit had a niche and a purpose, in SD 2 there are units that a purely worthless in any scenario, because something else does the same thing and more, better.

In spite of all that, I still recommend the game for the simple fact that there exists no other game that delivers the same experience. No other game brings you close to feeling like a commander battling for control over vastness of the Eastern Front.

I come from a war game and history geek background, having loved the Close Combat series in my youth....
SD2 feels like the real successor to those great games.
Its historically accurate but not overly so...meaning its really well paced, frantic and good fun.
I still love placing AT guns in ambush positions and micro-managing engagements but my extremely defensive style in say Close Combat has to be assessed against the need to macro manage. You need to bring in reinforcements and manage several areas of the map simultaneously.
The aspect of taking a division resource pool to create your BattleGroup is also brilliant. Its kind of similar to building a card deck and whilst it takes a little getting used to, its fun in itself.
Multiplayer works flawlessly,although I've only played it with friends.
I'm not much of a fan boy but this game is more accurate than say Company Of Heroes but still maintains that fun and fast paced aspect. Therefore, they've had my money for all DLC's and they'll keep getting it.

The small maps are actually to huge with way too many objectives to manage in one on one, even at the slowest speed. The breakthrough mode has trenches, barbed wire, and gun positions, but you can't place them where they need to go much of the time, and anyway there doesn't seem to be anti-tank or anti-personal mines and no road blocks either.

Pros:
- Nice graphics
- Runs well
- Combat mechanics are satisfying and the engagements themselves are fun

Cons:
- Lack of a cohesive campaign
- Army General is interesting but feels like a step backwards compared to the dynamic campaign of Red Dragon

At the end of the day I just found the experience very lacking to older titles like Red Dragon which had an engaging and intelligent campaign.  I don't know why the Steel Division series has stepped back from the meaningful single player experience but each title seems to focus more on MP at the cost of the single player experience.

If you are looking for a good tactical game for single player I would just go play Red Dragon and skip this.",1595185596,1595185596,False,16,1,0.646009325981140137,1,True,False,False

#Great unit models and enviroments (really good for the scale of the battles).
#Large maps.
#Sounds and effects are good but has the same soundtrack on a loop which can get abit boring.
#Unlike in WG Red Dragon you can now finally save progress in a skirmish match!
#Less unit spam than WarGame, excluding artillery.
#No vehicle fuel mechanic.
#Air combat compared to WarGame is much better and is no longer a doughnutfest.
#I like the small convoy ability where you can chain link units such as apcs together.
#Good theme.

THE BAD:
#AI cheats - The AI spams artillery and it feels like unless your troops are right at the back of the map hidden behind thick forests the AI will spam mortars at you and reck everything. I always feel the need to bring a ton of self-propelled artillery to counter the AI's artillery and then tell them to bolt it before the AI fires two smerch barrages at my counter-artillery.

#Terrign is weird, and feels like a step backwards from WarGame. IMO it also assists the AI in being able to see a ton of your stuff with recon and making hiding stuff more of a pain as your only option is behind thick woodland. WarGame had varied terrign of different elevations and shapes which was not perfect but felt much more realistic than SD2. SD2 has a maximum of three uniform ground elevation levels, everything flat and level which helps the AI spotting stuff even more easier.

#Provided support for mods except most don't work if you have installed any dlc (vistula, d-day, etc...) which makes modding not worthwhile. Plus updates always breaks mods which themselfs may no longer be supported.

#I personally don't like the deck division system and prefer the nation system as seen in the WarGame franchise (i.e. access to all units of a nation to build a deck with).

#No built-in option for infinite match time.

#Dlc are abit pricey for what they bring, though I understand that this game type does not have a massive following/audience and they need to make profit.

#Fast firing weaker mortars seem to powerful in terms that one or two can stun and destroy high end medium tanks.

#Wish defenses was not limited to just breakthrough gamemode.

#2000 meters.

Conclusion:
I have little intrest in SD2 multiplayer and the cheating AI which wipes out your hidden units with spam mortars is a deal breaker for me and is why even though this game gets alot right, I still would rather play wargame.",1595125244,1595125244,False,22,1,0.697967708110809326,3,True,False,False

With some more practice i plan to start playing the multi player as long as i have the spare time.
This game is not a close combat style wargame, its a much broader game with many many more troops on the field. Also if the games played like command and conquer[ ie massed groups dragged and dropped] you will take horrific casualties. It pays to think, also with AI can pause the game and place orders..

What's wrong with the gameplay? When the game was initially released in beta, the creators boasted about providing the most accurate and authentic statistics for the units in the game. This was quickly replaced by arcade-balancing gameplay mechanics that have stripped any sense of realism from the game. The Campaign (Army General-mode) attempts to give players greater agency than the prequel, but all it becomes is a rinse and repeat simulator where you battle with the same combination of units on the same maps (for instance in the Vistula Campaign, I was still playing on a map called ""Orsha""). To make the single-player even more aggravating, the AI is only ""difficult"" because it's given a ridiculous cheating handicap that makes the whole experience unenjoyable.

Typical Eugen game like Wargame, but WW2.

With that comes:
- Good AI? NO! Let's make the Enemy AI have 40000000000% the amount of deployment points they have, perfect visibility of everything at all time EVERYWHERE, oh and if they destroy 1/3 of your regiment yeah it's routed and useless until the end of the game. Oh and they always know how to perfectly position every troop to instantly one-shot kill every unit you have. They don't need recon because the AI has now FOW so they always know exactly where you are.

- Allied AI?

HEY REMEMBER HOW THAT ONE PLANE GOT SHOT DOWN BY 4 88'S OVER THERE? YEAH LET'S GIVE THEM MORE TARGETS, SEND THE WHOLE REGIMENT ONE BY ONE TO GUARANTEE THEM EASY KILLS!

Hey there's 4 heavy AT guns there? Perfect! Time to send a truck and tanks one by one to have them killed.

- Fun for playing around with historical units, absolute shit as usual with wargame at everything else.

- Chance battle? Ha! The only challenge for the computer is ""How many chancs to absolutely slaughter your every troop are they gonna give them, number between 20000 and 20000000000""

Eugen just does not know how to create a wargame. Pretty to look at, horrible to play.

Well here are a few reasons:

- Refreshing Game-play
- More satisfying when you get a victory
- same controls from Red Dragon, so coming over is super easy
- Team-Play is heavily rewarded.

These are just a few of the main reasons why I've personally found this game good. However, This doesn't come without its quarks. In this game the effectiveness of artillery has been greatly reduced, Tanks and Infantry play a WAY more important role than they did in Red Dragon, and setting defensive emplacements (again) is heavily rewarded. 

The Few Cons about this game are:
- Game Modes are confusing and are what they are in Red Dragon (I'll touch back on this) 
- It can feel very spamy at times with opposing players in their deployment of tanks and arty
- A lot of the game is locked behind pay walls (which in my opinion is the worst part about this game) 
- Not as big of a community as Red Dragon.

So now I'm going to touch back on the game modes. There are 3 different game modes. Conquest, Capture the flag, and breakthrough.  

- Conquest can be broken down into 2 types. Close and Not Close. Close Conquest essentially puts the front line right in front of your deployment zone and makes it a much smaller map. As you can imagine the Not Close one makes it so that it is a bigger map and you are further away from the center when you do deploy in the beginning of the game. However, This is where this conquest game mode gets weird. In this game mode, there are these zones that you need to capture on the map that will get you not only more points to call in more units, but also counts towards who actually wins the game. Essentially, If you don't capture any of these zones, you WILL draw. Regardless of how many points you get. If you Lose any zones you WILL lose the game. And if you gain zones you WILL win. Its just odd that a conquest game mode has a mandatory secondary objective in order to win. Very unlike War Game Red Dragon.

- The last thing I will talk about is the Paywalls. In a game where on regular price would pay $40 you would expect the DLC to be a little less that what it is. When the DLC isn't on sale like it is not (Steam Summer Sale 2020), the price would be around $16 per DLC.  And there are around 4-6 DLC. There honestly should be no reason that I should have to pay the price of the entire game and then some, just for content that really should be in the game as it is.  


To sum up, I would recommend this game to anyone who has played Red Dragon for an extended amount of time, wanting a new game play experience. If you can find the game on sale like it is right now I would say its a definite must have. Just be prepared for slower game play that rewards you for working as a team.

Great job to the devs for the follow through, I am following this studio to see what they come up with next for this genre.

Not only do I prefer the World War 2 era, but the slowness of the tanks, anti-tank weaponry, and aircraft add a new tactical element to the game. Unlike Wargame, you have to give your assaults time to develop. It isnt simply a matter of 'pop smoke and run for cover.'

Furthermore, the addition of criticals and armor bouncing make tank combat much more enjoyable. Its all a matter of finding the right distance, angle, and numbers to engage the enemy. 

My biggest complaints include the graphics and level design. To me, the game lacks a clear art direction like Normandy 1944. Everything looks sort of drab and unit labels are confusing. The levels themselves arent quite as varied as I wouldve liked and after 20 hours I havent quite found one that I can honestly say that I enjoy. But, I guess thats Eastern Europe for you!

Historical battles are cool. 
If they kept small span area or better they would let you choose one span area and that way battle would develop this game would be amazing.

I am a single player type person, who mostly plays multiplayer with friends. However from time to time I do play multiplayer with random people. Thus I will be talking about single player first. 
      This game, sadly has fallen to the cult of ""Everything German is bad, everything Russian is good"" that so many WW2 games fall into now days. Im not one of those German worshipers that you find in these types of games either. But what im talking about is, in this game it is common for T-34's not just 85's but also 76's to out match and kill Tigers, Panthers ect. They shoot faster, they shoot better, and somehow they hit harder. Not to mention this game has made them harder to kill then they ever were in real life. Im talking taking direct hits fron heavy tank destroyers to their side, and still not only surviving, but being able to turn all the way around and kill that HTD before it fires again. Im talking Flak 88 guns hitting light tanks directly and not killing them. It's insane, this problem is not only found in tanks either. Maxims routinely outgun MG-42's, Russian infantry killing entire platoons worth of German infantry without taking a single casualty, while the Germans are entrenched in an Urban area, meanwhile they charge into open fields get lit up but 3 MG-42's and lose one or two guys out of 30 or 40. And no matter what side your on in single player, the AI will and does cheat. Their arty is more accurate, then yours, it can see yours, if it has a LOS on it or not, and arty in this game can wipe out entire trench lines in a few shots. All of this can be proven in one simple thing in Multiplayer. no arty sniper without direct LOS, it's absolutley insane how a game dev would think, making arty this strong, then give the AI the abbility to see everything and attack it with reason or not. Multiplayer can also show that my initial statement about this game being in the ""German bad, Russia good"" cult., oh and I should mention im talking about equipment, not ideology. Look at any competetive player, they will ALWAYS pick Russia over Germany if given the choice. Any big games? Russia almost always wins due to no matter what tanks, AT guns, strats, or choices the Germans use, the Russian stuff is so much better and cheeper they will just punch right through it. Thus making playing Germany in singleplayer or god forbid multiplayer is so intensely difficult, or even impossible, that you can no longer enjoy it. Which makes the campaigns boring since I know if the Russians attack im going to lose, not matter what, or leads to a serious shortage of good German players, since everyone who has more then 2 games of multiplayer will not play Germany unless forced. So I suggest either player the wargame series or Normandy 44, cause this game isunplayable atm

Edit: Im here to respond to most of the comments ive been getting, which are appreciated. First I will talk about why I played so much more despite my initial review saying it was unplayable. A lot of the comments made me rethink what I thought and I decided to give it another shot. And I will admit a few things I said were false. MG-42's are stronger than I made them out to be, and the AI, while it still does, does not cheat as much as I made it out to. But it also has made me realize more flaws then I did before. My intial stance on Tanks has no changed. If you think im using them wrong I will post a specific situation below and you can tell me what I did wrong.But the main other flaw I noticed was just how toxic the community is. Most players in this game will yell at you for the smallest mistakes. God forbid you tell them your new to the game, some servers will just straight up kick you if you do. Even a few of my friends have taken to mocking me for my stance on this game. You can also look to my comments on this review to prove this, people instead of responding to what I said, just say I must be bad at the game, or I suck. And you must understand this is all what I have gone through, your situation may be completly different from mine. But as far as I can tell my points of view are rather common as most of the negative reviews say similar thing as mine does. So  again I recomend not wasting your money on this game, and instead playing it's much better counter part of Normandy 44, or any installation in the Wargame saga.",1588725167,1592029621,False,79,10,0.704421699047088623,11,True,False,False

I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the wargames and even SD44, but until the devs figure something out with army general it remains near unplayable.

the biggest and really only thing holding me back from enjoying the single player experience is the non stop AI arty spam. everytime i watch my superior numers crumble because the AI micros its own arty like a computer instead of a human, and when i say computer i mean every arty team is firing thier tubes so theyre red hot at all times, on top of that they instantly know where my arty is and kills it after a couple shots.
Basically what im saying here is the singleplayer is either a viewing of my own army getting demolished by non stop arty or me calling airstrikes for the entire game just trying to take out the enemy arty. its really zero fun.
theres no big tank engagements, no blood and guts fighting over a city, no desperate defenses against a russian steamroller, its spend all game getting rekt by enemy arty, or spend all game trying to spot and bomb enemy arty.
2 ways i envision eugen fixing this without overhauling the ai.
1) put it on workshop so we can mod out the arty spam
2) do versus co-op
I love Eugen, but this game is a real piece of shit. and their neglect, at least of the singleplayer community, shows. especially since they refuse to return to airland battle SP. this will probably be the last eugen game i buy at full price.

Beautiful accurate graphics considering the massive scale of the maps, and ability to zoom so close to get personal with infantry units and back out see a battle front than spans over miles.  The mechanics have greatly been refined from Eugen's Wargame era. (can see set movement paths,give movement orders before match start, and sight lines from any position or current unit) I also enjoy the new armor system that works less like a heath bar and more realistic considering what type of gun and ammo is being used against it. They did remove fuel from logistics,ammo is still a concern, but I don't mind that at all, what with all the heavy tanks you can use. The battles can last a long time but I feel that there is never low point. It is not really a click per min game, you will need some grand strategy but micro managing tactics will really pay off. Very rewarding to work your way up the learning curve and begin taking down real players. I cant stop playing the 10v10 matches, feel like you have enough diversity and support so that no one player or shortfall of a deck will mean your teams defeat.

Might be because if you do land a multiplayer game, the only thing people end up using are elite units and artillery, because there's no need for careful use of selected units when you can rush them with artillery. Lots of artillery. Flatten the map with artillery. Please, bomb me more and bomb my artillery so I can't counter. Whoever sets up their artillery first, wins. 

They finally added destruction mode, which is like the only mode I'll happily play and is a staple of their RTS games. Before this, they only had 'conquest' (they only had one mode!!!) but they changed the name to something stupid like 'capture the flag' and I still just roll my eyes at it. 

I have to say that the ""Army General"" gameplay is very fun and very nice, but does with its ups and downs, but honestly the attention to detail and degree of realism in Army General is really good. Might be the best Grand Strategy out there, to be honest, if you don't mind the time consumption involved in massacring the AI in order to get a 0-10081237192731723 win ratio and avoid auto resolve's garbage.

Like, this is a weird mix between Men of War and Wargame, but can't decide what it wants to be. Has such great detail for zoom-in close-up micromanagement but forces you to play on a grand scale. And fast paced, too. No time to admire the small things and whatnot unless you're fighting AI, and the AI doesn't know how to avoid instantaneous death even on max difficulty.

If a DLC ""features"" a map pack, and you find it not worth your money, then you won't be able to to play with people that have it. Normally, Eugen allowed DLC and non DLC players to play together, you'd just have to play base divisions against the new ones, but now... If the host picks a DLC map, or sets the lobby map to random - you wont be allowed to join/get kicked if you're in the lobby. What are the devs they thinking?

The game is a huge grind and a lot of spam. Lots of RNG involved, and lots of hidden stats for units. Aim times, and vehicle hp are the biggest offenders.

Balance is bad - allies are struggling to kill panthers and tigers at range, to a point, where a heavy tank or two, placed on a hill, that is overlooking vital roads, can change the outcome of the game. Bad map design allows that more often than you'd think. When soviets bring out their is-2 tanks, the situation becomes reversed. Besides the rare, expensive, slow, and easily killed pak 43 at gun, and whole 2 subpar divisions with a very low amount of either king tigers or jagdpanthers, germans have nothing to deal with them. Thus the game devolves to an artillery and plane spam, as tanks have a hidden hp stat, which allows them to die to an X amount of high explosive ordnance.

Tank combat is RNG based. Supposedly tanks have no hp, but that is just another hidden stat, You roll to hit, you roll to penetrate, you roll what the penetrating shot will do. Plenty of harmless critical hits out there, which allow tanks to either fire back and kill the attacker, or safely retreat and repair, instead of dying. From time to time, the hidden hp stat will erase your shots - 100% to hit and 100% to penetrate shot will do nothing. Can be game changing - you spend an X amount of time to sneak around and set up a kill shot on that broken super heavy, you finally fire - aaaand nothing happens. Then it turns around and kills you, or safely retreats. 

Air combat is terrible. Half the time fighters just zoom around, trying to align and fail to kill the planes, while getting shot by anti air, until they panic and run away. Besides few, expensive anti air pieces, anti air is impotent - won't kill planes no matter what, unless you invest hundreds and hundreds of points for that. Competent anti air quite often is more expensive and less available than the planes. Go figure.

Division balance is non existent. Some divisions are loaded, some are seriously lacking in various areas. While some unit tabs are less important than others, some divisions have seriously impotent vital sections - almost no anti air, a very small amount of anti tank guns, only a couple of tanks, and so on. Because of that, it's possible to see the ""pros"" use the same divisions with minimal differences in tournaments and such. 

Game design itself promotes blobbing. When you are choosing units, you have to make a compromise - more available rookie troops, or a few veterans. But then the leader units come in - in a small area around them, they increase the veterancy of allied troops. Guess to what that leads...

Devs are very picky to what they respond. There are bugs on the game forums, that were reported months/multiple patches ago, with no response from them. Some of them are game breaking. Meanwhile, sometimes you spot them blabering on something as irrelevant as what books they like to read...

If you want to play solo - the ai is extremely dumb. Increasing the difficulty only gives it more units and more income to spam at you.

All in all, I can not recommend this game. No wonder, that Wargame: Red Dragon has a player base that's 2-3 times larger than this game, despite being 5 years older. Lets hope for Wargame 4.",1566441319,1591441524,False,3,0,0.556897103786468506,0,True,False,False

If you're an OG RTS gamer like me, you're probably familiar with the classic Close Combat franchise. In my opinion, this game is the first to deserve the title of spiritual successor to the Close Combat series. It's a really fun WWII RTS that does an excellent job striking the sweet spot between realism and fun. It has a great front line system that allows for cutting off of enemy troops, which reduces their combat effectiveness and makes them easier to surrender. Battles are fought over control points that correspond to militarily important features of the map. The deck building system can be intimidating at first, but once you get the concept it actually becomes a very fun feature of the game. The course of a battle is heavily influenced by what units you bring in your deck. 

If you're looking at this game thinking, ""This is just a Company of Heroes clone,"" please rest assured that it is not. The scale and scope of the battles go way beyond anything in CoH. To give you a sense of the scale, tanks can engage each other at 2000m. (A 4v4 map I would estimate at 5km x 10km.) The average deck gives you approximately 60-90 infantry units and 20-60 tanks to play with, along with a myriad of recon, support, artillery, AA, AT, and aircraft units. Air combat has been very well implemented. (Who doesn't love WWII dogfighting?!) Battles can have up to ten players on each side, which is a blast.

It is definitely different from any other strategy game I have played and I mean that in the best way and I think the developers of the game nailed the core game play of Steel Division 2. I'll say that the battles typically go on for 45 mins - 1 hour so it is hard to play more than 2-3 games at a time, but I don't really mind, but I do have some critiques...

I wish devs would have a better notification system for your units. When they're under fire or being wiped out, it would be nice to click on the notification to jump to their location to see where the action is at instead of taking the time to find it when you have 3 other skirmishes going on. 
I also wish there was more customization and I think that is where this game lacks the most. Being able to customize your army with different uniforms, colors, vehicles, or even if you could have different firearms or other changes, it would be a huge step in the right direction. I know that is asking a lot of the devs, but I think that would take this game to the next level.

Contrary to the Cold War-themed Wargame series, Steel Division 2's gameplay is a bit slower-paced, and much more tactical. Tanks are represented in a more realistic way compared to Wargame, with armour simulation on each side of the vehicle and accurate weapon penetration characteristics. 

While the core mechanics are mostly the same, Steel Division 2 uses the phase system from its predecessor, which means you have to make strategic decisions on what units you can bring in and how to use them in each phase. The combat itself is spectacular - huge, detailed and pretty maps let hundreds of units loose on helpless Eastern European villages and farms, the explosions look great, and the models look sharp and detailed even in the most zoomed-in setting, as Eugen is known for at this point.

Singleplayer also features a new addition in the form of the Army General mode, which adds a meta-game strategic layer to the tactical battles, which let you move Soviet or German divisions around in a way somewhat similar to the campaigns of the Graviteam series of games. It's a cool addition but it can be frustrating fighting with only a quarter of the units you're used to, fighting off Panzer IVs with motorcycles and infantry guns until your precious T-34s finally show up in the next phase.

The negatives are really the community. from high levels who only want to play along side other high level to the allies who sit and let all their troops die while your taking on a 2 front war. A problem you will find rampant is the sitting and defensive players who use decks that are tailored to the attacking and taking ground aspect. high level will sometime team up and bully you (especially on 10v10) while your team sits in a defensive position when they should be attacking. I honestly havent ran into many bugs and am pleasantly surprised. I love this game and the developers and have all dlc and will buy all future dlc so long as the keep doing right with this game.

Leaving my old review as it was accurate at the time. However it was accurate for the wrong reasons, so it's more of an awful warning:

""I have the recommended specs and the game simply doesn't function very well.

Starting a battle takes a few minutes (2-3 I think) which isn't too bad, though annoying.
Other than that the battle goes relatively ok. The AI is a bit weird about leaving one side of the map undefended. 
Panning/zooming sometimes lags the game several seconds which isn't great.

My main gripe: Switching out of a battle though is awful. It takes about 5 minutes (literally 300 seconds) of watching the loading screen waiting to be able to go back to the campaign map.

I switched the graphic profile to low I should add, in case that made a difference. It did not.

Quitting the game is also a pain in the ass. It takes another .. 5 minutes or so before any of my other programs starting to respond adequately. I assume it hogs resources and all of these are being reclaimed or something, I have no idea but quitting a game shouldn't make the rest of your system be unresponsive.

The developers have done a lot of research into where actual units were during the battles, which units faced off against each other and what sub-units were part of each unit.  

Some of the usage of maps is repetitive across different Army General scenarios and you do find that the AI is at times clunky when you give units orders to hunt towards an objective, they advance to contact with an enemy unit .  If the balance of forces is in your favour, the opposing unit is destroyed and then your unit doesn't resume the hunt towards the objective, it just sits there? I do also find it frustrating that when you advance multiple units, you can't put them into formations; Recce out in front, rifle sections, command teams and support weapons.  A grouping and formations button would be good and then sections/platoons could be put in formations like file, arrowhead, two platoons up or one platoon up in company formation.  The same could work for armour, artillery units, even aerial formations.  As a side note to unit formations, what generally happens is that unless you send individual sections towards individual points in what looks like a loose formation they end up huddled up into what looks like a 'kids football team' and they end up as artillery bate. My only other negative point is when you are laying out defences, there seem to be random linear areas of open terrain that you can't put defences over.  When you do lay out defences they have to be in linear form unless you allow the AI to automatically layout the defences (which are then laid out with no tactical appreciation).

On the positive side, I enjoy the blend of moving units on strategic maps and then the tactical game play.  I like the fact that Eugen also keep bringing out new maps, scenarios, units etc to keep players interested.  The graphics are good, the effects such as rifle/machine gun fire, mortar/artillery fire and rocket/air strikes are good  (especially (katyushas).

One plea to the developers, can you consider creating scenarios pre-Operation Bagration,  perhaps the Battle of Kursk or the German and Russian campaigns in Crimea.  Or even campaigns in 1945 as a magnum opus to SD2 such as Seelow Heights, the Battle for Berlin?",1589314252,1589314252,True,23,0,0.681793153285980225,0,True,False,False

However, Steel Division 2 has giant distinguishing feature - a feature one might quite literally call a game-changer: 'Smart Orders'.

This single feature cuts down on unit micro-management to a fraction of what you had to cope with in SD:44 or in Wargame, allowing you to focus on executing your overall operational plan rather than on unit-level tactics. The feature is as simple as selecting a group of units and giving them a ""Seize"" or ""Hold"" command: the AI will then take over and do its best to execute your order, freeing you to either look elsewhere or to micro-manage just key assets.

The 'Smart Orders' are a very simple feature but one that I would consider perhaps the most revolutionary change in RTS gameplay mechanics since the original C&C (1995), Ground Control (2000), and the original Wargame (2012).

'Smart Orders' can open up a whole new style of playing games like SD2, as you can now focus on commanding platoons and companies instead of individual units and squads.

###

Update 12/5/2020: After playing through two campaigns, I stand by what I wrote above about the tactical gameplay, but I have to give an update about the 'Army General' campaigns.

For starters, having truly dynamic campaigns is a great improvement. The campaign plays like a turn-based strategy game and can be enjoyable in itself even if you would auto-resolve every battle. Your moves on the campaign map can be far more consequential than anything you do on the real-time tactical battlefield.

HOWEVER, the campaigns are plagued by the game having way too few maps for the real-time battles. This severely erodes the enjoyability of actually fighting the battles yourself during the campaign. You'll find yourself playing the same map over and over and over again, even if every battle takes place in a complete different sector of the front every time. It gets boring real quick. It's so bad that I ended up auto-resolving most of my battles during the campaign and only playing myself the ones that really mattered, and even then reluctantly.

The compelete lack of randomly generated maps - and the lack of an adequate number of hand-crafted maps - is the single most fun-destroying feature of Steel Division II. I don't want to replay the same map twenty times during a single campaign.

###

TL;DR: The new 'Smart Orders' function and the dynamic campaigns are both great improvements over the first Steel Division. However the complete lack of randomly generated maps means you'll have to play the same map over and over and over again during a campaign. That kills much of the fun of actually playing the battles yourself during a long campaign. The campaign SHOULD be a tool for generating interesting battles, but instead it generates endless repetition.",1584891336,1589276928,True,25,1,0.698341548442840576,0,True,False,False

We stood at Eugen´s side during the postponement of the release date, the rumors that the studio might be out of money, a terrible Beta-phase, a release where basic stuff like tutorials were missing and yet Eugen is not capable of repairing fundamental stuff like fighters for weeks which makes the game unplayable for real and which makes the game die.

Old review:



First of all I played the beta for about 50 hours and played about 40 multiplayer matches, moreover I also played the war game series and SD Normandy 44. The maybe most important point, the gameplay, is very good. If you played Wargame or SD44 it feels like coming home. However there are quite a lots of significant and good changes so that this game feels special. 

But:

I was really shocked when I installed the release version yesterday because there are so many things missing like basic stuff.

1. No manual or tutorial:
If you played the other games before that might not be such a problem but this game has a steep learning curve and new players feel completely lost without a tutorial or manual and therefore abandon the game and SD44 already had huge problems with a very small player base making it hard to find multiplayer games from time to time 

2. No tutorial for the army general mode:
I've been playing strategy games for 20 years now. Nevertheless I had not clue what to do as the game just threw me into the mode without explaining any stuff. Fun note: as I wanted to leave he mode and pressed escape there appeared a button called ""manual"". This ""manual"" looks like a word document not helping in any way.

3. Multiplayer lobby:
Another point that has never been good at eugens games however this one here somehow managed it to make it even worse. You won't be able to find games against other players because the whole lobby is flooded with empty eugen servers games. Terrible! 

4. Then there so many other points that are just annoying like units cards missing and staring ""work in progress"", loading screens that are sometimes in French and lots of other stuff.",1561046092,1589210979,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

In the game you play as commander of a certain division, which means that you get to control a variety of different units (infantry, tanks, planes, anti-tank weaponry, recon elements, support and anti-air). This great variety only has one downside in my opinion; that the game is quite micro-intensive at first.

I also really like the abilities to change the units according to your preference in division decks and the many different maps. This allows for different strategies and greatly enhances replay-ability.

Campaign 4/5 - These are pretty intense and can be as micro or macro management as you like.

AI isn't the brightest though for better or for worse.

2 - Multiplayer Skirmishing 2/5 - This is just not designed well for the small playerbase and having a CoH2 style queueing. Really need to have everything minimized to as few choices for queueing as possible when you have a small playerbase.

Multiplayer Custom Lobbies 5/5 - This is where the game shines, getting into glorious 2v2/3v3/4v4/10v10 matches.

The Only bad thing is you need to own the first Steel Division to get the US, BRIT, FRENCH and CANADIAN divisions. 

One thing i want more of is Brit\Usa\Canadian\scottish\australian etc. Just the allies divisions in general. Also i Understand the japanese werent on the eastern front or the chinese. Any other Countries are welcome.

Pros: 
Beautiful game, epic scale, lots of modes, great historical accuracy, and a superior AI (AI has nerfed income on normal difficulty-- I play with the level playing field of 'hard' and still lose sometimes). I think this game is proof that incredibly complex systems can have competant AI.

I did not enjoy myself for some of that time because of the amount of crashes the game was experiencing, the poorly implemented and confusing campaign UI, issues with the multiplayer server browser, and some strange issues with the AI in the battle map.

After almost an additional 8 months to polish the game, and about 100 more gameplay hours into the game, I must say, it has drastically improved. The crashes that I was experiencing previously (on the same computer) are no longer occurring, and free updates have added some excellent AI sub-commands which only serve to improve game play by reducing micromanaging on large battles, but still allowing you to fine tune unit movement.

Army general campaign mode is not so full of bugs, and is actually playable now with the improved save-game capabilities and significantly less crashes to desktop/ strategic movement anomalies. balancing is also better than it was before with a rework of the costs of some of the more powerful units.

Overall, when I bought the game, I preordered and put my faith into the developers to put out a good product worthy of the legacy of their wargame series, which I felt that steel division #1 was lacking, mainly a good strategic campaign. I felt burned on release with the messy state that the game came out in, but after revisiting this game months later, I finally feel justified in my purchase, with much less frustration and much more fun and immersion. The maps can get a little repetitive, but new ones seem to come out frequently, and for free, and it gives you a chance to really learn them for competitive multiplayer.

Overall, very happy now with my game, enjoying it much more than at release time, and as their DLC has demonstrated, the devs now have made a good framework to explore other theaters of war with the addition of new factions, maps, and campaigns.

There are 4 issues:
Army General Campaign Turn Limits- I understand the desire for limiting the number of turns to reach a certain goal, but it feels like the old Panzer General games where RUSH RUSH RUSH is the only way. In fact the easiest way is just to cut off the supply and kill them or not which brings me to the next issue.

Army General AI - The AI in Army General mode is rather terrible at defending against this tactic, it simply makes no effort to protect the rear. It's all too easy on the larger maps to encircle the enemy and watch them make no real effort to get out of their situation.

Infantry in battles - These poor guys die far too easily. Apparently I can see a 2 man bazooka team at 1500 (feet or metres?) in rough hilly terrain. Also, this terrain, or any terrain for that matter doesn't protect infantry from being shot rather easily. In essence this means the infantry are not trying to take cover in little dips and troughs of the landscape, or using longer grass to remain concealed, or hiding on the floor of a building that's being shot at. Infantry should be harder to kill so they can be at least a little more useful.

Single Player Battle Timer - The main issue for me is the limited amount of time available in each battle to take half the battlefield before the defeat timer starts to take victory ticks off the enemy instead of you. Just played a game against an entrenched enemy that ended with a minor defeat after just 13 minutes. It's not enough time to even move the infantry far enough into the map to take enough objectives to slow down the timer! Infantry are rather easy to kill so they are constantly having to be replaced by new squads which pauses the attacks.

It can be a fun game for sure, which is why I have 214 hours on record. These issues are quite frustrating though.",1584732351,1584732351,False,29,3,0.700287520885467529,0,True,False,False

Good tutorials on the tactical and the strategic aspects, yes you get both; tactical battles either in skirmish, historical or campaign modes, then on top of all this is the General mode in which you play turn based on a large map of Belarus, moving your detailed units ranging from recce battalions right up to air support groups. When you engage an enemy in battle then you have the option to fight the battle on the tactical map or auto-resolve it. This is  a great and unexpected feature, and it's nice to be an armchair general governing the war!
The devs have gone to enormous lengths to make the game historically accurate and even the most demanding grognard should be happy with the result. OOB's are spot on and very detailed with full equipment lists etc. Just about every unit that served in Bagration on both sides is present, and if you own SD1 Normandy you can even export those units into this game as well for free.
The graphics are outstanding and the fighting down on the ground and up close when you zoom in looks very convincing - you'll take a lot of screenshots! I like the phases system where you start a battle with just recce and scouts troops, before gradually going through the phases until you can bring in your heavy hitters, the same with the enemy. This is all about mastering combined arms warfare WW2 style and get that right and you will win. Start off slowly though with small skirmishes against easy ai and use the pause and slow keys a lot, because the ai is very powerful and a real challenge to master.

The biggest problem I had with those games were the literally overwhelming complexity...  So what if I forget to move this two-man LMG section?  I've been micromanaging this infantry company all day.  What do I do with the trucks?  Argh!

But, this game is built upon the earlier games' shoulders.  So much is streamlined and simplified:  Starting deployments can be done automatically!  You can move entire blocks of troops and they'll pick the best routing automatically!  If they're under fire, they'll move to a better position and wait for things to improve, after which they'll resume their former mission.

So now that so much is streamlined, they can add even *more* complexity and it doesn't hurt.  Now there's a whole ""higher level"" campaign game (General mode) where you move your battalions around on a large scale map, covering many dozens of kilometers.  Much like Chess, but on the Eastern Front.  Many of these battle functions (movement and fire) are handled automatically.  When it's time to actually fight, you move to the ""zoomed in"" detail map, where you can see all the units making up your battalions, down to the last vehicle and even individual soldiers.  

One ""new"" idea I've not seen before, but really like, is the idea of drawing an ever-shifting dividing line between your forces (areas they control) and the enemy's.  There's something about this that just works, is very satisfying, and indeed it's all about control of territory, that's how you ""win.""  Losses of units is secondary; victory is everything.

Now, such a very ambitious and well put together game should have its issues.  Some complain of bugs, but for a game of this level of complexity, it's a wonder it works as well as it does.

The game is very in depth and historically accurate to the point you don't sacrifice gameplay, it is pretty well balanced. 
The engine is amazing, runs fast and has insane level of detail. Very strong point is the AI of units, if you manage to set them in proper mode. You can dedicate the micromanagement to AI, so they attack or defend in sensible manner. Units will advance forward, using cover, appropriate munition, strategic points, landscape etc. 
When set to defensive mode find good ambush points, relocating if enemy pushes forward too much, try to avoid artillery fire, not just stand in one place until they are completely obliterated. 
The building of Battlegroups is also well done, allowing lot of interesting setups. Overall the variety and replayability is great. 
It is somehow 'milkyouontheDLCs' model, but even with the base the game is compltete, DLCs only introducing new units. It is not on the level of Paradox games, where if you wnat to enjoy it, you have to pay shitton for DLC. 
The campaigns offer great challenge and are nice addition to single player.

1) AI is the worst. It really, really is as bad as it possibly could be. It just spams units mindlessly at you. No exceptions. It will drive with its tanks right into your AT, it will use its planes to fly and die to your AA. If you're here for single player experience - avoid that game. I've played many 1v1 games with AI in which I saw like 10 AI units. It was not defending any flags, just driving around. It's just pointless.
2) Now all divisions are pretty much the same in multiplayer (apart from like... 3 of them?) Yeah sure, you get like 5 units that are different in every one, but apart from that they're the same. The same infantry, same tanks, just nothing new. You're here for some interesting and different gameplay of 16th Luftwaffe, or 1st SSB from SD:Normandy 44? Well... you're getting none of that.
3) There are no significant differences between phases any more. You can get your IS2 or tiger in phase A right at the start of the game. Only thing that changes is the amount of them that you can bring - this applies to most units. This is really unfortunate as phases provided a very diverse experience in SD Normandy 44. Now they're basically gone.
4) Scale of the conflict is too big. Seriously, how are you supposed to micro 15 tanks, change their ammo type, micro your 10 artillery pieces and 40 infantry squads? And you absolutely need to babysit everything, because default unit behaviour is just pathetic. I've watched many times my AT guns using their precious APCR ammo blowing up trucks, my tanks firing at infantry squads while being hammered to death by enemy AT guns. It's not funny. To help you with that developers introduced so called 'smart orders'.... yea.... so now you can let AI take care of some of your units completely. Great. See point 1) of the review....

I could write more things here, but I think that it's time to stop now. I've installed and uninstalled this game 3 times trying to love it, but I can't. Just avoid this title and don't waste your time.",1581780284,1581780284,False,37,1,0.680806517601013184,0,True,False,False

My RTS experiences are from Graviteam Tactics games, so my expectations for realism and historical accuracy are pretty high. After playing Steel Division 2, I can see that Eugen has finally done it: a combination of realistic and fun gameplay. For someone coming from ""lighter"" RTS games, it may feel ruthless, but it is far from GT's kick-into-balls ruthlessness. SD2 is challenging, but also rewards the one who is humble enough to learn. Smart orders lessen the click-fest and micro, and with right combination of troops, arty and support, one can actually rely on Seize command and concentrate on bigger picture. It isn't perfect, though, and it might require a little tweaking with tanks (the sight when 10 tanks stop to fire a single AT gun brokes my heart) and not always as smart as in some games (*cough* GT *cough* Command Ops *cough*). But the game is still under development cycle and future patches may cure some tweaks.

5.  Everything takes a little bit longer to die.  You have time to react.

Campaign in Army General mode is just awesome, and coop scenario and other improvements (playing soviet for example) made this sequel very interresting.

If u were ok with the controls in SD 1 (compared to Wargame RD), then you will love this one.

If i had to mention downside or issues, then i would point units controls and behaviors in tactical scale, that still too far from WRD.. i mean too arcadish compared to WRD accuracy.

That was the bright side.. On the downside, battles on the field are still as bad and not enjoyable as they were in the 1st one. audio is awfull, all u hear during all the game is engine noise (and bad ones), tank guns are 4x quieter than engine now ?

I'm also unsure about the phase system. I'm not a big fan either about the suppression system that replace healthbar.

I really tryed to like this game, but it's not the Wargame feeling.

You deploy different units, take cover in trenches and houses and fight to capture flags that are placed throughout the map. The more flags you control, the quicker the match will end and you will destroy or route the enemy. The enemy is the only real issue I have.

I have only about 20 hours in the game whic means im not decent enough to get deep into the meta, or spot flaws within balance or units. Im barely experiment with the game had a dozens of multiplayer match. So take the review with a grain of salt.

About ten years ago i discovered combat mission the new but the old operation bagrattaion one. It was summer so put my desk out in the yard grabed some beer and smoke then played various scenarios of the east front. It was a suprise after all the movies i saw how this machines and units acted, they shooted eachother from 1,5km away mostly missing the target and even when hit occoured it may banced of or do some nuanced damaged like sight or track damage. It was strange, mostly becouse what i saw in the movies was very different. So i started to read stuff looking up stuff on the internet and to my wonder the game was actually very authentic. There was many occasion when tank shooted eachother form kilometers doing minimal damage until one of the machine was become inoperable or the crew just couldn't handle the stress and bailed. 
So time past on and combat mission evolved into modern game, still gimmicky and niche but it was modernized. I played the demo of battle of bulge expansion (thats not the real title) and was suprised how easily side shooting my sherman the enemy tiger down the valley. I was like wtf? Then cheked distance and it all made sense. 600meter side shot was all that it took to destroy the dreaded beast.
Time goes by and i fund this game called ruse, marketing got me on that one with the two guys at the table playing eachother out. I bought it and feeled just strange, there was no real tactical element in it. It was strategy to the core. I dont realy liked that game bur the zooming thing was amezed me.
Time goes by again and came europian escalation the real deal, where total war and modern warfare collide.
I was hooked and with every new installment the gameplay become better and better.

And than came SD:44 and i was like what? What is that paint like graphic what is with the scale? Everything seened small and lackluster. Until i played a dozen hours and realized that this game is closer to the old combat mission games then anything else. Its like chess, slow but not boring, you always have to think what is your next plan. Sadly the community left the game very quickly so i couldnt realy get the full experience.

And now that all that shit said and your still reading this i can tell you that steel division 2 is combat mission operation bagration in 2019. Its has the same feeling, the same tacics, the long shoot outs form km-es the brutal town fights where units got chowed up, the overwhelming artiery barrages. 

Many people whine about the so called Spam. The reason is that 44 was small scale tactical game. Every unit has value. Here single units not as usefulls as platoons and companys of units. And guess what. Thats totally cool. This is how things worked in the eastern front, they dont toyed with a single panther, they used them in platoons. They dont send in  two engineer team to blow up the mg nest. They attaked with a full platton consisting riflesquads lmgs mortars enginers. 
I know many people get ovewhelmed by this, and got annoyed by the slow pace that the game has over Red Dragon. But this is WW2 and its WW2 at its best. You can play Tank warfare 1942 and you will see the same scenarios except even slower. And without multi.

Now im not gonna lie, probably there is issues with this game as well, and after i hit 300 hours with it, i will reevaulate my opinionon this game. But righ now its ww 2 on a regimental level wich is awesome.",1578436573,1578436573,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've tried to play entries in the Wargame franchise before and found them to be way too fast paced and arcadey. 

Steel Division 2 actually feels like a solid tactical experience where position, troop composition, preparation, and common sense matter.

The AI also seems to be very capable of fighting back against the players in most situations, though they have particular trouble attacking in breakthrough mode (I'd recommend setting them to higher difficulty so they get bonuses in that situation).

The unit modeling is great, although infantry faces remind me of something directly out of a Nintendo 64 game with the way the faces look like pictures of faces just stretched over a nearly flat head model. Given that you'll only be seeing infantry faces during division construction though, I can give that a pass.
The tank and aircraft models are all very well detailed.

#1 - The pacing is way, way too fast. As in: on Normal play speed, you get only a second or two of notification when a unit is destroyed, under-fire, etc. You at least can slow it down in-game in single-player, or even pause it outright... but the pacing on Normal speed is way too fast with all that you have to micro.

#2 - There's quite a lot to micro. And to be honest, the worst micro-ing is just for line-of-sight... if you play with the camera high up, to see as much of the battlefield as possible, you often lose perspective and don't see elevation well. Now, you can use hotkey commands to get LoS on screen in a more informative manner (LoS relative to the position the cursor is on). But when there's so much else to micro, this becomes a real mess. 

#3 - Unit info is not at all intuitive. This is not helped by many units having their official military designation as written in their native language at the time of World War 2. While this may thrill purists looking for authenticity, it's a hindrance if you don't already have familiarity with a lot of small World War 2 details. Units do have icons, but even the icons don't always help to sort things out... infantry-class units that have anti-tank weapons all have the same icon designation, whether their AT weapon is a simple AT grenade or a longer ranged anti-tank rifle or a bazooka-style weapon. Things like that may seem trivial, but there's a huge difference on range and how much armor each can pierce.

The game itself is, I think, really well done. And again, a lot of work went into naming units what their own military called them, and the game mechanics themselves are solid  enough.

I recommend it, but the learning curve is quite steep, and the pace is problematically fast at times (which is why it can degenerate into unit-spam, especially on certain maps).",1575571523,1577842620,True,4,0,0.57238394021987915,0,True,False,False

- Ai might be stubborn sometimes. For example, i order a tank to turn to an azimut and he turns back when he see a target.
- DLCs stuff, some different divisions are locked if you did not buy the DLCs

TLDR: Better than 44? Very yes. Same as RD? Similar. Just like CoH2? No.

For newcommers: Steel Division 2 is a mostly historically accurate game with a great deal of realism in it. It is a bit difficult to pick up & learn, but it's game mechanics are deep & rewarding once you learn it. I heard they actually bothered putting in tutorials now, oh should we be so lucky to have such benevolent French (extra terrestrial) developers.

One thing you might be surprised by at first when playing this game is that the AI is actually fairly competent. It doesn't rely on cheap bonuses & handicaps, it simply plays well, most of the time.

Artillery is kinda OP when you're a noob & air is pretty much useless or very effective depending on how much AA is in the area. A few infantry units are a waste of points as well, tough most are not. Otherwise I'd say it's a pretty well balanced game.

Everything is a threat to everything on some level if used properly. If not in outright stopping power, then in suppressive capabilities. Except for AT-less infantry & vehicles with weak suppression, which tend to be quite cheap instead.

There are all sorts of terrain features & sight-line blockers in the maps, making natural choke-points & over-watch locations. This fits well with the 2km-reaching guns in this game & wide array of vehicles of varying armour & gun values, making certain units excel at certain roles.

If you're used to Red Dragon or the Wargame franchise in general, this is fairly similar, but with a few staggering improvements: There is only one super-heavy tank in the game: King Tiger & there is like 1 division that can field it. There are no sniper-jets or sniper-AAs or such bullshit units, so no killing stuff in one hit across half the map. Infantry don't immediately melt when hit by literally anything. Infantry is cheaper in general as well as have stronger yet shorter range AT. Low cost units aren't complete trash that is only good for getting shot at. Dedicated AT is actually dangerous. Air units, barring the scouts, can't detect units on their own. Flamethrowers actually kill things. Artillery actually kills things. Despite being set in a supposedly more sparse environment than in most RD maps, the maps are still more detailed, have much more height variety & lack the gigantic plains of nothing that is characteristic of RD maps. No more conquering zones with command units. The commanders now give bonuses to near-by & radio-linked troops instead & there are now also officer units that do the same.

So what's bad in SD2? The lines on the map warns you about pushes & unit concentrations. On rare occasion you can penetrate a single unit multiple times without doing any crippling damage. What is the purpose of SMGs in this game? Infantry AT is too accurate & quick-firing at max range. AA & aircrafts are both too strong, creating a all or nothing situation in many cases. Artillery spam is annoying, but ultimately too expensive in most cases & leads to a frustrating win for the receiver. What is the point of C rated divisions? I have yet to find a use for military police besides as weak rapid response team. Taking over arbitrary points on the map is kinda gamey & sometimes frustrating depending on the circumstances.

Over-all I quite like this game. It got some flaws, but I think it's the best Eugen put out so far & is a massive improvement over the bocage RNG AA-dominated hell that was 44.",1577646189,1577646189,True,42,3,0.740312516689300537,0,True,False,False

Good Graphics
Shows the Eastern Front which isn't talked about in the media and in most popular WW2 games

Challenging
Tutorial added
Active developers

Cons:
Limited singleplayer so if you really want to play hours on end of singleplayer after you finish all campaigns, it'd be difficult, however that will change in the future
While it is possible to learn the mechanics, it does take alot of time. I have 21 hours in the game and I haven't learned all of it

Overall, despite then number of cons, I do like this game because it is still in its early stages so I won't judge it too harshly and I will give the developers time to well, develop the game further.

You know, I've been playing Eugen games since RUSE. I thought RUSE reminded me of Command and Conquer, a game of the golden age of RTS's. I waited patiently through Wargame ALB, EE, and RD. Played all of them, but I never felt like the campaign was fully fleshed out. Red Dragon almost had it, but I only wished for more of them. I felt like Steel Division: Normandy 44 was a decent game, but I never felt like it had the charm that Red Dragon did. Battles felt extremely slow paced, the campaign felt like it was ported straight from a skirmish v. AI battle at some points.

So I went into this game with skepticism. I didn't know what Eugen was going to do with the Eastern Front, but I decided to try it out. 

SD2 has fixed almost all of my previous complaints. The Army General mode has accomplished what I have been craving all this time: a fully fleshed out, open world battlefield. Individual battalions can encircle other battalions, breaking through a fortified line is hard, but so is clinging onto that same line as a defender. Carefully moving your shock troops through the city while trying to manage a tank duel on the other side of the map fills every second of the battles, and nothing is more satisfying than forcing a defeat upon a superior enemy. This is Wargame in WW2 how it was meant to be.

But I do have my complaints. The AI in each battle and on the campaign map is extremely predictable after about 20 hours of gameplay. The battles, as fun as they are, depend on a frontline system which needs to be improved badly. Recon battalions only have a handful of troops which can ""hold"" a frontline, meaning if you surround one Platoon leader with 20 recon tanks, the frontline in that area will belong to the enemy. The time constraint in the breakthrough mode is far too short for any decisive battle to take place- it is oppressively game ruining sometimes.

Put differently, completely awesome, this game. 


Absolutely gorgeous graphics.... without exaggeration this is the most realistic and visually pleasing game I've ever had the pleasure of playing or even seeing. The ability to zoom into closeup where faces of the soldiers are visible, from a birdseye tactical overview of the entire battlefield, is particularly awesome. Although I'm personally more inclined towards strategic games like HOI4 or HOI3 none of my favourite such games has anything like the visual and realistic experience seen in the tactical SD1 or SD2. The problem of essentially any strategic game I've seen is its inability to really make the player 'believe' the simulation... the level of abstraction is just too high... but SD1 and SD2 really do place you on the battlefield. Think if the strategic games would actually allow you to enjoy the Tiger tanks you've gone through all this trouble of researching, organizing into an appropriate divisional template and then train crews for and produce in sufficient quantity as well as transport to the front. The SD1 and SD2 game systems would easily lend themselves to being made entirely consistent with the equipment production in HOI4 a game which moreover has battle-resolution as its absolute weakest link. 

In addition to a white christmas, I'm also dreaming about putting together a HOI4 mod which would have the exact equipment object model and hierarchy as that in SD2 (at least for the German and Soviet units). This would make a HOI4 battle easily reflected in a SD2 tactical battle.

The strategic warefare capabilities offered as the main augmentation between SD1 and SD2 is fantastic. But to be honest, rather than 'strategic' I'd call it 'operational' because it only covers the Bagration offensive in the east... essentially it is an 'operational-echelon' game-let which is surprisingly fun to play and offers some nifty brain teasers... the tactical battle simulation is in an entirely different league. It like comparing the boardgame Risk with the Civilisation computer game.... no offense to Risk but the tactical-echelon ""Steel Division"" game is truly mindblowing and deserves to be liberated from any critical comments anyone might have about the operational-echelon game.

Since Paradox actually publishes both HOI4 and SD2..... you guys at Eugen and Paradox Interactive should joinly put together a strategic layer on SD2 (or a battle resolution capability to HOI4 depending on how you view it). In my dreams.

It also tries to be realistic but with some limitations (the battles happen much faster than they would in real world). We have plenty of different units. Different types of infantry, tanks, anti-tanks, artillery and air units. Armoured units don't have a healthbar - like in real life when hit it either explodes immediately or nothing happens. The game will roll a dice of course but taking into account distance, caliber, thickness of armour etc. Basic strategies work as intended - armour is strong in open field, but often lacks vision. Infantry becomes much stronger in towns and forests. What might be a bit overwhelming is the size of the battlefield and how fast everything happens. At some stage in bigger battles we take more time micromanaging than actually planning strategy. But it's a RTS so what one would expect? Luckily developers gave some smart orders for us to help and in campaign mode we can give some units to the AI.

The game was designed mostly for multiplayer but developers gave us also really amazing single player campaign. Instead of designing pre-made missions we have a strategic map, in which we move units (mostly brigade or regiment sized) in turn based manner. When a fight starts we can assign up to 3 units and then play it on the tactical level. This is really amazing as we can craft the battles the way we want them. Maps assigned to the battle are chosen according to the terrain which we could expect. Unfortunately they quite often repeat. Devs could have designed more of them. Still every battle is different because of different units taking part and it works really well. We can also skip the battlers which we predict to be boring (when fighting forces are uneven).

To summarize - this is a nice tactical RTS. Maybe not as realistic as good old Close Combat, but it happens on much larger scale. It is also beautiful and the whole tactical map can be zoomed to a level when it looks like an FPS. And it still looks nice. It's good for multiplayer, but the single player campaign is amazing and can give hundreds of hours of gameplay. Highly recommended.",1573932077,1575113209,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Single player experience feels nothing more than an afterthought. There is an imbalanced Grand Campaing with little to no replayability and an AI that cheats like hell. 

As for the gameplay, there is no such thing as realistic balistics or unit behavior: it is simple rock-paper-scissor. Flanking, maneuvering, covering fire simply don't work. An anti tank cannon will always beat a tank (or 6 tanks, for what it matters). A machine gun will always beat infantry (or 3 squads of infantry). Also, the huge scale of the maps and size of battles make for the use of tactics pretty pointless: it's all about tanks and artillary.

What it urgently needs is 1- a lot more control over the skirmish games, 2- a better AI that doesn't cheat so much and 3- an AI that doesn't abuse artillery or at least an option for players to make that part of the AI's behavior.

Bonus idea: Add an AI-playstyle like the one in R.U.S.E. where we could set that behavior.

1- The skirmish mode is limited in such a way that I run out of troops and/or never reach past a few minutes in phase C before the game ends and I'm not a novice player, I've played every game in this series. What I want is hours-long conflicts instead of a 25-minutes taste of a game.
2- The AI cheats so badly that one time, it just ran 2 units zigzaging right out of reach between all my units all the way to the other end of the map.
3- I saw in the forums some arguing that artillery was heavily used in WWII so it's historically accurate but historically, artillery wasn't near that good at hitting anything, let alone kill 4 units with 3 volleys. That's just impossible.

Honestly, it feels like even after a 6-months delay that game was rushed out, untested, not calibrated, with half-coded AI and lacking the very basics of options. If they're going to release an incomplete game and develop it as we go I'd have it for $20 and be glad to help with feedback but to pay a AAA price and wait 6 months of delays then, probably another 6 months for it to be optimized to be able to play it as I would like to?

The game started without a functioning tutorial, but this has since been added anyway; it is certainly no luxury with a rather complex game like this!

If you've played WW2 RTS games before the battles themselves should be relatively straightforward though; veterans of the Close Combat series will feel right at home! The biggest difference is the battles being made up of three phases.
The battlegroup composer is a bit trickier; I recommend to use the ""auto-fill"" feature and subsequently changing things up to personal preference. It's best to try out your battlegroups against the AI, that way you can get a better feel for the things you want to change up (units you never use, units you need more of at an earlier phase, etc.). If you want a unit to be availabe during an earlier phase, or if you want it to be on higher veterancy, you can't field as much as them otherwise though!

As someone that focuses on single player, I find this area somewhat lacking.  While I appreciate the fact that the campaign focuses on a specific operational time period during the late war, I can't help but feel like the campaign is a bit... meh.  All the battles start to bleed into each other and the maps are very similar.  It's a nifty idea, and at the grand level things work well, but when you start grinding out battle after battle on maps that after a while seem indistinguishable, the temptation is strong to simply auto-complete, which is never a good thing.

On the bright side, the unit variety is very good and seems to be fairly complete.  The level of detail on each model is good, though not ""insane"" as in some other WWII games (which makes since considering the scale of battle).  

One of the things that might help the game out would be the inclusion of battles and events that took place outside of the geographic area the campaign restricts you to.  It might also help to expand on the historical battles mod and include important battles from throughout the war on the Eastern Front (perhaps in an expansion).  Also, including destructible elements like bridges and create tank trenches and mine fields would be a welcome addition, changing to map dynamics drastically and (for the Germans) be more in-line with a defensive war.

Unit balancing is something they are constantly working on, which is greatly appreciated since (right from the Beta) various units seem to be completely out classed or certain types of units seem to be too plentiful for your opposition.

Would I buy it again as a player interested in single campaign, skirmish, and historical battles...... Yes... on sale.

Instead what I got was an RTS version of “whack-a-mole,” where you simply try to outspam your opponent. Strategy was essentially thrown out the window, as I would watch brand new players handily defeat high level players with amazing strategies such as “I bought more artillery than you so I win.” That’s a favorite strategy.
Another great one is calling more heavy tanks than existed in all of WW2.
No rarity system, so feel free to call in dozens of Tigers at a time.
You’ll get some great 10v10 action, when half the teams went all artillery so everyone just bombs empty flags because they assume enemy troops are there, but no one would know because the only units on the field are heavy artillery and some asshole who doesn’t know how to play so he placed 14 AT guns behind a forest with no LoS.

But you might say  “Well at least you can still set up clever ambushes, and catch those tank spams off guard.” Well… no. Because The moment one of your AT guns sees a tank, the literal second… the tank magically sees you, too. When your opponent spams tanks, a great strategy is to spam planes. But then he’ll spam AA so you need to spam Arty. Then he’ll spam arty to kill your arty, so then you’ll both be moving back and forth, support trucks in tow, in an elegantly boring dance of death, waiting to see whose artillery RNG causes the most damage. Once that exhilarating artillery exchange is over, everyone goes back to spamming whatever unit they were spamming before. How thrilling!

The first expansion pack adds another third-tier campaign window. My favorite troops - the hungarians, are almost trapped with an MP-44 toting army of fresh recruits given great weapons and their veteran allies given the precious G43.

In the campaign, you'll fight to ensure minimal losses - particularly in armor such as Panther, Tiger, Marder - in order to have an asset ready when the Soviet army hammers down on the line with up-gunned T34 & Sherman tanks. Only in desperation will I field the coveted Panzer4 regiments against overwhelming numbers of armor after destroying thousands of Red riflemen.

I like strategy games  and this one is by far one of the BEST strategy games i have played in many many years.
Steel division 2 Generals Campaigns are really great. You can under stand how the Third Reich moved flags around the maps with out knowing the units & Battalions no longer existed. Its so good to be able to participate in history. Even though we know the how it ends. Quick orders cuts down the need to micro manage  units on the maps. meaning you can leave a few on auto pilot while you face the immediate threat.

I may re look at SD 1 now.

It brings back a lot of the elements of Red Dragon while keeping some of the newer interesting elements. I don't know why I love Red Dragon so much but this game recaptures some of the magic. This game feels more focused on the basic tactics. In general this game is less punishing of mistakes. A unit might be able to retreat and survive an ambush instead of being destroyed. This can also be annoying because you did everything right and got the drop on a unit or a rush, but some of the units retreated and are not dead. If you chase them you'll probably walk into an ambush. One difference is the planes seem weaker and less effective, and AA is not radar based so no more micromanging!

The AI in this game is slightly smarter, they post their anti-tank and machine guns with good sightlines for an ambush, instead of rushing one lane like in red dragon. In Red Dragon it felt like Eugen completely gave up on improving the AI. While its hard to do right, they do seem to be improving it.  I like the smart orders because you can leverage AI for some of the micromanagey tasks. Thats especially nice if you are fighting AI because you can keep up with its grindfest. I do wish there were more things that could be automated. For example a fire and move for artillery and AA.

The AI is better and that's good, but where previous Eugen products shined was in the multiplayer. I had so much fun in multiplayer in the past (and frustration) and I hope to do the same here. Unfortunately the player base is not very large. The 10v10 tacticals are usually empty at night in PST and since I'm new I'm not ready for a 1v1 or a 2v2.

One thing the game does well is representing the utility of all kinds of units in warfare, essentially all kinds of units, even the oddest ones, have uses and can often be deployed in an efficent manner.

It is a massive improvement compared to Steel Division 1944, and has great diverse maps, and a much larger scale. The Army General mode is also really cool for people who like Grand Strategy, and it can be fought in auto-resolve mode if you aren't the kind of player who likes/can handle the tactical game play. 

The multiplayer is really fun if you have a group of friends who you can play with, and you can experience large-scale, realistic World War 2 conflict that takes place over hundred's of square kilometers, where you have to deal with resupply, artillery fire, and air combat to help your ground troops push the front line back and seize control of objectives that dot the map. There are several different game modes, starting set ups, and customization options for the resources available to the players. You have access to numerous real historical divisions that you can custom make ""decks"" with that you can use in multiplayer or skirmish mode games, and its fun to have personalized decks that play to your fighting style. If you can find a few friends, you can even custom build decks to work together, and you can play against the AI too if fighting humans sounds scary.

If you haven't played a Eugen game before, I will say that this game is rather difficult for new players, and it has a relatively high learning curve (at least in the tactical battles.) It took me a long time back in Wargame European Escalation to get decent enough at beating the AI, and when I first played multiplayer in Air Land Battle my friends and I who had gotten cocky beating the AI, got defeated the first thirty or so games we played online.

TL;DR get Men of war assault squad 2 , why not perfect I can accept and not get mad when my tank gets one shotted by a weaker tank because it shot me in the ass straight into my engine block. Hell get Company of Heroes 2 if you want an Arcade WW2 RTS disguised as realistic strategy. Both are much better time killers.

Pro

Graphics , models and maps are nice 

cons 

Arcade style combat pretending to be realistic

AI dumps all their points straight away and just zerg rushes the map which means you cant play a small strike force to cut off their Arty because chances are your main forces will be overwhelmed because you were not concentrating on holding back the horde.

AI magically knows where to Air strike and arty even at reserve forces near your side of the board that are no where near combat and are hiding in the forest playing with the rocks.

defending towns is a nightmare as they will zerg rush tanks through your AT line and then Air strike you and Arty you and ignore any forces you have flanking them.

Attacking towns is a nightmare as it feels like the AI just grabs a random assortment of units and clicks attack move on the town so when you get to the town center ""SURPRISE"" there are like 4 tanks sitting there in some weird ass formation just minding their business with a few AA guns and infantry 

Friendly AI is useless as they  just like the Enemy AI zerg rush and dont compliment each others forces ""whats that Jusef is taking this forest with his infantry , well I know that there is an enemy squad in there some where so let me ARTY THE WHOLE THING"" 

Multiplayer on this developers games come in two varieties genuinely nice people who want to have a good game and asshatss who use op or cheese decks because fun isnt the point , winning is. I suggest getting this game is you have friends who also like this type of game.

*Typical RTS problem that is maximized in this game. Even though the scope is grand and ambitious, the maps are frankly just too large. You cannot micromanage well enough against an AI opponent who can move all his forces at once across such a vast landscape.

*Infantry is near useless as compared to Wargame where it takes a vital and primary role. They seem to be only effective in towns, but on the Russian border in 1944, those are few are far between obviously.

*Playing off the previous point, if you place infantry/artillery/officers in a wooded area, either on the line or behind it where it is hidden, the AI will drive/fly directly to destroy them.

*Defeating large amounts of enemy forces doesn't pay off well. Ultimately victory is based off the insignificant goal of holding ""flags"" for a limited amount of time. Realistically, if you held one ""flag"" but destroyed 99% of the enemy force before retreating, wouldn't that engagement be in your favor? Not in Steel Division it wouldn't. You would have a total defeat, where even if 99% of your men survived the engagement, all of them would be instantly destroyed at the end of the battle because the AI was able to drive a truckload of men over a flag.

Maybe if modding was activated in this game, some of the players that actually experience these flaws could act on them. But alas, it is disabled, and what little modding Eugen has ever allowed tends to be minimal.",1572271273,1572271273,False,27,3,0.55846017599105835,5,True,False,False

The new smart orders feature seems to have addressed my concerns. Therefor, I'm giving this game a giant thumps up :).

It's actually a lot more playable now that you don't have to micromanage everything and instead focus and play how you want. I'd much rather focus my time on strong points and not worry about managing all the small skirmishes. Granted ignoring it completely can lead to a relatively stable flank from being overrun, but at least the AI can put up a competent defense so they can hold the line until I notice.

----------------

So, I like this game, however, the artillery (not infantry guns) sniping is insane at the moment. The ai uses artillery with deadly efficiency. Before I bought the game I was like, ""nah, those reviewers don't like the historical aspect of it"", but after playing it for a few hours, it's extremely annoying to have awesome battles going on, but the artillery just wrecks you before you can react because of the size of the maps. To make matters worse, the ai will counter your artillery attacks. You'll address a problem on one side of the map for a minute and go back to your artillery and they're being bombed.

I have a balance suggestion to the devs. Make line of site for artillery limited to a dedicated troop type aka ""Spotter"" teams under the recon class that ARE the line of site for artillery and/or add a feature that allows a player to have the ai take control of your artillery. Unless this is balanced the game will not be fun. 

At the moment I've resorted to sticking to skirmish mode and creating division templates with VERY little artillery.

If the devs decide to do something positive about the artillery situation, I would recommend this game for anyone who liked Eugen Systems previous games and WW2 RTS/Strategy fans.",1562467273,1571591266,True,0,0,0.793316841125488281,2,True,False,False

This is by far the best WW2 RTS game for PC. The level of realism is unparalleled. Models and effects are exceptional. I have been playing war games since commodore 64 era and I must admit that SD2 is a turning point in the history of WW2 RTS games. You can command an infantry squad or a whole infantry platoon or even company. You can assemble a panzer battalion with full air and artillery support and experience all the challenges of real warfare. If you like this level of realism and  a simulation of WW2 warfare, this is a game for you. You need a lot of information about specific units capabilities and weakness to use them with success in the game. There is no normalization of units like other WW2 RTS games. If you send a platoon of T-34s to face a squad of well positioned Tigers, all your tanks will be wiped out in few minutes and this was reality back in WW2. You need to know basic infantry and tank fighting tactics, you need to know how to use terrain, line of sight ,logistics, artillery fire and air support. 
I personally have been waiting for such a game for many years , and I am glad to see SD2 in my steam library.

So talking of Army Generals, 

 * Too ""Historically"" accurate... I wander what is the point of fighting a war when you already know it was won or lost... so Instead letting you to choose where your divisions are going to be in the battlefield, you start with a lot of them scattered across the front... so you end up fighting battles against an AI with Air superiority and you don't having nothing to defend against planes... so you can just watch how the AI bombs your soldiers and you cannot do anything... nice game... yes...
 * You don't have victorious scenarios for Germany... so if you want o play as Germany, you have to play a lost scenario... What is the point??? totally incomplete game you have 2 option of the 4 you should have (Play as winning Germany, Play as losing Germany, Play as Winning Soviets, Play as loosing Soviets)
 * Battlefields are so big and AI sucks so much that you cannot play the game at normal speed... if you rely on AI your soldiers die.... if you want to control everything you end up playing at super slow speed because is impossible to control everything at real time.
 * Battles are too many and too repetitive... I spend several hour playing the same battles over and over again... I had like 3 or 4 battles per turn... over and over again... I was not able to reach the 2nd day of the campaign without getting tired of doing the same all the time, (At slow speed...)
 * Today I tested the Smart Orders for the first time... the first action taken by the soldiers I assigned to hold position was to run away to the open and die... very smart... yes...
 * The order of chronology do not match the order of difficulty... ok, if you want to follow the chronology and is the first time you play, you have to go against hardest mode... yes.. perfect...

For me this game feels like a big set of predefined battles, there is no strategy in this, just hit play and do what is already defined... you cannot choose... You start the campaign, you have to deal with 2 or 3 battles in a very bad situation until you can finally start moving some divisions... but what you can do is very limited so you end up again fighting those very same battles over and over again...",1566596969,1571514108,False,7,2,0.502385079860687256,0,True,False,False

This game is for a niche player, which accounts for the low MP player base, but hits the bulls-eye for that niche player. The single player, and to an extent multiplayer, sits right in a weird sweet spot amalgamation of fast paced RTS. tactical RTS, and operational level wargame sim. 

For some wargamer/RTS player looking for a way to experience operational level warfare in a game with nice graphics, with ability to go into actual battles you maneuver into, I recommend for Army General campaigns.

There's definite improvement to some of the game mechanics, but the range extension on all guns and the relative small scale of the maps (ranges have basically doubled on tanks and at guns, but the maps are only slightly bigger than SD1) leads to a meat grinder spamfest with little tactical maneuver that turns most games into a war of attrition. This in turn makes the game boring to play. 

The deck builder has become a compromise between Wargame and SD1 and this in turn causes it to suffer. There are no unique divisions anymore, they're all copy-pasted from one another with slightly different units in a few places. For example, 29th Tank Corps and 3rd Guards Tank Corps are almost a 1 for 1 with the only real difference being the t-34's vs M4 shermans. These decks play the same in all other respects.

5th Panzer and 116th Panzer are almost identical. The list goes on, but I think I've made my point.

This game could be great, but it needs an overhaul of infantry lethality and tank/anti-tank gun ranges to cease being a spammy snoozefest.

As of right now, it sits in the shadow of its better predecessor.

****Death on the Vistula Update****
The smart orders work very well, credit to the devs. 
The Axis divisions are pretty bland except for the Sturmtiger, and the Polish divisions are a bit more interesting with all their stolen weapons.

It isn't for the faint of heart, you have to study your units, your division load outs, and your maps to really get into the game.  The positive, immense rewards for your tactical prowess. It's also a beautiful game, i love watching my replays and zooming in on my advances, my retreats, and my desperate dogfights to control the sky.  There are divisions that are under powered and take incredible skill to win as, and then their are divisions that are well equipped with the tools you need to take on any situation.  That's the beauty of this game, it realistically portrays divisions of the time while still balancing with assymetry.  Don't have heavy tanks to defeat those Panthers?  Well don't worry, your air force can control the sky and pepper them with AT rockets.  Don't have the airforce to take on the swarms of Soviet aircraft? Don't worry, use your state of the art German AA and keep those pesky planes at bay.  I encourage anyone a fan of RTS and WW2 to pick up this game and try to learn it.  It will really pay off

Note:  Don't pay attention to the reviews that complain about the Germans being overpowered, they are not.  Everything is balance very well.  The IS2, the Soviet counterpart to German heavies, is one of the best tanks in the game.  The allies also have the best medium tank in the game, the EMCHA (Sherman m4), that has incredible aim speed.  While not good at range, if you manuever your army well, it will beat any tank at 750 range or less.

Multiplayer is a bit more fun but there are plenty of better games with more players online at the moment.

The campaign/strategic mode is a joke, you will play 20 battles on the same map with ""historical units"" and will end up micro-managing everything in slow motion because there is nothing else to think about if you want to win. 

Everything has been polished and made even for both side (weapon range, unit armor, weapon efficiency etc...) for multiplayer purpose, the AI is even dumber than in the previous SD game. Your units will blindly run into enemy fire or into burning forest, enemy artillery will always target your units on first shot... and many many many other flaws that will make this game so unrealistic it totally ruins my will to play it.  When you get how the enemy AI works there's no more fun, you just use game mechanics to take advantage of it.  No challenge, everything feels very basic and made only for multiplayer purpose. Once again, there are better MP games and this one is only accurate graphically, all other aspects cut from immersion that was expected from it.

1) the lack of an in-game tutorial or in game tool-tips (they have links to fan made youtube videos

I prefer thinking of my plan of attack and executing it in a manageable pace but this games wants you to micro manage all your units, and mind you, units die really quick if you aren't constantly micro-managing their movements and abilities. It especially gets even more hectic as the battle rages on and you have lots and lots of units on the field.

The aesthetic is average and has not really been improved upon. Infantry animations still look terrible. I get its an RTS but there has not been much improvement it seems in my eyes. The UI and game mechanics are essentially the same as Normandy with only the terrain being different. I expected a bit more and it just feels like a DLC, and that would be fine, if it was a DLC and not a standalone.

Overall, its average if you like fast-paced and micro-managing gameplay but to me it feels like an over-priced DLC that could of had more potential as a true successor to the previous title.",1568713260,1568713260,False,54,6,0.608535826206207275,0,True,False,False

SD fans don't like how the game are so spammy, while wg fans don't like it because it's not a wg. So they angered SD fans, and didn't manage to pique enough interest from wg fans.

My biggest problem with this game is the spam, the arty spam and tank spam in this game is absolutely crazy, late game just became a shifest because of the spam, you can take out the word strategy out of this game's genre in late game. This is happening because eugen want a ""historical loadout"" for the tanks. Screw historical loadout, I want a fun strategy game. Eugen said they want to do this because people complained there were not enough tanks in SD44, well they took that to heart and gave us more tanks than on Belarus in 1944. They refused to decrease the amount of tanks no matter what, despite many players in the community have voiced their concern about it directly to eugen either in steam forums or Steel Division 2 official discord. Same thing about arty spam, they kept refusing to nerf the amount of arty. Instead they nerfed the accuracy and rate of fire of arty by just a bit and called it a day. Obviously it did nothing to the arty spam problem. Eugen have no idea what they are doing.

Also eugen didn't give the player any option to opt out of mirror match in ranked and quickplay, you are just forced to play mirror match in ranked and quickplay. This could've been easily solved had they allowed players to pick two division (one allies one axis) when queuing, but no, apparently it's beyond their capability to do that. I want to play a WWII game dammit. 

Eugen increased the scale of the game significantly in SD2, but the map size unfortunately didn't follow suit. This is also one of the factor that made the spam in team game unbearable, I only play 1v1 because of this. They also didn't give enough capture point for bigger maps, this result in blobbing of units in certain part of the map every single game. There's little strategy in all of this. 

Every new patch for this game are also guaranteed to break something, there was this one time when they released a patch that has been clearly released without being tested, because it will crash the game everytime you play ranked or quickplay. They released a ""fix"" for that, only to find out it didn't fix anything. They were forced to rollback the patch. A show of utter incompetence from eugen. I'm getting tired of having something that was fine previously suddenly became broken because of eugen's incompetency with their patch releases.

Eugen went independent to release SD2, but clearly it was just arrogance or greed from their part, the game didn't sell as good as SD44 (SD44 have bad player retention, but a lot of new player kept buying the game, keeping it alive until SD2 is released). Paradox did a better job at marketing than eugen, hell I doubt eugen have even heard of the word marketing despite being in the video game industry for years.

In short, eugen shot themselves in the foot with SD2. Playerbase is shrinking rapidly, and the majority of the remaining playerbase plays nothing but 10v10 the whole time, eugen didn't even create a genuine 10v10 map, everyone are playing 10v10 on 4v4 maps. 

I played this game quite a lot because I believe it has potential, keeping faith eugen will be able to resolve the problems in the game, but no, that faith has been squandered.

This is not a game that will tell you how to win.  This is not a game that holds your hand like modern titles.  This is back to old school play and learn, play and learn.

I mean literally the ""very low income"" setting is noticeably higher than the ""Medium income"" setting in the first game (Steel Division: Normandy 44).
It's not much of a strategy war as it is a spam war...unless you set income to 0, which is considerably harder to play. Getting locked in a spam war makes for a very boring game. (The Wargame series and the first Steel Division game did not have this issue in my opinion)

Why did they remove the ability to have no time limit? Now the game just says either high, medium, or low duration. These time limits are not a consistent time, and one game set to medium may last much longer than another medium length game.

I am by far not the first person to raise these points. Most importantly, they really should just lower the income rate, or possibly allow someone to change the income rate to whatever they (reasonably) want. If someone can select the starting points for any match, why not allow people to select the points per cycle of the in-game clock in the corner?

A light tank also should not cost as much as a decent pair of infantry. That's part of the issue.

However when Steel Division 1 came out they got away from the tactical sense and more of the rushing the flag.  Games have objectives and you have a certain amount of time to get there.  For those who like to plan their assaults and try to keep to historical tactics this is not for you.  Steel Division 2 which is better looking than 1 plays about the same its roughly the same size with the exact number of units although less tanks.  The rushing to attack just to keep the game going makes the game unfun.  The AI artillery has to be removed from the AIs battle deck as its way too accurate and deadly.  The ABC theme which can be modded out in SD1 doesnt seem to have a mod for SD2 which is a shame.  Where in history does a attacking division go into battle piecemeal with its best units at the rear waiting around for someone to allow them to join the attack.  I find it annoying.  Another thing absent from SD2 is supply trucks that cannot replenish damaged infantry units, this was a nice feature in WGRD.  Its actually possible for the game to end because of lack of supplies but this is rare as the game will end after a timer expires.  In WGRD you could play total destruction mode game plays till one side is out of forces.  Generally total destruction mode is played in all multiplayer games.  This is absent in SD2 which is a shame.  The game uses a line of sight that is hard to figure out since the map is 2d its hard to see where to put forces for maximum viewing distance.  The AI always knows where to place its forces and seems to always know where you are at all times.  I have seen the enemy AI rain down artillery on friendly forces so far in the rear behind trees that did not fire their weapons many times.  You just know the AI is cheating.

If you love games that have a better view of the historical battles then this is going to be a very good option for you. 
And more then that, if you that kind of person that loves to play with his mind and acutely to do something interesting, that is the perfect World War 2 game.

The game has a lot of gameplay options, from the huge solo game to one of the best Multiplayer games that you will see.
In one word AMAZING.

But every game has some week points.
First I can say that for me (Someone that never played in any game like that) I was very disappointed when I heard that the beta was only for people that pre-ordered the game, secondly, it would be nicer if the game will have some tutorials, and not a one hour video.
Also, I can't understand why Steel Division Normandy is almost at the same price as Steel Division 2.

I know that some people don't like the game so much, but if you look closer and acutely reed all the reviews you will see that most of the people love the game and played a lot, but that game a negative review.

•	As mentioned in other review the AI is out of control ridiculous, they do know where exactly your units are at any given moment and god forbid, they start mortar or artillery strikes you zoom out the map and you can see the white streaks literally across the map from 1 end to the other amazing nobody is safe how do you defend from that smh
•	We need more info on units and there specialty pros and cons maybe adding a hoovering option where you hoover your mouse over a unit in the menu and it tells you more in depth info on it so it can better assist you in deciding your next move. 
•	Graphics need to be fixed improved that’s all.
•	In game you can scroll out to the entire map, I notice that the map even continues past the border, I say why have that why not get rid of that and use the memory or performance that it takes and APPLY IT TO ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE GAME.
•	My biggest issue is not micromanagement but undermanagement instead. I hate micromanagement but nobody want to play a tedious game where u control every induvial. How about giving more leadership options like grouping units together in a more sophisticated way not just clicking and dragging the mouse to highlighting the units there’s no strategy in that. So, lets add more controls that make it easier to command units effectively without traveling the entire map or trying to figure out which is which or where is where give us subgroups platoons company divisions make it more serious and technical and strategical.

The AI is ruthless. They are so much better than I am at recon. Both sides are able to spot the smoke from long ranged artillery but the player has to watch that area. Then you fire on the position to take out the guns. The AI will do this as well.

The AI will also hit you in the flanks as it is very good at getting line of sight. Some players are pretty good at this game. I am not good at this game, but I find it fun.

The campaigns are good. Moving your units on the strategic map to cut the supplies off for enemy units is the key to winning. Also, leaving some units behind to cover unimportant areas and moving other powerful units quickly down the roads is how you get to the objectives. Frontal attacks into dug in positions are unwise but necessary sometimes. I usually let the AI control my land units in tactical combat as I am horrible at doing that.

I read in other reviews how the AI seems to immediately know where all your units are, and can hit them with no line of site (from the FOW). My first match was that exact experience. The moment I started the battle, I hadn't even unloaded my troops from their trucks, pinpoint accurate artillery fire from 76mm guns (from the FOW) came in and took out half my infantry.

BAD:

-At first, there is a lot to learn about the game before you can realistically try playing ranked games, or any kind of multiplayer 1v1. It is very micromanagement heavy, there are rarely any moments you can just sit and enjoy the battles, because you will always have something you need to do. 

-This is not an easy game by any stretch, not something you can just hop into right from the start and begin progressing. 

- Some of the divisions are locked behind a paywall, just to clarify, those are not the strongest divisions at all, and you still get access to the strongest divisions in the base game.


GOOD:
-It is a ww2 game with incredible diversity in terms of types of units and possible play styles to explore.

-10V10 mode is the best way to learn the game, since making mistakes is a lot less punishing than in 1v1's & 2v2's.

-the graphics are pretty nice when fighting a battle.

-There is no ""Best strategy"", as almost anything can be countered to some degree, and division options are pretty vast

-If you can invest some time into watching guides on youtube you will get better with time.

Pros:
-Nowhere else is the wide variety of units, troops and equipment in WWII as accurately portrayed. Rather than being restricted to the stereotypical Panzer IV's and Tigers, many German divisions make use of captured Soviet, Polish, French, and even British equipment, just as they did in the war. Rear echelon units like Vichy French and collaborationist forces are also available, and even Hungary makes an appearance. The same goes for the Soviets, who can field all sorts of unusual lend-lease equipment and captured German vehicles.
-Battlegroup design remains extremely fun and one of the most redeeming aspects of the game. Constantly returning to your decks to fine-tune different forces for different purposes is a boatload of fun. A wide variety of transport options give you great flexibility in designing how your infantry, support, and recon elements complement your armor.
-Solid level design enables many styles of gameplay, encourages large-scale strategic thinking, and promotes balanced decks and coordination between multiple players.
-Army General mode, which allows players to campaign across a larger map, does a good job of linking battles together and dipping the game's toes into the 4X pool.
-Destructible environments give you a great feel for the devastation inflicted by artillery and air support on strategic points like towns and ridges.
-Breakthrough mode, one of the better ideas to come out of the series, gives you the satisfaction of planning a defense against superior numbers-- or, alternately, of attacking and neutralizing a heavily defended enemy position.
-Battle mechanics in general reward good planning while still encouraging micro, all the while avoiding the pitfalls of repetitive, APM-focused RTS games.

Cons:
-Graphics feel dated by several generations. Vehicles are lovingly modeled, while infantry look like GoldenEye 64 characters. Bodies and destroyed vehicles disappear. Total War games from ten years ago have SD2 beat for unit graphics.
-The removal of phase restrictions for elite units makes the flow of battle somewhat wonky; you can plan your army for a regular, balanced escalation and get overrun by IS-2's in the first 5 minutes.
-Similarly, some phase restrictions make no sense-- elite tanks are locked to Phase A, while low quality tanks are available all the way into phase C.
-A relatively small number of maps causes you to get bored quickly.
-Army General and historical battles are a nice touch, but ultimately lack the depth of a true campaign and leave you wanting more.
-Matchmaking is a bit of a mess, with Ranked games being only 1v1 and all other public games being 10v10's or comp stomps.
-Audio assets are generally re-used from previous games, and the limited soundtrack is generic music licensed from a third party (the same tracks appear in various documentaries and other unrelated media). Feels lazy.
-Lack of mod support means no innovative game modes or new maps are forthcoming from the community.

Game then devolves into artillery spam which pins any unit when you try to play the game , thats including highly armoured closed top tanks. Only way to counter artillery is to , you guessed it, get your own artillery. Air units get countered by anti air units that cost half the price of a plane. Maps are massive so you cant really appreciate individual engagements because you have to keep constantly pouring more units into areas that need it over 4 - 5 different fronts. This is all multiplayer experience. Single player, as with pretty much any game nowadays has poor AI so thats not too fun. If you want to play vs AI then build regiments for them that have limited artillery, so you can actually use units like infantry and tanks. 

In terms of the way the game looks, it looks good up close, but the maps look very ugly with bland shades of green and yellow.  The unit graphics appear to be all blurry even on the maximum settings. The presentation of the menus, battlegroup and division selection all looks very bland, and the division icons look like they have been put together on Microsoft Paint. 

The sound effects have basically been copy and pasted from SD 44. 

The game has literally no tutorial, and apparently has a game manual, which you need a tutorial to find, because I cant find it. It relys on third party videos on youtube to help new comers to the game, again quite lazy of the developers. 

If your looking to get Steel Division , get the original Steel Division Normandy 44. The game is much better presented and put together. And puts more of a focus on actual tactical gameplay. It also looks ALOT better. SD 44 clearly had a much higher budget compared to SD 2, that unfortunatley is not reflected in the price of the game, SD 2 should honestly be about a third of the price and be in an early access state.

Check out this video for some highly realistic tank fights where a single IS2 takes on 40 Panzer IV's.

A little background: I have a fairly long history of being interested in realistic tactical real time and semi-real time strategy games. I grew up playing games like Close Combat (#1-5), especially Close Combat 3. Hundreds of hours into that game. I moved onto Combat Mission (#1-3), especially Barbarossa to Berlin and Afrika Corps. Since those games have aged I have been looking for a replacement desperately as nothing scratched that platoon level itch. Company of Heroes was fun but wasn't realistic enough to hold my interest. I didn't enjoy base building, although I did like managing reinforcements. In addition several aspects of those games I thought could be improved. Close Combat 3 was great as it all occurred in real time and so the designers sought to limit map size for it to be more manageable. Combat Mission 2 used a semi-turn based WEGO system where time stopped every minute and one could take as much time as they needed to micromanage each and every unit over a gigantic front. In my opinion this game combines both of those aspects in the best ways. 

Fast forward to Steel Division 2: A real time game with no base building with a massive scale and realistic unit features and amazing graphics to boot. It combines the scale of Combat Mission with the real time nature of Close Combat 3. Does this become unmanageable at times on large maps? Yes , sometimes, but I actually think that's a good model for the chaos during battle. You can't manage every unit perfectly, you try to give them general direction and the friendly AI does a fairly good job of figuring out the rest. Enemy AI is very competent and aggressive especially at hard difficulty levels.

In addition the community is great and speaks to the depth of the game. There's always more to learn and get better. A great thriving discord channel with lots of great commentary. 

To sum it all up, this is an amazing game. Lovingly crafted. Great graphics. Awesome scale. Amazing single player scenarios and the multiplayer is a blast, especially the team games. 2v2, 3v3 all the way up to 10v10 which I actually have not tried yet. I have about 60 hours in game and have not touched the army general (campaign) portion of the game yet.

This is mainly due to the fact that the developers are lazy and will not listen to their customers who have been supporting them from the very start.  I was willing to overlook the sheisty Day 1 DLC poo poo, which is totally unacceptable, but I put up with it as I loved the previous SD 44' and Wargames.  Now however, it seems that the developers have totally lost touch with a section of their core audience.

Developers, for the love of all that is good in this world PLEASE add in an unlimited timer and total destruction mode.  You failed to mention that these features, which were all but standard in all your games except this one, would be removed permanently and you would be total asses about not adding it in.

This has totally ruined the game for myself AND everyone that I play this game with.  Also, I don't really give a flying !@(*# what the apologists have to say about how an imposed time limit is supposedly 'realistic'.  I want to play the game at my own pace and impose my own time limits on my decided strategy based on the ongoing tactical situation.  Having the option for unlimited time and total destruction doesn't take anything away from those who want to play with a time limit, give'er balls, but don't take away my fun because you like to play a certain way and think everyone should as well.

Just my two cents.

To those who feel the same way but haven't reviewed the game, I encourage you to do so so that we can send a message to the developers.

I'm real sad panda because I can't play the game and enjoy it.  -_-

Lastly, depending on Youtubers to make tutorials for YOUR games is pathetic.

Take this review in the context that I have played all of the Wargame series and so I already knew how to play the game for the most part.  A lot of people have given the game a bad review and complained that there was no tutorial and so on, it is a valid complaint but that does not mean the game is bad.

If you are a history/WW2 buff then this is going to be a wet dream for you. No battle plays the same, with all of the different divisions and customization options for them it is pretty limitless. The combat is much improved over SD 44 and even Wargame, the place is slowed and infantry has much greater importance. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and since the beta I have gotten 5 different people into the game, two of whom did not play Wargame or any other RTS other than Red Alert-type stuff before and they have fallen in love with the game and gotten the hang of it quickly. 

The game is not balanced how typical games are balanced, but it's not really meant to be. It is a realistic historical game, and history was not balanced. Regardless, with modding tools you will be able to fit the game to your liking - especially if you are just a comp-stomper.

Unfortunately though unlike every other game of this type there is a truly odd time limit imposed. Winning a game and moving in for the kill, time limit ends it. Losing and pushing for a counter attack,time limit ends it. You are forced into a capture the flags conquest type gameplay, great if you like to rush and finish a game as fast as possible but if you like to plan, take your time and fight a protracted engagement you will become so frustrated with playing and then missing out on half of the battle you should be having, that you will revert back to other games. The response has been from Eugen that the game has been designed for the conquest style of play and that in real life people have to work to time limits, i really think this decision to impose this time limit and lack of total destruction even in single player will ruin the experience for many players, which is sad as the Army general side and campaign are very good.

Oh boy this game, Eugen really can't decide wich of their 2 main communities to pamper to so they went ahead and created this Frankenstien.

First of all, don't expect the true tactical micro that was in Wargame or in Steel Division '44, you get extreme amount of units per card, now you say, they are all recruits. Well yes dear reader, too bad it's nullified with the commander option, the commander is a unit that not only gives 2 star vet to any unit in it's AoE, but, thanks to the radio network, gives them to any unit under a leader AoE in radio range, so those 22 recruit t34/76 you can get in C phase now are all 2 vetted, this completley eliminates the idea of lesser but more efficent units.

And don't get me started on numbers, since the maps are bigger you get waaaaay to many units, the panzer Lehr for example can take 24 panthers in C phase, 24! Soviets of course gets double or triple that amount to compensate. 

The UI is extremley poor, while now you can know precise information of each of your units you'll bring into battle it's 10 times harder to actually navigate it.

The feedback while in game is terrible, while in the Wargame series and first SD you could pretty much know where that pesky atgm or anti tank gun fire was coming from, or know when a volley was coming, now you need to wait 30-40 seconds to understand where somone is shooting at you.

The new divisions are yet indeed fun, but like SD '44 if you wanna play competitive 1v1 in ranked you gotta go for the meta stuff, the non meta ones require much more effort compared to a meta one.

Army general is actually a very interesting concept and game mode, too bad it's killed by the AI, as in all Eugen games you either play against an umpa lumpa that can't tell that sending stuff down that road will keep getting it killed on easy or the very same stuff on hard but with the added benefit of maphacking.

Also due to the extreme amount of units you will see loads of tanks and arty, now this isn't all bad really, after all it's the eastern front... Too bad that while you have way too many tanks you get basically 3-4 anti tank guns per card, wich while not certanly low is nothing compared to a horde of tanks.

tl;dr
On paper all the improvements they brought in the game sounds really good and a step up. In practice it's a damn mess, by trying to fuse their 2 main playerbases they got the love of some of the veterans from SD'44 and none from Wargame, while messing up the peculiar gameplay that was behind the first SD and it's more smaller scale tactical approach.
I do not recommend this game in it's current state, wich is very poor and unbalanced divisions wise, if you wanna try it buy it on sale at at least 50% discout or just wait a few months to see how it develops.",1563638600,1563638600,False,9,0,0.567850768566131592,0,True,False,False

I only played one historical scenario but it was great and very well balanced with the 2 Tigers arriving just in the nick of time. I especially enjoy those nail-biting moments.

The main excitement point for me with SD2 was always the Army General or dynamic campaign module. At launch it lacked the ability to save in the middle of a tactical engagement and these games can take hours if you micromanage them the way I like to do, so it was an essential feature - it's been added in one of the last patches and I'm a happy camper now.

There are still some balancing issues and things that need ironing out but so far I have had a very enjoyable experience. The historical campaigns have very engaging and well-executed introductions providing the necessary context for every campaign. I've been playing the Orsha campaign and managed to hold off the tide in the first engagement with the 78 Sturm division as it was historically. Next, the soviets struck north at the 256 Infantry with their Guards Infantry division and even though I held the line for half the battle it was not possible to stem the red tide and they got the breakthrough at the same spot as it was historically. 

This is what I was missing in SD1, and now with the strategic layer offering me continuity and context as a history buff, I am a happy camper.

What really sells this game is the multilevel strategic and tactical design. And these aspects beautifully combine in Army General. You can really choose how you want to carry out the campaign. The level of detail is pretty great, and the order of battle ranges from the Grand Field HQs and Divisions, down to individual regiments, companies, and finally squads.

So far I have spent 35 hrs in-game, mostly in AG, and I have been really enjoying this title. 

However....

I also think it is important to address some criticisms I have. Firstly, some aspects of the HUD, GUI and general aesthetic feel quite unpolished, if not lacking in quality. One particular example is the 'briefing' before each AM campaign. The footage and maps, along with the cardboard cutouts of Generals look quite amateur. The music is generic and can be quite repetitive at times. I've basically disabled it for now.

 There are a few other lacking gameplay features which can become quite frustrating over time. For instance when you are preparing an offensive or defensive battle, you cannot see which exact enemy units are attacking/defending. Similarly, I cannot save the game during the AI turn, and this becomes a problem when I have to leave or turn off the game (each turn can last upwards of an hour if you play each battle). 

But nonetheless, my issues with the game are mostly superficial, or aesthetic. I am very pleased with the core game mechanics, and ST2 will become one of my long term go-to games.",1563140814,1563140814,True,4,2,0.516621410846710205,0,True,False,False

[*] The amount of depth to the divisions and the variety of Units is great as how you will never play the same battle twice due to how it limits what units you can bring out from that division.
[*] It runs extremely well and looks amazing even on the low setting on graphics and looks really good even in replay mode.
[*] Being Able to Replay a battle afterwords is amazing allowing you to see what happened that caused your defeat or overall taking cool screen shots.
[*] So far I only have 2 problems with this game and that would be the lack of allied heavy tanks in most divisions as you naturally get more medium tanks which can also be a good thing as it causes you play differently however this may not be the case if you find your self unable to move your tanks in a effective range.
[*] Another problem with this game which is very common in other WW2 RTS Games is the artillery spam, one to three pieces of heavy artillery can be ok however i find players will spam it out causing your troops and tanks to fall back without you being able to use them, and same with Rocket Artillery.
[*] my last complaint would be the weakness of planes, as any fighter or bomber can be easily routed by Cheap Anti Air that sits behind lines causing you unable to effectively use air support, i feel if AA was less accurate and planes could take more damage i feel that this would significantly improve the effectiveness of air support.

This game has huge, has interesting maps, excellent unit variety, and engaging games. The available campaigns are limited but still good. The AI intelligence can vary a lot but is generally good enough to give you a problem though it struggles with dug in defences. 

Then comes the AI cheating, which just ruins it. I would not mind the AI having more points and bigger armies at times. But, even on easier difficulties, they cheat with indirect fire. AI artillery is pin point accurate, fast firing and always acts like it has line of sight on your whole army. If you fire just one shot with your own artillery, deep back, no possible LOS and in dug in gun pits, be prepared for it to be wiped out in seconds by artillery that you cannot counter. Once your guns are silent AI artillery and air strikes will wipe out your whole army one unit at a time and there is nothing you can do. All the developers need to do is release a patch that gives enemy artillery the same limits as player artillery. But without it, single player is borderline unplayable.

Army General (Single Player Campaign)

The Army General Strategic Campaign feels a little lackluster. I feel it is the weakest part of the game in it's current state. It is still fun to play but the tactical battle maps quickly become repetitive. Also the division system is odd and feels poorly thought out. Often matches see one or both sides without any of the basic necessities. This can lead to interesting and different play styles in specific cases but more often than not it comes off as frustrating. This has led to my playthrough's devolving into a series of auto-resolves completely ignoring the tactical battle component. This is unfortunate because the tactical battles are where this game really shines, just not in the Army General format.

6/10

Skirmish and Multiplayer

This is where EUGEN really hit the mark. The skirmishes are a blast both with AI and human players. The AI is really quite competent for a game of this complexity. It will challenge and overwhelm you but persevere and you will beat it. This game has quite a learning curve but a strong community of Youtuber's and streamers have provided an almost limitless cache of information to help players along the way. I feel the learning curve is what makes it such a great game. Every time you learn a new strategy or how to properly use that weird tank it is a sense of accomplishment. You will get better and the human match-ups can be a true test of wit. As of now balance is ok, it needs work but that is to be expected at this stage in the release. Where the multiplayer falls short is the poorly implemented lobby system. It works, but that's about all that can be said. It's messy. Matchmaking is extremely minimal and only has options for 1v1. That being said it works and the 1v1's are a fun, great way to improve without letting down your teammates.

8/10

All in all the developers have made a solid game with less than ideal conditions and I think they deserve some praise. There are some questionable business practices surrounding the release but I will leave that for the consumer to judge. I am hoping to see more people pick up and learn this great game so the community can really flourish in the years to come.",1562722076,1562722180,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

SD1 was much much better. My biggest gripes are total lack of balance between German and Russian forces. Things like infantry anti-tank ranges are especially broken. Russians have it way too easy, with standard infantry knocking out light tanks and other vehicles at 500-750m, where playing german, you have to close to 120m and sometimes less. Even 2-man panzerschreck units are only good to 250m, this is just too difficult even on easy settings. In the campaign, if you pick the Germans, and play the first campaign, you face a ridiculous onslaught of tanks, and you are given no armor at all, and only one, single light ant-tank gun, but it cant engage infantry and it has only half the range of the average tank, so good-fricken luck closing that distance or doing any appreciable damage on those three heavy tanks coming in, in tight, bumper-to-bumper formation. That is not fun, at all. 

This is a game, not a damn history lesson. If I wanted to watch the Germans get rofl-stomped, I'd break out the national geographic WWII series and just watch it on TV.

Please note that I am contrasting this opinion based on much better balance and fun to be had  in SD1. I really don't care what the history books say. If history demands it, have a historical campaign mode, but for people who want a balanced game, please have a balanced campaign mode also.

My other gripes are some problems with seeing bullet tracers. Why was this changed for the worse from what it was in SD1? Why is there no option to increase the shell/bullet/tracer sizes? Again, if this is for more realism or whatever, make it an option, but right now, it sucks because you cant enjoy the zoomed out mode at all, especially if you want to see which units are engaging which other units.

I'll keep the game and hope someone mods it back to be closer to how SD1 worked, but for now, it's a definite thumbs down. Just awful.",1562656005,1562656005,False,5,1,0.480949491262435913,0,True,False,False

Now to the cons: Units are not properly balanced. This encourages all kinds of cheese. Air abuse, rushes, arty spam. You name it. 
However, devs are actively listening to the community this time around so hopefully they will fix this mess.
Some of the 3d models are straight up broken (poor pzIV). And last but not least, community. Unfortunately, a lot of players dont like to play against proper opponents. Instead they opt to stack lobby and bully new players (sometimes even kicking anyone who is high level). This coupled with no tutorial means that a lot of new people might get flustrated with the game.

If you are new to this game I recommend playing SP against AI, then Co-op or 10v10 and once you understand core mechanics of the game you should start to play 1v1 (PvP). There is a functional matchmaking for it (so almost no wait time) and you will learn A LOT (you can watch replays and learn from your opponents in case they beat you).

Pro:
- Intricate, detailed maps & vehicle models.
- Reasonably accurate mechanics and graphics.
- Customizable battlegroups drawn from German & Soviet divisions (vanilla), which can make a given division play quite differently depending on how the player puts their battlegroup together.
- Robust single-player experience.  

Con:
- No tutorial.  This is not a simple game.  Can be overcome with perserverance, but the first few hours can be quite frustrating to someone who hasn't played this series before (I had not...came close to hitting the ""refund"" button.  Glad I didn't).
- Subjective, but I find the default pace rather quick, and the micro-management challenge piles up.  The interesting paradox here is that Eugen created a beautiful detailed (and often grisly) world that is amazing to just watch unfold...and then set the action at a pace where the player rarely has the opportunity to take it in.  That said, on single-player there is a half-speed option, plus the ability to pause as often and for as long as you want.

I cannot speak to the multiplayer experience, other than to say that the lobbies look rather small to me whenever I peek to see how many are playing.

-Infantry are more useful rather than SD44's infantry meat grinders.
-Fire while fast move
-Deck flexibility is back from wargame red dragon
-Scale are much larger, maps, units, battle, chaos, etc.
-Stealth mechanic has been redone to improvement, like tanks can no longer spot infantry or AT's while firing.
-Environment is more grittier and realistic, and more uneven terrains.
-We now have dynamic single player campaigns like in Graviteam Tactics
-And lots and lots of divisions compared to the first release of SD44 (well you know, there was paradox policy back then)

This has to be the best tactical RTS that I have ever played in my entire PC gaming years. This game has high competitive and replay value, and also has a steep learning curve compared to other casual RTS. This game can also be frustrating in a good way since the decisions you make doesn't always end up the way you wanted it to be.

Now the only problem here is the player base. Its understandable with niche games such as this, but competitive games like this are multiplayer centric and needs players to increase its replay value. This was the problem with SD44, don't get me wrong that game was great but the game's value only lasted for a year due to continuous decline of population per month and long waiting times in the lobby. I just hope eugen adds a decent matchmaking system for multiplayer so waiting times in the lobby would be greatly reduced.

Micro in this game is super tough.... with 30 units on the field, each with their own perspective and field of view, it's really not feasable to micro. Just spam tanks and attack move. Blah.

This should give you an insight look on how this company works. Ignoring long lasting problems that already appeared in the first games of the Wargame series haven´t been fixed yet.

A system such as in WarGame RedDragon, where each 'flag' gives a certain amount of points for the team would be cool also.

Seems to me Eugen just decided to make a game while compressing all the worst ideas of  previous SD and Wargame titles into one

Here are the following reasons for thumbs down(but not all)

1. Unit range and accuracy - it seems Eugen just doesnt know what they want, they went from bad but still playable SDs graduated range on tanks and guns (800-1000 to max 1200) which made a lot of units obsolete or OP, to this mess of slapping the 2000 meter range on almost every tank. 
While technically possible, tanks and AT guns rarely opened fire on that range due to lack of accuracy and penetration, and the simple fact detecting a tank in camouflaged position (and even less AT guns or infantry teams) was all but impossible. Did 2000 meter combat occur between tanks, absolutely, was every second or third shot a hit like in game, ABSOLUTELY NOT, most of the time it would have been a waste of ammo.

For example, IRL IS-2s, Panthers and Tigers had anywhere between 10-25% first round hit probability in combat conditions on 2000 meters and were an exception, not the rule.

Accuracy of guns on max range is buffed to the point it hurts not only realism, but also gameplay. Any kind of flanking or penetration of the front is going to be greeted by  super accurate AT and Tank fire from literally other half of the map (talking 1v1 maps) with you many times not even figuring out what is happening as your infantry and tanks get literally sniped at max range (even when fully zoomed out you wont be able to fully asses the situation or at least not fast enough).  If max range needed to be capped it should have been done at 1500 meters. Unfortunately the issue with range gets even bigger when you count in ...

2. RNG penetration and critical hits...they are back, and with increase in gun range even worse than before.

Way too many pointless RNG ""critical hits"" that usually get your tank or AT gun killed from return fire, perhaps the worst critical (and one of the most common) is ""transmission damage"" with no real benefits and can be considered a wasted hit.  

Couple that with penetration mechanics based on percentage and you will find yourself fighting enemy tanks suddenly go full terminator mode refusing to die from numerous hits (and criticals) only to repeatedly one shot hit your tanks in response. 

Why is penetration based on ""lucky percentage""  when we have good enough documentation to recreate realistic armor penetration (a simple ""gun x penetrates that x thickness of armor every time"") is a mystery to me.

3. Unit and ary spam - again similar to point 1 it seems Eugen doesnt know what they want , they went from SDs mostly infantry focused battles with better tanks and arty  as ""unicorn units"" of the battlefield, to decreasing unit prices in such ways regular infantry squads are barely cheaper than a medium tank, with mortars and basic arty worth barely more than medium tanks and infantry. 

This leads to numerous issues, one being arty spam galore, but also unit spam in general, as you get flooded with requisition points pretty easy, game is even less focused on maneuver (remember the laser accuracy 2000 range i mentioned) and even more on firepower from unit concetration. Infantry guns with 2000 range are a bane versus infantry and AT guns (looking at you ig18 and its russian equivalent).

4. Unit AI and AI in general, again bad , unit AI is nonexistent and you will have to babysit them even more due to the 2000 meter range. AI on skirmish is going to demotivate a lot of beginners thats for sure. 

In short the AI has ""the all seeing eye"" on medium AI and up. Snipes units with arty, makes perfect pushes  and ""assesments"".  

It turns into a frustration to play, similar to facing against a wallahckign cheater in a FPS game, which means very few beginners will have the motivation to go and try multiplayer.

End thoughts , i still try to play the game but not more than 2-3 matches per day, after that i am drained and somewhat frustrated, and thats never a good sign for a game.",1562254185,1562254621,False,92,2,0.825345337390899658,5,True,False,False

Graphics, easily 8.5, not quite a 9, even at the highest res I felt that the graphics are a couple years old.

Return fire, not sure why but a manual fire seems to reach a lot further, possibly my recon isn’t seeing something but the return fire just kinda seems to stink and lack distance.

I've had to refund the game for now, as I simply haven't got the time to sit around watching Youtube tutorials because the developers neglected to include a few simple interactive missions.

It's not a game for everyone. Even diehard fans of the RTS genre might not enjoy it. For starters, all campaign missions have a 30-minute time limit that you cannot change. Beyond that, most skirmishes seem to abruptly end around the 25-30 minute mark because 1 team had 1-2 more cap zones or something, there's usually no clear indication of why you won or lost.

It's basically a very slow paced meatgrinder. Due to the size of the maps (they're huge, not necessarily a bad thing), your troops will often feel like they're moving in slow motion. Because of that, retreating isn't usually a good option. This is accentuated by the fact that moving under enemy fire will cause massive losses... So, once your troops are engaged, it's seemingly best to just leave them in one spot and wait for them to die as it'll take longer (for them to die) than if you try to retreat or move them unless there's cover within 100m.  

If there are any enemy mortars or artillery in range, you can kiss your infantry goodbye because that arty will obliterate EVERYTHING with pinpoint accuracy. 2-3 shells landing within 150m of your troops will suppress them entirely. Troops are moving? No problem, mortars are seemingly assisted by UAV and can readjust their fire within seconds based on that movement. Remember, it only takes 2-3 shells to completely suppress a unit. So if they start getting hammered by arty, better to forget about them and start queuing up new troops. 

Long story short, micro is a very small part of SD2. It's more about sending troops into the meatgrinder and being able to constantly replace them. In a way, this makes sense because there's no troop replenishment in SD2, but for any RTS vet it'll feel weird if you're not already used to the series. And if you're not already used to the series, prepare for the community to rip you apart because of that. 

SD2 is a battle of attrition more than anything. Playing as the Germans gives you a distinct disadvantage due to the Soviet/Allied numbers advantage and VERY strange balance decisions. For instance, a Tiger tank (German heavy tank) can be EASILY taken down by practically any medium tank in just 1-2 hits. The ""elite"" German infantry units can easily fall to any other inf, even low quality Russian rifle squads. 

If you'd like to learn the game mechanics without spending an hour or two reading an extremely convoluted manual, you're SOL. There's no tutorial and seemingly no plans to make one. The community advice regarding this is, ""you should have been playing the series from day 1 and you'd already know how to play"". 

After all of that, there's the fact that half of the day-1 divisions are locked behind day-1 DLC. Included in that are the divisions you'll need if you want to play online without getting completely destroyed by the meta decks. Without them, you're fighting a losing battle 90% of the time. 

That's basically Steel Division 2 in a nutshell. It's not the game for everyone. It's an extremely niche RTS that only a small fraction will thoroughly enjoy beyond the initial ""new game enthusiasm"".",1562093747,1562097256,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-fights taken place at longer ranges so positioning and tactical maneuvers are more important
-AA is actually capable to defend your line unlike SD 44 but not so to make dogfighting impossible as in W:RD
-recon vehicles now dont move the frontline so you can do more with them

Such as adding an armour system instead of a 1-10 point rating, Large scale combat as opposed to the bocage of Normandy and large scale unit variation. While it isn't a wargame title it goes a long way toward the WW2 wargame the fan base wanted while still holding onto the positive ideas introduced by steel division.",1562051056,1562051056,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After watching a few videos and learning what few things need to be done, the game fit perfectly where I wanted to fit. 
I was a little disappointed at 1st, because it was only 44, but after experimenting with all the combat groups, oh wow there is just so many things!
Every combat group is a challenge,  and some are stronger in other things that others are weaker at.
I like the Russian front history, and this game let's me relive it in so many ways. If I was na feel like in 41, then I choose a group that has those tanks and my AI opponent I do the same.
There are so many maps and so much to explore,  that even after 40 hours of gameplay, I'm barely scratching the surface. 
I tried multiplayer the other day, and I went into Co OP, I had so much fun.
After reading a lot of reviews,  if I should play the game, I was a little worried it would turn out bad.
But after playing a lot and learning how to play, well I just gotta say it feels very realistic (if you can keep your Tiger at a range of 2000m it will be untouchable, but of course the AI will try to nuke it with air attacks, so you move out of the way or send fighters to intercept. 
I must say I'm very happy with my purchase and I can't wait to start the campaign, now that I know how each unit and the game works.

First, there is no save options between battles, which means that hours of your fine fighting are lost instantly if you don't have the additional hours to finish the next three or four battles. THIS IS A KILLER FOR THIS GAME, PLEASE FIX IT!!!!!

Second, there is no tutorial, so if EUGEN wants to make money beyond its basic loyalty customers and build a bigger base they need to fix this and fix it NOW. I have played this game and almost returned it for a refund because I had no walk through on the campaign. The campaign was the only reason I bought the game. If others are likewise draw to the game for this function, they will be instantly frustrated and word will spread and no one will buy your game. FIX IT!

Third, SUDDEN DEATH IS BROKEN! I took all the enemy access points and rather than that battle ending after 10 seconds, I had to fast forward for another thirty minutes to end the battle. Please fix it! I would send you a save, but you do have a save function.

Lastly, I must say that I am completely disappointed that the various campaigns are not connected and that the battle results don't bleed over to different fronts. It appeared to me that this was going to be a massive strategic scenario, where your battles really mattered and where you could alter history across a wide front. However, that does not appear to be the case. What happened to being the general, rather than the regimental commander.

It is most similar to Wargame: Red Dragon. Same concept but in a world war 2 setting.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787888532

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Steel Division 2 is an RTS that plays by using decks of cards. Here’s how it’s done;

Before you even get into a match you can build a deck. The deck consists of every unit available to the specific division that you choose. If you picked a panzer division for example you will get to choose from a lot of tank/vehicle- cards. 

With a limited amount of supply you need to make a balanced deck for the 3 phases of the match. Each match plays in phases A, B and C that each last for 10 minutes and depending on what unit you want to add to each phase the amount might vary. 

If you add a very good artillery piece to phase A you will only be able to call 1 into the battlefield. This is important. If it gets destroyed it’s gone for the rest of the match. If you would add the same artillery piece to phase C rather than A you would be able to call in 6 of them instead. But is your deck strong enough to last the 20 minutes it takes through phases A and B? It’s a balancing act that takes a lot of strategic planning.

When your deck is finished you jump into a match with the deck you created or you can select a premade deck that comes with the game. 

Before the match timer starts each player gets to place a number of units from their phase A cards. If you’re in multiplayer, people will ping what locations they will try to defend/push before placing their units.

When the placement is finished the match starts and players order units around to do various tasks. You can place units in an ambush position, order them to search for enemies through dense forests, tell them to not shoot unless shot upon first (good for scouts) etc. 
Something that stands out from many other RTS games is that height matters a lot in this game. Units that are placed on high ground will have much better view over the field so it’s an ideal position to hold. The same goes for forest areas as it makes for good ambush positions.

The goal is to take and hold as many enemy objectives as possible. When you have taken a few of the enemy objectives a defeat timer will start for the losing team. That’s the time limit they have to take the lost objectives back or even out the board by taking an equal number of enemy objectives.

This means that a team that loses objectives right away in phase A might be in for a very short match. Or it could last over an hour if both teams are doing well.

When the match is over there are statistics where you can see how many kills each unit got and so on.

[h1]Graphics and Map design[/h1]
The maps are very well designed in terms of offering strategic advantages on both sides. You can be zoomed out and play the match on a strategic icon level if you so please, or zoom in and see detailed models of soldiers as they perish in mortar rain.

It’s not beautiful to the point where you’ll stop to admire the graphical gymnastics but it does look good for a game that plays on such a huge scale. Huge battles look very cool.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787889910

[h1]Sounds and voice acting[/h1]
No complaints here. Everything sounds good. Units have varied voice lines for the most part.

[h1]Day 1 DLC[/h1]
This is the number one reason why people are giving Steel Division 2 bad reviews. They removed 4 nations from the beta version of the game and put it in a day 1 DLC. I would not mind it so much if it wasn’t for the hefty price tag on it. The DLC is currently at 25€. The base game is 40€ so if you want the “complete” experience, you’ll need to pay a good amount of money. Greedy but luckily the base game is very good without it.

[h1]Interface and controls[/h1]
The interface is very good. I am glad that they didn’t opt for NATO symbols as the default icons but rather put it in as an option that you can activate if you so please. Kind of sad that there’s no option to hide the interface during battle though. It would be nice to do so during chaotic battle moments.

[h1]Multiplayer playerbase[/h1]
It’s alive and well right now (in Europe, my location). PVP seems to be the more popular choice but I can get into cooperative games vs AI very easily as well. 

[h1]Skirmish/solo gameplay[/h1]
You enjoy this game very much by just playing with/against AI. I do it all the time and find it very enjoyable. There are different difficulties and you can choose decks for the AI if you want to spice things up.

There’s also the campaign mode you can play which I’ve heard is very good but I have not got into it yet so unfortunately I can’t say how good/bad it is. I refer you to look at other Steam reviews for that. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787891145

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
It’s a very fun RTS game that require a lot of planning. It looks chaotic when watching videos but I find It quite relaxing compared to other RTS games since so much of the game is won by planning rather than pure execution. Whenever the enemy does something you try to counter it and predict what else he will do. Early airplane? Could be an air-heavy deck. Call in 2 more anti-air vehicles. Place them near the artillery and tanks. You get the idea.

I have seen a lot of people complain about the time limit that the game puts on you when you’re losing. But that’s just how this game is played. If you plan your defences poorly and you get steamrolled you are most likely going to lose. I think a lot of new players who haven’t learned the proper counters yet are going to have this experience. 

Some people give the game bad reviews due to artillery – invest in anti-air in the A-phase and don’t let the enemy scout you. 
Simply put, lot of these reviews try to make it sound as if the game is bad when it’s just that they’re using a bad deck or don’t know what counters what.

This is the best WW2 RTS game I played and one of the best RTS games available right now. If you like the WW2 setting and the RTS genre you are going to enjoy this.",1561986464,1561987109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pro:
1. Detailed maps and armies in Army General.
2. While not realistic, armored are streamlined to ensure in-game balance. [Example: Soviet tanks like their main T-34 have poor gun depression, so if modeled in, it is easy to beat Soviet armors using reverse slope defense.]
3. Great show of infantry weapon different capabilities. In Wargame, infantry weapons rarely varied in their capability within the same case. In SD2, Soviet Psh will outperform the German MP40, but the Germany make it up for long range with the MG-42 which is superior to the Soviet light mg.
4. Supply trucks are far more useful, as compare to Wargame. 
5. Differences in recon ability. Pure recons have better optics compare to artillery observer but the observer provide accuracy buff to long-range artillery.
Cons:
1. Again, lack of instructions forcing players to send hours searching for answers from communities, when the developers could have easier provide clear tutorials that would only take tens of minutes to learn.

The series is somewhat unique in that it allows the player to customize their army in a fashion similar to deck-building card games. Though combat is real time, and very beautiful, each battle consists of 3 phases, a, b, and c. A lasts 10 minutes, B lasts 10 minutes, and C lasts 20 minutes. Players build their divisions from ""cards"" of units belonging to that group, choosing the level of experience each unit has and the phase that the unit is available in. Units available in A, continue to be available in B and C, so building a roster of available units that is effective at fighting in each phase is important. In the same way, players can customize their ability to purchase these units. Normally a player receives a starting allotment of points, and earns additional points per minute which can be spent to call units in from the edge of the battle map. Players can choose to have high income in the beginning, middle, or end, or follow a standard scheme which increases with each phase.

You can replace those losses in 2-3 minutes, the AA guns behind them, and the infantry ahead of them without significant issue.

The ground game is significantly improved by giving medium tanks a great impact and economy. In SD1 and the wargame series, the meta tended to center around the unicorn, a handful of the best guns and armor in the game. It meant there was no competition between the highest and the average. Now? Medium tanks flourish. They may not kill the dreaded King Tiger or IS-2 from the front, but you get so many of the handy things that the medium tank swarm is a viable alternative, even in large games. This part of the game is also fairly balanced, so both the Sherman and the King Tiger can excel in their roles.

The support game as it stands is alright, but it represents a return to the Wargame formula. Artillery is plentiful, so are fire missions. Airplanes have seen a modest nerf: the AA meta can suppress and remove them fairly quickly, but you are now back to large numbers of planes.

My biggest disappointment is that the infantry game has returned to the Wargame formula. While you can deploy so much infantry that a game stopping loss in Wargame wouldn't finish you off in SD2, I am still saddened that the stealthy infantry design of SD'44 didn't survive the shift to the eastern front. Snipers are back to being practically useless, sneaking scouts behind enemy lines is unviable past 1v1s. Infantry are good replacements for recon.

Extremely crude and incoherent unit controls.
No tutorial of any kind. Visual feedback is zero other than the basic ""your unit is under attack/dead!"". You have 4 types of markers you can put on a map, half of time you hear the sound from your ally marker but don't see anything on your minimap.
Camera glitches out when you pan or zoom and just focuses on a random point in the map.
Half of time you have no idea what's going on, just bunch of explosions.
Tanks get their visibility ""blocked"" by nothing, and yet shoot through massive buildings like they're not even there.
You damage gunner sights by shooting tracks, and then the same damaged tank does a 360 noscope oneshot on you.

I thought this was just them putting out a game that is like the previous one with no real changes to the game. That being said I was very impressed with what they have done with this game compared with 44. 

The shining point in this game for me is the breakthrough game mode. This game to me feels like a good mix between Company of Heroes, Men of War AS2 and even a little Total War. I loved MOWAS2 but I hated how there was no AI. Frequently I would play with friends and set up a defence and have them attack me or me attack them but I couldn't do it on my own as there was no AI. Being able to set up a defence as the shitty Hungarian Divisions and have 3 Soviet AIs attack me is loads of fun. 

I love how they have the capture points on the maps in all game modes. This makes holding territory that is tactically unimportant matter in the game and forces you to pay attention to the whole map. I love how these points are how you gain victory instead of just holding a majority of the map.

Setting up your battlegroups is a lot better than in 44. Being able to choose what kind of transports infantry units have is great. You can have more halftracks and gun trucks or just use normal Studebaker and Opel Blitz trucks. Changing a units veterancy and this affecting the overall number of the unit you can deploy in battle is great as well.

My only gripe is the user interface needs work. I find myself zooming right in to see what my units are doing, and on these huge maps that creates a problem, as i often miss something important happening elsewhere.

Much improved over the first one on every level, more maps, improved gameplay (eg. such as infantry getting pinned can crawl underfire and slowly move to cover), more units.

Yes, the absence of tutorial is a pain, and diving in the Campaign mode is challenging at first. But two things should be remembered :
- there is an in-game manual that summarizes everything you need to know. So when you begin to be lost, just press ESC, open it and look for the info you need.
- the community is very active and you can easily find YT videos to help you get started.

The sheer scope of the work provided by Eugen and its developers (who had to overcome many difficulties, sometimes coming from their own employers...) is staggering, making a realistic and faithful version of Operation Bagration, all the while making it a playable and enjoyable game. And they did it perfectly.

Their suicidal anti consumer business practices endangering the players counts in MP community far beyond any RTS I've known and complete lack of media coverage and experience publisher only makes the problem worse.

If you are reading this,and you haven't preorder it then you've missed the preorder exclusive deal roughly about 10% of the game's content and will likely put you in a disadvantage in MP. 

Also,if you don't have SD44 then you missed out 8 divisions,together it is 10 divisions and they are among the best in-game divisions,it means 28 potential divisions vs 18 vanilla in a MP match.

For those who defending this game with no better reason other than it is good game and can't even state the reasons,may I compare DOTA 2 with 50% heroes removed from regular players and award only to BETA testers,rock,paper,scissor removing scissor,then call it fair match?

The fundamental rule of any RTS is equality,any minor deviation is acceptable like COH2,WGRD and newer TW but this game derailed too much even on day 1 when player counts the most.

If you WW2 RTS fan who like SP and doesn't care about MP then you should give it a try after 50% discount,it ain't worth the AAA price tag without the same performance.In the means time,just wait for the developers to patch at least some of the problems.

Before some very ""friendly""member jumping in and telling me git gud or L2P like usual SD2 community discussion,I have 42 hours in-game and 150 in SD44 and almost 4K hours of all their games,so I believe I have more than qualified than most of the reviewer.

Art:

Pros;

1.The BGM they selected are decent.

2.The concept art is matching AAA standard and even better than COH2,you will see them in loading screen to give you some .

3.Decent combination of music and concept art in loading screen give you an adrenaline.

4.The graphic is major improvement from previous game while still far behind than MOW and COH2.

Cons:

1.The music will be repetitive after few times,it will be sooner if your hearing is sensitive.

2.In game graphic rendering is unnecessary grim,the gameplay didn't show the brutality on the East Front as COH2 does. 

3.The concept art in your folder if you have the DLC is only 1920*1080.

4.Many models are still inaccurate and wrong.

Game mechanism

Pros: 

1.The combat system is relatively realistic,compare to COH2 but far worse than MOW and Graviteam Tactics,it stands in a middle ground.

2.Game setting on the East front which is where most battles happened.

3.The AI may give you over 20 hours of fun if your skill is very low or new comer,they are far better than any new players.After that,they just brain-dead AI.

4.Up to date, huge WW2 battle.

5.Open Beta tradition is here,while much shorter and inconsistency.

Cons: 

1.Frontline giving out hidden unit's location.

2.Hidden HP bar leading to many arty kills and units losses happened very  suddenly.

3.All rounds with AP ability works as APHE round and zero representation of British focus on solid AP round while lacking. 

4.Suicidal routing,infantry going to wrong direction and enemy ZOC or vehicle showing its flank to AT.

5.Damage system is abstract as hell,breaks about every rules in that context.

6.Phases create extreme fast gameplay many instant,front-load armor deck can quickly end the game.

7,Anything with AP power can damage tank even the its armor penetration are way below target's armor,but there aren't any explanation in-game about how it works.There are many records HMG disable tank but no game information about this.

8.All games on conquest,the only mode.

Multiplayer

Pros

1.Heavy armor trolling is good

2.Spamming units are pretty fun for the first few games.

3.Arty trolling is the best.

4.It is fun to see the enemy or your teammate frontline crumble,it makes you feels good,very good.

Cons

1.Everything in MP is down to units spam

2.Segregate player base,already part of the community is barring 8 ahistorical divisions in-game at the moment,there are 28 divisions but maybe more as time went on,the buyer of the original game will only have 18 putting them in a heavy disadvantage,DLC divisions are among the best divisions in-game,some of them will eventually be Meta. Leaving 28 divisions vs 18 divisions

3.Poor Balance among divisions.

4.Unhelpful members of community,many of them just tells them go play something else or google the problem.It will reflected heavily on the player counts in long run.

5.Very low players base even lower than the previous title,if nothing change then the MP will be effectively dead within 6 months or faster like previous game.

Human computer interaction

Pro:

1.Vehicle Turret traverse rate is showing in-game

Cons:

1.No explanation on AP calculation with round size in-game.

2.Worst in-game lobby UI design I've seen in a RTS,1/3 of players name card are hidden by ""???"" while no chatbox without chat button

3.Huge numbers of AI opponent servers without way to filtering them in MP custom game.

4.No way to filtering DLC divisions in division choice,you have to work on your history lesson or check the DLC if you don't want to play with ahistorical combatant.

5.No deselect button combine with auto grouping leading to a pretty sticky control.where units feels commit suicide sometime while it is actually following order.

6.No explanation on AP calculation,the current one from previous game.

7.If it is human and walk then the speed is hidden.

8.No tutorial and manual again,really? You want all the new comer just blindly buy your expansive stuff and you don't even have a courtesy to help them to get good?

9.Abstract skirmish setting without proper explanation,income rate,how much?time limit(Duration)? how long?

10.Same problem with unit stats,turn rate?how many second to complete a full turn?Resilient?you means how much hidden HP it has?

11.Allow speculating,how do I spectacle? Zero explanation.

12.LOS is still won't work in building

13.No tutorial on campaign.

14.Armory don't show unit availability to any of the divisions,wanting to make a deck with certain unit is a page flipping chore.

15.No aim time detail.

16.No clear veterancy explanation in-game,just an icon giving you abstract info.

17.If a RTS game has no HP bar then it is not for regular RTS fans but a hidden HP bar is far worse.

The conclusion

Eugen system was my favourite company since their Atari-era but now,ranging from the first protest happened in the gaming industry in many years,firing protesters,downsized the company to less than half employee,abandon of naval in RD,AOA dumping and SD44 overall poor quality,extreme frequent of switching publisher,I won't take their word seriously and believe their ability to revive RTS genre.

I will give it a score of 75%,but judging by the importance and competitive nature of RTS game especially MP,their hostile anti consumer policy on DLC,it means nothing.

The main problem with SP is the broken A.I and extreme tedious gameplay,they also failed their HCI lession badly on this.

For SD44 MP fans,I won't recommend buy it even if I ignore preorder exclusive,the different between SD44 and SD2 is huge,one is more tactical while the other is spammy as hell.

For RD MP fans,you are mostly won't like it,it just different game,one is quick action free for all no rule while the other is complete opposite,as simple as that.No matters how the devs claimed the SD series is the spiritual successor, it is not the same franchise if one derailed far like C&C 3 and C&C 4.

Edit:On further testing,I'm no longer recommend to SP player,the campaign event and ending is liner and offer no sense of accomplishment. At the moment the MrCrisps haven't confirm to do the mod,he made the best mode in SD44 overhaul the gameplay.",1561127268,1561802316,False,20,1,0.52199399471282959,4,True,False,False

I haven’t found a better “tactical” WW 2 battle field experience.

Cons:
Can be too micro intensive to actually be fun. 
Lack of decent tutorial.
Lack of “customization” for campaign / small scope of campaign.
Can be too repetitive.
Is just a reskinned wargame or SD 44.

While there are some interesting and promising features with the campaign, ultimately, I feel it fails to break new ground as it becomes very repetitive too quickly. 

I pre-ordered the game and played the beta some. The tactical combat is decent. The campaign started to feel like a chore way too fast. I was hoping what they were planning to do for the campaign would be better than the SD44 campaign where you have to constantly save scum or play on extra slow... while it's not that, I'm not yet convinced they pulled off something better. The tactical can be too micro intensive for my tastes. They had the right idea with the campaign, but lack of ability to customize your reinforcements for campaign really sucks the fun out of it. You end up having the wrong units go up against the wrong things all the time while getting bombed constantly. I started getting this nagging ""oh not again"" every time i was given the battle option when playing the campaign and this is not what I was hoping for. 

There is a tutorial/manual in the escape menu of the army general campaign, but it is a reading tutorial and mediocre at best. There is also a video on by Eugen that goes over it fairly well also.

For a WW 2 battlefield simulator wargame type game this is excellent, but there are too many quirky flaws that put this in the do not recommend category.

The biggest new Feature compared to Steel Divsion Normandy is the ""Army General"" Mode, where you controll battallions in a operational manner,  and go into tactic battled whenever you attack or get attacked.

This Army General Mode is extremly cool and extremly much fun, but is nearly unplayable.

You CANT Save during battle or inbetween battles when its the AI's turn (which often attacks in 3 -5 different places when they attack). 

And since a defensive battles goes 40 minute (in normal speed and without the time you need to place your units before the battle starts, you are left with 2 options. 

A) Playing for 3-5 hours non stop or
B) let Auto-resolve ruin your battallions (which you cant refill btw)

Therefor i determine the Army General Mode unplayable (and after a week and several hotfixes devs show no sign of changing this ""feature"" of not being able to save). And without the Army General Mode the Steel Division 2 is just an exspansive dlc to Steel division Normandy. so i need to highly recommend not buying it",1561736050,1561736050,False,4,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False

Looking forward to the future of this game and all the other divisions, aces, camo's and whatever else they bring to the mix.  Awesome job on the graphics, the sound, the terrain, realism (while making it fun still).  Ranked play is fun,  Single player is fun... the game as a whole offers so much as far as content goes.  9.5 out of 10 in my book.",1561665029,1561665029,True,2,0,0.506441295146942139,0,True,False,False

Skirmish mode is IDEAL as compared to Steel Division 44 so much so I may never play SD44 skirmish ever again. SD2 skirmish is great because of the 24 Strategic Cap areas that each map or most maps have - this determines if you win the map or not holding more of these than the enemy. 

SOUNDS GRAPHICS
The sounds, and graphics and things are such that I am not waiting on a mod it is great as it is. 

MORE OPTIONS
There are much more options now with skirmish you can do a skirmish against NO enemy. You can do a skirmish and give each side a fixed amount of Deployment Points and then choose to have NO more deployment points ever given during that skirmish - this affords a tiny ""Scenario"" skirmish such that when you take out an enemy unit it means a lot plus its a great way to learn the game besides having NO enemy. 

LOTS OF MAPS
26 different maps if I counted correctly with 4 of them having each 4 different sizes of that map. This does not mean there are 26 maps total there are many more than 26 maps - but there are 26 Different Maps. Full Disclosure I have only played 3 different maps that is because they are so fun and varying with the new Strategic Cap areas that they do not play the same and they are interesting.  SD44 maps were mostly all flat some so stupid in my opinion I never played them. 

BREAKTHROUGH
Breakthrough option now available, in skirmish before in SD44 it was only basically conquest - Breakthrough is a defensive type battle where in you can use defensive structures - barbed wire, machine gun pits, trenches, and gun pits that YOU decide where they are going. 

you can play 4 vs 4 and any combination thereof. 

Because of the Battlegroup enhancement with SD2 this makes skirmishes better so let's end this and talk about Battlegroups. 

Short and Sweet making a Battlegroup is much more complex because of all the options basically that you have. The option to assign levels of experience to your units BEFORE you stick them into your battlegroup  affects the numbers of those units you get AND - may or may not affect at what Phase it is Available. So the deployment points you get in order to make a battlegroup results in  much more strategy to consider when you make a battlegroup. You may stare at your screen for awhile trying to figure out how many of this or that to be able to deploy or you could just autofill and jump right in. Or you could autofill and edit onen or two things about the outofill and jump right in.You may find yourself enjoying tweaking it again and then getting excited looking forward to how this new tweak can play out. 

Finally, for example you can basically put any unit in any Phase you want meaning you can put previously only available in Phase C units with SD44 you can now put them in Phase A, B, or leave em in C. For example, making a battlegroup using the 116 Panzer I can set up my battlegroup to among other things be able to deploy a Panther D - RECON UNIT -  in Phase A !!!  Sounds like fun to me they show up with their cute little light tanks and mech infantry in Phase A and in rolls a Panther D - Front armour 120 mm and Penetration capability of 185 mm woo hoo   albiet it does cost 120 vs an infantry recon unit of 15.

Pros:
- Amazing visuals for a game of this scale.
- Historical accuracy is on-point (for the overwhelming majority of units), especially in the campaign. If you're a stickler for orders of battle, then the campaign will make you blush.
- Extremely customizable army (deck) builder
- Wide unit variety among all three major playable nations (Hungary, German, Soviet Union).
- High skill ceiling means that the very competetive will be able to play with equals as opposed to completely stomping on opponents constantly.
- Very intriguing campaign, especially when it comes to unit variety and player freedom

Cons: 
- Very difficult to learn for those unused to the Wargame and Steel Division series. Many don't know what morale does in the campaign or in battles, and as a result, they are often curb stomped by the Ai and more experienced players.
- Campaign can be repetitive, especially considering the lack of map diversity (players who have a lot of hours will notice that, because of how large the 10v10 maps are, the battles on the campaign will repeatedly use the 10v10 maps, but only portions of it to seem like there is more content).
- Cheese. Like most RTS', there is a meta and a bunch of jabronies will abuse it. If you play this, look up how to counter it.

Meh:
- Voice acting could be improved upon, especially considering voice lines were reused from the first game.
- Graphics can be wonky, especially when zooming in really quickly on moving units, or during forest-fights.
- Trucks disappear after infantry dismounts. I completely understand why (all Wargame players will too), but it breaks immersion slightly.
- Some balancing. Again, this is an RTS, so I do understand, just be prepared for somethings to consistently fail and some to consistently win (P39 fighter bomber, for example).
- The campaign does not open up the concept of alternative history. Like the above ""meh"" remarks, I do understand the reason behind this, but it is nonetheless disappointing.
- The non historically-inclined will have no idea what any of the units within the deck builder are for. For example, ""Lovetz"", the standard Hungarian infantry, make no indication they are elite, standard, or poor just with their name. Soviet units follow a similar pattern.

Overall, I would recommend this game to every RTS player. Once you understand how to build a deck and get a few battles under your belt, this game becomes a blast. One of the great things about the intuitive deck builder is that, while there are metas, you can completely ignore the meta if you are a versatile tactician. The older tank models, for example, seem like they are completely useless. However, resourceful commanders can devastate their opponents who underestimate the older tanks. This applies to every other portion of the army builder, from using lower-caliber guns to ambush vehicles, to using artillery as an anti-tank gun to suprise your enemies.",1561602335,1561602335,True,5,1,0.552751123905181885,0,True,False,False

The only two downsides in my opinion are: 
- you do not really get a proper introduction into the campaign mode. This could be done better. 
-  also the range limitation of 2 km for direct gunfire (tanks, InfGesch.) in my opinion is a big nerf of heavy tanks, tankhunters and infantry gun, in particular the german ones. For Jagdpanther, Nashorn etc. 2 km was a suitable combat distance, please take a look in the tactical manuals for these units (there are some available online, only in german language).

Also saving during the ""Army General"" campaign doesnt work on quitting the game (saves don't appear anywhere) and you can only save if it's your turn!  Since auto-combat pretty much sucks, you'll need a lot of time at hand to play though the enemy turn.

While these are problems that need to be addressed, I don't think they are game breakers.

The gameplay itself is uniquely complex and deserves praise in the way combat evolves compared to other WW2 RTS's.

A player will first need to build a deck of units before starting a match, the deck will be based on a division that will be have its strength in infantry, mechanised, or tanks. You change what units you want to have and at what phase of the game you want to be able to access these units. Each unit has many different stats such as ammo type, range, road and offroad speed, penetration values, armour, view range, camo rating. An infantry squad alone could have multiple weapons such as rifles/smg's/MG's/grenades/AT rifles that all have different stats such as damage/range/suppression/ammo. Building and changing the deck to suit your playstyle is one of the biggest strengths of the game and definitely something that it deserves praise for.

Once you get into a game, you will have to learn where your units will be most effective, while spacing them out accordingly to avoid bombardments from artillery and air strikes. New players will definitely find this very difficult as it has a fairly steep learning curve due to new players not being able to micromanage small groups of units effectively. There is also a large number of different historically accurate units so it will take time and experience to learn the effectiveness of each of your units as well as basic knowledge of the units you are fighting (WW2 enthusiasts will have an easier time).

If you enjoy WW2 strategy games and can handle a complex challenge then this is a game you might enjoy. If you want an easier WW2 strategy experience then I might suggest Company of Heroes 2. If you have played Men of War then this has about the same learning curve.

I don't post reviews. In fact this is my first one. But this game deserves it. Sure it has a few bugs here and there but this is a game that really knocks the genre out of the park.  As an officer in the Army I find games don't have a good balance of the intricate and delicate balance of the strategic, operational and tactical levels of war. Hearts of Iron IV does a very good job with the strategic and somewhat with the operational but lacks the tactical. Steel Division 2 does a phenomenal job nailing the tactical and operational levels that I have yet to see in any other game. 

Does it have a few bugs? Sure.

Is this a truly committed and passionate dev team that has been listening to its fanbase all through development? You're goddamn right.

This team has taken a very challenging task, starting morphing it into a direction and used the beta process as it is designed to fine tune the game.

The mods and devs that are left still have the same pompous attitude (which really really isn't doing them any favors).   They also decided to throw in the scummy practice of having 2 divisions only available if you pre-order the game.  There is no longer a way to obtain those divisions... it was a cheap cash grab and rubs me the wrong way.   I don't mind exclusive cosmetics but if there are units that are plain unobtainable in any way then it really throws off the sense of fair games, regardless of whether it has an impact or not.  For what it's worth I think they do have an impact and having the units just be straight up unobtainable is a huge negative.  Luckily I own SD'44 (a mistake) so I got the 8 divisions from the ""back to war pack"" for free.  However, if you don't have SD'44 you're fucked.  Prepare to pay an extra 25 bucks for meta divisions from SD'44 on top of the base game just to be competitive.

Unfortunately they went even more towards the ""spammy epic"" playstyle.  There's very little emphasis on preservation of units this time around, instead it's common to send them in as waves as the phases come up.  Individual units matter much less, the income is much faster, there's way more units in general, and suppression is really all that matters.   It's almost a mix between strategy and tactics now during the battles when before they were much more tactical.  As a result positioning matters much less (though it does still come into play).  I'm still not a huge fan of some of the wonky aspects of the morale system either, I don't like penetration or crit chances changing based on the morale of the unit.  There's other times where it seems completely off as well... too many times.

I find it to be generally a much faster style that doesn't translate to much faster battles.  Part of the reason I fell off WG RD near the end was I found it to be encouraging spam with their balance changes.  SD44 took it farther with the spam and SD2 takes it to the extreme.   I also don't like that they took out the destruction game mode.  I have over 500 hours OF ACTUAL PLAY TIME in the WG franchise and only 16 in SD '44 and the reasons remain in SD2.

I'm refunding this for now and maybe getting it on sale later... but probably not.  I don't like the direction this company is going, I generally don't like the remaining developers' attitudes, I don't like the DLC practices, I don't like their labor dispute or the way that are handling it, and the community is still as terrible as ever albeit much smaller.   Not to mention the fact that they had to delay the game for months because they were too busy firing people 5 days before xmas for daring to stand up for themselves.  The studio is a shell of it's former self at about 25% of it's peak employment and IT DOES SHOW.

Eugen.... what the f happened?

I'll be following the open source initiative called ""project field warning""... it looks promising and with the open source engine lends itself to many different settings.  All I know is I miss the glory days of WG where points and units mattered and tactics were much more pronounced over spam.  Yes it was way slower... yes you could fuck up royally and lose all your units in a second... and I liked it like that and apparently so did others because it doesn't look like this game is doing it for people.",1561255063,1561422171,False,408,21,0.780073344707489014,80,True,False,False

As for performance, I only have an Laptop with onboard graphics (i7-7500U @ 2.70GHz RAM 16 GB Intel HD Graphics 620). With those Wargame Red Dragon looked and ran great on medium settings.

Steel Division is complex and rewards players for the time they invest in it by providing the best real-time tactical representation of combined arms warfare on the market. If you are totally new to Eugen's games, there will be a steep learning curve to this game, but there is a strong community of youtube content creators and experienced players in the community to help you get started. Those who have played previous Eugen titles, such as SD:N44, or the Wargame series (Red Dragon, European Escelation, etc) will find in this game an improved iteration on the mechanics of Wargame combined with aspects of SD:N44. I would like to praise in particular the outstanding flexibility in how you build your army division and approach the game: there is a huge variety of units and other strategic choices that players make before they even begin a multiplayer match.

Moreover, my initial impressions of the Army General mode are very positive. Army General is a new turn-based single-player strategy experience. In that mode, the player deploys numerous battlegroups across different parts of the eastern front in focused recreations of real military operations. Battlegroups engage one another in combat and battles can be fought in real-time (with or without AI teammates) or auto-resolved (such as in the Total War games). However, be aware that this new mode is lacking any sort of tutorial.

I’ve been waiting for a game able to merge tactical and strategical level for a long time.
The wait is not over.
Steel Div 1 was already a very good tactical WW2 game. Steel 2 is slightly better.
I don’t like the new graphics much. I preferred the “old” one. The icons were nicer and clearer, but these are still fine. Still an excellent tactical level game.
The big news for me was supposed to be the Campaign mode. I guess there’s a reason why it’s never been part of the Beta testing. It’s so raw, so unpolished. It’s simply the beginning of an idea.
There’s really no strategy. The four “campaigns” are not linked. Each campaign spans a few km and a few days.
Autoresolve will mostly ends in a defeat, while fighting live is fun but takes A LOT of time and you cannot save!!! Why? Just tell me why!?!?
After the first turns the game turns into an apparent WW1 trench war. Lots of units massed without any clear logic on both sides.
Quite difficult to understand who will be attacking and who will be able to defend as artillery (and bombers) now can take a unit out of the tactical level at the strategic level.
There’s no unit fatigue, there’s no experience gaining, there’s no unit reinforcing (only new predetermined units), so many (simple and less simple) things are missing.
Units can apparently build bunkers (and trenches, barbed wire, gun pits) in half a day. After one week they have the same amount of fortification they had after half a day turn! How does that make any sense?
There’s no apparent weather impact (probably because the time span is so short that they already know the weather was always fine).
The campaign HUD is painful. Adding new units to the fight is unnecessarily cumbersome and unpolished. It was much easier in Steel 1.
For some reason units have only three different deployment costs in campaign: 1 for most units, 3 for tanks and arty and 8 for bombers.
It’s beyond me why the deployment of a Tiger “costs” as much as the deployment of an infantry gun or as much as a Pz II.
They added a nice idea, the possibility of putting some of your units under AI control. It’s a very nice and useful idea, especially because some of the maps are frankly too big to be played in real time.
However the implementation is once again quite mediocre. To do that you must give up way too many deployment points and there’s no way to direct/assign the AI to areas or tasks. It will simply overlap to your units and your line of defense/attack.
Air units and artillery units are no longer support units. Now you have to decide whether to take to the battle one infantry regiment or an air squadron (out of three). It makes no sense, especially since you won’t know until you are in the battle whether you’ll be facing tanks or infantry or other air units, … while it could make sense in surprise attacks, not so much in WWI style engagements where you’ve been facing your opponent for the past three or four days.
Mostly air combat is out of the equation in real time. It plays a role only at the “strategic” level.
There is no way to customise your divisions, to change a bit what you bring to the front, to switch quantity for quality or arty support for air support, or … basically no strategic decisions at all.

Bottom line. Still a great tactical game. The “campaign” is very, very far from being just acceptable. I finished them all in a couple of days. No replayability value, not much fun either.

With that out of the way...

I think this game is a large improvement over SD:44 - SD 2 takes a solid foundation laid out by the previous game and expands on it in several significant ways.

The Phase System/ Deck Building is revamped so that one of the biggest complaints - the limited units in Phase A, B amd C - can be largely negated by the player, if they choose. Want a King Tiger or IS-2 to be rollling down your front lines in the first minute of the game? Go for it - but you only get one of them. Slot them into Phase C of your deck, though, and you can bring in many more at the end of the game.

The other big complaint of SD:44 - the dynamic frontline system - has also been revamped. Now the players need to control various strategic locations such as villages, crossroads, supply depots or elevated plateaus. Since we now can better guess where our opponents might move to, we can better plan an attack, defense or ambush.

Real-world values have been added to the combat system - so now instead of a tank having an arbitrary Armor Value of 9 and Weapon Power of 11, the tanks now have 100mm of effective armor and a penetration value of 145mm on their main gun. Vehicles may also now carry a variety of shell types such as HEAT or APCR, based on real-world layouts.

Infantry types have been expanded upon. Some artillery units now have radio communications, and if you bring an artillerist in your deck, those radio-equipped guns will get an accuracy and rate of fire boost onto targets within the artillerist's area of influence, as their crews are able to receive real-time updates.

Or you might decide to take military-police units such as the infamous NKVD, which prevent your units from surrendering in the face of heavy enemy fire.

On top of this, you get to play with all they historically accurate and iconic troops and equipment of the Eastern Front, as well as some ""oddballs"" such as the Hungarian Nimrod.

In all, the game improves on SD:44 in ways which were directly influenced by feedback from the players.",1561385708,1561385708,True,1,4,0.431104451417922974,1,True,False,False

I played Wargame: Airland Battle for the first time a awhile back.  it was fun and I really enjoyed it (That was my first ever RTS). I then played Red Dragon when it came out. I was shocked when I saw it had ships (Although I never really came to enjoy the naval battles). My favorite factions to fight with in Red Dragon were: Japan, ROK, DPRK, USA, USSR, and ofcourse the PRC. When Steel Division: Normandy '44 arrived on Steam and I saw it was Eugen's next RTS, I was so excited and didn't even read the reviews and purchased it. To my surprise it was no where near Wargame: Airland or Red Dragon. But had the vibes of them. Normandy lagged for me (Given this was before I had recommended specs) and it didnt look or feel the same as Airland or Red Dragon. Not to mention the updated UI threw me off and had a deeper learning curve so I refunded it. When Steel Division 2 (This game) came out, I have a new computer with better specs and have more time to learn the game. So I bought it for me and my good friend who bought me Airland and Red Dragon (He was like me and it looked cool, so they were our first RTS'). After our installations finished, we spent an hour or so in Discord helping each other out to find out how everything worked since it was different than Airland, Red Dragon, and Normandy. Finally we got our decks (Battlegroups/Divisions) made and sorted and we spent another hour in our own Skirmishes against AI to learn the game mechanics etc. Finally we got to what we'd been waiting for! MULTIPLAYER COOP. We'd waited two hours (Because of learning the game a bit) to get into Co op and when we finally spent a little time to set our units and things up in breakthrough mode as defenders, as soon as we launched the battle, the game stuttered with some sort of internet latency issue and it was nearly impossible to do anything after the AI started throwing mass amounts of units at us. So we both stopped and havn't come back to it since a few days (since we installed). He's more or less mad because of it. So am I, money wasted because we cant play together really. We both have good internet connections and speed so it was nothing on our side.

Multiplayer is pretty unforgiving as with all Eugen games as players tend to form super pub stomps which is sad but inevitable with this style of RTS. 

I played a lot of Wargame since EE and that is still my favorite RTS to date due to the variety of dates and play styles and was not a huge fan of SD44. This Steel Division has turned me in favor of the series and so far I have sunk 20 hours out of a pretty hectic life to get some more Army General playing in.

Great campaign (once you learn the play)
Easy flow for tactical battles
Challenging AI
Good multiplayer in random battles or vs set up teams
Beautiful look

CON:

No tutorial for AG
Steep learning curve for MP
DLC prices are too steep

not sure why it is doing this? 
also if you have a close support wing they tend to refuel and return very quickly, and that can dominate the battle. May need to reduce the amount of aircraft in a tactical battle, I can commit a CS wing to a battle of 40 aircraft but only need or can use a few of them. maybe better if the close support was over an area like fighter supremacy and have a few aircraft available in tactical battles. also if you commit your CS wing to one battle it isnt available for any others that turn....
people have been complaining about so much Russian artillery. well they had a huge amount of artillery, so thats good.
you need to learn how to hide from it.
There are 4 campaigns of various difficulty, once you get to know the gameplay system you can organise your attacks and defense quite well. and does up to a point reflect historically how the battles played out.

Pro:
- historic accurate battlegroups with lots of diffrent units

- athmosperic campaign

I spent over 1000 hours playing wargame and enjoyed it but I just can't enjoy this.

Not having 2v2 , 3v3 and 4v4 matchmaking will ensure a dead multiplayer community in the coming months just like Steel Division 1944 died. 

DLC costs are insane for what is essentially an indie game charging AAA game prices and Preordering DLC. You will spend well over $100 to get all the content in this game and if its like previous Eugen DLC you will essentially have to buy the DLC to remain competitive in its niche hardcore multiplayer community. Then there is the "" Back to War "" DLC which is you paying $25 for 8 divisions that are literally reused assets.

Not having tutorials in a game this complex for Single player campaigns or multiplayer in 2019 is just not acceptable. Madmatt tells people to read the manual but there is no way that will prepare you for the learning cliff that you are about to be thrown of when buying this game. I remember how brutal it was to start playing Wargame and the only way I got decent was watching videos made by people like Razzman.

There are improvements over Wargame such as the following 

Single Player AI
LOS Tool 
Conquest Points 
Not as many useless units when it comes to deck building

The game was also delayed two months and still is full of bugs. My time spent playing the singleplayer campaign gets cut short from crashes and half the time I am confused as to how everything interacts due to having zero tooltips or anything. Even a basic FAQ about how it works would be a step up from nothing.

TLDR

If you like singleplayer RTS games set in world war 2 you might very much enjoy this game but I would not pay full price for it. The developers want you to pay AAA game prices for an indie game made by a studio of 30 frenchmen who don't listen to their community.",1561329805,1561329805,False,7,0,0.53271031379699707,0,True,False,False

Some good improvements graphically and quality of life, the new Breakthrough game mode is a lot of fun (The AI seems much better than before). That's all the good stuff I have to say, the amount of improvements feel like an expansion to me not a entirely new game especially at 40$ (They did give a ""few"" divisions from the first game free to owners of it for the second game, which is better than nothing, but still bs as all the content should have been in the base game anyway, espically after the fiasco that was Steel Division One, and I cant believe they charge people 25$ for this...shame), so the faux good will gesture is kind of lost upon me, now onto the bad.

Wargame Red Dragon is an amazing game (You should buy and support this game to let dev's know they have support for a great game that doesn't rip people off through dlc and arbitrary pre-order bonuses, and delivered a unmatched / unparalleled rts experience). I would go on to say that Steel Divison 1-2 was designed to dlc you to death to buy more divisons for each nation with how the deckbuilding is designed and restricted compared to the way it was done in Wargame European Escalation, Wargame Airland Battle and Wargame Red Dragon (All Amazing games, especially in European Escalation, how you had to earn experience and unlock new units to add to your deck, that was so rewarding and added so much to the game, I miss that feature so much). I would also consider these games (Especially Red Dragon, the culmination) some of the  best tactical rts's ever, especially if your into modern era warfare). In these previous games your unit pools are available by nationality (Or coalitions which combined multiple nationality's) were huge and pretty much unrestricted except by deck type (Motorized, Marines etc). The most fun of the game for me was having huge range of choices to customize your deck and within each nation the amount of variety was staggering. The DLC model for Wargame Red Dragon released entire nations and their units for you to customize decks (You built and invented your own ""Divisons"" out of massive unit pools for each nation, unlike Steel Division where units are preselected from a nationallity and restricted to that premade divison, so now they can keep selling you a nations divisons so you have to pay a bunch of times to access the entire unit roster, and even after you pay, still cant make decks out of the general pile of units, you can only use the presets they gave you, ingenious to microtransact and dlc you and still not even get the full experience they use to provide you with).

Lets fast forward to Steel Division 2. Decks are now called Battle-groups, okay no big deal, but now instead of getting all of a country's units, you create your ""Battle-group"" from a Division (Which there are many for each of the main country's the game is based around, Germany Vs Russia in 2), there's a few other nations included in Division selection but only a couple. So why does this suck? Let me tell you why, because now when you build a deck you are restricted to a handful of units that are linked to that specific division, you don't get all of Germany's units to build a deck from, you get a specific set assigned to that division you chose. This limits the best part of the game for me, open varied deck building, and forces you into presets, why did they do this? Because they are monetizing the hell out of their game. Exclusive divisions to preordering, day one dlc, and not one or two but a few. All dlc almost as expensive as the base game. Everything in the dlc is all the things I would expect to see in a base game. Historical mode with additional divisons and units, with some campaigns, some skins for units? 25$ / 35$ extra dollars.... LOL. 

Lets Recap, Eugen made three amazing wargame series games. They came out with Steel Dvision (Normandy 44), it was pretty terrible, they gave up and dropped it. Instantly turned around and worked on 2, monetized and restricted the game to make you buy all kinds of additional dlcs. The core experience is restricted compared to how it use to be so they can part it out and sell you all the little pieces you use to get when you, you know actually bought the game. I wont condone or support this behavior so the company gets my negative review for breaking apart and restricted what could have been a amazing game if they gave it to you like a decent company would (Like they use to for their other great games that made them such a company in the first place). 

Good core game-play, its a shame they restricted the internal workings to make money and take away the freedom and deck variety. I will still play this because I spent 40 dollars on the base game and I cannot refund it, I will not buy the bs dlc, and I will be bitter at the company and not buy further products until they stop being greed elementals and chopping the game up and restricting it to take all your cash. This game could have been a 8/10, but instead they restricted it and chopped it up, so I would rate it a 4/10 and not recommend it or any future products by this company until they change their ways.

Players new to the series beware, there is no tutorial included with the game, there's a decent learning curve to Wargame series games and it might be rough to break into, and its kind of weak for the company to ignore the tutorial completely. Maybe they'll sell it to you like the rest of the game they chopped apart if your lucky. No manual either. I'm surprised the base game came with music and graphics options, they could have sold those also.

The game does seem well optimized and ran silky for me (Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti, 16 gigs of ram, Intel Core i7 6700K 4.00 GHz, all options max, 1080p).",1561321426,1561322069,False,11,1,0.525556325912475586,0,True,False,False

If you dont know about phases and the like then you are in for much furrowed brow and much swearing at your screen. It is a basic oversight on the developers fault.

However there is Youtube - but why should you have to go there to ""learn"" a game... it this laziness or an oversight? People do use Tube for their games but in my experience not for the basics - its usually to look at other peoples theorycrafting or to get a deeper understanding.

I played hours in the Beta and must say I do like this so far. Counter Battery Fire by the AI does seem OP and Anti-Aircraft batteries are useless unless grouped up making them a target for the aforementioned CBF.

I try to make Kampgruppe - like a miniature army battlegroup.... So a bit of everything all together. Problem with this is you are jack of all trade and master of none.

Bottom line I would recommend this title to people who have played Wargame series or SD1 - if you have no idea wtf I am talking of then have a look at their Youtube content.

1.This game is a great successor to the previous one, with many of the dynamics and specialties between units being fixed. For example, had a fantastic game which involved an infantry fight over a town where small arms were used to great effect. Sure I could have brought in my heavy arty and completely flattened the town but I would have removed all cover for my infantry units to be able to hold in against counter-attacks. Instead I ended up using mortars which provided the fire support my infantry needed while not being overkill to destroy the town. While this may seem like a strange thing to bring up it’s little things like this that I really appreciate about this game over the previous one. New cover dynamics also allow infantry to more effectively hide in towns and wooded areas. I would be here forever describing them all but in short I am very satisfied with how Eugen have done this.
2.The new feature of terrain elevation is a welcome change and adds huge value to strategic thinking. Maps are also deigned in a way that requires mixed-unit tactics whereas in the previous one a decent AT gun could probably hold an area quite happily until stage B.
3.The new modes involving CTF towns and strategic positions as opposed to SD1’s version of having a dynamically moving front representing each teams control of the map. The new “breakthrough” mode is also a lot of fun.
4.The campaign map mode provides a lot more meat to this game for players who want more strategic choices beyond the simple PVP skirmish modes. Here campaign map decisions have a serious impact on battles you fight with your armies.
5.Greatly improved visuals (game now looks amazingly pretty).

Cons:

1. Eugen seems to have decided to sneak in historical inaccuracy once again under the guise of “balancing”. I’m a big history buff so this really rubs me the wrong way: For example the Sherman Jumbo has more frontal armor than the King Tiger?!? This was corrected in the previous game (albeit in an inaccurate way) by making the KT +1 more than the Jumbo in Frontal armor (which is still completely wrong) but seem to have decided to go back on this in this game. Before someone accuses me of being pro-German in this game I like to point out that the T-34 1V1 with a Panzer4 will win. This is realistic and I really like it not to mention making it a lot more of a challenge for the player on the German side in the initial stages. Life isn’t balanced so why the hell should historical games be? The thing I like about this game is a lot of the time having to adapt and work with the strengths and weaknesses of your deck. Unfortunately on some units Eugen have decided balancing is suddenly worth more than idea that pretty much their entire game is based around? I was expecting to play as the Soviets and being able to flood the Germans with t-34s while struggling to make a frontal attack on armor or a fortified position wielding a 8.8 cm pak 43 without huge numbers. While I don’t think these aspects are a game-breaker I hope they certainly tweak some of these mechanics in the future.

Also furthermore: I don’t understand why people are annoyed at exclusive decks for pre-orders? This is usually the other way around with people who pre-ordered the game geting annoyed at being told they are getting these exclusive units and visuals after paying 2-4x the price of the base game only to find that the game dev’s sell the same offer to regular players later down the line for $5!? I agree if these decks are unbalanced this isn’t right but then again suppose butt-hurt everywhere..",1561283718,1561283718,True,13,0,0.53704226016998291,0,True,False,False

SD Normandy '44 was a very good game, but its campaigns were underwhelming -- not really true campaigns, just series of scenarios with no player input into what happened on the operational scale. It was disappointing after seeing the excellent dynamic campaigns of Airland Battle and Red Dragon.

The campaigns are what makes SD II a masterpiece.

First, kudos to Eugen for not dumbing things down. The Orders of Battle are impressively authentic. Making battalions the primary maneuver unit was a very smart decision. Gives the player wonderful operational flexibility. 

SD II rivals the Graviteam Tactics games, Mius Front and Tank Warfare. That's about the highest praise I can give it. There was really nothing out there to compete with Graviteam Tactics until SD II came along. Between Mius Front and SD II, there's simply NO other game out there that recreates combat on the Eastern Front in such a deep, authentic, and engaging way. 

I had sky-high hopes for SD II from the very first dev diary. I'm incredibly pleased to say, Eugen has pulled it off.

A must-buy for fans of sophisticated, non-arcady WWII wargames.

First off, if you were a fan of either Steel Division Normandy 44 or the Wargame series, you should get this game.  Its a return to the scale of the Wargame series ( hundreds of tanks if two armored groups clash), combined with refined versions many of the core gameplay improvements from SDN44 (LOS tool, Towed artillery/AT, platoon leaders, queing commands before match start, etc.).  There's around 25 skirmish maps, historical scenarios, and four campaigns, so plenty of single and multiplayer content.  Is it perfect?  No, there's always room for some balance tweaks (right now tank destroyers seem very fragile even at long range and in cover, presumably something else will arise once that is fixed) and the AI is unnaturally good at counter-battery compared to a human (or at least me and anyone I've played against).

If you are new, I would still highly encourage this game.  It sits at a comfortable mix between realistic and not so hard on the realism to be unplayable. The learning curve can be steep, and you will probably have to start with the AI.  Luckily, the best feature of Steel Division is that you can fully customize the battlegroups (the selection of units from a parent division or corps) that the game uses in a skirmish battle. These can be selected for both yourself and the AI, you can engineer scenarios to help you learn how to play against certain things.  Brand new?  Give yourself a normal armored division and the AI a couple squads of partisans - you'll be able to learn how to move troops around the battlefield and deploy arty and air strikes under conditions like being on a training base.  Struggling to win versus tanks - make it an armor only battlefield.  After you've played the historical scenarios that come with the game, you can essentially create your own for any skirmish by dictating the units for both sides and, if your playing with friends, imposing some unofficial victory conditions amongst yourselves. 

 The game has hundreds of different units from many nations, which is a little daunting.  It also makes the game more interesting.  This is the first world war II RTS I've played were not only can you play as a Hungarian calvary division, its even somewhat competitive.  Both sides have all the staples that you would expect (Tigers, T-34s, ppshs, Zis-3, MG-42, etc.) but also rare and older equipment ( Panzer IIs, captured french tanks for Germany, lend-lease Shermans, Grants, and Valentines, Turans). I think that it because of the scale of the battles, the gameplay mechanics (battle proceeds in three phases, as more and more resources are directed to the front from the recon forces to the main effort) and the attention to detail the game operates and conquers a unique niche.",1561264115,1561264115,True,2,0,0.518042623996734619,0,True,False,False

The largest issues that were present in the first game have been ratified (namely the morale system and air power balancing) - to be honest, this is the state they should've released the first game in, and in that sense it is very similar to Wargame: Air Land Battle. 

The multiplayer modes and co-op (which can be played with either players or AI) scenarios are excellent; however, the Army General single player mode is in dire need of some kind of tutorial mode given the complexity of the mechanics it implements - it is almost impossible to figure out without prior research.

If you liked SD44, or liked Wargame (but aren't a salty boi whenever something non-wargame comes out), or just like strategy games in general I recommend this game. This game is much more fun and enjoyable than SD44, and with Historical Battles, Skirmish breakthrough and conquest as well as the new Army General mode the single player potential alone is worth the price. The main issue I have with the game is the lack of tutorial, meaning many people new to the series can have trouble at the beginning but this can be overcome with video tutorials (Eugen have some official ones on their channel) and just playing Skirmish against easy/medium AI until you learn the basic mechanics.

Pros: 
-Marked improvement over  SD44 in every way, combining some features such as the larger battlefield of wargame sucessfully.
-Enjoyable and fun gameplay, which is IMO way less frustrating than SD44 due to a few subtle changes
-AI on skirmish isn't retarded, a little too cautious at times but overall seems better than SD44
-A huge variety of units in game, many of which are viable. There aren't many units that stick out to me as being a must avoid unit.
-The maps are beautiful, varied, and HUGE, each much feels different yet fun, so far there aren't any MUST AVOID maps in this game unlike SD44
- Army General has huge potential, but I've only put a couple of hours into it so far so can't comment too much on it.

Cons:

There are 2 issues with it:
1) The strategic units (battalions etc) that you fight with are really incomplete in terms of what categories of units they bring. Most units completely lack any air defense for example. As you can only bring 3 of these units in battle many battles being bizarre in terms of what units you can use. It is common for example to see battles where both sides built 15 bombers because no one has any air defense or fighters. I do not believe this is realistic or fun to play.

2) It is just too long. The maps are so large that I often end up playing at half speed and so a single battle takes 1,5 hours. A campaign has an enormous amount of fairly unimportant battles, so I feel very little progress is being made on the campaign.

From the penetration systems being worse, to the infantry combat being less fluid, to 70% of the infantry not being dangerous to any level of tanks, to tanks themselves being useless as anything other than a combined arms strategy, to bombers/fighters being useless themselves against tanks, to AA being pointless outside of discouraging bombers from doing anything other than running away- the Steel Division series carries with it the assumption that decreased  vision and lethality somehow makes the game better. 

But decreased lethality doesn't make the game more fun. It just makes the game take longer. and feel more random when your stuff gets one-shot from the fog because your tank can't see 50 meters ahead of him, or when your bomber has a perfect attack run lined up on an enemy, only to stop from dropping a bomb 'cause he's scared, or even worse, you drop the bomb, but it's got a 40% chance to one-shot your target, but RNG screws you so... Suck it up?

Some more gripes: Leaders are incredibly important, but they functionally act as a macro tax for bad players. The campaign is expansive and seems wonderful, but the mechanics aren't explained anywhere, present you incredibly incomplete information, and punish the hell out of you for messing up even a single engagement, to the point that you can roll into a battle and waste 40 minutes (because you can't save in either battle, or in the engagement screen) because when you engaged, you didn't notice the enemy had 3 hidden divisions they pulled out of their ass because divisions in SD2 apparently don't know how forward recon elements work....

In Red Dragon, literally all of these problems didn't exist. AA was powerful, but was weak to SEAD. Tanks had enough vision and damage to control the battlefield from vast distances, but were vultnerable to helis or aircraft. Aircraft could actually competently kill stuff, but if you hadn't cleared enemy AA, you only got one good run. *ALL* infantry was dangerous to tanks, but infantry was costly, and bad infantry became supremely ineffective past a first volley. Leadership mattered, but not to the point that units reloaded 3x faster and had near 100% accuracy and couldn't break when they had max ranks. Morale existed, but your units didn't immediately surrender when a fkin' rookie unit dropped a single handgrenade on them, because they got too close in a forest. Napalm was actually a Dot, instead of a random % chance to permanently stun an infantry. Tank v. Tank mechanics meant that superheavies were actually worth their value, instead of weight of numbers and adaptation of accuracy naturally rendering superheavies useless via volume of fire, panic, random crits, and a bullshit armor system that ignores angling. In the campaign, the rules were simple enough that a tutorial wasn't required, and though it was simple, the emphasis was on creating fun tactical battles with interesting combinations of units- not a drag-out slow slog of a war of attrition where both sides have to position for a fight over several stupid turns, only for the ultimate battle to be fought by only 3! groups of troops that have the *least* weaknesses, instead of *all* of your troops, with all the fun toys. 

In short, Red Dragon was *FUN*. Units mattered, high tier units (Unicorns) mattered more (and could meatgrinder what they countered), battles were shorter, mechanics made more sense, the campaign was simple-stupid and about doing cool shit, being a noob wasn't punished as hard due to speed of deployment/engagement, and lack of the bullshit phase system that HEAVILY punishes early losses, the randomness was heavily mitigated due to high accuracy and high ROF on units that mattered...

SD 1 & 2 have/are none of these things. Unicorns are bad, movement is slow, accuracy by volume is prioritized over actual accuracy, nothing can see jack-shit in front of them except recon units, mechanics are obscure to the point that EUGEN has outsourced explaining them to youtubers, the campaign is unintuitive, grindy, and boring (but oh, think of the historical accuracy!), the glacial pace of the phase system just means you take 30 minutes to get shit on if you don't know how to play, the LOS and non-functional armor system means you can get randomly one-shot side-shot from a 50 degree front-facing angle @ 2000 meters, and the lack of accuracy on the move means your expensive tanks act more as heavily armored AT guns than actual tanks.

The diversity of maps and terrain is great unlike the first installment where it was mainly hedgerows and the occasional hill or airfield, though I can't complain since it was based around Normandy anyway. The victory point system has been revamped with the points being key strategic locations like bridges, some hills, a forest or a city. Whoever holds the the majority of points wins. In the first installment it had this 'frontline' mechanic where it would calculate the percentage of territory one has, which frankly ruined the strategy aspect for me, so I'm glad that they threw it away.

I do enjoy the scenarios and custom battles with friends but without some sort of progression, or growth besides skill, this game is doomed to be a wasteland with no players in the next month. 

They should do themselves a huge favor and open up the Steam Workshop for this game like they did with SD1. Let the community add content so that the game doesn't die a death it does not deserve. If I could make scenarios and maps right now, I would be spending most of my time in game doing that. 

There is a huge amount of potential here, just needs the communities polish to really bring out the best.

- beautiful graphics, sounds, and atmosphere
- good physics
- better customization of battle groups (deployment phase, skill level, and transport infantry comes with)
- breakthrough mode with static defenses

Cons:
- numerous annoying bugs that do not get taken care of despite having been reported early on in the beta (that is what a beta used to be for)
- some static defenses look unrealistic, e.g. straight-lined trenches instead of the common zig-zag pattern
- [u]no total destruction mode anymore[/u]: instead there is a [b]forced time limit - you have no choice but to play this game under an unforgiving time pressure and when you are just about to enjoy your impending victory... nope, the game ends with a draw or even defeat --> highly dissatisfying & makes it feel like an arcade game[/b]

This game brings the large scale combat of Red Dragon & the deck building from the Wargame series and turns it into a well rounded WW2 Wargame with plenty of map, game modes and divisions to play it out on.

Long gone is the absolute shit frontline game mode from Steel Div 1 with the pitiful lack of units to play and being locked in with terrible divisions that no one cares about.

Now I can play as the Panzer Lehr and drop 5 Panzer IV's and a KT in the deployment phase and punch an armored fist straight into the center of the map.

Multiplayer : excellent, the realism in the battles, being able to customize your own divisions, spending hours deciding which may be the best deck or tactics for you, knowleadge of the maps, you can even use real military tactics against your opponents.
 It is really good and solid. Yes it will get patched overtime for balance, but thats fair

Army general ( campaign ) : Oh god, the idea is fantastic, but it lacks of a proper tutorial, even experienced players such as me ( over 500 h ) have problems to get started and learn the mecanics because they are really complex. And here is where problems begin :

Come on Eugen wtf we wanted a big battlefield in which we could deploy thousands of units, we got the big battlefields but guess what, (hahaha ) only 3 '' cards '' can fight at the same time in a battle '' gg you killed the experience yourselves. 

Since the game is really complex and the ¨¨ regiments/ divisons ¨ are really focused on one main role ( inf, art, aa, at, armour, air ...) giving us only 3 slots to fight battles breaks the game. It leads to some really unfun battles where the AI will only spam planes, artillery...  whyle you conquer the rest of the map. it is very unbalanced, and therefore not fun.. This is just gamebreaking. Army general mode has potential to be the best ¨ wargame series ¨ campaign but it really needs a lot of work. It needs and increase in the amount of '' cards '' you can bring to battle at least to 5 or even more, otherwise it is to unbalanced.

The second big flaw : the maps are so big you cant even properly deploy your units through all the map, unless you let the AI command them ( not fun, the AI will do less than a human and lose more units, since they cant be repalaced. Each loss is definitive. Fun fact about this is if you choose the AI to control one of your 3 cards its even more unbalanced.  Why you might be asking ? Because  whyle you get 40 deployment points if u play by your own, if you decide to coop with the AI, it gets 40 points + the 40 you get. Instead of that couldnt we just get 80 points and play by ourselves ? 

I am just hopping for mods that fix this mess, or an update from eugen. This issues really break the game and make a fantastic title that could be so fun, tedious and boring because you are figting battles where there isnt any balance since you/ AI dont get enought cards aviable in the battle to make it balanced and really intense.  Sure i got 2 or 3 really fun engagements, ( because it was tanks vs tanks + infatry ) but the other 3 or 4 where just capture the falgs whyle the AI spams planes and anti air because it is the only thing it has aviable to throw at you. Guess I will play multiplayer and try again the campaign when the mods or and update from the devs solve this issues. 

If u have ten full stack cards against ten full stack cards in a battle whats the problem ? After all  the maps are huge and implementing this option would lead to massive fights with all kind of equipment and units which again is what the most of us want.

As son as we get mods that solve this issue or an update from the devs i will change to a '' recommended ''

This game is an artillery-game in the camouflage suit of second world war called ""PANIC - the artillery-game"". Beautiful models and maps but no tactical depth. It seems to be tactical with all the gun- and armour-values. But the game-mechanic isn't balanced or not even working. It doesn't matter how strong your units are... the artillery sets everything into panic and a single unit makes your army surrender. All players in MP and even the AI-armies in SP works like this. So finally the tactical value of a single unit is all the same, KingTiger or soldier on bicycle armed with a screwdriver... the artillery kills or panic it, you can't control it anymore and it's going somewhere and gets shot or surrenders. Battles are just about who kills more artillery than he loses artillery. If there would be the possibility to heavily reduce the amount of artillery, this game has a huge potential. But not now. Or am I too old to understand the game? Counter-artillery doesn't work, air-strike doesn't work.

The core game itself is pretty solid. However, there are some critical cons that in my opinion make this game a 'no' at full price:

- There is no proper tutorial. This is somewhat offset by pretty decent tool tips. But even with hundreds of hours in the Wargame series, I found certain aspects confusing. How various mechanics tie together is not directly apparent.

- Content that was available in the beta has been removed and is now Day 1 DLC. Adding insult to injury (almost literally), the UI screams 'YOU CAN'T GET THIS WITHOUT DLC'. Eugen, don't learn how to DLC from Paradox. (Note: Apparently this was announced, but not ingame -- so I didn't know.)

- I find it somewhat unclear exactly what you get from the various DLCs.

- The Army General mode (strategic campaign) is unclear and confusing compared to the campaigns in the Wargame series. It may be better once you get into it, but I didn't have the chance within the refundable time period. In short, I miss more/better SP gameplay that isn't Skirmish mode. (I don't play multi, so ymmv.)

- Parts of the game is somewhat unpolished, and there may be balance issues. However, I'm refunding the game so I can't play enough to uncover all of them.

Let me begin with the positive feedback. As I began with Wargame:EE and was playing multiplayer for the most part, my satisfaction comes largely from that direction. The divisions are OK in my opinion, when emphasis is placed on some sort of historical role play. Gameplay-wise it is not as flexible as wargame-style decks, but is not an issue. What I like compared to SD44 is the selection of infantry and arty transports and veterancy variety. Also the new commander-leaders OOB is an excellent addition. Overall, I really enjoy the multiplayer.

What I find not that good is the SP campaign. In the strategic sense it is OK-ish, but some of the map abilities such as bombard for artillery and bombers are quite awkward and offer a lot of room for cheesy strats without ever fighting a tactical battle in the sense that you can stun-lock tank units while victory is achieved by defeating an infantry unit in front of them. When it comes to actual battles, the limited brigade selection does not make much sense to me with regards to the compositions one is able to commit in the battle preparation window. Resulting battles are not that enjoyable in my opinion. For example, I ""stun"" two tank units and attack a Guards brigade in from of them with an infantry btn., a StuG btn. and an Air Recon group. Enemy gets the Gds. brig. in phase A, commits an Air Wing and an another infantry brig. in phase C. Resulting battle is a comp stomp with occasional annoying    fighter-bomber spoiling your fun, but I win in phase B or even before that. The worst thing is, I was able to repeat this several times in the first campaign as the Germans until I completely cut off the southern Soviet flank south of the river. Overall, I do not like the way the SP is looking now. I think this could be remedied for example by increasing the scale of unit representation on the campaign map, so that you can commit more all rounded units, which could make the battles less frustrating. Or the number of units commited can either be ""infinite"" and only based on proximity to the spot where that battle takes place, or simply increasing the number of allowed units in battle to more than 3. This extremely limits any combined arms scenario one was used to in for example ALB or RD, but I imagine this comparison already drives the devs crazy... :)  To sum this part up, I think the SP campaign still needs some sort of revisit, because it really feels off to me. The historical scenario battles are fine though.

To sum up, this is a great game if you plan playing MP, as its a lot of fun. So, definitely recommended, giant improvements over SD44. A bit disappointed by the army general mode.",1561124787,1561124787,True,4,0,0.539334952831268311,0,True,False,False

To be honest, I did buy the game for the campaign mode. I was hoping they were making a return to the WG:ALB and WG:RD style of campaigns but it's something completely new and completely infuriating. 

The game offers no tutorial and the manual is less than useful. As far as gameplay goes, its pretty much SD 1 with a few new gimmicks. Multiplayer isn't terrible. But its the solo play that ruins it for me. 

The new mode is called ""Army General"" and like some of the previous WG series, you can move your units across a map and battle for territory. You can deploy in extra forces and there are various bonuses your units can get(as far as I can tell, these bonuses are only used for auto resolve). The game explains none of what the new concepts are aside from a buggy tooltip pop up. It doesn't even explain how attacking works. I send my forces to attack a unit and I have no attack option. The ability to attack literally seems completely random. It doesn't tell you that you can;t capture airfields/kill planes on the ground, which was a nice surprise when I rerouted a few regiments to capture an undefended airfield with the enemies entire air force and now my units are cut off 20 miles behind enemy lines(because somehow undefended land that I captured automatically reverted back to enemy control?) It doesn't even explain how the game mode is chosen: I attacked one time and the enemy controlled the entire map and I had 30 minutes to capture the map. I attack again, it's a normal half and half map.

This is coming from someone who despised steel division Normandy 44, and its small scale un-interesting game play. This game can be genuinely massive, with possibly thousand of units, deffinitely thousands of infantry possible. The game is overall allot more similar to wargame red dragon, the Normandy 44, with a return of an engaging and fun deck system, also reminiscent of wargame.

However the game does have issues, its larger scale can make micro managing very hard at times. Their can be occasions when you look away from an area, and one t34e managed to come behind you heavy Panther tanks and knock all of them out. This isnt the only problem with some game play aspects, but over all i think it works well.

Another problem is many units, especially ones brought from Normandy 44, have not had their graphics updated, meaning allot of units look pretty bad compared to the newer ones. Confusingly sometimes their is a new graphical model of a plane or tank, but it is only present in some decks/units and not all. Mainly affected is British and Canadian soldiers who look pretty ridiculous. however i dont think this has a massive detriment to game play, and hopefully will be fixed.

All on all i think its a great game, which will hopefully gain a strong player base, as unfortunately the advertisement campaign has been pretty small.

I started the scenario and expected some kind of tutorial or at least explanation of what I am supposed to do. Nothing.

In terms of content, there are already more than 600 units and 25 maps, a major improvement over the entirety of SD:44, right from the get go, with more content expected in the future. Maps have much more detail to them allowing for much more interesting engagements, and have added more geographical intensity, such as multiple hills with varying Line of Sight across portions of the map, making for extremely interesting tactical play. 

The devs really pulled no stops when it came to realism and authenticity, save minor facets that had to be streamlined to accommodate the nature of designing a video game. Artillery now has much more authentic effective range of fire, armor penetration is calculated as armor thickness in mm as opposed to RNG, and where most games would tweak the performance of units to make them 'balanced', this game uses a deploy point economy where units cost an amount of points that you get as income, and this point economy allows for units to be authentically designed and still balanced in turn.

The creme de la mente is by far the Dynamic Campaign, essentially an entire 'game within-a game', adding an entire strategic level to the game that is unprecedented in this series. By manuevering ones battallions on a map, they get to play major military operations from the late years of the Eastern Front, testing their wit to turn the Soviet tide or obliterate the fragmented German defense. It really puts a competitive point even to games like Total War, where players who enjoy a game with both strategic and tactical play have legitimate concern to check out this game.

I just wish there was a Strategic campaign for Normandy, its exactly what was missing in the first game.

But outside of that and more british divisions, which would be awesome, all i think is missing is the ability to save the campaign in the middle of AI turns, and if possible, even inside the tactical battles. Battles may take a long time, 40+ minutes, and if the AI attacks you 2 or 3 times, you can get stuck in the campaign for over 2 hours without the ability to save, before its your turn again.

First of all AI - in compare to older wargame series its very well done.
Most of the time Ai plays like an average human player. He keeps the frontline solid, reacts to your actions and make his own, uses aviation artillery and AAA well. Playing against AI is a great tutorial in itself and will prepare you for online battles.

Multiplayer part - similar to SD but polished. Slightly less micromanagement and bigger scale. More units on the map results in more epic battles. Unlike SD 1, tactical and operational level of command plays bigger role relative to micromanagement, even in 1v1 games. 

Many divisions to chose from each offering enormous customization options. Now you can change almost everything, what unit in what phase to deploy, at what quantity and veterancy and even redistribute points for each phase.

Unlike SD 1, in conquest mode not only you need to move the frontline forward, but you need to capture specific strong points scattered throughout the map. Now capturing empty field will not grant you conquest points, but cities, crossroads, bridges etc... will.

New game modes, where one player is attacking and another is defending. Here you can create trenches, bunkers and place barber wire.

And last, but not least, Single player gameplay. 
Once again, unlike SD 1 and Wargame, due to AI the experience is much better.
The army general mode is a blast. It feels like a slightly simplified, but still very engaging and deep operations in ""Graviteam tactics Mius front"". Your troops are represented in historically correct structures, divisions, battalions, companies etc... and move front line just like on the tactical map, but on a grand operational scale.

It's an ode to real time strategy and military simulation that respects your intelligence as a gamer. It feels like a labour of love, like how people used to make games before. You can feel that for these guys, the game they made is not only a career, but also something special, something that will leave its mark, something that will be remembered, something that they would have loved to see on the market and play it themselves.

I honestly think this is the best, optimal concession that can ever be made between realism and fun, more realistic than that and it wouldn't be fun, and more arcady than this and it wouldn't be a wargame simulator. I think there is no other RTS game like this one. This is as close as you'll ever get to the historical authenticy and source material while still having an actual fun and deep tactical strategy game.

Even the ""arcady"" elements the game has, such as the ""signature"" Eugen deck-building (which is even better now with phase-selection) mechanic where you build your own division, customized to what strategy you have in mind and yet limited and balanced by the historical limitations of the division you're using, is itself a ""realistic"" abstraction, and is super fun. It appeals to my desire of creativity. I love coming up with crazy builds such as having an opening with veteran Luchs german light tanks and being rewarded with an early lead in the game.

Does it have flaws? Yes. I think it takes a little bit of time to get used to for sure. You should play a few games vs Easy AI. But, at the same time, with the amount of experience they have in the genre now, with the experience they have from past games, it is clear that this one has achieved something special as it has probably the best UI of all of them (which isn't a feat since all past games had terrible UI lol), and is probably the easiest out of them all to get into and to start playing.

At least you should try playing it, not to mention that it's one of these games that is super fun even on PvE especially if you play with friends.

This is a reference, the ""Total War"" of WWII strategy games, a pillar of gaming that we will look back to in the future (and play) with fond memories.

If you are coming from MOW or COH3 you will be overwhelmed by the vast scale of this game, both in environment as in units.  It offers wonderfull possibilities for those who appreciate WW2 RTS and doesnt struggle in the graphics department like e.g. operation mius front.  It offers high replayability and a good range of divisions to play with.  Compromises have been made but this only improves the balance in the game.

Pros:
-Scale;
-graphics;
-flexibility;

cons
-missing options like destructable bridges, minefields...
-missing game mode total destruction

conclusion;  if this game adds dlc from time to time we might have a new WW2-RTS champion for quite some time, it simply sets a new standard and can be improved even further by minor tweaks and additions.  If you are gonna buy one WW2 RTS this year, this should be it!

And not talking about game mechanics, they are easy to figure out, but the general within me had to come to terms with these new set of rules and how to master them. That's absolutely fantastic and given that the scope of the game play is in subdivision sized units (battalions) it offers some fresh take on the strategy genre. The order of battle for these units is what impressed me right after that, they are historically accurate.

So, after figuring out the basics i let all my artillery pound the enemy divisions moving at the front line and decided to attack an enemy anti air battalion with my fusilier recon battalion (i could have brought up to 3 different battalions to the battle but wanted to try this first). An very interesting battle ensued. Since i was mostly made up of recon troops i couldn't capture territory. The battalion had a bunch of 80 mm mortars though and a few MGs, together with the commanders i could capture something so threw all of it into one corner and started to recon for the enemy AA units then destroy them with mortar fire. The enemy had obviously brought air support as one the 3 battalions into the battle so my mortars would immediately be bomber by multiple ground attack planes. Changing position after a short salvo i managed to save them each time. If i would have had limitless time i could have cleared the map this way but at this point its better that i lost due to running out of time. I did get the enemy strength well reconned though!

From this i can only imagine that the game will offer a wide array of battle scenarios depending on what you bring into battle.

We no longer have a tiger has a penetration value of 15 :P. The re-scaling of army value makes infantry more important in this game. If you lose 4 panzegrenadiers, you lose a panther A. People typically did not care about their infantry in SD1, instead they focused on micro-management of their tanks and aircrafts. So this change makes people use infantry more carefully.

I think Eugen will deal with this issue in the future patches.

This game do have some issues. Currently they are: bugs related to single player mode (especially the army general mode); the design of UI, the display of vision in skirmish mode and the back to war dlc (which I personally like, however according to the developers this game features eastern front so they should not be included).

Hearts of iron 4 meets wargame? Yes it happened. If you are a fan of operational level and tactical real time ww2 
combat. This is the game for you. 

If you like wargame:red dragon you have no real reason to dislike this. Its deep , the mechanics are fleshed out and it adds some new layers of complexity to the game but does not stray very far from what wargame built. If you never played a wargame title. The most similar game to this is a game called World in conflict. If you have not played that game,  basically this is a ww2 RTS combat game that forgets the base building and economy stuff and allows you to control the units you decide to take into battle. These units are built with ""decks"" or as they are now known as ""battlegroups"". You have to be smart how you build your ""deck"" you only have limited points to build it and you decide how your income in the game is attributed to you based on a xxx/xxx/xxx income breakdown with the game containing 3 time periods. For example if you are a fan of rushing. You might have most of your income come 
right in the first phase of the game instead of traditionally towards the end when you are able to use the more powerful units (you also get more units to take into battle if you choose to take them later in the game , but its a risk because the game might not last that long).

CO-OP is a blast. The AI can be jacked up to be absolutely murderous and unfair. And low enough that its a still a challenge. This is where i believe a majority of players will enjoy the game. And there is nothing wrong with that. 

But if you want the ultimate RTS challenge you are going to have to fight other players. And this is much much more difficult. If you are a new player i would suggest against diving into PVP right away until you have a greater understanding of the mechanics. And the learning curve is steep for PVP. Playing against players is very different than the AI. As i learned in the first game i played when an human player bombed a highway containing ALL MY UNITS 
in the first 30 seconds of the game. 

The single player ""ARMY GENERAL"" mode is in my opinion the most important introduction to the game by far. You are given a historical time period of operation bagration to control an entire operation (hundreds of thousands of units) If you are familiar with games like hearts of iron. You will immediately understand what im talking about. 
You are given a front line to defend or attack based on your orders from high command. In the case of the first game i played i was ordered to protect a highway and town from advance of the soviet army. You are given limited reinforcements and have to place them wisely on the operation map to be effective. Artillery units can be used to 
suppress enemy tiles to prevent them from attacking or moving. Bombers can do the same from the air. AA units can deny airspace to aircraft. And all infantry and mechanized units can dig in and get a defensive buff. 

The game is turned based on AM and PM days. So your first turn will be the morning of the day and the second turn will be in the evening. After that the next day comes. I had a ""night bombers"" division so i assume there might be 
night fighting bonus's. 

Ultimately this game has an extreme amount of content to enjoy. If you enjoy multiplayer. Singleplayer. Tactical combat , operational combat. Its all in this one game. 
Only downside is there are some crash issues. 

9/10. Eugen systems best game so far. Definately worth the money!",1561044291,1561044534,True,114,7,0.860694766044616699,4,True,False,False

With bigger maps, more units and combat on a larger scale than the first installment of the series this game is a tremendous improvement over its predecessor.

The Good:

Graphics look real and gritty which adds tremendously to the beauty of these large scale conflicts.

Good balance of combined forces, they really worked hard to make the different factions as balanced as possible and it shows, units don't get stunned all the time and Tank combat is fun thanks to more open maps that still retain enough cover and opportunities for infantry based playstyles to shine. You can always have an answer to the enemys tactic.

More freedom in general, the developers listened and gave us many maps to play with. There are also many different divisions to choose from which themselves can be customised to fit different playstyles.

Great singleplayer content with 4 indepth campaigns (campaigns are kinda total war style) that offer great replay value as well as some historical missions that can be player in coop, this is of course is all aided by the fact that the AI is competent and fun to play against.

The Bad:

Steep learning curve, if you are familiar with the previous entry or the Wargame series you shouldn't have a hard time adjusting to this game but if you aren't it will take a few AI matches to become accustomed to this games scale and combined arms combat. Your Battledivision can be premade with the autofill function though so actually making your first few armies is easy.",1561043089,1561044135,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was a savage, vicious clash of Titans, the Wermacht and the Red Army. This game reflects many of the outstanding features unique to the Eastern Front. The game is on a scale which draws justice from the scale of the conflict. Operation Bagration was the worst defeat ever suffered by the Wermacht. It will be challenging and fun to play them. The details in the game are histrically accurate. I think Eugen emphasizes both historical accuracy and intensity in this game. It really captures the feel and scale of the Eastern Front, both tactically as well as strategically, by including a Campaign.  Watching the mighty Tiger duel it out with the T34-85 is awesome, the rich detail provides opportunities for great screenshots, like tanks firing. I love the game and highly recommend it to all Eastern Front enthusiasts.",1561042853,1561044023,True,74,3,0.700219929218292236,1,True,False,False

The Army General is a fantastic experience - as a HOI Fan I love to see this scale of a battle be playable. 

The ArtBook offers a nice insight into game development and all the aspects that were thought and worked about.

For the critics - yes, the game is not perfect - here and there are some points that can polished in the further weeks 

BUT

when you put your eyes on the greater vision and all the different kinds of content - skirmish - historical coop missions - singleplayer campaign you will respect the huge amount of work that was put in this title and more as that - it brings fun and I recognize tons of that into Steel Divison II xD

what I would like to add is 

I love the different type of division handling in the single player campaign particular in tactical battles. This brings a realistic feeling that you has have to do it with a real military structure.

the system from normandy works well for skirmish-based matches that goes straight to the action but I had so much fun in my first battle with the deployment-phase because this smaller brigade(?)-based-structure.

There is so much great content starting by the awesome maps in huge numbers (25 + variants) including Urban maps too!
The new armor penetration system is really cool it shows realistic armor in mm not in numbers like arcade SD44. 
I played every game from Eugen Systems starting with R.U.S.E. 1000+ hours ingame this was really arcade but fun who could think of the progress they have made since 2010.
Steel Division II really is a great step forward in RTS evolution. 
Hopefully it is not the final step of all craft and Eugen System sell lots of copies that they can proceed delivering us RTS in all its glory.
The game is really worth every cent and if u are not rich go for the standard edition there is including more contant than you ever need^^ 
Just think of all the combinations of Divisions and maps its like jackpot to get the same game setting twice. 
Managing your Divisions by changing cards after every match to customize your Battlegroup in your playstyle is very satisfying and takes lots of fun time.
I strongly recommend this game for all WW2 RTS gamers.",1561043340,1561043340,True,9,0,0.54262155294418335,0,True,False,False
919640,51336431,76561198035586632,0,8,11065,0,1234,1616546776,"Pretty awesome. Great graphics and visuals, but even on a low end machine (think 2013 laptop with a locked i7 and Nvidia gt 745m) I can run at really good framerate, even in 10v10 battles.

For the most part the units are very authentically represented and mostly realistic. There are some issues that take away from the realism, and these are really engine based as far as I know; these issues are present in nearly every RTS though. 1. Your units always know where every enemy unit is even if they themselves did not spot the unit, so all of your units really act like a hive mind and it makes it a bit unrealistic, but I can understand the compromise for gameplay. Another issue for realism is how accurate really everything is, and again this is obviously for gameplay as most people do not want hardcore realism.

The campaign is really dense. I love it, but it is really difficult and time consuming, not something you'll just pump through in a few hours, but that is what I love about it. Your actions in every battle can really come back to haunt you later in the campaign if you make mistakes and lose too many men. There are some gripes i have with the campaign, but they are very minor, such as it is not so transparent why your units can move to certain places on the map or not, even though it looks clear, but this doesn't affect gameplay much. Another small gripe with the campaign is that you can only take 3 battlegroups into a battle.

Multiplayer is awesome, but the community kinda is pretty toxic if you engage with the discords. There is a big learning curve, but outside of high level players, most people are not so skilled, so after playing for a while you won't get your ass kicked so bad.

It is a really awesome game, I would give it an 8.5/10.",1561042964,1561042964,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False
