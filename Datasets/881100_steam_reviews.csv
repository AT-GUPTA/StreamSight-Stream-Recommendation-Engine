 playing with perks/potions/wands/ and spells will give you a plethora of possibilities on how to defeat enemies, survive the sometimes deadly environment, and navigate the world. 

the gold economy makes mining always seem worth it no matter how long it takes (with the right wand), and a high variety of enemies and stages will always feel like a whole new experience.

Don't touch the mods until you play vanilla for a while. Otherwise, in my completely biased opinion, you're cheating yourself out of a fun experience.

Only ONE thing that is irritating as hell about this game is that it randomly crashes. Sometimes I can play for hours without interruption, other times I can't play 15 minutes without it crashing multiple times. But that's really it.

Float around and blast dudes and kick their bodies off of cliffs. The game feels very sandbox, with nearly limitless ways to interact with the environment and a plethora of spells, but also countless ways to die in hilarious and embarssing ways due to how easy it is to cause utter chaos and devastation.

There are many, many video games that has magic as a mechanic, but the MAJORITY of the time this is more or less differently colored ranged weapons (think Skyrim). In tabletop settings, and in books/ shows/ movies, magic is often depicted as an unstable, barely controllable power that is unpredictable and dangerous. [b]Noita[/b] is one of the very few games that depicts this well (somewhat akin to the Magicka series). Within the levels, you will find new wands/ spells with which to mix and match in between each area, and you can create some STUPIDLY overpowered wands. Imagine shooting fireballs out of a wand at a fire rate of 50 per second, that level of insane, or shooting a tiny beam that creates 10 bombs whereever it hits, or teleporting through an entire level in an instant. The possibilities are endless and irrational and hilarious all at once.

Becaues of this random nature, [b]Noita[/b] can often be frustrating as you will likely die in unexpected and confusing ways, but you can't really take it personal. The sandbox, anything goes nature of the game is by design, and it's endlessly addicting for someone like me to constantly try and experiment and find out what new insane stuff I can get up to.

This happened to me in this game.

Loosing a long run is very painful, so the main downside of this game imo is that you can't play it for too long continuously without being demotivated. But I suppose that's a skill issue. Early game is a bit slow as wands are basic and you generally go for the same things each time, and as you find out more stuff to do near the beginning you end up extending that section to your own detriment, but ah well.
The particle physics are nice but pretty simple and don't interact with gameplay much. The main meat of it is in wand building, with you becoming progressively more dangerous to yourself as you make more destructive weapons, 'cause those are the ones that deal the most damage. A successful run seems like a cartoon ball of snow rolling down a mountain, my first victory ended with me having a wand devastating enough to kill everything I saw (including the final boss, and myself if I misfired) in one shot. You just build up your doom weapon as you go.

You always learn something new, adapt to whatever spells you got in each run and try to make it work as far as you can. Which most of the time, you won't until a couple deaths and runs were put in the game.

Environmental damage is very satisfy in this game, every liquids and vapors all react differently and blowing things up never got old here. You can drown enemies with careful planning, or even set them up to fall into lava pit. The game rewards creativity in this regard and that's just a one mechanic.

Wands and spells building are another part of the game that rewards your creativity. Making simple spell with trigger and timer to be more powerful by combining it with another spells and putting it in the right wand you found exploring is part of the challenge where you need to manage resource such as your health and trade it with exploration deeper and deeper into somewhere you are not familiar with.

Overall a very good game. Have patience, explore at your own pace. Death is a set back to be expected in this game but you can always get better, being more careful and manage your resources. Try to look this game as a survival where you need to decide when to push and when to call it a day and proceed to next resting point. You can always find a way to comeback to explore the beginning area again eventually.",1708059907,1708059907,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The whole Noita experience, from you being a weak little witch, to you becoming a god, are all incredibly fun and challenging in their own ways. Despite being ravaged several times due to RNG or simply my own incompetence, I always come back for more, for every single seed is unique and special in its own way.
I'm so glad that the Noita community exists, if it wasn't for them, I would've quit long ago. Seeing game-plays, tips and tricks, lore videos and so much more made me inspired to try my hardest and to achieve a god run. (I just wish I had that inspiration with fitness lmao)

   You'll always be surprised by the amount of stupid and hilarious ways you can die, even when trying to build a new wand and dying to your own weapon.

As there's no class or level and unlockables, Noita is not a mix between roguelike and roguelite.

So much time spent mastering spells and crafting the ultimate wand, all for nought. Just when you think you've conquered it, some random enemy blows you up, mocking the effort you've put in. It's infuriating, a cycle of build-up and sudden demise that leaves you open mouthed and thinking why you even bother.

AND I LOVE IT!!

It's a masterpiece of frustration and fun, a game that tests your patience only to reward you with a sense of achievement that's all too rare.

This game takes a impossible premise and somehow made an amazing game with it 

Noita is a game that takes the spirit of roguelikes and throws it into a huge, open world, making it quite unique. In most roguelikes, you encounter walls that you can't break, and you just move on. But in Noita, everything is breakable, and experimenting with your surroundings can lead to both good and bad outcomes, which adds a magical touch to the barriers you face.

When you start playing, you might think it's just another cave dive, but there's so much more to discover, different areas, tough bosses, hidden items, and cryptic secrets. Figuring out everything the game has to offer is an incredibly welcoming surprise.

Noita is tough. It's just like your average roguelike however the game is massive, and while there's tons to do, surviving is no easy feat, even with this in mind the great graphics with the dynamic soundtrack makes fighting very enjoyable. For reference, the main route of the game, the cave you explore, is actually called the tutorial as a running joke by the players and devs.


Overall, it's a great game that's definitely earned a spot among my favorites.

Cons:
Your luck can make or break a run, and skill doesn't always count for much, especially in bad runs. This is typical for roguelikes, but Noita's bad runs can drag on, making it a bit of a time sink.

This luck-based aspect makes noita have rare highs, which actually made the game way too addicting

As a Roguelike, Noita relies on experience to be your teacher. The only real way to learn about the game is to keep going and interact with new enemies, spells, and environments. Most of these will kill you before you realize what happened. This leads to a typical gameplay loop, where the player will start a run, limp through the first two or three areas, and eventually die, forcing them to begin again.

But eventually, Noita will *click*. You will reach a point where the game makes sense, and you can gain power faster than your enemies do. You'll still die, to be sure, but it will no longer feel like it was inevitable. It will be a clear, sharp lesson, and retracing your progress won't be as much of a chore. And once you hit this stage, your first win is very likely to come soon.

But the biggest trick up Noita's sleave is this: beating the game is only the beginning. You might explore a bit and get a sense that the world is larger than the standard path you are intended to take down to the bottom, but just HOW BIG is something you cannot understand until much later. Noita's world is so massive that the main game occupies about 10% of it's map... and then you realize how far it goes beyond even that. It's a world of mysteries that no one player could have a hope of solving on their own (and even some that the community as a whole is still puzzling out years later).

The bottom line is that Noita isn't for everyone. The intense difficulty and time investment required to master it will turn most players off. But if you enjoy challenging gameplay that rewards clever thinking as much as fast reflexes, with a massive, mysterious world full of wonder and danger, Noita is unbeatable.",1706988575,1706988575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This looks like one of those games with a thousand hours worth of content.

---EDIT--- 157 hours 
I have now played this game for around 150 hours. I tried to really learn as many game mechanics and quirks as possible, and I must say that the skill ceiling for Noita is extremely high. There is always something to learn.

I am now at a point where I can relatively consistently win a run if my goal is to finish it. Don't listen to all those people who say that this game is too hard and that you will get killed by random and unpreventable things and get ""noita'd."" 99.99% of the time you die, it is a preventable death. There has been a death where my game crashed and reloaded my character into a wall of cursed rock, but that is truly a rarity.

Even if you get one-shot by an enemy outside of your screen or killed by a pixel of polymorph, I truly mean it when I say that all of those deaths can be prevented if you know what to look out and prepare for. Don't believe me? There is a win streak of over 200+ recorded wins in a row on Twitch (check the leaderboard on the Noita wiki.gg), and all of them are done in a reasonable amount of time.

This game is definitely a game where you need to rely on the knowledge of the community to truly master it. Wand crafting is so complex I am not joking when I say that you can write PhDs on it. There are still puzzles in the game that haven't been solved by anyone. Every run, I learn something new.

I didn't even get the other endings, because the sheer amount of things you CAN do to get them, is stopped by the thought that if you slip up, all your progress vanishes and you're back to the mines and nothing to show for it.

Lots of really cool looking spells and areas to explore, all kinds of bosses, really neat physics and interactions. An insane amount of secrets and crazy objectives. But, hold on, before you get to see any of that, you get to die over and over again to random bullshit you couldn't possibly understand.

So get ready to be dead and confused.

No help is offered through the game itself, I don't believe anyone has ever finished, or played through any significant portion of this game without excessive use outside aid. Maybe it was easier to get into when the game was barely developed, but coming into it now seems quite insurmountable. I had a much easier time getting into Rim World, which is probably the most complicated game I've ever tried to learn.

Even after watching as many hours of videos as I've spent playing the game, I am no closer to understanding anything about it at all. In fact, I think I now know even less.

I'm guessing you have to spend at least 40 minutes to an hour just collecting gold on the first floor, while also getting extremely lucky with a powerful damage wand and a teleportation wand, in order to have any sort of chance at getting anywhere else. I only assume that because every tutorial video out there is someone with a crazy wand blowing everything up in sight while they teleport themselves all over the place at extreme speeds, while also having thousands more health and tens of thousands more gold than I've ever seen. All by the time they get to the ice caves.

No amount of skill or being good at video games will help you here. This game is about knowledge, luck and extreme patience I'm guessing. 

It is impossible to just pick this game up for fun.

You have to dedicate your very soul and existence to it.

Pass. 

Maybe some day i'll get curious and try again, Or maybe i'll just cheat until I understand every detail and nuance.

But until then, pass.

Update: I learned to git gud.

After spending at least 50 hours watching Youtube videos and Twitch streams about this ridiculous game, I learned enough to be successful. And I've got to say, this game is insane.

Even with a dozen or so victories now, and a handful of bosses slain, I have not even come close to beating this game. I'm not even sure i've actually played it at all. 

I'm actually still looking at the store page, is how little of the game I've actually played. 

It just keeps going. Once you understand how incredibly big the world is, compared to the dungeon you are guided towards, you'll poop. Go to google images, and search ""noita map"" and look at how big it actually is. Then, if you think that's big, go ahead and make your way through the cursed rock on the east or west side of the world. If you don't die, you'll end up in another world. And you can just keep going.

Your power potential in this game is practically unlimited, if you're wise enough and lucky enough to get there. 

Biggest tip for starting out, is to just cheat health. Watch some youtube tutorials on how to wrap spells, and how to heal. There aren't too many healing sources, but health is your most valuable resource by far.

Anyway, I hope we can all laugh about my initial review of this game. 

It's an amazing game with unlimited replay value. About a million bosses to seek out and dozens of ways to ""beat"" it. I think i have like 11 out of 100 achievements that are tracked in a cool way in game.",1675147136,1706744981,True,0,0,0.604615747928619385,2,True,False,False

The first version of this review is a rant about the vanilla version of the game, and I still stand by most of what I said there regarding that. On the other hand, I can absolutely recommend playing the game's mods. Not only are there plenty of QOL mods that solve many of the issues I talk about below, e.g. shop reroll, edit wands always, etc., there is loads more content you can play around with. The wand mechanics in this game might be the most fun weapon mechanics I've ever played with, and mods bring even more out of them. So get it on sale, but use mods.


Version 1 for vanilla
This game, although technically a masterpiece, is very mediocre, especially considered as a roguelike. Each area takes far too long, especially if you're trying to find good wands and spells. The environmental effects and alchemy and such are far too gimmicky, punishing, and ultimately shallow. Polymorph comes to mind especially. It usually takes too long to become powerful, and you usually jump from being completely defenseless to being practically invincible very quickly. The game is far too rng dependent. If you get the good spells, wands and perks early on, it's playable. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy torment. 
If Nolla sped up the gameplay loop, made resources much more plentiful (or at more reliably useful), and LET YOU EDIT WANDS ANYWHERE ALL OF THE TIME, this would be a much better game. Basically, if Noita was more like Risk of Rain, it would be a much better roguelike. 
On the other hand, Noita also pretends to be a metroidvania, although its areas are not remotely connected enough for that and the powerups unlocking new areas are either very specific, like All Seeing Eye or Black Hole, or non-existent, you can just walk in at any time. Their idea of exploration is literally just go farther horizontally or do  a stupid amount of backtracking and then go farther horizontally. The gameplay loop is either just press on like a normal roguelike or let the pacing grind to a halt as you waltz back to remote areas for stronger equipment, before you return to the normal path and just obliterate everything. The map design is ultimately terrible because they are trying to make the condition for unlocking new things dependent on what secrets you have deciphered. However, they completely through away the pacing of the game, especially the mid and late games, in order to achieve this. 
Finally, sandbox doesn't mix well with this kind of roguelike. If the game were much shorter and smaller, the combination would work quite well. But there is nothing worse than losing hours of progress to some mechanic that you hadn't encountered yet or that has no defense against it, like poly.",1634588332,1706496941,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Took 60 hours for me to win a run and I haven't even scratched the surface of how much content there is. Every aspect of this game has so much depth and care put into it, world gen, element interaction, wand building, and so much more. 

Part of me wishes they gave you at least a little guidance (like a map you can look at) aside from the glyphs in the beginning w/the controls, but the process of learning/becoming competent at navigating the world and its hazards is such a fun gameplay loop in itself that it's honestly not even necessary. 

There are tons of bosses that I haven't even encountered yet as they are hidden behind some puzzles that aren't the easiest to find/figure out/survive long enough to get to without looking it up, but it seems like you really shouldn't even try to go after them until you really know what you are doing. 

There are some good mods you can download for things like a mini map or even the ability to make save files if you want to make it easier while you are learning, but honestly throwing yourself into the deep end and trying to just figure it out is probably the best way to play imo.

But when trying to experiment, the process is hampered too much by the rogue-like elements, and it gets tiresome having to do the beginning grind with the same boring spells at the start of every run because the last wand you thought could have been cool killed you when you fired it because, like many other wands, can't edit them to be better in most areas without a perk, and use some form of point-blank explosion spell or was dangerous to use in general, simply because you wanted to drop the bog standard bread-and-butter wand to freshen things up a bit.

This is before nonsense like enemies randomly off-screen triggering the [Spoiler]'Angered Gods'[/Spoiler] penalty making your limited safe zones very dangerous if you don't have the spells/perks to handle that.

Its definitely not bad at all, and maybe the (honestly RNG) difficulty appeals to some folk, but do note its very hard, and constantly expects you to restart due to extremely minor mistakes or even circumstances out of your control.",1706013035,1706013035,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are going to buy this game, get ready to die. Then die again. And again and again and again. This game offers no helping hands and it feels everything, is out to get you. This is a constancy throughout the entire game; it's extremely challenging and everything is a lot more nuanced under the surface. There is so much to this game and should you buy it, I highly recommend looking up tutorials and explanations. Nothing is ever really taught to you except the fundamentals. But, the longer you play, the more you know; the more you know, the more powerful you are as a player. Slowly the world becomes your playground, challenges that completely overwhelmed you in the beginning are nothing more than a minor inconvenience. By the third stage, you have become an unstoppable god. Maybe you even beat the ""final"" boss, and complete the game. But you haven't even experienced a fraction of what this game has to offer. I have a almost 350 hours, a minuscule amount of time in the eyes of the community (and for good reason).

I once had a nearly 3 hour long run where I had a super strong wand which shot 12 projectiles super accurately, each dealing over 40 damage. I was exploring in one of the later areas when I saw one of the wizard type enemies and started shooting at it (I had encountered a few of them before and they always have some weird mechanic that really screws with you, so I knew I wanted it dead.) turns out, that particular enemy swaps places with you upon taking damage. So I hit it with one 40 damage projectile, then swapped places with it and took the other 440 damage straight to the face and died instantly. 

The thing to take from this is: sometimes Noita is bullshit, what's important is that you remember that bullshit and never fall for it again. This game will utterly fuck with you at every turn. Pay attention to everything, because any slight mistake means it's right back to the beginning.

However, this game probably has the steepest learning curve out of any rogue-like that I've ever played. Then again, I haven't played a lot of rogue-likes, but I am a fan of the genre.

The game is so deep, so rich with content, and it rewards (and punishes) your creativity and willingness to explore beyond what is shown to you. While dying means a complete restart, you do retain your knowledge. Knowledge of wands, enemies, key locations, interactions between different materials, and other niche knowledge will make your next run better. Sure, luck does play a part, and sometimes you get noita'd, but a good chunk of the game is under your control. How you build and use your wands makes a major difference, even the position of your spells can turn your wand from a peashooter into a machine gun.

Overall, if you're looking for a casual experience with short runs, this might not be the game for you. However, if you're willing to take the time and really learn the game for what it really is, you will sink your teeth into this and never let go. I'm currently in the longest run I've been in (~8 hours) and I'm just amazed by how much there is. There's still more I can do in that run.

I recommend playing with either a high end modern cpu to brute force it into running well or accepting the fact that it will run slow on even normally invincible i7's from a few years back. 

The game does not have frameskip due to its nature, so fortunately you will get smooth gameplay regardless of cpu load/lag/tears, meaning that even though it might get a little slow-mo sometimes, it is always playable.

GPU load might as well not exist on anything newer than the statue of liberty, but some graphics settings may reduce cpu load so turning down graphics could end up helping a lot.

881100,155181829,76561198066437699,375,6,14153,16,13945,1708848651,"This is genuinely one of the greatest games I have ever played. It starts off as a pretty run of the mill rogue lite where you go deeper downwards and kill the enemies to get to the final bottom level. But that is such a disservice to what this game actually is and there's so much content here for easily hundreds of hours.

I will try to just cover the surface without going to deep so you can explore this genuine masterpiece for yourself:

Looks:
Firstly, it has an incredibly simple yet beautiful art style. Fires can quickly spread illuminating a dark hallway and spells trail through the air impacting with the environment creating craters and holes. The player is is constantly surrounded by a breathtakingly dynamic and deadly environment. Without getting into spoilers, the actual playable area is much larger than the player initially realizes, which helps really sell the world as there is much to see and explore.

Gameplay:
The interact-ability with the world gives way to a lot of emergent game play. One play-through you shot a weird spell and now the ceiling collapsed killing you and your mother. The second play-through you died because you have a cool electric wand, but you thought it would be a good idea to use it while in kiddie pool with all of the other shitters and now everything in that puddle including you is dead. The player is forced to pay attention to the environmental dangers of the world around them before even engaging with some the enemies in the dungeon. Everything is a threat and the game does not hold the players hand, you learn to quickly tread carefully and the farther you go the more intense things get.

This is with out even touching the wand building mechanic, which is what makes me come back to this game still. Imagine playing a game where you have the ability to create a build out a generic rock turning it into a heat seeking missile that rips through the air killing everything in its path. This is on of those things you might need to just google to see how insane and deep this shit gets. But there is no game that really gives the tools to create such interesting builds and interactions with the spells/wands/perks provided. The combinations are truly endless, and Im still learning and making new builds 200 hours in.

The Bad:
There is no bad, Perhaps maybe the occasional bug, there really isn't much I can think of besides it being maybe too challenging for more casual players to actually get started. But I dont actually believe this to be a flaw, as its just part of the Noita experience for the player to overcome. And overcome you will, when you learn just how powerful you can actually get. Take your time my child.

All in all, 
Its one of the games that I believe deserves the title of ""Masterpiece"". And in terms of what is humanly possible, in many ways I believe this game to be perfect. I hope you don't delay, and you pick this game up and just stick with it for a while. Don't force it, but push yourself to learn it, if you get bored maybe look up ""Sun seed quest"" and you will start to see the potential of this amazing game.

Noita has an exellent pixel styled physics engine that can work either in your favor or against you. Most of the time it's the latter. 

After 13 hours of Noita, I'll give the game an 7/10. There is lots of things to explore in this game and it just so happens the actual gameplay meshes really well with the physics. Noita struggles in it's build variety and fairness, not allowing the player to experiment and stack abilities.

Noita is a game of intricate wand building: buying spells and wands, unlocking even more powerful spells, and implementing them to create weapons of unparalleled power. Learning how spells are arranged, how wands work, and which spells in which orders create death or victory genuinely feels like studying the arcane arts and becoming a wizard. The sheer number of different powerful wands you can create gives this game the same charm of deck builders. Yet despite all of this, this game is really hard. Any number of things can kill you (often your own wand) but the game challenges the player just enough to be addicting. Every run, every stupid death, you learn something. Again, this contributes to this emergent sense of growing stronger, smarter, and more knowledgeable.

But I haven't even talked about the scale of this game yet. A good rule of thumb is that no matter how big you think Noita is, there is always more. It is always bigger. Entire quests, secrets, lore, bosses, and areas are completely hidden from the player until they are discovered naturally. This does bring me to my one complaint, which is that the game is so big that  the average player may never find some of the best parts of this game. My advice to new players would be to just ""win"" first, then start using the wiki and glancing at maps. This game is massive and deep, and there is always more to explore.

The music is reactive and catchy. The graphics are beautiful. The lore and world is fascinating. The mods are excellent. The gameplay is fun as hell. I just love absolutely everything about this game. No other one game has made me feel as stupid or as smart as Noita has, and every run has something new and fun to offer.

What it does exceptionally well is its almost endless replayablity and physics. Once you get a hang of the game mechanic and understand how the game works and what it wants from you the only limit is your own capability of wand building.
In this game you can build wands that range from either shooting a purple bolt that disappears on contact to casting a spell that is an equivalent of an aneurysm inducing supernova on crack that ctrl+alt+del everything and everyone including yourself in a single frame. The map is way bigger than it may first seem. Seriously, its enormous. And on top of that every single pixel is simulated and acts realistic.
Example: Explosion in water => Water evaporates and turns to steam => steam rises to the ceiling => steam slowly cools and condensates back into water. (This is just a basic example and there are also a bunch of alchemic reactions in the game)
Obviously there are a lot of other great, interesting and unique mechanics but i just cant list them all.

There is a bunch of secrets but i recommend using the wiki if you want to find them because the game barely explains anything and if it does its cryptic as shit. Same goes for unlocking certain spells, the game can get kind of stupidly complicated to unlock certain spells. But if you love secrets and hidden messages then you will love this aspect of course.

That being said the game isnt perfect. It has its flaws like lack of explanation of game mechanics as i said before. You have to figure out everything yourself except the bare basic controls. It feels like the game is designed for people that are already pros at Noita and its incredibly frustrating at times. Some spells or perks have hidden stats or mechanics the game doesnt tell you about. Again, use the wiki for more infos on spells. Luckly the game has a great Steam Workshop with plenty of mods that can help you get into the game easier.

Overall its totally worth the 19€ if you enjoy roguelite games and its often on sale as well. I would give it a 9/10.",1703994005,1703994304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the minds, I stumble across a cool looking wand submerged in a pool of a strange pink liquid. I think nothing of it, and jump in to try and grab the wand and quickly jump out. Instead, I turn into a sheep with wings. Okay, well the pool has walls around it. I'll use my wand to blow up one of them and the pool will drain. Great job me! I use the wand, but the bomb bounces off the wall and falls down somewhere below. Oh. Well, okay, I'll drop a bomb on the inside of the pool. The wall blows up and the pool starts draining. Nice! I jump down and, trying to avoid the fire, I miss the floor and fall down to where the liquid is going. I turn back into a flying sheep and cannot fly back up to the wand, so I fall further down. Say, what happened to that first bomb of mine? I don't have to wonder any longer, because I find a burning vat of whiskey that I fall right into, and cannot fly out of. The polymorph effect wears off, and I turn back into a Noita, luckily not on fire. However, I instinctively click while I am still holding my bomb wand, firing my last bomb and blowing up the rest of the whiskey, as well as two explosive crates right next to it. I run away, and am able to escape with 94 health. Around 30 seconds later, I accidentally shoot a lantern which falls onto an explosive crate and kills me. 
I am in constant suffering.

Spells and environments interact and not always predictably, which is a great source of entertainment in runs. Most deaths will be due to your own carelessness or lack of foresight. 
As roguelikes go, the game is hard but fair and rarely will you die to random nonsense you didn't cause. Enemies are cleverly designed to have great environmental reactions and some even attack each other. 
However, runs tend to be longer and the careful investment in each character means the losses at the end of each unique run will feel bad.
There is minor meta-progression between runs in the form of secret pickups that unlock spells for further runs but otherwise its all up to you. This game really encourages you to understand and get to know all the wacky things you can do, rewarding you greatly for thinking outside the box.

One, the learning curve more closely resembles a cliff. The game is hard and doesn't hide the fact that it's out for your blood; it's very unfair by design.
Two, most of the content of this game is hidden from you. The loop of spawning and progressing to the ""final"" boss is but a small portion of what this game has to offer.
With that said this is a must for those that enjoy roguelites and challenges. The pixel-by-pixel simulation gives you a ton of freedom and replayability through randomness (and unfairness), and both the wand building system (your weapons and spells) and the alchemy system are very elaborate. This game is as close as you're going to get to the ultimate spellcrafting and spellcasting experience where you can spend hundreds of hours combining hundreds of different spells and modifiers to see how well, or how suicidal, it turns out.

Enemies kill you extremely easy and you have little to no options of healing besides progressing to the next level which has a full restore in it however doing so makes everything in the stage prior completely inaccessible to you until you get a very good digging wand to big through the walls as well as a very good combat wand to defeat the skeleton warriors that spawn when you try. all the positive reviews say this is a game not meant for progression but my only question is if you aren't supposed to progress then what's the point because this game just isn't fun with the level of difficulty it has in it it forces you to either completely restart or hope to god you get good RNG to get a good wand which makes it a game of RNG and not skill or tact and this is a game full of secrets and bosses but whats the point if you can never reach any of those because you die so easily and have no hope of healing yourself all you can do is just spawn in the game then die that's it that's the whole game.,1703629255,1703629255,False,2,0,0.469714432954788208,1,True,False,False

As mentioned above, the random item generation can make or break your run, which means that you can beat the game very quickly (Someone did it in around 20 hours in the Steam discussions) if you get lucky, but it could also take you hundreds of hours to beat the game once on the normal difficulty. During all of these runs, you will be running through the same areas over and over again with some differences and rearranged points of interest.

PROS:
-Phenomenal amounts of quality and attention to detail, I don't think you can actually run out of things to do in this game unless you have hundreds of hours spent in this game.
-The game mechanics are really solid, and I haven't personally encountered any bugs or issues.
-Great soundtrack and world building, it's definitely a treat to get to explore around without any real limitations.

CONS:
-The first thing you'll notice is how easy it is to die, but before you think ""oh that's a skill issue"", I'm talking about maybe 5 explosives, that literally do more damage than a nuke (a spell in the game) individually, being tucked away in a pile of snow, just for you to mine through it unknowingly and die despite having 1000+ health - kind of bad luck. A fundamental problem this game has is that no matter how skilled or knowledgeable you are, it's so ridiculously easy to die. This isn't a game that has a skill ceiling with the foundation of actual skill, it has one of sheer knowledge that you gain after dying hundreds of times (literally based off of anyone you ask) and just luck. The game is extremely unforgiving, there's a reason most people don't bother playing after like around 40 hours. 
-The secrets that this game has are just about impossible to discover yourself unless you google them, and if you do plan on doing that, well they still aren't all found, unless you only care about getting 100% achievements.
-This game doesn't actually really teach you anything besides how to use the basics and manage your very tiny inventory, you'll learn by dying by enemies or just killing yourself because you experimented with a wand.

OVERALL:
If this game was structured in a way that was a lot more new-user friendly, and wasn't 99% based off of RNG and knowing what garbage to not take and what stuff you just abuse and kill the boss and whatever other secret bosses there are, then I would recommend it even more. Considering the game is fairly cheap, I'd still pick it up. I personally love this game, but it certainly has problems.",1656055012,1703450315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

first off a basic explanation of the game.  it is a brutally hard rogue-like inspired by the actual rogue (i think i dont play a lot of these kinds of games), and falling sand where you're a witch who goes into a cave for reasons i dont think anyone fully understands.  this cave is full of goblins who are all awful and i hate them. it's also full of gold!  you find and buy wands and spells in order to craft magical wands in order to make your life easier, or just blow yourself up.  Sometimes by accident, sometimes for fun.

i really really hate RNG and randomness in games.  i really love high difficulty games that allow you to completely break the balance of said game.  basically, i like if the game is hard but allows you to become an overpowered god if skilled.  i hate when luck is a primary factor because i am an insanely unlucky person.

noita combines the thing i hate most in games, with the thing i love most.  and it also adds in the falling sand game that i used to spend hours on in high school.  it also adds another game feature i despise, obtuse secrets that require you to be INTELLIGENT to figure it out.  im not smart man come on.  but it also has something else i adore, references to real life mysticism!

all in all the package is very endearing.  there's something very special about this game, and every time i play it i remember i both hate it passionately and love it more than any other indie game i've ever played.  the high stress moments are very balls retreating up your body, and the more peaceful moments are genuinely serene.  death lurks around every corner but as long as you're a brave, but cautious little witch you can generally come out on top.

There's no wizarding game where you feel as powerful or godlike as you do in Noita, while still being able to be instantly killed by all sorts of random mechanics you could never realistically never have foreseen. This contrast is also what makes the game so fun - being an omnipotent allmighty wizard holds no meaning if it's something you easily accomplish every restart.
  
The mechanics of wandbuilding in this game are so intricate that very few understand even half of it, but you don't even need to understand all that much to have a great time. 

The only negative thing I can think of is that there's not *enough* of the game, although there's still probably upwards of 200 hours (probably more if you do the longest quests in the game) should you never consult the wiki.

Great random mapping through each playthrough, can save and play later, until you die, which will happen a ton.

The perks and wands make this game so much fun, you basically start out like a weak ronald weasley, and can then turn into voldemort if you get better wands and spells, the wands have different stats such as the recharge time of using spells, mana capacity, more.

Perks can be found after completing levels, my personal favorite is vampirism, or the one that makes you have spider legs (can't think of the name of the perk). But there are soooo so many I have barely played 14 hours on the game so far. Apparently you can beat the game? I haven't made it that far without blowing myself up.

I don't want to give too much away, the game is so worth buying if you enjoy progressive rouge-like games.

One minute you love it to bits, you're casting spells that make you think you are invincible, then you die because you find yourself at the receiving end of some novel and possibly ridiculous chain reaction that you failed to anticipate. Sometimes it's just some simple thing that you just haven't seen before. Sometimes you just have to learn the hard way that something really is flammable after all. And every time you hate it a bit and have to go do something else. But then the game pulls you back in.

If I had to compare this to anything, I would go with FTL, because both seem more or less impossible to beat in the beginning and over time as you learn more and more you get further and further. You have only four slots for wands and four slots for other items like potions and it makes this hard in the same way that FTL or similar games are hard, and it's perfection because you have to think carefully about what weapons to prioritize. Some wands are better for digging, others are better for sniping, others you just fill with everything you can imagine and unleash mayhem that probably gets you killed in the process. It's wonderful how you can add, remove, mix and match spells and spell modifiers, sometimes with deadly results (resulting in more rage quitting, realizing what you did wrong, seething for a while and then starting a new run).

While this can be good, the lack of direction makes it difficult to figure out what to do. Noita would benefit immensely from NPC's that offer guidance on the many mechanics the game has to offer.

The gameplay loop is very repetitive in that you are constantly dying to try and learn more about how the game mechanics work. After enough deaths this just becomes tedious and exhausting rather than fun. Especially since you start from zero every time you die. Let me get to the fun part and learn without having to spend 20-30 mins getting back to where I was.

The lack of a meta progression system hurts in this regard too. This would at least provide some indication that the player is actually doing something right.

Amidst a ballet of algorithmic alchemy, you will find yourselves cloaked in the robes of a sorcerer, navigating the cavernous abyss where the familiar laws of nature are but whispers and suggestions.

To saunter through ""Noita"" is to dance with uncertainty – every grain of the pixelated underworld is touched by the wand of simulation. Here, elements frolic with a mischievous gleam; fire sprints with wild abandon across explosive powders, water waltzes gracefully around your cloak, which is as whimsical as it is a repository of eldritch secrets.

Delve into this cryptic cavalcade, and you shall discover a bestiary most bizarre. Creatures of such pixel-perfect malice, they would give a necromancer's spellbook an existential crisis. Cast your spells – which I assure you come in more flavors than an interdimensional candy shop – but do take care not to singe your eyebrows. Magic here is a fickle friend; it giggles at the chaos it brings.

Every plunge into the cavern's heart is a fresh fever dream. The walls twist and the laws of physics are quaint suggestions, often scribbled in the margins of reality. Dabble in the art of crafting spells and watch as your creations either blossom into a flower of destruction or wilt into a herb of mild inconvenience.

Imagine the sight of a witch's hat, suddenly bestowed with wings, attempting to fathom the mechanics of flight and you won’t be far off. ""Noita"" embraces its own absurdity like a jester at the court of darkness. It is as likely to inflict a smirk with its bizarre interactions as it is to furrow your brow in bewildered defeat.

In its essence, ""Noita"" is the whisper in the dark, the chuckle in the face of demise, a potion brewed with equal parts wonderment and bewilderment. So, capes on, wands at the ready; just keep one eye on the shadows and the other looking for the next anarchic giggle. The game is a soiree of the unconventional, inviting all who dare to rewrite the rulebook in a land where even gravity is subject to negotiation.

Every playthough you learn something new: how this spell works with that spell, how this potion can get me through this otherwise tough section, how this enemy reacts and fights, etc. Even though on a surface level, it seems as if you are repeating yourself going through the same areas, every game will be different, with different challenges you have to adapt to. You are never not kept on your toes.
If you are just starting out on this game, allow yourself the time to soak in everything. You will not beat this game quick, even if you have seen gameplay before you play it, you need experience and alot of it. You have to be a wizard, a warrior, an alchemist and a strategist simultaneously to achieve good runs, and that takes time and experience.

My personal favorite thing about this game is the fact that the descending progressing levels of increasing difficulty with the final boss at the end COULD be all that there is to this game and it still be a good game. But there is an entire WORLD surrounding it in all cardinal directions, filled with secrets, quite frankly to the brim. So if you get good at the game and beat the boss, try exploring a bit more, and see what challenges and strange places you may get yourself into. 

And most importantly, have fun. Don't become attached to a run, understand that the more you play, the more you learn, and with each death, you become a better player. But still pray to our lord and saviour RNGesus, because sometimes in this game, a single pixel could set off a cacophony of unfortunate events, one of those events being your ultimate demise.",1702542782,1702542782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is deep. It's a roguelite that kind of expects you to have already graduated from metroidvania school. Even still, this game is difficult, but because of the you-never-know-what-youre-going-to-get-next element and incredible variations on wands, spells, perks, just for starters, it makes you want to play again and again just to see how far you can get.

Some people may not like the roguelite aspect of this game but if you're as old as me you'll remember Metroid was closer to a rougelite that most ""modern"" mertroidvania games. This game does not hold your hand and again, feels more like old-school Metroid than it does, say Hollow Knight (a game I also love.)

Even though the graphics are 8bit in look, the feel is very different. Nearly every pixel is affected by physical simulation and always seems to deliver surprises. This game is smooth, although at times it can drop frames a bit if you start causing lots of explosions all around you. There's really no map (there is a map of sorts in mid-late-game content.) The only real meta-progression is a series of achievements, or Pillars, as they're called in the game. Otherwise you start from zero every time, with 2 random wands (from a much shallower pool of possible combinations) and a flask of random fluid, of which there are many. As you progress (downward, usually, at least at the start,) you find more powerful and unusual wands, perks and other miscellaneous oddities.

A totally unique, simulated world that seems so inviting and intriguing at first, Noita quickly teaches you that in this world you have few friends but great rewards await you. Dive deep, find hidden clues to secrets with great rewards and at all times take care!

The game that made me question the value of eyebrows, the necessity of pants, and the structural integrity of pixelated caves. Welcome to the wizarding world where spells are your superpower, and accidental self-destruction is your university diploma.

[olist]
[*]Graphics. This is probably the most good-looking roguelike I've ever played. They are not as blocky as other pixel art games, and the movement feels good. I like that each pixel has its own effect and interacts with each other, which makes them feel like realistic atoms. The visual effects of the spells are impressive. With a carefully designed wand, one can literally make scenes as cool as or even cooler than those in professional productions.
[*]Complex mechanics. The effects of materials, spells, perks, enemies and items, and how they interact with each other are very complex. They combine to give many interesting mechanics. On the other hand, the game doesn't force the player to know or master too many mechanics right away.
[*]Mystery. All those cryptic texts and strange objects pique curiosity. The world is huge and filled with secrets. It invites exploration and gives a sense of discovery. I like that it doesn't force you to visit everywhere and instead just sort of place them there. Once the player finishes the obvious biomes, going left, right, down, or up all leads to new areas.
[/olist]
Several things that I feel could be better for me are
[olist]
[*]The wand mechanics is confusing and not explained well. I have to watch quite a bunch of videos to understand how it works exactly. Even now I'm still not quite sure about how some of the advanced spells work. I think it would be interesting to add the knowledge of spells and wands as a reward within the game. This is an experience that only a mechanically deep game can give. A feature like an encyclopedia that gets populated as you experience things would be nice too.
[*]I hope there are more friendly/companion creatures or, even better, NPCs. The world is huge and after the standard biomes, it honestly feels a bit lonely to explore the world alone. While exploring a dangerous world filled with wonders is an experience in itself, I find it can get tiresome with a lack of purpose. I think adding some quests with stories can add more meaning to the exploration and make it more fun.

I had no idea how to build wands and what to do. The game does not explain anything wand related. Once I understood the way wands worked then everything changed. And I mean it really changed. I made some totally broken wands that would kill anything in a second while digging through almost any material. I was finally able to fully explore the game and complete everything. 

So, if you take time to fully understand how the wands work and have a little patience, this game is really rewarding. The way the elements are used is awesome. Fire, water, earth, electricity, and everything else. No other game goes so in-depth. No other game will also kill you instantly more than this game will. Explosions, picking up wands that instantly kill you when you fire them, being on fire and out of your water flask. All kinds of death, over and over. Youtube videos helped me a lot. I beat the game and killed many of the optional bosses. There is a lot of content here. If you like roguelikes then I recommend this game.

First there was Magick, the mesh and the weave, the interconnected relativity of all-thing.
Where Magick's matrix slacked, second there was Chaos, tumbling and twisting the unhemmed seams.
Those who witnessed Chaos conjured the third, Order they called it. Rules by which seen chaos might cease.
The Witnesses, made of Magick and Chaos, did not follow their own Order. So they birthed the fourth, and named it Sin.

In the time since, every civilization has suggested these things came in the reverse order. That the evil of Sin is inherent, and that Order is necessary to weaken Sin-- but that Order requires constant maintenance because of Chaos... And rarely do Witnesses speak truly on the formation of Magick.

Great game, story doesn't matter and can only be found through hard to get and cryptic lore fragments, gameplay is phenomenal, game looks beautiful, no bugs to be found. When I say 'average' game time, I mean, being a rougelike, the time it takes to complete a single run. Total time is ridonk. 12 hours in and still haven't beat the game. Lots of blood and some gore, sound is also phenomenal. Its a VERY hard game, so just be prepared for MANY ragequits.",1701558591,1701558591,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

** Spell Crafting **

Noita's spell crafting system is truly special, and is something that I've been looking for for a long, long time. And I highly suggest that any developer looking to create something similar, to study this game. I want more games to give me brain-rot levels of theory crafting. I want games to let me attach so many modifiers to my wand that I crash my game. No, I don't *want* you to fix it. I want to feel like my meddling in arcane arts that I know little about caused the universe to implode.

The Spell Crafting system can make the game feel entirely different from one person to another depending on how experienced they are. GamerGonzales2009 might settle for just putting on a bunch of Reduce Cast Delay modifiers with a standard Spark Bolt and call it a day, where as XxXCosmoNebulaWizardXxX might be one shotting bosses by boosting his spell damage for each pixel he spawns on screen prior to firing it and going to parallel universes.

Seriously - this game is as deep as you want it to be. I'd also like to give two recommendations for new players:

1. Get a mod that permanently gives you Edit Wands Anywhere. Dev says they took away the ability to edit wands anywhere because players were spending too much time tinkering with wands. I say, that's half of the point of the game. So just do it. There's exploits that allow for the functionality near enough anyway, and Hardcore Mode has it by default. So you might as well.

2. If you REALLY want to know the ins and outs of wand crafting, I highly recommend the Spell Lab mod. It'll give you some interactive challenges that teach you more in-depth things about the game's spell systems. You don't need it to have fun, and infact I first encourage you to do a few runs on your own. But if you want to take your wands to the next level, there's no better way to do it than with Spell Lab's tutorials.

** Knowledge Progression **

Noita is a roguelike with basically zero permanent upgrades. The closest it gets is that whenever you discover a spell it then becomes possible for it to appear in shops in later runs. But that's about it.

However, whilst most of Noita's worlds are randomly generated, they *do* have a number of areas, events and items that are either guaranteed to spawn, or otherwise have a high chance of spawning.

The best way I can explain this is by pointing to Terraria: every world is randomly generated, but there's always going to be a Dungeon to the far right or left of the world, there's always going to be beaches that will have chests under the oceans, ect.

Noita has A LOT of things like that. And learning these is crucial, because you can go from barely surviving with a wand that shoots eggshells, to entering each early-mid stage of a run with powerful modifiers, items that can be exchanged for strong wands, and so on.

I'm not gonna spoil the big ones, but I will give you a small example: In the beginning mines area, going to the left will eventually take you to an area called the Dark Cave. You'll need a good digging wand (TNT, Bombs, ect), but you can blow an opening into the cave, and within it, there's a guaranteed max health upgrade. You'll need a light source of some kind though. 

That's the most BASIC example. I'm not joking when I say the game is filled with things like that. To the point where your 'route' through the game can vastly impact your success, vs just constantly going down, down, down.

** Content Quantity **

And lastly, Noita has a TON of stuff in it. From the sheer number of spells and modifiers, to the areas, bosses, collectibles and endings. It's not as huge as something like Binding of Isaac, but let's just say that Nolla Games didn't waste their time over the years - if you want to see most of what Noita has to offer, you're going to be putting *atleast* 70~80 hours into the game. Hell I'm sitting at 200+, and I havn't experienced everything the game has.

Noita is no longer receiving official updates, but it lives on through mods, with official modding support.


Noita is a game that doesn't care weither you live, die, or crash the game with Divide By multipliers. It's a game that encourages exploration of both its world, and its wand building mechanics. It's a game that'll piss you off by stunlocking you from off-screen into a pool of lava.

 The problem, is the gameplay loop. If you don't give your players some kind of reason to keep playing other than 'start new game"", they might not. For me, this gameplay loop of just ""die due to lack of experience knowledge of how the game works, and that's it, no skill points or some kind of character improvement or information/direction about the game just try again, noob"" really didn't capture my enthusiasm, and that lack of motivation on top of all of the amazing possibilities a game engine like this presents, just sucked the life out of the experience that is being sold. I suppose it's worth it on sale, but for the full price, I just would need a bit more substance.

The game forces to play extremely conservatively, despite having all these fun mechanics that you're heavily discouraged from participating if you want to progress.

Sure the RNG will sometimes (often?) piss you off, and your great run can come to a quick end when you get stuck on a tiny rocky pixel you didn't see, but the adventure and spell experimentation are well worth.

I love this game so much that whenever I feel hatred towards it for ending my 1 hour run with an offscreen nuclear explosion, I want to keep playing even more to get back at the game for fucking me over. I'm like a battered and abused housewife who doesn't want to call the police because ''its okay he's just drunk, he'll get better soon''

Wandbuilding in Noita is akin to learning a new language, verbal or coding. You start off completely clueless and fuck yourself over, but each time you fuck up you learn a small nugget of information that eventually adds up to you being able to form a word or two. You learn common rules and structures, building yourself up for more complex words. You can now maybe form a small sentence a child would be capable of, but this is only the beginning of a long and rewarding journey.

Never played a game that fucks you over harder than Noita, but still keeps you coming back for more. I've been playing games daily since the early flash era, so this may mean something to people reading. Do not play if you aren't willing to play a hardcore roguelike which puts knowledge above all else. You will die, possibly hundreds of times, before you even reach or kill the final boss. And that could be considered the prologue of the game. Also has some of the most cryptic and esoteric secrets in all of gaming, with some still being actively solved to this very day.

You can't move magic abilities until you're in the safe room, which wasn't safe because everything is one giant map. I was killed by a powerful undead lich in the first safe room through the portal. There are 2 portals at the bottom of the first level. Each time you respawn the world changes. Loading times are really fast when things rearrange. I've seen evidence of the last world, proving that the world just gets an overlap. The destructible environment is appealing but only for a while. You'll find wands and potions. You can discover different things.

This game has no checkpoint saves. You can save and quit, loads where you were standing before closing the game, but once you die you're back to the beginning. This is a hardcore type game. A one shot adventure. You collect gold nuggets as currency that disappear after several seconds, could be 30 seconds. The flashing of the nugget will increase before this happens.

You don't get to choose your abilities before respawning. For those confused about the recording it only saves what happened as picture animations in gif format, like those memes.

Liquids stick to you and can either give you a bit of protection or make it easier to get hurt depending on the liquid. Any liquid you get in contact with replaces any previous liquid depending on how deep you went in said liquid. You can get wet up to chest height, at least based on what shows on your robe.

Dying made it feel like I wasn't making progress. The most frustrating part was being attacked by the undead lich in the first safe room. In another instance a worm dug it's way through the stone dividing the first and second area.

As much as I enjoyed getting wands, gold and abilities I can't recommend this game yet. Not until at least safe rooms are guaranteed safe. A big help would be being allowed to choose your starting wands and abilities after discovering new abilities.

Edit:
I would like to know what the devs intentions are for this game in the future if they plan to implement more control to the players or if they don't mind file editing or don't care about mods. I want to succeed playing this game within the rules and confines of the game without ""cheating"".

Step two is breaking the rules.
Step three is realising that what you thought were the rules were in fact meaningless the whole time and the devs already accounted for it. If you can do it, its allowed (and accounted for)

If your c0ck and or ba11s are currently locked in a vice and you aren't receiving enough satisfaction through the level of pain it gives you, I would highly recommend Noita for it provides an endless source of it!

Unfortunately the uninitiated cannot be told what Noita is, you just need to experience it for yourself.

The Good: Wild, weird, wonderful sandbox; secrets; excellent pixel graphics; secrets; addictive, one more run, format; explosions; easy to learn, hard to master game play; secrets; tonnes of mods to customise your game to your tastes; secrets.

The Bad: base game mechanics are a bit unfair and punish curiosity and exploration, which leads to unfair deaths that discourage new players; thankfully, mods can change that.

If you enjoy games like Streets Of Rogue or Magicite, you should definetly try this one.

There are two downsides though:
- The game is pretty short. I completed it recently. It does have a more difficult mode though that unlocks after completion.
- How well you do is 50% skill and 50% luck. If you are lucky and find good traits, you will increase your chances drastically.

Correction after like 100+ more hours:
- The game is absolutely not short. There are so many secrets and the map is so much larger than you'd think.
- The game is not dependent on luck. It makes a difference, but the more you learn about the game mechanics, the better wands you'll be able to build in the beginning of your run.

You're thrown into the world with very few clues as to what you're supposed (or able) to do, and left to fend for yourself.

You die, and a lot.  The game is very fair, but sometimes you get Noita'd for ridiculous reasons.  Falling explosive boxes, ignited by Stendari above.  Taikasauva-bearing Hiisi.  Teleporting into lava.  Surprise propane tanks and falling KK-Tankki.  Matos and Lukki spawning angry Stevari/Skoude.  Surprise Ukko.  Olematon.  Matkija.  Midas.  Poly.

As you play, it'll happen less.  You'll dodge well.  You'll know not to get ukkoskivi'd, and wow to befriend/gank Steve.  You'll find Hämis and Lukki cute.  You'll know how to build wands.  How to explore.  How to transmute.  To see the non-existent.  To heal.  To travel.

There's some permanent progress, too: unlocked spells and perks for the determined, pillars for the brave, and cosmetics for the worthy.

Despite the game's apparent simplicity... you'll find the depth of lore, the number of secrets, the interactions between creatures and materials, the sheer amount of things you are capable of doing -- once you learn how -- is just incredible. Every playthrough can unveil something new, even after thousands of them.

For the uninitiated, the progression of the game can be relatively slower initially, to being overwhelmingly complex once you progress enough.

[h1]Overview[/h1]

Noita practically presents no information or narrative on what to do other than your basic instincts of going in the cave and descending until you beat it. This is merely a smokescreen that instigates you to cross it and explore its boundaries, or more accurately its lack of.

It tests and rewards your creative capabilities by playing outside of its intended structure. The boundaries of this game are intentionally presented under the guise of a traditional roadblock you normally see in games, signifying that you cannot go past those bounds, when in reality there is no limit to it, quite in the literal sense.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The game employs a myriad of spells to be found or discovered under a surprisingly complex system of combinations in which you can utilize them giving different results, whenever positive or .... disastrously negative, either for you, for the game, or for your PC's ability to comprehend your spell's power output. Even with the amount of time i've played, there's quite a large number of spell combinations that i've yet to find.

It is well optimized for having every pixel simulated through a physics engine, and i played it relatively well with my busted GTX 760 on Linux through Proton. Every environment is completely destructible, no matter what you encounter. Various liquids and environmental hazards can have chemical reactions depending what they interact with. The liquid system is deceptively complex, as much like the spells, there are numerous combinations you can experiment with. 

There are MANY secrets, and many (un)fortunately quite obscure. There are types of secrets that had community efforts to be uncovered, meaning that some methods of finding secret places or items might require the usage of a wiki. The devs however have done a better job placing more hints compared to the game's earlier builds.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

The difficulty of this game uses your own traditional knowledge of the roguelike structure against you. It does not test your pattern recognition or your ability to brute force your way to become stronger and stronger with unlocks until completion. Its trial and error is done primarily through experimentation and exploration, where your creative freedom dictates how you can to approach or avoid an encounter, and learn new information with every death. 

There is one aspect of this game where it makes or breaks for many. It is something that everyone will experience it as they play. No matter at what point in the game you are, no matter how overpowered you become, there will always be an unfair encounter where it will end your life. It can be anything, ranging from a nuclear explosion, to a few pixels of liquid that could potentially end your entire run.

The possibilities of busting your veins from sheer frustration are limitless. It is unfair, it is random, and it is understandable why many might not enjoy the inevitable chaotic nature that for the most part can't be prevented in this game, as it creates a lack of control on the player's part that could undo hours of grinding a run, which might understandably give an unappealing experience. This constant lingering danger is however what makes it exciting for others like me. There will always be a constant uncontrollable tension present, and your end will manifest itself sooner or later, whenever from your own actions, or outside of it.

Because of that, you do have invest a fair amount of time in order to properly acclimate to the environment of the game and its dangers, just so you can delay the inevitable, or dare i say, overcome it. Runs in Noita can take hours to complete if you want to true knowledge, meaning there is a process of tediousness that you will partake due to the sheer scale of the game's playground.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Chockfull of secrets, optimizations, routes and endings, this game offers a great experience, to be enjoyed in depth and for a long time.

The community for Noita is helpful and friendly, YouTube is full of videos explaining how to get a grip of basic concepts, but if you want the true experience and having no help while crashing through the holy mountain, the learning curve is never ending. No matter how many hours you have at the game, something will surprise you, two runs will hardly be the same and there's always something new to learn.

Be warned, though, this game is hard. Hard to learn, hard to master and hard to control. Things will explode and kill you, enemies from unseen corners will snipe you, you are not even safe from yourself in your quest for knowledge. The wand system allows for one of the coolest - if not the coolest - way I've seen in a videogame to experiment and tinker with your powers. 

Art and music are out of this world, offering a great dive into the game's atmosphere and lore. One of the best examples of stoner rock and alternative music in videogames.

I was curious to see how this mechanic would affect the gameplay and the exploration of the procedurally generated world. I was not disappointed.

Noita is a roguelike game where you play as a wizard who can wield various wands and spells to fight enemies and manipulate the environment. The game is challenging and unforgiving, but also rewarding and addictive. Every run is different and full of surprises, as you never know what you will find in the next biome or what kind of wand or spell you will stumble upon.

The game encourages experimentation and creativity, as you can customize your wands and spells with different modifiers and combinations. You can also interact with the world in many ways, such as digging through the terrain, setting things on fire, creating floods, or even summoning black holes. The game’s physics engine is impressive and realistic, as every pixel has its own properties and behaviors. You can see how liquids mix, how materials burn, how explosions affect the surroundings, and how enemies react to different elements.

The game is not easy, though. You will die a lot, and sometimes in very frustrating ways. You might accidentally kill yourself with your own spells, or trigger a chain reaction of destruction that you can’t escape from. You might also encounter enemies that are too powerful or too fast for you to handle, or traps that are hard to spot or avoid. The game does not explain much to you, either. You have to figure out everything by yourself, from the effects of the spells to the secrets of the world. The game does not have a tutorial or a difficulty setting, so you have to learn by trial and error.

But that’s also part of the charm of Noita. The game is full of mystery and discovery, and every run is a new adventure. You never know what you will find or what will happen next. You might discover a hidden temple, a friendly NPC, a rare spell, or a powerful artifact. You might also encounter a boss, a curse, a trap, or a deadly enemy. The game keeps you on your toes and makes you adapt to the situation. You have to use your wits and your magic to survive and progress.

Noita is a game that I bought for the fire pixel physics, but ended up loving for the whole package. It’s a game that is challenging, rewarding, and fun. It’s a game that makes you feel like a real wizard, with all the power and the danger that comes with it. It’s a game that I highly recommend to anyone who likes roguelikes, magic, and physics. Noita is a game that is worth playing.",1700543621,1700543621,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The combination of sandbox-y physics and roguelite elements makes Noita a joy to play, even though I haven't gotten farther than a few stages in. The spell system was a bit difficult to wrap my head around -- as you have to take into account not only spells but the wands and modifiers you use with them -- but it's incredibly rewarding to find a combination which fills an area with oil. Oil? What's so special about that? This, my friend, is where the physics/simulation aspect of Noita comes into play. Since every pixel is simulated, that pool of oil we made can be lit on fire (WATCH THEM BURN MWAHAHAHA). There's an abundance of flammable materials in Noita; as a bit of a pyromaniac, I love to watch the world burn. What makes it even better is that plenty of other materials exist which you can use to vanquish your enemies (I won't get into them here because the review would be a 20 page essay). And, the physics that everything follows is excellent. If a game uses a default physics engine, it's easy to tell, which hurts immersion. That's not the case in Noita; when you punt an explosive barrel of toxic sludge across a cavern, it feels believable. Sometimes, I'll sit around and do sandbox-y experiments because it's that fun to mess around in the game engine.

Despite its fun sandbox and roguelite elements, Noita isn't a game for everyone. As a beginner (and likely later on too), you'll die. A lot. For fans of roguelites and roguelikes, this is expected; RNG is a significant factor in how long you'll survive. If you're new to the genre, temper your expectations. The game will screw you over and put you into unfair situations, kill you, and that super cool wand you just got will be gone. That's the reality of roguelites; the journey is more important than the destination.

I'm excited to see how Noita's development continues. The devs recently added mod support, which is of course excellent for the community. As Noita is an early access game, I won't give a 100% recommend yet (because the devs could abandon the game or eff it up big time), but as far as early access goes, it's a very enjoyable and promising game.",1572645263,1700293685,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The value judgement the game wants you to make in each enemy encounter is to play patiently, slowly, and safely to prevent any kind of damage accruing over time. There is skill expression in the decisions you make and your knowledge of the wand system, but having to treat the smallest of encounters as if you're on 1 HP gets boring very, very quickly.

To me, the game was not ""fun"" until I lucked into a source of infinite healing, meaning I could engage enemies head-to-head instead of meekly peeking around corners and sniping at them from half a screen away until they were dead. Combat felt more interactive that way, and there were still threats I needed to be careful of even if I could regenerate after the battle. But infinite healing makes the game a cakewalk. A dozen hours later into the run, I was practically unkillable outside of a few edge cases. The game had turned into a glorified wand-building sandbox.

I really wanted to like this game, and I wish there was a middle ground -- maybe along the lines of a small shield that regenerates outside of combat.",1700153961,1700153961,False,1,0,0.46210142970085144,0,True,False,False

Noita is pure chaos, you will rarely- if ever- feel like you are ""in control"" on your average Noita run. The game sometimes kind of decides that you're just dead now, sort of like Darkest Dungeon does, but playing conscientiously and generally being carefully will keep you alive long enough to get to the next rest area, spend half and hour building wands, only to immediately get dumpster'd in the next area.

As you start the game, you wake up outside next to a mine holding 2 random wands and a potion. There's also some stones which tell you the controls, but that's as far as Noita goes in terms of helping you. Everything else? Figure it out lmao. This game is very unforgiving and frustrating, so if you cannot deal with dying over and over again because of your own stupid choices, completely random shieit and trial and error lessons, then this is not a game for you.

There's also a very unique mechanic in Noita. Every pixel is simulated, meaning that every pixel can be interacted with in a way or another. It's great, but just keep in mind that it also means that a few pixels can be all it takes to kill you.

Outside of the aforementioned simulated pixels mechanic and the classic roguelikes elements, I would say a major pull for this game is its wand building. The game features an absurdly high amount of different spells (totalling to 393), which you can combine into almost anything. You want a spell which nukes the entire level? Check. You want a spell which fills the entire screen and crashes your game? Check. You want to deal a million damage in a single shot and turn everything to dust particles? Check and it is also an achievement. The possibilities really are limitless, because the spells react in unique ways based on their order and what other spells they are combined with.

And finally let's not forget the secrets. There are a ton of them, some minor and some big. I'll be honest some of these are so obscure that I really do not expect anyone to pull these off without guide, so do not feel bad about looking these up. Also fall back on this advice if you ever feel like you've seen everything, there's bound to be something you've missed.",1638135066,1700034844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update:

It still needs serious balance fixes. Certain enemies are far too accurate and aggressive for the early levels. I care less about balancing the later levels because by then you should have a decent build going... but those floating slime guys. Man. They suck. 

The shotgun guys are way too accurate and they're always doing trick shots.

Great addition to any Steam library. Just buy on sale if you aren't into this kind of game. If you do like this kind of game though, Noita will make you bust a nut. The physics stuff alone is meganut level.

Edit: Reinstalling this was a mistake. All this game does is waste your time. Spending a hour on a run over and over is so fucking boringly frustrating. You get into a loop of trying to go faster and faster to try to make up for the literal lost hours you spent in the same areas.

Noita is an [i]insanely difficult[/i] video game. Not in a ""X is the Dark Souls of Y"" sense. But in a seemingly random, punishing way. You will die. Again and again and again and again. And the sooner you accept that, the sooner you'll realize the beauty of it all:

[i]That's exactly what you're here for.[/i] The looming threat of having all your progress reset over one mere miscalculation creates an oppressive atmosphere comparable to horror games. Every time you find somethign new, you'll be scared. And yet... You'll carry on. Because you'll want to find out what's beyond all those obstacles. You'll want to push this game to its absolute limits. Curiosity may kill the cat, sure, but no one can deny its allure.

But you won't blindly charge through all hazards. You'll study them first. Hesitate. Plan ahead. You'll learn to respect every single pixel on your screen.

Even though Noita is simply a 2D dungeon crawler with physics akin to those powder games on the Play Store, it will burn the concept of Equivalent Exchange into your mind. You want something? [i]Anything?[/i] Then you better be ready to sacrifice a piece of yourself in return.

I'm gonna add a quick addendum in here about the system requirements. This game wants as much single thread performance as you can give it. Minimum req says ""Dual Core CPU, Intel i5"" listen to the i5 part not the dual core part, I'd probably say 4th gen or newer is a reasonable starting point. 

Recommended spec says ""The more cores the better"" which also seems wrong but better encapsulates the idea of what you want. I'm not a dev, IDK what's going on in the background, but I'm getting utilization of about 7% when the game is being pushed to the limit, out of 12 cores that would mean it's almost maxing 1. Seems to me that we would favor the most single thread performance as possible, I previously had an i9-10850k and Noita can bring that down with physics calculations, now I have a Xeon W-3235 which functionally isn't that different, so favor stronger cores on as new an architecture as possible.

Still super fun and the game has a ton to offer in terms of replay value. If you haven't played much or haven't played any at all, then you should look up the Noita map. It does contain some spoilers but it gives you an idea of how massive this game actually is. This is a game that I'm sure I will never even be able to do everything and that is halfway because of RNG. The game is so much deeper than it first seems when you first start playing. Highly recommend this to anyone thinking about picking it up. 

Just buy it now or on sale. It is worth it either way.

EDIT - After 400 hours and a good amount of wins I can honestly say this is the best single player rouge like game. The only reason this doesn't get best overall single player game is that there are to many different types of games but this is my personal favorite and has been since I found it. I still dont even have a full understanding of all the wand crafting nor have I unlocked all the spells enemies or perks. Albeit I am getting pretty close but I still have a ton to figure out. The game has literal infinite replay value. So long as you can get creative and like to experiment you can make whatever kind of wand you want. I wish i could type out all the things I love about this game but the list would keep going and going and going. 

My conclusion is that more people need to play this game and give it a shot. It has much more than meets the eye if you can get past the first hours of sucking and dying over and over. The more love that this game gets the more updates and attention it will receive. It has by far the best community of any game I have ever played which is a huge bonus. Tons of people willing to help you learn and understand the mechanics and tips of the game. 

This game is a full on 11/10/ 
Beautiful physics engine with some minor quirks. 
Game looks cool as hell. 
Replay value is infinite.
huge modding community. 
great community in general.

-Immersive sim
-Physical 2D simulation

So you start off with some absolutely trash wand. You can't do anything about it. So you go down since you just started and you don't know anything. You wander around, progress, maybe die a little and you're thinking well that's okay, I'll get further. Maybe you do get further. But you don't really learn anything.

And by that of course I mean, you don't learn anything actually valuable. Noita is an impenetrable game and even when you do figure out what something is, it still doesn't teach you how to take advantage of it. This is a game based on secrets. It is no exaggeration to say pretty much every single aspect of the game is some sort of secret the game expects you to figure out on your own.

If you play this game in English too I am fairly certain there are deliberately misleading tooltips and so on just so the game can be that much more 'mysterious'.

Noita gets pretty quickly frustrating when you end up repeating the same couple areas over and over again. It gets really frustrating when you realize that further exploration hinges on getting the 'right' perks and the 'right' wands and spell effects. It gets downright hateful when you learn things like, the devs added new perks in an update post-release that dilute the useful perks with many many terrible ones. That the perk pool itself (or perk 'deck' maybe) is so absurdly unbalanced that you can sometimes sift through a dozen and see none you really want or that will strongly help you.

You can play for hours and not see any useful or particularly fun wands. And that's this whole game. Noita is a game where you explore, find absolutely atrocious wands with limited and terrible capacity and useless effects and spells on them, and then you can't even edit them unless you find one perk (out of like 60) that lets you change wands anywhere. So then you just keep going, hoping maybe around the next corner you'll find a new wand that isn't terrible. You don't. Instead you find some enemy that shoots at you off-screen or something like that.

And then when you die you just have to start over and repeat everything you just did all over again in pretty much the most tedious way possible. You have to sift through the first couple areas you've seen a dozen times, again. You have to make sure you don't miss any health upgrades or the potential for a useful wand or potion. And you need to do it because if you don't get at least a decent start you're not going to get far enough anywhere to get any good wands.

Even if you happen to like, get really really strong, and clear the game, well. Congratulations. You beat the game. Now what? There's absolutely no direction or anything after that so then I guess you just meander around the rest of the game, possibly find wands that are terrible, and maybe die to some random enemy type you have never seen before that does a damage type you aren't immune to so you swear at the game and stop playing for the day.

Or maybe you do what I am sure most people who reviewed this positively have done and just look up other stuff you can do on the wiki so you can just know what is even expected of you.

And that's Noita. It basically has every single roguelike problem ever and you're also expected to do like 12 hour runs that end in dismal failure while you wander around a world you don't understand and probably don't have too much interest in because nothing really makes sense and all the things in the game exist just to fight you. Or maybe you beat the game and then go ""okay cool"" at the totally and completely unsatisfying 'conclusion'. I guess it expects you to find some other different ending that isn't 'the ending' that most people get.

Maybe there's like another 100 hours or something you can spend meandering around the world in hopes of stumbling by random chance on things you can do that you haven't seen yet.

Or maybe it's all just a waste of your time. I'm going with that option because I am done gaslighting myself into thinking ""maybe the next run, I will have fun"".",1569909212,1698447522,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Take your time, the game isn't short and the point isn't actually arrive to the end the fastest way possible. I didn't even finished it after all this hours but it only takes less then an hour to end a run. So yeah, take your time, explore and enjoy the trip instead of running to the destination.

- Embrace the death. You'll probably die, a lot, and it won't even be your direct fault most of time. There are
accidental explosions, acid lakes and a lot of oil in some places and it's totaly ok to die while trying a new spell just to discover that the damn giant disc has a pretty interesting balistic.

- Try new things even if you think that they can end a run, do it and you may discover wonders of spell combinations that you didn't even thought about. This trip is about trying and trying and trying weird stuff and find yourself in weird situations but it's allways something fun or beautyfull.

~700 hours later I can confirm that I still adore this game. The difficulty can be a bit frustrating, as it can be a bit too punishing when you first explore through the game, but if you can live with the feeling of a chaotic world with potentially run-ending surprises lurking behind any odd corner, this has to be the roguelike with the most player-agency I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying.
Sometimes the rng can pull a fast one on you, by simply not giving you anything you can use for progressing the game in a natural manner, but some experience and creativity can usually amend this to a certain extent. Late-game you can avenge your own deaths by declaring war on the game itself and become disgustingly powerful, yet I've found myself simply enjoying the gameplay-loop of the main path, with the odd deviation every now and then. The physics and destructibility of (as far as I know) literally anything unlucky enough to stand in your way means that you can get quite creative in how you approach traversal and combat. 
Leading up the the release and for the first few months, Nolla pushed the one update after the other (somewhere between one or two meaningful updates, not just singular changes, a week). And somewhat recently, they have implemented a few other impactful changes to both potion-mechanics and cheesy strategies. In my opinion the changes are very welcome, as most of the cheese they removed was tedious and repetitive to perform anyways.

This game can be frustrating, and I've had multiple friends question my sanity when I admit my love for this gem of a game, but if this game happens to rub you the right way, the most difficult part will be putting it down. For me this game has become a zen happy-place that requires you to think through wand-builds, what items to keep for potential rewards further down the depths, and how to maximise the utility of anything you can get your grubby hands on. For an impressive amount of hours, you will keep learning and changing your approach to this seemingly unending rabbithole from the one game-changing crumb of knowledge to the next.",1617615181,1698186172,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a little confused on how the spell crafting system works, as there's not much player guidance yet. I had splitting projectiles equipped on a wand, which would duplicate TNT, but not regular bolts or black holes? Might just be a bug. It needs a long way to go with balancing issues, some enemies nearly instakill you while others seem pretty much harmless. Also, don't fire a black hole into the temple wall, it immediately ends your run, which is pretty awful in my opinion, especially for a roguelike. Especially if it happens accidentally when you're testing out skills of which you don't know what they do yet. Kinda leaves a bad taste after playing a few fun runs.

that time expended racks up extremely fast without either modding the game to make the conditions to learn things easier, cheating the permadeath system by backing up your save or spoiling the game experience by using the community-driven wiki. additionally, it sometimes doesn't feel like knowledge is truly power with certain bad starts. i know it's a funny roguelike trope to just get bad starts dealt by the game, but if you reach the fourth zone and get little resource, it is usually faster to restart the run unless you just want a run W instead of trying to hunt secrets.

the gameplay is fun and when something clicks or you get actionable knowledge, it is extremely satisfying - such as basic alchemy for removing toxic sludge. wand crafting, likewise, is fun - basically a mini deckbuilder within the combat system. the enemies are also quite good, with the later ones acting as a soft deck check, if you wish to explore the secrets of noita. the time spent during progression however, such as the abysmally slow earlygame, is not. you spend a high amount of time in churn. imo, noita would be significantly better as an RPG with how unforgiving the game can be. the roguelike elements, specifically permadeath; and to a lesser extent, the spell weighting system, serve to be a deliberate pain point and causes a lot of start-and-stop.

if you hold no qualms about removing tedium or degrading the game experience by looking up resources, this is a good game *framework* for the player to customize as they wish.

for context, i haven't bothered killing the final boss a single time because i've been more invested in exploring the game world. i've killed [spoiler]four of the world bosses[/spoiler] so far. i've found out [spoiler]how to empower the voiceless key[/spoiler] and found a handful of orb locations. i don't consider myself far in.",1697988871,1697991499,False,17,0,0.617026209831237793,0,True,False,False

Whether it's a wand that just blows up everything in a 3 screen radius, or it's dying by accidentally firing a lightning spell while underwater, the emergent systems and interactions in Noita will keep you on your toes for all of your time with this game.

The world of this game does not make you feel like you are the main character. You're not some hero out to save the world. In Noita, you are a feeble alchemist, struggling against the gods and the world around you as you venture deeper and deeper, motivated only by a lust for deeper knowledge and riches. The way the secrets in Noita are designed reinforce this feeling. They aren't spoonfed to the player, and the average player will likely miss 95% of the content that this game has to offer. This reinforces the player sentiment of exploring a world that existed before you entered it, and that will exist long after you've been burnt to a crisp for the 100th time.

This is a punishing game by all definitions of the word, but it will reward you with a neverending stream of secrets to discover and spells to master if you decide to dedicate your time to understanding its systems.

Noita is a game that throws you in on the deep end with zero guidance. If you hate feeling like you have no idea what is going on then this might not be the game for you. That being said, Noita is full of adventure and wonder. Every time you feel like you understand something the game expands on it multiple times. It does so to the point of being a little bit ridiculous. I don't think anyone could ever actually fully explore the game without looking at guides or Noita wiki. 

The lack of explanation is partially responsible for why the game is so unforgiving. Once you learn and develop methods of dealing with tough enemies or zones, the game gets a little bit more playable. Before this though, you will struggle to complete even the first area. Even when you learn to beat most enemies Noita has a level of uncontrolable chaos that will be responsible for many deaths. Because of this the game is super unforgiving. You will get whittled down with no heals and struggle to find good spells which will ultimately lead to the run ending many many times. 

While the game is rough for new players, if you choose to stick around Noita has one of the best implementations of magic in all of gaming. The wand/spell system is ingenious and unique.

The key to enjoying Noita is being willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of learning and experimentation. Just picked up a wand that insta-casts Giga Black Hole? Give it a try! On your next run, you'll know how it works.

If the punishment for learning is too severe for you, though, I'd recommend checking out the Workshop mods, particularly the one that adds checkpoints between levels.

Its a rouge-like but you start nothing while it's possible to unlock stuff that you can find randomly in the game in your upcoming runs. There are steam achivements but they are quite boring while the in game achivement system is a lot more challenging and fun to do but you need a outside source to know what to do to unlock them (same as some of the steam achivements that is quite odd).
I think it took me about 100 deaths to ""complete"" the game for the first time and based on what i understand that's quite quick and can say after learning a lot more about the game that i had a very bad understanding of the game at that point.
Most of the game is ""hidden"" in the background of the basic gameplay loop and i would estimate that to win the game is like 2% of what there is to do in a single run.",1697567440,1697567440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you're still learning how the game plays, laughing at silly deaths (perhaps you fell in lava, or experimented with a wand) it's fun; then that fades. Yes I did get 100 hours out of this game, yes that makes the money technically worth it. But at the same time, I really wish I had that time back.

This game is a massive time sink. The biggest problem with the game (the one keeping it from perhaps being more popular than it is) is its balancing issues that make the game so rightfully frustrating. The second issue is its habit of being a dopamine feedback loop. You boot up a run, die to something you couldn't help (usually luck based nonsense like finding no wands, usable spells, or health upgrades) and then start over. You do that enough times and eventually you will roll the dice just so, so that it lands perfectly, and you get a good run. But that takes time --- a lot of time. And you know what takes even more time? Committing to a good run. Because with enough patience you can mitigate those bad odds until you have something salvageable. But that's only if you take five minutes to trek over a wasteland, a boring, dry wasteland. Plus everything else you would have to do.

The second thing holding this game back from being beautiful, is its aforementioned balancing issues. When you start you are given one damage wand, and one big boom wand. I consider the big boom wand to be balanced, as every spell it can be loaded with is helpful in some way. It's the d.p.s wand that's the problem. Now, what's preferred? A wand that can kill just about every enemy in the first layer with one hit, or one that takes maybe three? Obviously the former. But that's the range you are given. A completely unfair range that is honestly a small drop in the pond, but it just adds to the unfair role that luck has in determining how well a run goes, instead of skill. And there's more to be said about enemy damage numbers on top of this as well.

There's probably a lot more that could be said against this game, and some for it as well. For instance, the sense of exploration you get when the game is new, is rather novel and fun. But as you learn that getting the proper dice rolls to be able to even explore most of those areas is so slim, that novel feeling fades. Obviously, this game held me for 100 hours, but I honestly that was from the fact that it has such addictive gambling like qualities.

In the end, it feels like the developers spent more time making a puzzle, than an actual game.

TL;DR too much luck based stuff, too much time waste.",1695137727,1697566521,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most games that have this sort of ""hardcore"" type mode where a death means you start over, rely on giving you upgrades you can purchase each time you die, so that next time you can progress further.  This game however, relies on the player learning more about the world they're in.  I really like the take on discovery in this game, where you're constantly learning more about how the world works, and how you can use what is around to your advantage,  Learning how the spells interact with each other, testing the wands you create yourself, finding what perks can help with the spells you have, figuring out what liquids you want to take with you in your flasks for future use, and so much more.  There are probably plenty of people that would get frustrated with the game at the start, because it can seem very difficult, but for those who like a challenge, there is so much to discover in this game.

As quoted from the game itself
""The sacrifice of oneself to the pursuit of knowledge
Is the highest tribute to the gods.""

To me, it's the type of game where I'm always wanting to learn more, and there just seems to always be even more to discover within the game.

If I had to say something negative about the game it would be that there is a few too many unpredictable deaths within the game, and they definitely could be toned down a bit.  Even after knowing what I'm going to come across, sometimes there is just nothing that can be done to avoid all the attacks without making the game tedious/boring.  Not everyone wants to tunnel/dig everywhere, but it is by far the safest method of navigation.  It simply allows the player to skip a lot of enemies they may have had to face, but I think it would have been better if the player could more reliably deal with the enemies directly.",1665237634,1697511315,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is the work of people who have absolutely mastered their craft, and it shows. ""Masterpiece"" doesn't mean ""perfect"" -- but it's damn close.

Are there bugs? Yes. (Surprisingly few, though.)
Are there balance issues? Sure.
Will you get frustrated and curse the very gods when utter bullshit is thrown at you without warning? Absolutely.
Is all of this a part of the totality of the experience that makes it so compelling? You better believe it.

Not only is the gameplay excellent, but the mystery behind everything is captivating, and the technical marvel that is this game's engine is absolutely unbelievable. I still have no idea how the hell they managed to make a game capable of simulating so many millions of pixels with such ease in spite of the immense complexity of possible interactions, even with the chunk system dividing the world up into manageable blocks. And I first played on a now 11-year-old PC without any serious performance issues barring some exceptional circumstances. It's incredible.

One of the most emphatic themes of the entire game is that magic is powerful and mysterious, but also extremely [i]dangerous[/i]. Reckless use can and will quickly lead to your demise. Yet for those who do manage to successfully harness its abilities without self-destruction, it is entirely possible to become godlike -- and that's no exaggeration.

That said, it comes at a high price, and it's a difficult road to travel. I normally don't like permadeath in games, and I honestly do recommend playing -- at least at first -- with a quicksave utility since there's no native, built-in save system, which is my one and only complaint. That will allow you to learn things a bit easier and, probably, actually get through the whole main loop of the game. But I can't really say I fault the game for going the roguelike route, either, and I recommend you refrain from backing up your save once you start exploring the deeper mysteries of the world. Trust me, it really does enhance the experience. Unless, of course, your time is very limited, then by all means savescum away without shame. Whatever it takes to experience this amazing world.

There are countless [i]incredibly[/i] cryptic puzzles to solve here -- most of which I'd never have managed to figure out on my own. But thanks to folks who datamined and analyzed everything they could dig up (which the developers seem to fully encourage), it's possible to experience world-altering cosmic mayhem firsthand. You just might want to look up some guide videos unless you're the type who likes to really dig deep and experiment with very limited clues. But even once you understand [i]what[/i] to do, actually managing to do it successfully is another matter entirely.

On top of all that, there are dozens of high-quality mods to further expand and customize the experience. There's basically no reason I can think of to NOT recommend Noita to anyone who likes combat, experimentation, creativity, exploration, deep lore, extreme replay value, or serious challenge. It has everything, and does [i]all[/i] of it [i]extremely[/i] well.

Its unique from most rogue like out there, with so much specs for players that really want to get completely technical with wands and spells. Finding a good modifier in this game is like a Christmas gift honestly. Understanding what the stats and the mechanics of the game has been incredible and really rewarding at times. 

The huge map and the high amount of things to do will keep you busy for ages. Mini bosses with different strategies to beat them, and even the ""end"" of the game is not the end. Unlike most of the rogue like games out there once you beat the final boss you finish that run. But with the proper spells you could just leave the boss arena and continue playing. This game processes a lot to the point that I just came here due to how the developer utilized pixel simulation whit liquids, smoke, and even the ground, but now I surely have found great interest in the content of this game.

I also wanted to write this review as a hail marry to express one of my discontents about the game. The enemies render view, as readding in some of the forums most of the communiity will respond to a failed run with a ""You got noited"" and for most of the times I will say...whelp that's noita for ya! However I do also think that some enemies can notice you without you noticing they've seen you. For some enemies that make a sound queue you'll know what to do, but for some you just see a projectile coming out of nowhere with no understanding of it. If I were to ask for one change is that some of the enemies form the earlier levels had to have to be in your field of view to shoot a projectile at you.

Even ignoring that blatant issue, Noita requires me to gamble wayyyy too much time on the vague hope that I'll get a good run and finally re-experience the game's incredible highs. You'll never see most of the awesome spells and cracked-out wands visible in the trailers because you'll be too busy getting stunned by random bullets, plummeting 1,000 feet, and landing on some explosive barrels that coincidentally happen to be on fire.

(25 hours played so far)

- I've been playing 25+ hrs, and I still have have no idea whats happening 95% of the time
- Physics based Roguelike make monkey brain go Hur Hur Hur
- Very wierd mysterious world that doesn't explain much, I'm avoiding Wikis because I'm stubborn
- Made by Finnish Developers, the enemies in the game have hard to pronounce Finnish names
- Avoid this game if you dislike the Finnish language. I haven't seen Lauri Markkanen so he may not be in this game
- Fire and explosions are dangerous you will learn that the hard way
- More wands in this game than Harry Potter, if that kind of thing turns you on
- A wand that shoots ricoshetting Buzzsaw blade sounds awesome...but ended very badly for me
- You'll figure the lower level enemies out, but they will still kill you more often than they should
- You can drink various liquids, which can have both positive and negative effects. I enjoy drinking the blood of my enemies
- I know I've mentioned Fire already but...take extra care around flammable and explosive things
- The enemy who looks like the devil (I call him The Arsonist) is a massive douchebag
- Don't pat the skulldoggies

the crafting wands mechanic is very cool, there is over 400+ spells and 171 enemies which are each solid designs!
oh and if you die a lot.. then your not any different from every single player, since this game is really hard at the beginning, you will die a lot and mostly kill yourself .
even now im not the greatest player, like i only have 5 hours on this game but 4 on my pirated version (yes i originally pirated this to try it out and i bought it since it met my expectations!)
the game is on sale frequently so you can get it cheaper, i got it for only 10 dollars, while normally its 20.
the mods are AWESOME!!!!11!!! there is a mod that adds over 280 creatures ! 
and they're all so cool, like they're actually made by the devs!
but the game is absolute anarchy whit all those new creatures and makes so much harder.
so my opinion...
buy it.
its completely worth the money .
buy it.
NOW.
(or whenever its cheaper)
top game huge W.
oh and whenever you get the huge chainsaw spell do not throw it randomly cuz it likes to come back at you and end your run cuz it does like 200 damage. 
i died because of it 4 times. 
ok buy it.

On a more serious note. The game-play loop is simple, but very fun. You explore randomly generated caves/caverns that each have a theme. You can levitate around (on a timer) and have pretty free movement. Your goal is to survive to the bottom of the cavern while gaining as many resources as possible (gold, wands, spells). Upon reaching the rest point, you can get new spells/wands (cost gold), mix and match the spells your wands cast (to make crazy/dangerous combos), and gain a perk for your character. Then off to the next cavern.

There is very little in the way of a tutorial or instructions, and that is a good thing. The point of the game is to explore through trial and error. What happens if I eat this? What does this spell combination do? What is that red dirt over there? What does this potion do? 

Many times, your curiosity will end in death, but the knowledge will have made you stronger. Other times your trial/curiosity will pay off in a very satisfying way.

I have only made it to level 5 (I think) and I have died countless times...many were accidental suicides when testing a new wand. Each death has been pretty unique. While I have been killed in many unfair ways (forcibly tp'd into a nest of monsters, attacked by a god, acid falling on head...etc.) I have never felt frustrated or upset by the deaths.

His fatal flaw of hubris led him to casting a nuke, which he somehow arced at an angle that didn't kill him. This was his first warning. Following this, he cast two random spells that did literally nothing. He then proceeded to say, ""one more time - just for good measure.""

It was at this moment, he just so happened to roll the spell that instantly turns everything in its radius into gold. Including you.

But _many_ runs tend to end due to circumstances outside of the player's control, such as enemies being able to one-shot you from outside of the screen with projectiles or even large explosions that move faster than you can be expected to see.

Runs can be fun, especially when you are ridiculously lucky. The wand-building mechanic is deep and can lead to interesting gameplay, but it's hard for me to get into runs when I have to accept the high possibility that my performance will likely not affect my chance of reaching the end of the game.

Due to a lot of the difficulty being out of the players control, as well as runs varying greatly in length, I can't recommend this game to non-masochists.",1618362212,1696814199,False,1,1,0.434353381395339966,0,True,False,False

ABOUT THIS GAME
Noita is a magical action roguelite set in a world where every pixel is physically simulated. Fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've created yourself. Explore a variety of environments ranging from coal mines to freezing wastelands while delving deeper in search for unknown mysteries.


Pixel-based physics: Every pixel in the world is simulated. Burn, explode or melt anything. Swim in the blood of your foes! Enter a simulated world that is more interactive than anything you've seen before.

Your own magic: Combine spells to create your own magic as you delve deeper into the caverns. Use magic to crush your enemies and manipulate the world around you.

Procedurally generated world: Explore a unique world every time you play. Discover new environments as you adventure deeper.



Action roguelite: Death is permanent and always a looming threat. When you die, don’t despair, use what you’ve learned to get further on your next adventure.

Noita is being developed by Nolla Games, a company set up by 3 indie developers, all of whom have worked on their own projects in the past.

The three gents in question are:

Petri Purho
Petri is best known as the creator of Crayon Physics Deluxe. In his youth he also made a lot tiny freeware games. He has also made a bunch of board games, but he hasn't told about it to anyone. So please keep it a secret.

Olli Harjola
Olli is known for the award-winning, mind-bending sci-fi puzzler The Swapper. Besides indie games, he also dabbles in music, live visuals and making programming languages.

Arvi Teikari
Arvi is also known as Hempuli. Over the years he has released a lot of tiny experimental games, so many in fact that he is unaware of all of them. One of the games he remembers making is Baba Is You.

50 run later and 3 AM in morning: 
I can tell This is a experience.
Such a grand experience felt like a new gen release such as GTA ...But in its own technology, in its own way, coming from another multiverse. 
Maybe I exagerate? Maybe not?! Decide for yourself...
The exploration sense when discovering that everything want to kill you and burn you and poison you and bleed deadly acid on you !
That feeling when explosion like no others were done before like in Mercenaries2 ? or Red faction Armagedon? Man these were huge explosions!
But these are too, but ahem, made differently! PIXEL version.
Your looking for a game that simulate your arcady pixelisated nevralgic  adrenalin rush nerve in your nostalgic brain?
Search no more, this is it. 
The destruction and much going on with PIXEL getting burned and destroyed, water getting boiled and vapirized, causing more fire on upstair ledges!
The melting is incredible. watch out for acid bleeding enemies. Every liquid react differently, mix with other or with fire.
Blood, Whiskey, goo, slime name it. 
Have you ever see a FULL Potion lab explode?? 10 combined unknown effect form into a pool and then a unsuspisious enemy fall into it from a burning platform??!
That is pretty crazy what can happen here.
From the point of view PIXEL, in your perception when playing it. 
That game will take you elsewhere. talking about PIXEL, well every one of it can kill you! And I tell you, even if your a veteran player, IT WILL KILL YOU A LOT AND MERCILESS.
Good new is every little tiny one of these PIXELS can also be ""manipulated""!
Sure many other pixel art game did that. Terraria as exemple, but in those, none had theses crumbling, vaporise effect at same time maybe late Terraria?
But the liquid, particle , vaporize, freezing, effect? 
That is really cool man.
Knowing every of those PIXELS can kill you and you lose that new sharp staff of your!
THE TRICK IS: BE PATIENT. Seriously. It will save you a lot.
That feeling of masochist will possess you and crazy thing is you even ask for more again and again. 
It will haunt you, like some of these games that grew up with that will somehow, fusioned with your memory. 
And  like a INSTA-CULT-CLASSIC, It will make a place in your nostalgia secret compartment brain stem, like a reaching alien tick that is Noita!
It will suck you in, and BOOM next corner you will explode!
Man I would like to permenently unlock some village or something to, somehow, unlock things like ""returning wand"" of some sort, 
Cause it is really something when your far into it and you loose a 20 slots shiny looking staff...
But anyway, as it is like now, the version of the game, it is solid, in its own way... it is totally ready and a thumbs up...
But, seriously, did anyone actually managed to finished it in some way??
Prepare to start again and again because you will meet unfortunate ending even just after getting that crazy UBER wand that look so overpowerful,  and POOF your dead !!
Goodbye GODLIKE power!
The key in this game I found is: BE PATIENT!
Next step ahead can be totally fatal. 
I repeat: Every PIXELS want to kill you by burning you, exploding you, drown you, poison you, splatter you, spike you, freeze you, gooiid slimy you! and even acidify you.
In this game, You will get down and dirty.Either You like it or not.
Many fluids of different sort will ooze on your PIXELISED unfortunate Mage hero.
Oh poor him, he will suffer terrible fate in repetitive loop if you buy this game, but I assure you, you will ask for more.
So sit down, pop a soda or a beer, load the game and relax, 
Be patient, that is the key to survive in this game!!
Let the destruction burn ahead and create new path before going forward and die in the heat of PIXELS destruction. 
Careful what you MIX: it can be fatal if its too crazy powerful!!
Insta Killing you!
with recipe you experiment on like a idiotic alchemist would surely do: wrong ingredients in the wrong hands!
Man I had this Epic Uber Wand and mixe it up with explosion spell: I was sure it would unlock explosive bullets and become even more crazy powerful in that lucky run:  but instead, it unlocked lethal explosions in my face!
So be sure to wear your black leather strap suit: zip it up, 'cause your about to enter a real sado- mostly-masochist experience, when playing with Noita!",1696541007,1696544293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Poorly Explained & Kinda Confusing Jumping Right In
- Way Too Dark
- Where Is The Meta Progression???

This game has a story, but that story is only revealed over many learned lessons, in a vibrant and mysterious world
that you are completely free to explore (and die in). [b]Rarely does a game reward pushing the envelope as much as this game does[/b], and is always prepared to deliver in spades new possibilities (instant death) to those who embrace curiosity.

Noita perpetually finds ways to subvert and exceed what it has conditioned you to expect. Full of Challenging trials, in a world always bigger than it seems, punctuated by the inherent slapstick comedy of the emergent dangers you will find within it. the roguelike tenseness only escalates as you learn more about the game.

This game is a good buy for those who like a potentially challenging experience, or who like the idea of being a mysterious magical entity, anyone who likes exploding pixels, and anyone who might like a good story about greed and the folly of power. 

This game does offer you the classic roguelike experience, but doesn't insist upon a solid endpoint or goal in the same way a roguelike usually would. [b]people looking for that experience might not find it here[/b], in the same way you might in Slay the spire or Hades. This game offers something slightly different, a choice, that will become more and more apparent as you spend time in the game.

It's actually a fun story and my Noita journey . I write this and don't get any likes , but others can write bader reviews , but get 1 k plus likes and steam awards . Just so unfair >:( ! Anyway read on pls <:) ! 




0/10 until i win this fucking shit game then i maybe change my review not even League of Legends can't make me rage as much as this game >:( don't buy on sale and never buy and even when for free don't and don't even buy if 1,00 euro price it's a scam just don't money can't buy sanity which this game sucks out like a black hole . Idk why this game is overwhelmingly positive it sucks and it's not worth the money BECAUSE YOU can't buy sanity with money only reason and because i wanna rip out my brain from this game that too . Waste of time because you'll never win . I didn't want to be one of the usual crybaby bitches but this shit game is something different why so hard ? why ? Even better i now found out that for some reason it doesn't count my achievements anymore too >:( even better ! Next they are gonna delete my progress mid game 100 % . 

And i felt like it was my duty to write this review because i can't let others suffer like me and i can't keep it inside me anymore .


Ok but the positive not and no i'm not gonna change my review to positive until i win atleast one time as i said ealier and if my achievements keep being broken and no count then i don't change . But Noita i said enough cons now i will tell some pros to noita :

1. It's very addicting and i can't stop playing it daily i'm literally glued and addicted to this game 
2. It's very fun sometimes when you are lucky
3. when this game is good it's really good 
4. It's time consuming 
5. It offers many diferent playstyles
6. It's best terraria rip off i've ever played 
that's it for now if i'll think more i'll write later . 

P.S. even though i now will be playing every day to try to win i won't propably so this review is 100% gonna stay like this .

Update :

That's it i've played this game so much i'm literally so tired of it i'm taking a few day or week break bye until then .


Edit : date 21.09.23 september . ok as promised i said i'll update if anything changes for the better first for some unknown reason before achievements didn't count at one point in the beggining they did count and i finally for some reason got the achievement i deserved unlike last time >:( . And second i am back at playing noita determined as ever to win and i must say in the past few days i was pleasantly surprised , because i nearly won some times and did better than ever still i'm not changing this to positive until i can prove to myself it's actually possible to win in this game , because wtf why it's so hard ? . so 2/10 now , because achievements are not broken anymore for some reason .



UPDATE : 28.09.23 SEPTEMBER 

nah fuck fuck and FUCK FUCK THIS GAME CAN'T WIN AND EVERYONE SO LUCKY .



Update : 03.10.23 September 



ok i beat Noita finally 1 or 2 weeks ago and as promised i'm not mad anymore so i'm finally changing my Noita review to positive , but this game is still hard as hell . And i'll stop being salty and toxic towards this game , because i now realize if you're really good at this game it's massive even when you complete the game and it's fun when mastered . That's right this review used to be negative , not because i didn't like the game , it was just because i was too salty and toxic towards this game for how hard this game is and because no matter what i couldn't win at it no matter how hard i tried .",1686163123,1696426292,True,0,1,0.436863541603088379,0,True,False,False

---upd.
Honestly I love the game but can't recommend it to your average user since it has way to much ""personality"" from them to deal with. This game will f*uck you up in the ways you never even imagined possible when you think you can deal with literally anything.
It changed the way I view my my character's life's value in the same way dark souls did once before - I thought I didn't care and Noita taught me I was wrong.

tldr - the game's both great and bad, since it has nearly infinite amount of spell combinations for you to tinker with and at the same time doesnt really care about your experience being smooth from the get go. If you learn, you learn. If you adapt, you adapt. Well, if not, then you go play minecraft or some sh*t

Noita...is [i]evil[/i]. It sounds hyperbolic, it sounds like an exaggeration, but there truly isn't a better word for it. This game is [i]filled[/i] with malice. It does not respect your time, and it does not respect you. It inverts typical game design in such a way that it deliberately and purposely punishes you for just being a normal person.

You are punished for anything and everything, constantly. And when I say punished I don't mean the ""oh no I lost some HP or this set me back a little"". No. When I say punish, I mean that your run is over. It's done. 1 Hour in? Or 2? Perhaps 6? It doesn't care. It's gone. Punishment in Noita is [i][u]death[/u][/i].

Early on, the biggest threat you will face isn't the enemies, or the bosses, or the bad RNG, or even the traps. It's you. And I'm not strictly talking about skill issues here.

No. I'm talking about your desire to learn. Your desire to explore. Your desire to optimize. Your defenses. Your offenses. Your strategies, and your tactics. The developers have designed this game in such a way that if you do not look anything up and you play entirely blind, you die. And then you die again. And again. By doing this they can expand what is essentially a 20~ hour game into several hundred, possibly over a thousand.

You'll die from looting chests. You'll die from using new wands you find. You'll die for fighting new enemies. You'll die for trying new spells. You'll die from mixing spells in new ways. You'll die from unexplained wand mechanics. You'll die from exploring new areas. You'll die from your defensive perks. You'll die from your offensive perks. You'll die from stepping on a [b][u]SINGLE PIXEL[/u][/b] (not an exaggeration).

The joy of discovery is a concept I love in games. I love tinkering and trying to figure out how things work, and the payoff that one receives when it finally clicks. I really don't like having to look stuff up or follow guides because it takes away that ever so sweet ""joy of discovery"". However, Noita [u]despises[/u] the joy of discovery. No, it wants you to feel the joy of discovering its fist shoved up your ass.

When you die in Noita, it is [i]always[/i] your fault, but it [b][u]NEVER[/u][/b] feels fair. After your death you'll (hopefully but not guaranteed) know how not to die the next time, but it just wasted 1-3 hours of your life to teach you that [i]singular[/i] mechanic to avoid.

---

Dying isn't a big deal though, right? I mean, that's what you do in roguelikes. You die and try again. But there's a lot of very monotonous gameplay in the first hour of Noita. You're exploring with very slow movement speed praying to god that you find some useful resources without losing too much of your own, and this takes [i]time[/i].

With how many hours a single save can take up, It just doesn't seem fair to demand [i]complete[/i] knowledge and [b]perfect[/b] play the entire game. But it [i]does[/i].

This game is [b]evil[/b], and it [b][i]hates[/i][/b] you.

And what is your reward, after you put in the time, make the mistakes, and gain the experience and skill necessary to complete the game? Less of a game.

You then do to enemies what they did to you. Cathartic in some ways, yes, but then a new problem emerges. All challenge is removed. All difficulty is removed. You explore and explore and you steamroll everything without even being able to see what you are destroying. Then you look up what you're supposed to do next and go through the motions like a robot.

Quite frankly, It's boring. Some people like that sort of thing, but not me. Noita made me suffer for 60+ hours so that I could become a god and I don't find the god gameplay very interesting. Bosses either oneshot me, or I oneshot them. I've killed like 7 bosses and I don't even know what they do because the only way to make it to them alive was to become an unkillable god. How is that interesting...?

If any of this sounded good to you, then well, power to you friend. But it isn't for me. This was a waste of my time, and a waste of my money.",1656633140,1696137172,False,15,1,0.569393396377563477,0,True,False,False

The pixel simulation and variety of ways to die contribute to the chaotic nature of the game, and the wand customization has a good base. However, the poorly implemented parts ruin the gameplay.

The idea behind the customizable wands is well thought out, but most of the wands and spells you can find in the game are garbage. Until you find enough chainsaw spells to make a machine gun wand or get an extremely lucky god combo spells, your best wand will be mediocre at best. The same goes for the perks in the holy mountains, half of which are outright detrimental to the player. 

This wouldn't be a big deal if it weren't for the difficulty of the game. More often than not, deaths in Noita are unfair e.g off screen enemies one-shotting you, explosives being completely obscured by dead bodies, enemies angering the gods by destroying the holy mountain, etc. The only way you are going to have a good run is if you get an insane spell/perk combo. The common cope by Noita players is to ""just be cautious"" while playing, but that isn't fun, and it goes against the fast-paced and chaotic intent behind the game.

Noita's secret weapon isnt it's incredible fluid or element systems. Nor is it the elaborate wand crafting system.  Or its perk system.  It's secret weapon is the ability to make you feel like you are simultaneously super lucky/powerful with it's drop rate and challenged to have to fight for every victory.  Noita is easily one of the best rogue likes around.

Disadvantages: The cost of learning time is too high, and every attempt at new magic is highly likely to lead to death. Death in the game of rogue-like means a complete end, and everything previously done needs to be redone. Not very suitable for players with limited time and high daily life pressure.

And at the same time, the thing that makes this game very unique, which is the chaos and randomness, also is one of the bigger downsides. The amount of unfair deaths is uncountable. Enemies can one-hit you with powerful wands they picked up, you can be transformed into a sheep and made into kebab a second later, get teleported into a deathpit of very angry foes, get blown up by a random chain reaction of explosions and so on.

Enemies deal a great amount of damage, while heals are sparse. The amount of randomness means most runs end due to being unlucky. Most spells are to dangerous to equip onto your wands, leaving you using mostly the same safe, low damage dealing spells. 

Beating the main game/boss can be done in a reasonable time and feels enjoyable. If you try beating any other boss or try to uncover secrets the game is down right way to punishing. I died multiple times after hours of gameplay in the same run to something stupid, just to have to do the same thing again. These secrets are super cryptic, unfairly hard, time consuming and unrewarding. Some items and locations don't even have a purpose for any secret/story making it ever more confusing.

It's also very hard and there are so many secrets all through the game.

-The variety of spells is insane - there are bouncing balls, fireballs, magic missiles, thunder clouds, electric fields, black holes and on top of all the spells there are modifiers which can change different aspects of the spells. As well as the spells, every wand is unique; they have different mana capacities, recharge rates, spell slots, cast delays, accuracy, and you can edit your spell sets between levels.
The combinations you can get can be massively over powered, simply ridiculous and some kill you instantly, but all are fun and interesting.

-Every pixel in the game is simulated; sand and other fine materials will fall, liquids will flow, wood will catch fire, metal and liquid will become electrified and that's just some of the basic interactions. 
Acid will eat through any material and turn it into gas, oil and whiskey will ignite instantly, most liquids will evaporate if there is fire on them, oil will float on water and blood will sink etc.

-90% of what happens at any moment will happen without you even seeing it because enemies of different factions are constantly fighting each other, causing fires and explosions, bleeding different liquids like blood, slime, acid, toxic sludge - sometimes you walk into a level to find half the terrain destroyed before you even get there.

From there I thought Noita looked like Terraria.  It is not like Terraria.

This game has a tremendous amount of depth (both literally and figuratively) and replay value.

Noita is truly a unique phenomenon, like nothing else! While Nolla as a studio was a yet-unpublished entity at the time of Noita's release, the constituent developers are a veritable pantheon of current-gen indie scions, all of whom have some great work under their belts: Baba Is You, Environmental Station Α, Crayon Physics Deluxe, Legend Of Grimrock; not to mention a whole slew of interesting game-jam-level Itch-dot-i-o fare.

Truly, this is a Magnum Opus and should be considered a Great Cultural Work of both Finland and indie game development at large. And while a positive:negative ratio currently hovering around 7:1 means I can't really claim it's ""underrated"", it does feel like it's achieved far less wide-spread adoration than it should have.

I assume those 1/8 who voted negative either found it ""too hard"", or that their machine couldn't quite meet the admittedly strenuous performance requirements. Both of which are understandable. Like many RL ""get to the bottom of the world"" games, the breakthroughs required to find a winning strategy can seem frustratingly opaque. Without some gauge — internal or in-game — charting real progress, it's not hard to imagine that its utterly unforgiving ethos could leave hopeless those players to whom Noita has not made obvious its innumerable contrasting joys.

On the latter charge of poor performance, the requirements for good FPS must seem completely absurd given the visuals and seemingly-straightforward gameplay, right up until that moment where the full, awe-inspiring scope of the simulation dawns on you. After that, it seems more like a miracle that the game runs at all. And while it may seem a small comfort to those whose gaming setup lacks the power to deliver a playable experience, I feel compelled to mention it: despite seemingly-reasonable assumptions otherwise, the demands of this software are justified. The situation is diametrically opposed to that normally encountered with sluggish indies, where an inexperience or uninspired developer simply fails to use basic optimizations and best practices. This game needs a beefy rig because it's doing something monumental.

Preemptive apologies aside, thankfully, the actual merits of the game itself are far more numerous:

I do feel that uncovering some of this stuff on one's own is an integral part of the joy here, so I'll be brief: The moment-to-moment action is incredibly challenging, yet feels natural to master. The wand-building is deeply engaging in the very same way: the thrill of discovering new spells and interesting ways to combine them through experimentation and exploration provided a compelling meta-game that quickly overshadowed the goal of completing individual ""runs"". Lastly, the whole game is jam-packed with secrets and meta-secrets, some for powerups, some for lore, many for both. In fact, the last time I checked, there is still another ARG-style puzzle hidden in the game which has a community dedicated to solving it — joined by fans, to be sure, but also counting cryptographers, engineers and lore-heads among their ranks. This sort of thing doesn't really appeal to me personally, but I truly respect the level of dedication implied by both implementating and maintenaning such an impenetrable mystery just for fun. It really drives home the passion and creative whimsy of the developers.

on matters of taste: I find the pixelated late-DOS-era-pc-game-ish visuals to be both pleasing and functional. In a weird way, it honestly evokes vibes reminiscent of Lemmings or Cannon Fodder, of all things. And yet, in the three decades that have passed since that era, computing power has surged beyond anyone's wildest imagination. Thankfully, Nolla is not content with the simple retro baseline, and leverages the margin in those orders of magnitude to furnish and render a massively complex, large scale simulation, decorated by no shortage of awesome effects and interactions.

The setting concerns the journey of a ""Noita"" (finnish for witch/sorcerer, apparently) to uncover the secrets of alchemy foretold in legend, and manifests as a loose blend of sci-fi and fantasy, colored through a filter of Suomenusko creation myths and the writings of late medeival Hermetic Alchemists. Very fucking cool, IMO.

So too does the soundtrack rise to the occasion: Droning psych-rock which fits perfectly as ambiance for a descent into a bottomless cavern beneath a mystical mountain; nor does it ever lack heaviness or bombast when moments of intensity call for it, all the while absolutely slapping my ass raw. Seriously 10/10 music.

The modding ""scene"" is also worth mentioning: there are a wide variety of well-constructed mods, which alter, enhance or completely rebuild the whole game. It also incredibly easy to get into creating mods, if you're inclined toward that sort of thing.

While I clearly enjoy the game in its own right, I can't help but recognize the brilliance of the overall theme; how the broad tropes of Alchemy and Arcana — i.e. seeking forbidden knowledge in pursuit of limitless power — are reflected so purely in the gameplay itself.

It's at first simple and wholly diegetic. I've already mentioned the RL aspect, so hopefully this doesn't count as a spoiler, but it turns out that simply finishing a run doesn't really translate to ""beating the game""... Countless hopeful Noita will perish before their journey is complete, to be sure, but those who reach the goal they were given will revel in their victory for but a moment before reaping its fruits... Of course, the prize awaiting them at the bottom is precisely the same as that awarded to those who fail mere steps into the mountain: the swift and inevitable punishment due to all who suffer the hubris endemic to mankind. Here is your high score, fool! Better luck next run!

No, if one wishes to truly ascend, it is not enough to simply follow the legends. The rules of reality do not permit limitless power, and so to achieve it one must break those rules and defy that reality, forging a NEW path and uncovering NEW mastery. Only then can the ""Ludo-Narrative Synchronicity"" really shine: when the sentence for those guilty of hubris is delivered not as a simply matter of course at the end of a run, but by the seeker's own hand. Digging too deeply and being dashed on the lower stories of Hell itself. Attempting to rewrite the heavens only to be swallowed by a burning star. Creating a wand so unimaginably powerful that the physics calculations required to simulate it explode astronomically, leaving you imprisoned for eternity in the exact moment of its first firing.

You'll have to take my word for it: this goes far, far beyond the level of ""you have to do a couple extra tasks to get the 'real' ending"" type stuff. No, these are moments of TRUE Alchemy, experienced by an actual Alchemist, and not merely the actions of one playing a game about alchemy.

In conclusion: is Noita a perfect game? Yes. Of course, asking whether some work of art or artifice is perfect is really a meaningless question in the grand scheme of things. And so, I choose to say that it is, because I really like it a lot, and think you should play it.",1694880956,1694881869,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Combat is simple, but highly challenging for the impatient or uninformed. Finding new and unexpected ways to die is part of the learning experience, and due to the unfathomably large problem space this game sits in, it never truly ends.

It’s a game that will test your patience, your creativity, and your sanity. It’s a game that will reward you with spectacular moments of magic and mayhem, and punish you with sudden and brutal deaths. It’s a game that will make you wonder why you keep playing it, and then make you realize that you can’t stop.

Noita is a roguelike where every pixel is simulated, meaning that everything in the game world can be affected by your actions and the environment. You play as a wizard who descends into a procedurally generated dungeon, armed with a variety of wands and spells that you can customize and combine in countless ways. You can set fire to wooden structures, freeze enemies with ice bolts, create black holes that suck in everything around them, or summon rain clouds to wash away toxic sludge. The possibilities are endless, and so are the ways you can die.

Noita is not a game for the faint of heart. It’s a game that will challenge you with its difficulty, its randomness, and its lack of explanation. You will die a lot, and often in ways that seem unfair or unavoidable. You will encounter enemies that can kill you in one hit, traps that can trigger without warning, and spells that can backfire spectacularly. You will also discover secrets that can change the course of your run, items that can grant you powerful abilities, and synergies that can make you feel like a god. You will never know what to expect, and that’s part of the fun. 

Noita is a game that will make you feel a range of emotions, from frustration to exhilaration, from despair to joy. It’s a game that will make you appreciate its beauty, its complexity, and its creativity. It’s a game that will make you want to share your stories, your discoveries, and your failures with others. It’s a game that will make you love it and hate it at the same time.

Noita is a game that I absolutely recommend to anyone who enjoys roguelikes, physics-based games, or just experimenting with crazy magic. It’s a game that has been in development for seven years by a small team of indie developers, and it shows in the amount of detail and polish that has gone into it. It’s a game that has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and players alike, and it deserves all the praise it gets.

Noita is a game that I can’t get enough of, even though it makes me want to smash my keyboard sometimes. It’s a game that I can’t wait to play again, even though I know it will probably kill me in the most ridiculous way possible. It’s a game that I can’t help but love, even though it hates me so much.

Learning the systems and how they interact with each other is CRAZY satisfying and rewarding.

This game is supposed to be difficult, and I love that. As you play more, you realize that taking damage is basically the one thing you should absolutely avoid at all costs. The more damage you take, the less ground you can cover before needing to get to a safe zone, the less chance you have of finding better equipment (necessary) or gaining enough money to buy said better equipment. It really makes you value thinking methodically and considering risk vs gain. 

However, there are 2 things that fundamentally ruin the aforementioned concept:

1. Single pixels of lava/fire/poison doing damage to you. It's dumb. I could barely tell there was an orange dot of lava there because it's literally a single pixel surround by tons of other pixels with different colors and lighting effects. That's dumb. Make it like 3 pixels minimum to cause damage and the game stays the same without being... dumb.

2. Getting shot by enemies off screen. Difficulty, I get it. But again, that's dumb. People will say ""just adapt"" or ""don't take risks"". If I'm getting attacked by things that are IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE AWARE OF, that's a bad mechanic. There's no other way about it. If you genuinely think that's fine, you're literally drowning in copium. 

Regardless, buy the game. It's insanely sick and the devs really deserve to be recognized for it. Probably the coolest game I've played in a long time.

The game plays similar to a rougelike, however the materials gained from run to run is nonexistent unless certain conditions are met. The main thing you gain from run to run is knowledge and experience, as pretentious as that may sound.

This game has a particular ability to scratch my autism, because I am fascinated by the ancient science of alchemy, and this game simulates that both in its physical world and in its wand construction. Substances interact with the environment in unique ways, and this fact can be a strength you can harness just as easily as it can kill you, and the same goes for wand-making.

Many deaths will be the result of a calculated risk- will this particular set of spells backfire? Many deaths will also by the result of hubris, of striking forward when it would be better to draw back.

I really cannot praise the depth of this game enough, there are a near-infinite number of ways to make a wand or to achieve your goals.

One drawback that I cannot directly fault the game for is that it feels very necessary to have a wiki open when playing, to reference what certain things do or if this or that perk is worthwhile. This detracts from the experience, but it is mainly due to the fact that access to an all-encompassing wiki is just a click and a keystroke away.

All-in-all I would really consider this one of the best games I have ever played, aggravating as it may be at times. It is just as much a game as it is a science experiment, in seeing how things work or how they don't.",1693683114,1693683114,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Minutes of routine exploration can quickly crescendo into fighting for your life against your enemies and the environment. One minute you’re struggling to take down one enemy with your nerf gun-like wand and the next you find a wand that melts everything in your path. You enter one level and cleanly explore every nook and cranny leaving safely on your own terms.  The next level you can’t seem to not catch on fire, at every turn you’re stepping in toxic slime, and water is nowhere in sight so you must use the blood of your enemies to extinguish the flames and wash away the toxins. You have to rush to the end of the level because you can’t afford another misstep, but as a consequence leave most of the level unexplored.

This is the dichotomy of Noita. When you combine that perfect wand build, a set of great perks, and excellent game knowledge you can cruise through the chaos and feel like a true battle mage. The majority of the time and especially early on when learning the game, you’ll feel like a conjuror of cheap tricks and rinky-dink spells. But that’s ok, Noita excels in the chaos and the more uncontrolled the better.

Noita has a lot of great things going for it: gorgeous pixel-style graphics, tight controls, and great enemy design. Plus, it just [i]looks cool[/i]. Just look at the featured screenshots! It takes the rougelike fundamental of permadeath and doesn't toy with it. In fact, it gets pretty much everything right about what a rougelike should be.

My one [b]major, glaring issue[/b] with Noita is that, after seven hours of playing the game, I was still barely making it past the first level. It took about an hour or two to become familiar with basic mechanics like saturation, being on fire, acid, etc. I learned enemy attack patterns and generally understood what wands I wanted to keep and what spells worked for my playstyle. But beyond that, there was extremely little I could learn to improve my chances of long-term survival.

I'm not asking for rogue[b]lite[/b] features such as permanent progression. I'm asking for the game to reward me for learning from my mistakes. Yes, I know this is a ""Difficult"" game and that I should be expected to die a lot in a roguelike; I'm not new to the genre. But my deaths seemed downright unfair. Plan and react as best I could, death would find its way to me in the most ridiculous ways, often in a way I couldn't possibly have seen coming.

The smaller issue I have with Noita is that the variety of pickups is [i]too[/i] great. Too many combinations of wands and stats/spells are useless or downright lethal to you as the player. If wands cost less to buy or were more plentiful as pickups then this wouldn't be as big of an issue. But as uncommon as they are, I found myself passing up most of them.

In the end, I had to put Noita down. A more persistent, enthralled player will recommend this game (and they do! look at that review score). But if any of what I wrote above matters to you, I recommend you look for a different roguelike to get your fix.",1674196285,1693375646,False,3,0,0.48425707221031189,0,True,False,False

This game does have emergence but because it's based on how real world solids, gas and liquids would interact, it's not emergent in the sense that the base rules of the game interacting with each other creates an entirely new mechanic that even the devs wouldn't anticipate.

It's emergent because i.e : the dynamite guy just decided to throw a dynamite and it just happened that there was an oil lamp there in an entirely wooden area so the dynamite guy blew up half the level, putting everything on fire, while you were walking somewhere else.

But that's a good thing, because as much as there are seemingly random things happening at times, the interactions make sense and as such you can be clever in how to approach stage hazards. (or miserably die and do it again)",1692693508,1692693508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In its current state, I cannot recommend anyone who values their time to play vanilla Noita. The emergent difficulty of this game is placed far too much into RNGesus' hands. Mastering the mechanics of this game really only takes a couple dozen hours, and I found this game far quicker to learn than most other rogue-likes. But in this game, mastering the mechanics will realistically only help in understanding how to beat the game. It is only once in a blue moon that the player is offered a decent enough arsenal to delve far enough to beat the game. Most of your deaths will occur during the first four floors, as you will often find yourself lacking the firepower necessary to blast through the hordes of hiisi. The game only really opens up on the fifth floor, offering bounds of extra life, and suitable weapons. However, getting to this point often requires the player to be meticulous, exploring every nook and cranny of each prior floor in order to optimize wand builds. This all has to be done while paying extreme attention to detail, as deadly situations are often hidden in plain sight and require immediate action to avoid. This type of playstyle just isn't rewarding to me, and after though hundreds of deaths with so few victories my enthusiasm for how unique and intricate this game is has whittled away. I strongly discourage anyone who wants to play the vanilla game to continue after their first victory.

Despite the game's inherent and obvious flaws, the devs are incredibly based and decided to include native mod support. There are dozens of mods that re-balance the game into a far more suitable experience for casual play. Loads of these mods are also of extremely high quality, and fit so naturally into the environment it becomes difficult to revert back to vanilla. I highly recommend the modded experience to everyone who is interested in this game; it fixes nearly every issue this game has while introducing so many unique experiences that we would have never gotten without. The modded experience is a 10/10.

P.S. The secrets in this game aren't too hard to get once you have gotten a decent arsenal. Finding them on your own will take probably 30 extra hours from my experience, but if your are struggling to find them I would recommend you join the official discord server and ask people for hints. https://discord.gg/noita",1692473982,1692473982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, for starters, this game is unforgiving in a way that you'll only understand by playing it.
It's Roguelike, so by it's nature, it will kill you... A LOT! 
It has the nostalgia of an old school game (If you know, you know), but with superb physics built in, and everything  (YES EVERYTHING), even down to the last little pixel is destructible in one way or the other. 
The game doesn't hold your hand... You start, and you figure it out as you play. 
The controls are simple, and the objectives are easy to figure out... If you're one of those die hard gamers that thinks they're better than everyone else... please do be my guest.. I like to see people be humbled by entertainment...
The ""unlockables"" in this game are MANY, and the combinations of wands and spells are insane. This game will challenge you, run, after run, after run, and it doesn't get stale. 
IF you're easily frustrated, perhaps it's not the game for you... Or perhaps it is, and it's an opportunity to quell that rage and frustration you harbour, because it will break you... at some point... unless you're weakling and run from a good fight. 
The only thing I can leave you with, is this... 
Buy it, try it, OWN it... It really is a must have for any serious game collector, and is definitely one of my top favourite games to play casually in between more demanding games, it's one where if you have only 5 minutes to spare, this game can do that... or, you know... consume your entire afternoon with run after run.

I love finding new ways to manipulate and destroy the environment, experimenting with new spells and wands, and having those ""Aha!"" moments that change how I think about, and make me better at, Noita.

IMO, there are two main downsides to Noita:
1. There are some areas of the game and some wand configurations that are very CPU intensive, and when you come across those areas and/or use those wands, your frame rate will drop significantly.  I certainly noticed this on my Steam Deck, but this also happens to Twitch streamers with more powerful setups.
2. You'll occasionally die due to a stray pixel that blocks your path, a pixel which you couldn't see at first because its color nearly matches the background.

All in all, the downsides only slightly detract from a utterly fantastic game.

I was hooked the very first time I set fire to something.  Which then caused a chain reaction of explosions, dunking into burning oil, falling, and electricity that killed me in the space of two hilarious seconds.  This is a must have game for a hundred reasons.  Minor one of which is:  after only 60 hours of playing...I have skilled up immensely and now chain kill bad guys with fire.  With freezing gas.  Knocking off huge chunks of ice to drop on them.  And still being killed after setting fire to things.

Still reading/undecided?  Don't let the graphics stop you/  If you play fantasy games and have decent arcade reflexes, this is a must have title.  In fact the graphics and game engine must be experienced to be believed how good the visuals actually are.  The videos don't do justice, this has be experienced live.

This game is the dungeon delving BOMB because of the complex weapon building.  Every single weapon is a batch of removable components for whatever weapon I want to build.  If I can survive to the end of the level to actually be able to assemble a better weapon with them.  Or hey I didn't realize how powerful and strange the weapon I just picked up is.  Sure ok let's just try out one shot, just for fun.  Cool, look at these massive sawblades it fired, as tall as me and twice as wide.  See how they sliced through that enemy, and now slow to a stop, have reversed course, are accelerating.  Back at me...OH SH!!  

New game and lesson learned.  The lesson being:  THIS TIME I want to figure out how to USE the big sawblade, there MUST be an spell/item/perk combo in this game somewhere.  Let me check out the wiki site, or the excellent guides folks like cyberspacegamers have written.

Maybe it is the excellent procedural levels that are always different and waiting for me to explore.  Secrets, surprises, and death everywhere.  Or maybe it is glorious difficulty balance where situational awareness, quick reflexes, and how to best manage the weapons I have, are all equally important.  Maybe it's the immense variety of bad guys that manage to kill me even though I think I know how to fight them.

Certainly, though, every other roguelike or action/arcade game has helped to skill up to play this one.  Warm it up, warrior, stop reading and buy this asap!",1691922220,1691922220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To me, when a game does not warn properly, is unrealistic, and applies the maximum penalty afterwards, is a sign to instantly uninstall it.
This game, however, somehow makes me enjoy it as I hadn't done with any other game.

I think I already lost count of the many times I was peacefully moving around, with no apparent sign of danger, and that I instantly died a second later (I think the trailer already showcases that pretty much). And the thing is that you might not repeat that death again (because it does hurt to lose your progress, and quite a good run sometimes), but there are still just so many other ways that you might explode at that very moment.

The rest of the game is just a combination of polished details and game design... I mean, you can see after a couple minutes of time, that the whole world can be interacted with, and each thing is original and well implemented.

To me it's almost a 10/10, and my biggest complaint is about performance, as after a few minutes, the game starts to slow down. Fortunately re-opening seems to solve it, and it is so fast opening, that it isn't truly bothersome.

[h1]An Identity Crisis[/h1]
At its core, it tries to be a Roguelike game full of interesting and wacky interactions. You go through stages, go further down, get stronger, kill the boss. Simple. There are A LOT of ways in which you can unfairly die in this game, ranging from stunlocks to death, offscreen projectiles, invisible enemies/pixels, BS interactions literally teleporting acid onto your face, you name it.

But all of that is fine because you only lose like 30 minutes of playtime, right?

Wrong, because this is where the other half of the game rears its ugly head. The exploration. The quests. The ""secrets"". Basically, anything off the beaten path. And this game has A LOT of it. That sounds fun at first, but then you realize that going through these ""sidequests"" takes several hours, and at that point all it takes is a single purple pixel or a worm digging through a mountain to end the last several hours. The player's time is not valued.

Did I mention that the game features instant-death liquids that were put in to ""balance"" the lategame areas? Over there, it doesn't matter how well you strategize your build and your wands. You get hit by a single pixel of the stuff, you're dead instantly. Goodbye the last 6 hours of your life! Wait come back, why aren't you having fun yet?!

[h1]The pearls in the sand[/h1]
Balancing is poor. The vast majority of wands, spells and perks in this game suck really hard. They suck. They are literally just filler to pad out the content. COMPLETELY useless dogs**t. We're talking about limited-use spells, useless or detrimental perks, shuffle wands, or spells that just kill you. Then there are other perks that are basically just mandatory in order to play the game in a fun way, like Tinkering with wands anywhere.

Wand tinkering and experimentation is not rewarded and will most likely lead to wasting your time, your limited spells or even leading to your demise. In order to play this game correctly, you basically have to wiki what works and what doesn't. Same goes for the secrets, they are super obtuse and almost impossible to figure out on your own.

[h1]Dying is not your fault way too often[/h1]
There are SO MANY ways for things to go south outside of your control, much like Spelunky 2. A worm dug through the temple? Sorry bud that's your own fault, prepare to die. Offscreen sniper hit you? Tough luck. Better hope you weren't flying over a hazardous liquid or a high fall because if so, you are now dead because you're stunned out of flying. Enemy picked up a nuke wand? You're instantly dead now.

[h1]Metagaming is mandatory[/h1]
To play this game and have a consistent shot at not just beating the final boss but also doing some of the other side-content, you basically have to exploit the hell out of the game. Essentially, you have to make it so you can play the least amount of the game possible. This involves infinite Nolla teleport wands to explore areas and fight enemies the LEAST, black holing through the map to skip the most amount of the game as humanly possible, and doing other tedious stuff like teleporting past the invisible trigger that destroys the temple when you leave. Did I mention the temple is the only place you can tinker with wands by default?

[h1]Mods?[/h1]
But wait, there's mods! There's mods that respawn you at checkpoints, mods that give you perks like Tinker Anywhere at spawn, mods that give you a more reliable non-shuffle wand to start out with... BUUUUT you can't unlock anything when playing with mods. At all. Nothing. Not just no achievements, but no unlocks period. None of the good spells, none of the mandatory modifiers like Omega or Sigma.


In a nutshell, this game suffers from a massive identity crisis. It does not know whether it wants to be an instadeath roguelike or an exploration-focused game where you set up the world for a payoff. The end result is repeatedly wasting hours of your life. Not fun.

This game is fundamentally broken and I don't think any single change can really fix it. Checkpoints would just be a lame bandaid. I think the biggest sticking point is how unbalanced the perks are. When the best strategy is resetting until the 1st temple has a usable perk, something is wrong.",1585098392,1691678627,False,0,0,0,8,True,False,False

I recommend taking advantage of every exploit possible. This game is far bigger than I imagined and you are likely getting a taste. So if you made it down to the lab and beat the final boss, then good job! Also realize that you basically completed the introduction of the game. I watched FuryForged and LetsSufferTogether on youtube. They helped a lot. You will hate this game, then like it, and then go back to hating it. That's okay. You grow to like it more and more because the more you understand, the better you will perform.


I changed my review from a thumbs up to a thumbs down. This game was fun for a once-through... if you can even make it so far.

Should you buy this game? Sure. Buy it on sale. It's unique. it's fun at first. But for longevity, forget it. This game will turn a lover into a hater.

But now, I loathe this game. If there was a sub-category for the rough-like genre, it would be something along the lines of hardcore. Either monsters will kill you, the environment, or yourself. This surely can be expected and I knew that the game would be tough, but there are many factors beyond skill that affect whether you succeed or not.  

Although the mechanics are very simple and straightforward, there is still a durable learning curve to work through. And even as you progress through the learning curve, the game doesn't necessarily become easier to play. RNG is a real factor here and it could effect the quality of the wands you find (sometimes you find nothing). RNG also comes into play as far as being blind-sided by environmental catastrophes or monsters appear suddenly.

What really turned me off, was the RNG. out of 20 games, I would find myself with some luck. Maybe I would find more hearts than usual. Maybe I would find a wand within the first few levels that wasn't sh*tty to all hell. But when things would be going really well... BAM! I'm dead. I'm dead by something or anything.

This game has a tendency to take away any awesome feelings of achievement, consume them, and then vomit those feeling all over you. All within a blink of an eye.

So nope. I'm good. I beat the boss once. 1 out of 10 people right now can say they did the same. And should I mention... the final boss was the easiest part of the game. I thought there would be something wild about the boss and I should be lucky to stand a chance, but nope. I farted and it died.",1680727561,1691628338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You either have to find a really cool wand with modifiers already on it or you'll have to kill a lot of enemies and get gold in order to buy a wand.

My goal was to complete a run without mods before I could mod at all. After finally doing it at nearly 80 hours played, I believe I'm qualified to talk about the game.

Let's begin with this: Noita is a super unforgiving, completely unfair game. I would have beaten this game 15 hours ago on a crazy good run with a godlike wand, but I died to something that was completely unfair. It happens. There's no way to prevent it. You have to be willing to let the losses go and move forward with the next game, even though you're starting completely from scratch. It's tough, and it made me ragequit for a few days sometimes when I lost after building a very powerful wand. Be prepared for that.

Noita is a game where you have to be willing to take time to learn. I didn't get very far in Noita until I started paying more attention to formations and being more cautious when exploring so as not to get caught in large groups of enemies. It took me around 20 hours just to get past the 2nd biome in good enough shape to progress in the others. And then it took another 20 to make it to the 4th biome period. You will need to spend time learning how spells work, how wands interact with spells, how certain perks affect your character, etc.

There is so much for you to learn and experiment with in the game. (Slight spoiler warning) You have trigger spells, timers, double, triple, quadruple cast, spell modifiers, always casts on a wand, etc. I spent many hours in this game tinkering with wand setups. You can easily spend a long time in a single run trying to build your wand to be exactly what you like. There's a world of possibilities in Noita for wands and spells, and it's one of the main draws of the game.

I'll list out the various pros and cons in a short list for those interested.

Pros:
+ In-Depth, complex, and customizable magic system
+ Mostly satisfying rewards for exploration
+ Individual pixel simulation creates a large amount of interesting things to do with physics
+ Large amounts of optional content
+ Mod-friendly
+ Procedural generation means that no 2 runs will ever be alike

Cons:
- Insane learning curve
- Some deaths are unfair, and some unavoidable
- RNG can make or break runs
- Wand and spell mechanics are not clearly explained and must be learned via a wiki or YouTube videos
- Losing great runs can cause ragequits

Overall, Noita is an excellent game that can provide hours of enjoyment. It is not easy, will require effort and work to learn, and will take many hours to conquer. But once you do, you'll realize just how satisfying this game is to play.

It especially doesn't help that the beginning of the game is pretty boring/stale and reliant on the sand boxy start that just doesn't provide any consistency at all—praise be to the modding community though. Overall though, it just feels like a massive hit or miss and a massive time sink if you want to try as it's not really a typical roguelike game.

There are definitely some neat little secrets and interactions the more you play, but the base game is a bit hard to ignore.

It's got the most satisfying/fun environmental interactions I've ever seen in a game. It has a treasure trove of secrets that feel rewarding to find and conquer, with some secrets yet to even be solved by the community.
It rewards those who are creative in their approach to things, with your potential being basically infinite.
The game is beautifully mysterious, with a soundtrack that is just... so damn atmospheric.
The game's hard as hell, too, with some deaths being so absurd that it's just funny.

Now, despite all this praise... I give a warning. If you wish to persist, and crack open this game for all its worth, you MUST have a strong will. Knowledge IS power in this game. Every death will give you new knowledge. Focus on the knowledge, not the loss. Don't be afraid to check the wiki, or to ask the community. The knowledge this game's community gains is a group effort.

As with any wizardry, knowledge is power, and Noita is no different. The pixel based physics of the game come with their own rules and laws and mastering them is the key to success. Being a wizard requires lots of experiments to gain insight and the currency here is death. For instance berserkium is a great time until you fire off your first bomb and half the screen is gone, you included! 

The environment is only half the battle though, your wand is your greatest asset(and sometimes your worst). Like any respectable wizard you need to be able to cast spells, and oh boy can you! There are hundreds of spells and you can do some absolutely insane stuff with them. Knowing how to build your wand is one of the most important parts of being a wizard though, and a lot of that knowledge, like everything else in Noita, will come from a death. Firing dynamite and a spark bolt at the same time might seem like a good idea until the spark bolt explodes the dynamite point blank. It goes both ways though, one of my favorite wand designs takes a rather innocuous summon rock spell that is largely useless by itself, but by giving it accelerating homing will accelerate at mach 11 towards any enemy and smash them to death(unless they have melee immunity). There are all sort of modifier spell too that allow for some truly crazy builds,

Wizards need secrets to uncover and solve and Noita has them in spades. You'll almost certainly need the wiki for them, but there's all sorts of crazy bosses to discover and fight, orbs to collect, parallel worlds to plunder, and even more ridiculous feats of wizardry to preform!

I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into difficult 2D games, but also anyone who is interested in slowly amassing game knowledge until you can manipulate the world to your advantage.

[b] Noita's gameplay loop has too many variables, too little communication, and too little consistency for it to succeed at its goal. [/b] This is all the more frustrating because it is *so close* to being a great game. The wand mechanics are simply too varied, the spells too random, for every wand you can successfully build on you might see a hundred that are entirely useless. For every spell that is the successful basis for a good build, you'll see a dozen that will only hinder your progress. This is to say nothing of the time sink in order to determine if a run will be successful. [b] A good roguelike may punish you for getting cocky, but few then force you to go back to what amounts to baby's first fantasy game for 10-20 plus minutes, gathering materials, dodging exceptionally low health (but high damage) enemies just to take another crack at the difficult levels. [/b]

It is poorly optimized, leading to extreme latency spikes in routine gameplay (this PC was built in 2021 and upgraded in 2022). In a game that delights in punishing you for a slight misstep, this usually means that you *will* die when the frames drop. 

tl;dr: Don't buy this game. It is poorly optimized, suffers from an extremely poorly designed difficulty ramp, and has too many variables to be anything more than a slot machine that takes 20 minutes to pull. I would refund it if I could.

There are several tiers to ""beating"" this game; each is more elaborate to complete. You can travel down the Holy Mountain(s) and beat the boss for the most basic and worst ending. There's a better ending in which you travel around the world to collect 11 Orbs too. 

I just finished the ending that requires collecting 33 orbs, and it was extremely taxing to complete. I have attempted this challenge several times, and this final time kinda killed what interest I had left in the game. Shortly after collecting my 32nd Orb, I hopped into a Holy Mountain portal in one of the parallel worlds. Normally, this returns you to the base world's Holy Mountain, but instead.... the game crashed to desktop. Not quite the scare I wanted after spending an inordinate amount of time on this challenge. Fortunately, the game had a backup available when I relaunched it. I grabbed the final Orb, completed the Work a the Mountain Altar, and all was right with the world.

There is treasure to be found, power and secrets, but you will be cheated. Speaking plainly the game is quite frustrating, so very many deaths are just ""Oh. Okay. Guess I start again then"", but it is also quite addictive. Theoretically the structure is fairly simple: you want to reach the bottom of the dungeon and beat the boss. You explore each floor as much as you can for loot and move on when you either finish exploring or can explore no longer.

However throughout most of my playtime I was bogged down by the hints of more. There is a wealth of exploration to be found on the surface or outside the regular bounds. Which way should I actually go, maybe there's something to be found there. To be fair, there is, but it's not important. Not.. important enough to worry about. If you can't make it to the bottom of the dungeon, you probably don't need to worry about trying to get through the dangers that await there either.

After using a few mods to clear the game and explore more freely, I find it easier to try play and enjoy the game as is. Though I would still take XCOM or Dorf Fort over some of the 'fun' offered, and many of the faults are still inherent to the design of Noita, they grate less when the rules are laid out. So in general I will say many will not enjoy their time with this, but there is a fair amount that garners interest too if it happens to be your forte.

If you're familiar with the ""Powder"" toy, this game will bring back all sorts of good memories, as the ""Falling Everything"" engine that was created for the game is essentially that Powder toy. Add in randomly generated biomes, wands, spells, and treasure, and you've got the essentials of Noita. As a roguelike (roguelike-lite-likelite???), Noita will punish you for every mistake, and because of the game's engine, you'll become paranoid enough to inspect every pixel closely.

Wands and spellcasting are incredibly well ironed out, and the devs have essentially given the okay to try to break as much as possible in game. As a result, there are some absolutely mind blowing builds that the community has come up with. Then if you become bored with the hundreds of spells already in the game, Noita allows modding - an almost infinitely customizable game becomes literally infinitely customizable in this way.

There are hundreds of hours worth of things to do - such that the ""main path"" as it is called is less than 10% of the game. I won't go into secrets here as discovering them is part of the experience.

The world has incredible depth, and is brimming with secrets and easter eggs, but it is also brutally hard, and with each perma-death the player gains more knowledge, etc.. The game's most striking aspect comes from its truly unique wand creation mechanic, which is set at the center of its gameplay. Wand-creation tasks the player with combining together multiple spells to create the larger effect of their wands. As your knowledge of the world and its mechanics grow, so does your spell-crafting competancy. The types of things people can make with these wands are absurd. I've seen wands that can destroy the entire screen, deal infinite damage, teleport across parallel words, or even instantly complete the game (no joke). All this only serves to illustrate that Noita's wand-building fosters creativity and ingenuity in a very unique way. The player is no-longer just confined to fireballs and lazers. Want to create a wand that shoots 4 homing boulders each of which explodes into buzzsaws? Noita has you covered.

The essence of discovery in this game is unparalleled, and is a far and refreshing shot from the hand holding tutorials that every triple A title wants to hold your hand through these days. I don't think any other game encapsulates the potential of what 'magic' can be better than this one. At the time of this review, Hogwarts legacy came out not too long ago and I don't have any doubts that that game showcases a fantastic interpretation of a magical world, but the gameplay of being magical pales in comparison to Noita by far. When you discover a unique way of becoming powerful each run, there's nothing else like it. It might take you a while to get there, and the journey will be brutal without question. Noita WILL punish what you do and do not know about its world, inhabitants, and mechanics. Each death, as frustrating as it may be at times, will teach you something valuable to keep you alive just a little bit longer each time. Without looking anything up, it took me roughly 133 hours to beat the game, but that does not mean I completed everything. Far from it, there are secrets abound and stumbling upon them is always fantastic as each that you find each time gives you just a sliver into the world that Noita offers. There's so much more that I can say about this game but I'm currently freeballing this review and I will come back to update it over time. But the only thing that you need to know is:

Enemies hit you out of the screen, and you can do nothing; there are tons of environmental damages impossible to dodge at all; the lack of health resources and the possibility to empower yourself in very little way obligate you to search for exploits via the web, some of which are very tricky to bypass this crazy system. Why do that? Just give us more resources and stop.
Actually, 90% of the game is spent on the first 3 layers. If you don't get lucky enough to bypass harshly designed gameplay, you simply can not advance, even if you are the most skilled player in the world.

The simulational aspect is a technical feat, no doubt about it, but I just couldn't find a hook to keep me exploring. The starting areas were pretty bland and despite the novel ways you can interact with the world it ends up being more an exploration of all the ways you can get yourself killed.

For the right person this is a very engaging and deep sandbox but for me it was just a bunch of uninteresting pit falls I couldn't compel myself to try and work past. A great tech demo but not a very engaging game.",1690283535,1690283630,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

In reality this game is GIGANTIC, the ""normal gameplay loop"" isn't even a quarter of what this game actually has to offer.

This game pretends to put you into a box, we all know how it works, keep going down until you win, mhm?

Also, which i did not expect to be so immersive, the lore is actually very good as well and has some nice hidden stuff for those who like to go into the true depths of this game.
A wonderful mysterious fantasy world with over-the-top alchemy mechanics that will have you in stitches while you are fearing for your very life in the same moment.

The only thing I miss: being able to do more than one run in parallel. Once you started a long run it would still be nice to warm up to a new game instead of just going straight back in.

Noita is that.

There is the layer of game that is perfectly enjoyable and fulfilling and fun that is ""go into the mountain, progress through levels, beat the final boss"". You can do that for many tens of hours.

The other layers are all incredibly arcane and obscure objectives, places, and events that may or may not require your build to basically be Eldritch God-tier and require 5+ hour runs to complete.

ive loved just burning wooden structures to watch the embers fall and for the structure to break down, but after you destroy every explosive and set the map on fire it dose encounter some frame-rate issues, the same goes for gases. the only issues ive found are that materials like ice that break and fall down after breaking can occasionally not follow those rules and stay stationary after breaking, even when completely suspended in the air, also the bounce mechanic is a little to unpredictable, sometime if i shot at an angle smaller than 90 degrees itll just bounce right back at me, which makes no damn sense, but i think that's limited to just the bouncy ball spell or whatever its called.

the biggest feature being the wands is more intriguing then you are led to believe upon first launching the game, you have very little to work with at the start but eventually you build up a good catalog of spells to play with, but finding spells isn't the only exploitative aspect, take your time and just walk around the levels, there's stuff in every corner.",1689621583,1689621583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I have spent at time of writing, 200 hours on this game, I would point out that there are aspects of this game that I have obviously enjoyed, as I'd hope to be the case for anybody that has spent a little over a whole week of their life playing. I don't want people to be necessarily discouraged from playing this game by my review, but I want people to know what exactly they are getting themselves into beforehand. The issues I have will be listed in three parts, in this order. The games difficulty, the time the game demands out of your life, and the obtuse secrets involved. But first, a ""short"" rundown of my experiences before hand. 
I had my first clear after getting about 70 hours of experience into the game. I think I cleared with 6 or 7 orbs. At the point of the map that I'd explored (And regrettably my rapid fire wand was also my drill wand), I had to reset the game several times due to performance issues. On later runs I learned that this could be offset by not making a luminous drill wand also shoot ranged bouncy projectiles, While playing, the game seems to encourage teleporting in/out of holy mountains or drilling your way out of them so that you can come back later to edit your wands. This means a ton of backtracking, which I quickly got accustomed to. After my first clear I decided to install some mods that would save me time, such as more storage space for spells and items, as well as a free tinker with mods anywhere perk at the start of the run. I understand that this might seem like cheating to some players, and I admit that aspects of this can at times feel a bit scummy, but ultimately, this level of cheating matters little in this game. With how fragile the character is, it doesn't matter if you're carrying around 5 tablets and 13 potions, they aint gonna help ya. Tinkering with wands anywhere exists in the game, and generally feels like a better way to play, as you wouldn't need to spend as much time backtracking already explored areas. This perk helps speed things up, but if you can't find good wands or spells, it aint gonna help you either. Around 100 hours in, On a really successful and long run I picked up what I thought was going to be a spell and it was an ""elemental essence"". This started exploding things around me, and I nearly died. I turned off the game and installed another mod that would allow me to remove perks. For a long while I'd only used it the once, but never actually removed the mod. Later I realized that using this mod would allow the gambling perk to generate infinite perks. I did so once to see how op I could get. Didn't matter cause I got polymorphed and instantly died. To exemplify my point about cheating, while it doesn't FEEL good to do, the game doesn't care and will still destroy you. My max orb count is 21, and during that run I had started with every perk I could have wanted. I'd built god wands and had climbed a secret area twice for some special wands. Spent 7 hours doing this. I just wanted to see what a max orb boss would have looked like to fight, to see if I could make a wand that could beat him without looking online. Didn't get the chance. Polymorph and cheating aside, let's talk about the main issues I have, starting with that difficulty.
1. Difficulty.
I think that this is self evident by the fact that the game has weeded out half of the players before they were even able to get to the third ""stage"". Everything can and will kill you. You try to fire a wand you pick up, and the spells are in the wrong order or configuration. You're dead. You step on the wrong pixel, you're on fire. Spell bounces and hits a crate of explosives? Run over. Sometimes. While experience can solve these problems, sometimes things you can't explain or had no chance to deal with will end your run. Try to fire a wand that you know to be a safe wand (At a distance), but there is a single pixel that you couldn't see against the dark background that your projectile hit and you explode on the spot. Getting hit by enemy projectiles that spawn off screen. Or when an enemy unit picks up a wand that has an earthquake or nuke spell in it and fires it once. These is nothing that can be done about some of these potentially game ending events.
2. Time investment.
This game doesn't care about your time. I understand that rogue-like games have permadeath and are supposed to be difficult. But the sheer volume of content needed to actually ""complete"" the game takes so much time that you'd have to be a monster to do it in one sitting, which from what I can tell, most rogue-likes are made for. The fact that you can lose everything after playing one file for over 7 hours is one of the most punishing things you can experience from a video game. If you just want to get to the bottom and clear the boss, this aint a huge issue, but if you actually want to explore the bulk of the content this game offers, you need to be fully ready to spend nearly a whole 24 hour day of your life on a single run. Some streamers that I have watched have taken 18+ hours (and i'd argue that they are experts at this game) to get the secret content behind this investment wall.
3. Speaking of secrets.
You won't complete any bonus content in this game without looking parts of it up. You may come across notes on the wall in an area of the game, and wonder about it. But you'd be suicidal to actually willingly explore the area the ""key"" is in without a purpose to go there. I don't know if this was a glitch but when I finally obtained the musical notes, I went back to that wall and the notes were gone. I didn't think i'd have to write them down. Other secrets are just as obtuse. I don't want to spoil anything, just in case what I've mentioned so far seems like a great CBT time, but there is a sequence of events involving statues that I thought were just decorations until I saw somebody kick one.
While I respect difficulty in videogames, considering that I've played vanilla and modded Minecraft on Hardcore several times in the past, these traits tied together like they are in this game leads to a feeling that is generally more punishing than rewarding. There are several things I think you must ask yourself before you ready yourself to sit down and play this game. ""Do I have a reaction time good enough to dodge projectiles fired from off screen?"", ""Am I smart enough or willing to learn the spell wrapping and speed augmenting wand building mechanics?"", ""Am I willing to let multiple hours of my life blink away instantly?"", ""Am I generally a lucky person?"" If any of those are a no, you might not have a good time with this game.
If you read my whole review, thank you. I don't mean to shit on this game, but I don't know if I have much will to keep at it at this point. I must commend the designers for making something that I got 200+ hours of ""playtime"" out of. Was it ""enjoyment""? Some of it. Sure. Maybe most. But it's bittersweet.

I have put in an additional 400 hours of playtime. I have just now collected the final achievement. I stand fully by everything I previously wrote.",1630301462,1689506302,False,57,0,0.722566187381744385,3,True,False,False

Number one mechanic? Health can solely and only be replenished during level transitions (except for a ridiculous perk that probably spawns once every 300 runs)
To win the game you basically must travel 500 meters downwards in randomly generated caves. The problem is, after ""each 100"" meters, with each health replenishment, basically, difficulty increases, and enemies deal progressively higher damage, while your damage relies entirely and absolutely on the items you find. And guess what: the more you unlock, the lower the chances for the actually useful perks and weapons. Exactly: I was closer to ending the game in the first two hours, than what I was in the following 30.
You might be drawn by the pixel animations and smoke and fire dynamics, but it's not worth it. I would never have purchased this **** if I had played a demo first.

Sure it's possible to deal with; but a game that requires that amount of attention is just draining to me personally. It's more like a jump scare than anything else. I don't want to be on edge the entire time I'm playing the game but you pretty much have to be. If that's what you want then this could be fun for you. I wasn't really looking for horror experience but that's basically the best this game has to offer. I also think  many combinations of wands are more dangerous to you then to your enemies.

There is so much this game has to offer, from understanding the wand building mechanics, learning the world layout, messing with alchemy, discovering secrets, to completing quests without any direction or objective through sheer intuition (and maybe a lot of help from the wiki and community). You could easily push this game into the hundreds of hours, if not thousands, if you want to 100% it. It might even get you really thinking about what is actually possible in this game, how you can go from such a simple starting point and get to world ending god status over the course of a single run.

🟦 Lots of travel through tons of empty ""scenery"" and maybe fight one or two monsters every ten minutes
🟦 Tedious and repetitive gameplay with mediocre rewards that make you regret life but keep trying
🟦 Watch a cutscene for 30min, then run to the next room to trigger another 25min cutscene

Visuals
🟦 MSPaint Stick Figures On Notebook Pages
✅ Elemental Pixel Particle Simulator w/ beautiful, fully destructible environments (aka Powder Toy meets Metroidvania)
🟦 -slaps screen- this baby has more cell shading than that GameCube game about the kid and his red boat
🟦 Actually Crisis 3

Soundtrack
🟦 Possibly GTA Radio or MGS3: Snake Eater
🟦 Some pretty epic tracks to fight your enemies to
✅ Can tell how things are going by the ambient music shifting into <25%HP mode for its tracks. Fits the setting quite well.
🟦 ""Doot Doot Beep Boop, Hi, I am clearly the water stage! Enjoy your suffering!""

Story
🟦 JRP with ""dialogue box cut scenes"" and giant jello jigglers everywhere
✅ Almost not even there but it's totally there if you wanna look for it, be ready for deep dive videos
🟦 Better than [your favorite games story here]
🟦 Literally Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind

Noita Hates You.

It does not matter how far along you are. It doesn't matter what you're doing in the moment. It doesn't even matter if the nearest enemy is 4 klicks away. Noita can - and will - find a way to ruin your run.  Maybe you mix two pixels that really don't like each other, maybe you just get hit by a falling rock. Maybe you explode. All of these things have happened to me separately before.

But yknow what? It's fine.

I have modded the absolute bejesus out of this game, to the point that it's nearly unrecognizable. There is a plethora of online resources to help you understand the earlygame and get better as you go, learning what spells to use and what not to use, how to get gold, how not to die (and you will die a lot), etc. So if I had to distill any advice in this review, I would say this: slow down, take your time, dont charge into things.

In fact those and the secrets are why I keep throwing myself at this game so much, because I'm hoping I get to experiment with more spells and explore. The game is brutal, and even the skilled can't guarantee their survival. The odds are against you, and if you want to have any semblance of a chance then you must consult a wiki or a guide (something I have no problem with, but with Noita it is REQUIRED to know everything). Success in the early game relies very heavily on RNG for you to find the right materials, spells, wands, potions, ect. because if you don't it's like playing with a missing arm. 

Overall, I really enjoy what the game is, but the patients required to actually PLAY it is exhausting and causes me to not want to come back to it after unfairly dying (be it a god run or off spawn).

This is my favourite Genre of game. 
Not Platformer.
Not Roguelike.
Not Indie.
SYSTEMS BASED.
Notia is a game built upon of variety of systems. For example, Heat water and it evaporates and leaves steam. Freeze water and it becomes solid. EVERY pixel in this game has a property that can be interacted upon within the games systems and it can lead to utter, hilarious chaos sometimes. 
At it's core Notia IS a Roguelike Platformer but what sets it apart is the SYSTEMS. As you progress you pick up all sorts of spells and passive abilities that always have drawbacks and boons depending on the scenario.
A wand that Fires TNT? That's great!
A want that Fires TNT when you permanently emit a death beam from your eyes. VERY BAD! Because that beam will immediately ignite the TNT as you fire it causing an explosion millimetres from your face.
Also, The dedicated KICK button is an absolute godsend for a game like this. Kicking ash into a lake of oil is VERY satisfying!
This is a game where you WILL die in unexpected ways regularly but you will be able to work out what it was and be weary of it happening again. Do NOT cast your frost shield while underwater for example!
If all this sounds boring and frustrating to you then Notia problem won't be your cup of tea. If ANYTHING above sounds fun to you then I 100% recommend purchasing it.",1678582074,1688888286,True,2,0,0.527220606803894043,0,True,False,False

It truly feels like a rogue-like as virtually every run will yield a different path (assuming you don't immediately die, which will happen a lot, then its kind of the same run, but in a good way.)

The environment is such an incredible trope for a video game. When they say every pixel is incorporated, they mean Every. Single. Pixel. It makes for some incredibly dynamic and at times hilarious runs. 

The replayability comes from several facets of this game. Obviously the uniqueness of each run lends a lot to it, but another very interesting portion is the minimal to non-existent explanation of how to play. This may seems like a fault but really lends to the game because as you die and learn you start to feel very proud of yourself as you piece together different strategies and your play style becomes more polished. Before you know it your crafting insane spell combos in anticipation of ridiculous possibilities. The third part that lends to replayability is definitely the kicks. Kicking shit is some of the dopest stuff I've ever seen.

And then there are bad kind of difficult games that are difficult because you're completely at the mercy of RNG. That said, Noita is HORRENDOUSLY bad kind of difficult.

Not only do you need to get lucky at getting perks that make a run doable but you're also at the mercy of RNG to get even decent wands and spells to help you keep yourself alive. Yes, there are some cheeky tricks you can do, but in order to do said tricks, you STILL need RNG to be on your side. However I'm 90% sure that the game is hard-coded to give you perks and spells from certain pools, rather than being truly random. Oh and even if you do get lucky and get a wand that can kill the final boss in five seconds, you're then gonna die to something like acid or lava, which essentially mean insta-death if you're not moving.

And I'm not even going to begin on the bugs, like
1) getting stuck on random pixels you can't do anything about except beg for the game to realize it's BS and delete those three pixels off of you, 
2) small gaps you SOMEHOW can get through ONCE, only to realize that it's a dead-end but then the game won't let you back out, killing the run right then and there, OR
3) how the game can stack a pile of enemies inside one another, especially with spiders, which will then trick you to think it's just one spider, you shoot it as you're getting closer to get the gold, only then to be attacked by the other ELEVEN spiders that were hiding in one pile, thus killing you before you can even properly begin a run. Just to name a couple of things.

Don't trust those gifs and videos with wands that basically just delete anything and everything with 50 perks loaded up to essentially nullify all damage. You're not gonna get to that point without mods (which disable achievements, BTW).

This game is just frustration.

Avoid.

That said, I'm still going to 100% this heap of garbage since I'm already here. Pray for my mental health.

--- EDIT 03.07. ---

I should be done with this fucking pile of garbage but it just keeps bugging out like the pixely shit it is. How the fuck is acceptable that when the game starts stuttering and I save and exit to get rid of said stuttering, the game forgets about your run?!?! What the FUCK is wrong with the morons who made this game?! Not to mention how many times I lost goddamn hours and hours of progress because of all the crashes that have wiped my progress! And as a bonus, it turns out that because this game has been so horribly programmed, it can't handle Steam Cloud properly. Just today the game decided to REALLY try to sync up the Cloud files and decided to override my files on my computer. So in a nutshell, apparently I lost quite a bit of progress I've done in three weeks. More specifically, 1/3 of all the enemies in the ""codec"" are now blank again.

How the Hell do people defend this game?!

--- EDIT 08.07. ---

DONE!

Jesus Christ, never in my live have I encountered a game that handles its own data as poorly as this heap of garbage. Seriously, how stupid can these excuses for game developers be when they are perfectly aware of how easy it is to crash their game and yet they can't be bothered to create an auto-save function?! Instead of that, the game will desperately scramble to find whatever bits of data it can find but it often forgets about some of the key parts of the game like, oh I dunno, some of the more recent spells and perks you acquired and the very existence of parts of the world! If your game crashes, the Island on the West side of the map is gone 95% of the time.

Actually, here, a screenshot to show just a hint of the kind of garbage behavior you can expect from this game:

https://steamcommunity.com/id/juud0lf/screenshot/2052001304413311068/

Yes, those are golden outline on ""unknown"" enemies. If you crash after killing a new enemy, the game will remember that you've killed a new enemy but doesn't remember that you've killed said enemy. Good luck figuring that out with the bosses that only spawn once in the very specific parts of the world! And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the technical issues!

My previous points also still stand. This game is NOT fun for those who actually want to play it. The only reason this game has the ""Difficult"" tag is because of the technical difficulties, the sheer amount of luck you need to even start a decent run and the amount of stuff you either need to figure out painfully one attempt at a time or open up a Wiki. ""Okay, attempt #8 at this boss, this time I have the Omega Saw!"" *pew* ""Oh damn, the saw actually got- [i]Oh he can copy my spells even after he's dead and he fired about 30 Omega Saws at me, that's cool![/i]

I would rather go through the stress of seeing blood in my urine and stressing out if I have cancer or something else again rather than ever playing this game again. And dare I say, I'd rather play the bot-infested TF2 again rather than playing another minute of Noita.

Noita is a game with zero handholding. No game is like it. EVERY pixel is simulated. Threw a bomb to get to a heart? well now you've set fire to the wood around you, which caused a potion of acid to fall over and now you're melting to death while far enough to have the false illusion of safety. This game will beat you to a bloody pulp, it takes a certain kind of stubborn player to enjoy. Also has an incredible modding community, and the devs are back making updates again. I am not exaggerating when I say this is my favourite game ever.

10 / 10, once you get the hang of things you rarely feel like you've had no say in your death, it's a bit rough in some places but with the right knowledge that just adds to it's charm. Balance is an illusion, some spells will actively cause you more harm than any enemy ever could, but with a single other spell turn into level clearing murder machines. Other spells have near zero downside to ever using. Incredible wand-building system which gives more build diversity than any procedural roguelike could ever. Flaming sawblades that lash out tentacles homing in on wands in the world only to explode into actual living deer which rapidly multiply and explode? Doable. Genuine actual ballistic missiles which run away from enemies, eating terrain then after a delay firing out a square of tiny death particles, only to cast another wand which turns each and every little particle that just created into literal nukes? This game won't stop you. Magic which creates massive bubbles of ice, flooded with water, teleporting around chaotically towards enemies only to latch on to them, downing them while repeatedly firing circles of healing magic only to prolong their suffering? Just hope you don't drown yourself. This game knows no bounds. The pixel sim is beautiful and brutal, a thorny rose which will cause you to bleed out just by looking at it. Alchemy which explodes, burns, freezes, zaps, melts, and tries it's hardest to murder you. Come across the right reactions and you might brew flasks of infinite wealth and vitality, or melt entire biomes with all consuming void liquid. 

Noita is a game like no other. And if you've got the patience, you can go on endless self imposed challenges, play with even more content mods, speedrun to beat the game in literal seconds, there are users with thousands upon thousands of hours for a reason. I will never find a game quite like noita again, a literal masterpiece made of divine spite from a handful of sadistic arson-inclined finnish people behind other brilliant games like Baba Is You (this game also has reality bending tomfoolery, to a lesser extent!) and The Swapper.

There's skill involved, but a lot of the skill is dependent on what you already know. Knowledge of how the game is played and works can compensate for a lack of skill, in many cases.

This makes it a pretty rewarding experience. It also trivializes death in a lot of cases because, once you get used to dying, every step you retrace can be done faster and with a better plan. Success, in this, isn't about completing the game, but seeing how much better you can do this life than last life.

The physics are great. Since there are so many calculations and the engine isn't perfect, it does need regular restarts to avoid crashes which have the potential to damage the save game. It helps to set a timer for about 15 minutes. Hopefully that gets better, one day. Until it does, however, this is the worst complaint I can come up with.

Adaptive music is hard to find, especially music that adapts to when and how OFTEN YOU SHOOT, as well as enemy numbers, type of enemies, UGH the underground desert theme is so fucking amazing.

To go more into detail, the game gives you the knowledge of the basic features (shoot, walk, kick, throw, and inventory) and you figure out the rest. What's challenging about everything, however, is how used to you probably are with games functions that simply don't make sense; you think ""I bet the devs didn't think about this"" THAT DOESN'T EXIST HERE! For example: Broken wands and concentrated mana. You throw a broken wand-- it shoots sporadically for a couple seconds and then stops. When you throw a wand into concentrated mana, however, it CONSUMES a liquid and keep shooting UNTIL THE LIQUID IS GONE!! It's such a niche tiny detail you wouldn't even think about, but the devs did. Got a fire based enemy? Kill it with water (the majority of the time). Got an enemy with a shield or protective armor? Use plasma cutters to cut through it. Worm eats a fire mage? Dies because the blood of a fire mage is lava. Did YOU consume lava?? YOU BURN INTERNALLY AND CANT PUT IT OUT WITH WATER!

This game is the best game I've ever played, the only thing I wish it had was a multiplayer mode where the enemy count is multiplied by the amount of people on your lobby.

Noita is game about using your magical wands as weapons of mass destruction, to harness gold from the poor souls roaming the mines and Area’s bellow, to buy even Stronger wands and Spells.

Pros:
- Smooth controls and simple combat
- Large amount of Spells, wands, and unique trinkets
- The map itself is fairly big but thanks to the addition of parallel universes, it’s basically infinite
- Everything is destructible and can be broken down to its last pixel
- Amazing enemy design and variety
- Steam Workshop Supported

Cons:
- Secrets are hard to find and getting to them can be a mayor hustle as well (personal preference)
- Inventory System can be really annoying when trying to obtain/transport key items

Conclusion:
It is a game worth your money but I would not recommend it, if you can’t invest much of your free time into it. Runs can take hours and the game is not hesitant to severely punish you for even the slightest mistake you do.

1. Wand building, the only way you're going to figure out wand building is by watching a tutorial on YouTube. There is no indication that things like spell wrapping exist unless someone else tells you about it. This is TERRIBLE game design. Like unforgivably bad. I like games that don't spell everything out for you but most of the advanced mechanics or even just....regular mechanics you NEED to progress through the game are hidden behind YOUTUBE VIDEOS!

2. Starts suck....you always with 1 attack wand and one explosive(the vast majority of the time you're going to have a spark bolt and a bomb) and one flask. Your first job is to find water if you don't have it which is not fun, it's tedious. Then you have to explore the entire level for hearts and wands which may or may not drop. If they don't. Your run is unwinnable. Also have fun farming gold so you can buy the upgrades you need at the holy mountain because without those...again...your run is unwinnable. This is bad game design.

3. The coolness of the whole gimmick of every pixel being simulated wears off very quickly when you realize that all this actually really means 90% of the time is ""every pixel can burn you to death, melt you death, blow you up, etc"". You will almost never get the opportunity to actually use this mechanic in an interesting way to your advantage or really do anything cool with it yourself... Most of what this mechanic actually does in an average play is force you to pour water on yourself constantly all the time to avoid being hurt by acid, poison, fire, etc. This is bad game design.

4. The community has an entire term dedicated to the BS deaths in this game where you just seemingly randomly explode because something happened ten miles above you and acid landed on your head or whatever, they call it being ""Noita'd""....if even your biggest fans are pointing out that the RNG nature of deaths is cheating them out of a win....you created a bad game.

5. There is a mechanic where you can ""anger the gods"" in this game but most of the time when it happens it's not because YOU did anything to upset them. Usually it will happen if any destruction or harm comes to holy mountains but usually this happens because a giant worm spawned at the bottom of the level and destroyed it long before you even  got there......when you anger the gods...or I should say....when a randomly generated blatantly unfair enemy angers the gods.....you basically start the next level and unless you have a powerful wand....you die... It's not something you can really avoid. A skeleton guy with a giant forcefield around him to avoid any of the meager damage you levvy at him kills you.....this can happen even in the first level before you can be reasonably expected to have much more than a spark bolt. This is terrible game design.

6. There are so many upgrades that are just completely worthless to most players. And since it's all RNG all the time....you're going to get them a lot. And they're gonna be it, it's entirely possible that no matter how well you're playing... You'll just get trash upgrades that you can't use....and your run is completely unwinnable...or you'll get upgrades that would be useful in tandem with something else that you never find. Etc. This is bad game design...I know I keep saying that but honestly it goes beyond that at this point ..this doesn't feel like a designed game anymore after a while. It feels like a slot machine. Hades is a roguelite game too with a lot of random elements but it's also consistent...enough...to work...I have a bias towards games with like... real actual level design in them....but a game like this CAN work even if it's not my preference. And this one doesn't.

The worst part is....this game is terrible...but it's also easy to like....and hard not to like...which means I keep coming back to it in short bursts like ""this is gonna be the time this is gonna be where it gets good"" I would not be surprised if this has happened to a lot of people....which means you waste even more time on a game that sucks....at least most of the time a bad game shows itself early on, you realize it's terrible very soon, you uninstall it and you never touch it again(that's what you SHOULD do if you play this....but you won't) because of this factor I actually think Noita might be the worst game I have ever played.",1683452419,1688199404,False,4,3,0.397181868553161621,0,True,False,False

As with most games there are builds and combinations to learn that allow better survival and game play, so there is a bit of learning more than combat. The variety of spells, abilities, potions, etc. keep the game from getting stale.

Speaking of that, the primary method of playing is procedurally generated maps, so it's not just memorizing the layout and enemies. There is lots of exploration per level to build up your character.

It's a rouge-like in a dark fantasy setting inspired by Finnish mythology, with supremely interesting lore that's deeply rooted in the ancient pursuits of hermeticism and European alchemy (i.e. bringing the world under your command by mastering and manipulating its physical elements).

The primary mechanic is spellcrafting, which involves the combination of spells, modifiers, and other components to achieve a truly incredible range of effects.  This ends up feeling like its own mathematical language, and is apparently structured like a card game under the hood.  It takes a lot of dedication to fully understand how this system works, but doing so pays off immensely.

There's also a chemistry engine that allows you to transform and transmute materials, effecting reactions that heed things like temperature and motion.  If you ever played a Falling Sand game in the mid-2000s, then imagine [i]that[/i] as a massive, intricate world with monsters and magic.

There are spells in the game such as explosion which literally just removes your health bar 90% of the time. Your hour long run can be stopped short by trying something new or turning a corner and getting blasted point blank by an overpowered enemy. The enemies after a certain point all explode into various gases or oil or fire which becomes utter chaos and unfun to deal with.

Not to mention the RNG in the game can be ridiculously good but mostly bad. Most of the early game wands are utter trash and you need a good understanding of the wand stats and spells you can use without killing yourself in order to survive without min maxing peeking around corners and effectively sucking all the fun out of the game.

The game is fun when you are in mid air, casting spells and hitting things from offscreen or being immune to damage. In literally any other situation you are just asking to get clipped into some random pixel and die because you are now stuck for several seconds until the game figures out you are stuck (yes, being stuck is so ingrained into the game that there is a system that noclip the player after several seconds).

If you move at high speed (fall from high elevation/acceleratum) you'll randomly clip into parts of the wall and get yourself stuck. You can sometimes squeeze yourself through into tight areas and be unable to get out even though the terrain has not changed. There are spells that spawn objects with collision box (summon cart) and you can instantly get yourself stuck the moment you cast them (they explode btw). Use the teleport spell against a ceiling and you'll randomly get stuck in it (sure you can escape by shooting elsewhere, but why does this even need to happen in the first place?)

The worst part is that even undamaged walls can sometimes just cause you to clip into it. The clearest example is the dense rock wall that surrounds the chasm east of the mines, but realistically any wall can do this. If you fly against these you'll randomly get stuck, and to make it worse you'll be stuck in a flying state which means you can't even regenerate your flight gauge to get out.

I sincerely cannot recommend any platformer where getting clipping/softlocking is a literal feature at this point.

Edit: I enjoyed the game during the beta but a lot of things seem to have been changed for the worse since. The game is barely playable without proper digging spell and now there are so many random crap spells diluting the drops that you'll have a tough time getting one. Let's be very honest: nobody cares about 20 variations of fireball/bombs that don't even dig through steel, which can appear on the literal first level. To make it worse there are some really nasty enemies now like the swapper enemy and the ghost that spawns with random wands. I really don't understand how these add anything to the game other than to add ""lolsorandom XD"" deaths and piss off the player.

Early game takes too long. 
-Try to speed through and you have no money to buy anything or re roll perks.
-Going slow and taking you time means you will find more hidden wands and items, but by the time to get to the interesting weapons and perks, you have been slogging for almost an hour. Finding anything interesting or useful is NOT guaranteed either.

Plenty of people love the game, look at the reviews. And I did at one point. But the tedium is becoming very apparent.

I think there is a good game buried under there, that shows itself every one and a while.
But the time/fun ratio is too off for me.

TL;DR
Early game is too slow and boring for the amount of times you will be playing it.
Mods might be able to fix, but this review page is for the game, not mods.


As a side note, the physics of the world kinda become blah after some time. A lot of emphasis on things burning, and this also takes way to long. TONS of floating single pixels you will get stuck on. You are also apparently wearing a nylon robe soaked in lighter fluid.

That being said, this game sorely needs a progression mode where you restart at the beginning of the zone you died in, maybe with half health or such. I just find it annoying when you'll have an amazing wand and die before you get to use it or when I'm stuck in the first couple areas because I'm not playing my best. I get that it's a design choice, but to me it doesn't make sense to have the majority of players not ever see anything past the first 60% of levels. 

Yes, I can use the CheatGUI to get more health and see more of the game, but it's not the same. I get that eventually I'll get a good run but after two hours of being in the first few levels I just wanna quit because I want to do wand building, instead of collecting all the items and gold from the first level, over and over again.

The more I play, the more this rings true. I like difficult games but I guess I don't like difficult games that give you the feeling of making absolutely no progress after playing for hours. Games aren't supposed to always be about progress but when you consistently are stuck in the first half of the areas, it starts to be frustrating more than fun. Seems like I'm dying right as I get to the good part. 

Edit: As solutions I think an optional, somewhat limited(or not!) progress system would help. Other than that, maybe wands in earlier levels should have a bit more spell variety so you get to try stuff out.

[b]*Updated Review, 800 in-game hours later*[/b]
It is safe to say this is my favorite game of all time. I don't put that lightly. I will tag any potential spoilers - this game has soooo many secrets and hidden mechanics. The biggest issue Noita has is that its main mechanic, spellcrafting, is not explained to the player at all. While this is the only complaint I have, I also love and respect the decision to have the entire world - mechanics and all - be completely unknown at first. It is what makes this game so addictive as you uncover how huge and mysterious this world is. The amount of [i]things[/i] to learn feels damn near unlimited. And like any good roguelike, you are rewarded for breaking the game.

[b]The physics engine[/b] is primarily what drew me in and is still my favorite aspect. The ""Every single pixel is simulated"" concept is perfectly executed here with each pixel having a bunch of properties which in makes the world feel truly alive. Is it a soft material like dirt, or hard like steel? Is it flammable like wood, or fireproof like glass? Is it a liquid? A gas? Can it absorb explosions? Does it evaporate? If you look closely, you'll notice materials like metal will get rusty if water has been touching it. Try walking around and paying attention to the environment to see what sorts of unscripted events happen. I have countless memories of sitting back and watching a hilarious chain of events play out as if Noita was my own personal Rube Goldberg machine. For example, game starts > kick a mine cart down the entrance > knocks over a torch > catches a wooden floor on fire > floor burns away, oil barrel on top falls > barrel absolutely CRUSHES a nest of spiders (yay gold! [spoiler]2x bonus gold because it was an environmental kill![/spoiler]) > aforementioned fire has spread to a pile of coal > catches giant eyeball on fire > giant eyeball freaks out and searches for water > does not find water > explodes upon death, sending acid flying > acid touches the spider-crushing oil barrel > it explodes > I lose a huge chunk of health and catch on fire because I was collecting the spider nest gold. This type of thing plays out constantly and it can be pure chaos but it is such a great part of this game.

[b]Alchemy[/b] is built into the game so incredibly well that you don't even realize you're doing it. Day 0 alchemy lesson: Fire + Water = Steam. Day 1 alchemy lesson: [spoiler]pour some water from your flask into a pool of toxic sludge, it'll turn the whole pool into water[/spoiler]. I'm brushing over system, but it's so satisfying seeing all the different kinds of reactions, there are a ton to discover.

[b]Spellcrafting[/b] is the bread and butter of the game. I'm doing it a disservice by not putting it first in this gigantic wall of text. You will always come across some new combination of spells that make your jaw drop. I am going to describe the gist of building a wand to get you started, but it can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. There are a ton of great guides out there, 95% of my Noita knowledge comes from DunkOrSlam.
[spoiler]You can modify any wand at a Holy Mountain. That's the place with the healing and the perks in between the levels.
First, There are [i]spells[/i]. These include things like Spark Bolt, Magic Arrow, Bouncing Burst, Bomb. A few spells have versions of themselves with a trigger, like Spark Bolt With Trigger. This will cast another spell after the initial spell hits something.
Also, there are [i]spell modifiers[/i] like Electric Charge, Damage Plus, Triple Spell.
When inspecting your wand from your inventory, it will either say Shuffle: Yes or Shuffle: No. in its description. [b]This is the key to understanding spellcrafting[/b]. If your wand is a shuffler (Shuffle: Yes), then every time you fire the wand, it will pick from all of the spells inside that wand and it will shoot one at random. If your wand is a nonshuffler (Shuffle: No), when you fire, it will shoot the left-most spell in the wand. When you shoot again, it'll go to the 2nd spell, and so forth.
Combining all of these ideas, a wand you could put together with common materials found in the world is: A nonshuffler with, say, 5 spell slots. Starting from the left, the wand slots have the following spells and modifiers: [u]Spark Bolt with Trigger[/u] (spell), [u]Fire Trail[/u] (modifier), [u]Double Spell[/u] (modifier), [u]Bouncing Burst[/u] (spell), [u]Bouncing Burst[/u] (spell). Every time you shoot this wand, a purple bolt will fire out. When that bolt hits anything, it will release 2 bouncing green balls which on are also fire. If we took the Fire Trail and moved it all the way to the left, now what would happen would be: A flaming purple bolt will shoot out of the wand, and when that flaming bolt hits anything, 2 (non-flaming) green bouncing balls will be summoned. Where the Flame Trail effect happens depends on where the modifier is in that chain of spells. It can be super confusing at first but just try moving things around and shooting the wand. [i]Experimentation is what Noita is all about[/i]. A very fun and easy build to try out is to slap the Homing Projectile modifier onto the Rock spell. You really can create ANY type of wand you can imagine. I have made world-deleting wands, ones that lag my computer so hard the game gets 1 frame per 10 seconds, and some that have so much recoil and explosions that my character looks like a rocket taking off into space without ever touching the jump button[/spoiler].

[b]The artstyle[/b] is absolutely perfect in my opinion. I am a huge sucker for well-done pixellated art, but this is another level of detail. The more you explore, the more immersed you get.

[b]The music[/b] is so good that I tracked down the band (shoutout to From Grotto) online and threw them a bunch of money out of pure appreciation for their work.

[b]The lore[/b] is very deep but seriously well hidden. You'll never piece it all together yourself unless you are a die-hard player. I am only just scratching the surface of the lore of this world, I know that sounds hard to believe with so many hours played but it is true.

[b]The perks[/b] add yet another layer of replayability as you learn how they interact with different spells and environments. They are one of my favorite parts of the game and are a big reason I keep coming back. [spoiler]Perks can often stack with themselves... so imagine what it looks like if you figure out a way to get 10 instances of the More Blood perk for example. Your world would quickly be flooded with blood as creatures from different factions fight each other. Now think about if you snagged a Vampirism perk, now you have infinite healing which is a hell of a luxury in this game. You're still gonna die, but you'll at least feel safer for a little while[/spoiler].

[b]The community[/b] is actually a huge bonus for this game. The modding scene is great (the modders are so good that you can now play Noita multiplayer) and the people that frequent the subreddit, Twitch, Discord etc tend to be super nice and helpful.

And ultimately, [b]the difficulty[/b] is the icing on the cake. It will make you sit in silence, mouth agape, as you stare at where your corpse [i]should be[/i] after some stupid mountain man picked up [spoiler]an always-cast Nuke wand[/spoiler] and deleted you both from existence.

Nolla games have recently come back and started adding even more free content to the game after years of it being a finished product. I cannot thank these devs enough for creating such a masterpiece.

The game is ridiculously difficult and I recommend installing mods which make the game easier, such as the health pack mod and more immunities.

Without mods like it, playing without savescumming, you will likely never see new game plus, let alone the good ending.

THE CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE

The game (sort of?) portrays magic. Sorcery in real life is a sin. However, I don't think this is really portraying sorcery. Magic in real life isn't like in this game.

If you found a stick on the ground which could shoot lasers, you probably wouldn't call it sorcery, you'd call it awesome.

If you do believe that the portrayal of magic in this game is akin to real life sorcery (I disagree) then see my review of Fallout New Vegas for more on ""Should video games allow the player to roleplay an evil character?""",1663892716,1687065993,True,1,0,0.50437319278717041,0,True,False,False

Well, this is a procedurally generated roguelike,  about being a wizard, with a falling sand style physics engine.

Dicking around combining spell effects is the bread and butter of the game.
Try not to blow yourself up, some spell combinations are very volatile.
It is also very hard, as befits it's roguelike heritage.

Edit:
After a year and a half of playing, this has become one of my favorite games of all time. The depth of the wand crafting is truly unlike anything I've ever seen in another game. So much room for creativity.

Be warned, the game makes no effort to explain itself to players. While a player can definitely come to understand some of the basic mechanics from experimenting and messing around in the world, the vast majority of this game (MANY wand/spell mechanics, bosses, secrets, hidden locations, parallel dimensions) will only be accessible to people to who search for guides or watch streamers discuss how to access this content. I didn't like that at first, but the trick is that even when you know all the theory, reaching and achieving this content in a normal run is still a massive challenge and makes the game really fun.

Learning Noita is almost like learning how to ride a bicycle. Almost...
While doing the latter, the chance of offing yourself using your own healing bolt (yep) is much lower ...

...And there are no green-skinned jetpack fuckers picking up a wand that casts bouncy nukes and firing it (I survived, half of the biome didn't).

But once you learn the hows and whys, the dos and don'ts you can gain all the knowledge and become the ultimate shadow wizard of money.

The game is too unfair. Even if I have good perks and wands, the worlds generated situations will not give me chance to succeed. So many restrictions in sence of view and action and abundance of tough enemies without proper 'weapons' to fight them on first 3 locations, it's only time when you will close the game in rage of any kind. Yes, the opportunity to get overpowered items for 15-60 min is available, but it easily can be wiped in minutes on levels.
I've been teached by DS series to overcome the challange. But it's not mean you cannot say that game is good or bad balanced.

Disclaimer: Below might have a few spoilers but hopefully not much.

Edit: After playing this game for 10 more hours or so I feel qualified enough to say that this game is one of the most fun and most infuriating experiences you can have in your life. To expand on that I have a story for you, to start I got a wand of short teleport and I got a matter eater wand basically making the whole game world easy to get to. HOWEVER after 3 hours of play I get a nuke wand and I forgot that I had glass cannon and decided to shoot an enemy causing the entire ice level to disintegrate instantly, luckily I had an extra life but I died anyway due to me falling down into lava after the explosion, which made me stop playing the game for about 2 months. On another note I really like this games use of magic and how the wand building system works, using mana to fuel spells you can effectively build any spell you want with enough time and modifiers. Along with the magic system I really like the world of Noita and i'm not just talking about the lore. The level design is really interesting because normally in rouge likes you move from one level to the next sometimes going to a sub level like in Enter The Gungeon with the abbey of the true gun while in Noita you can (with the right spells or equipment) move between the levels and sub levels and in doing so get better spells and equipment. This wouldn't be a review without talking about what I feel are bad parts about the game so im going to begin with the difficulty. Noita is a hard game enemies can kill you instantly, you can kill you instantly, and even singular pixels can kill you which makes the game more interesting and fulfilling but for people that don't play games every often this game is almost impossible for them to beat and strait-up impossible for them to get to the ""late game"" which is very hard for even experienced players. Me as an example I would say that I am a competent gamer but after 32 hours I have only beat the game twice and gotten to one parallel world. The only other thing I would say makes the game less fun for some people is the problem of the lore of the game being La Mulania levels of cryptic and the problem of having to remembering the map layout and the positions of things without a map (or at least a good one) can put a real dampener on the experience, it almost makes me want a easy mode or something similar to be able to find the lore and have a bit more of a sandbox experience without resorting to mods. To sum it all up Noita is a interesting game with basically limitless potential for fun and it is very rewarding when you beat the game or get far into the game and complete self set challenges. On the other hand Noita can be a grueling experience with its difficulty and it has virtually no hand holding making newer players have a really hard time experiencing the fun parts about the game. To finish I feel that Noita deserves the score of ""The amount of times I wondered 'is this going to kill me?' shortly before it kills me/ The amount of skittles I can eat in a hour before dying of hyperglycemia"".",1637200694,1686348284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★ 5/5

Do you crave magical mayhem? Have you ever wanted to feel like an all-powerful wizard one moment, only to be doused by your own acid rain the next? Then buckle up, friends, because ""Noita"" has got you covered.

""Noita"" is a roguelike that's less 'cuddly companion on a cozy journey' and more 'sadistic teacher chuckling in the corner as you repeatedly fail your alchemy finals'. Every pixel in this game is simulated, which at first sounded like a cool techy brag to me. But no, it's their way of saying, ""We've meticulously crafted this world just so you can blow it up in the most spectacularly unexpected ways.""

The environments in ""Noita"" aren't just for show, they're the bread and butter of your survival (and often the cause of your hilarious downfall). Get caught in a fire? Better find some water to dive into - unless, of course, you've just turned that water into a deadly pool of acid with a miscast spell. Oops!

Oh, and let's talk about the wands. These magical tools aren't your run-of-the-mill point-and-shoot affairs. No, they're customizable masterpieces waiting to blow up in your face. Want to mix bouncing bombs with chainsaws that spit lightning? Go ahead. Will you annihilate your enemies, or zap yourself into a roast wizard dinner? Only one way to find out!

The game is tough. And by tough, I mean I've had an easier time assembling IKEA furniture without the manual. Yet, each demise is a lesson (often in what NOT to do), and you'll find yourself coming back, eager to test your newfound wisdom.

The pixel graphics are charmingly simple, and the ambient music is fantastic, providing a soothing counterpoint to the countless times you'll scream, ""That's not what I meant to do!"" at your screen.

So, if you've ever wanted to feel like a powerful wizard and the world's biggest magical klutz all at once, ""Noita"" is your game. It's an unforgiving crash course in spellcasting survival, where the only predictable element is your unpredictably spectacular demise.

If this review tickled your funny bone or you can relate to my magical blunders, feel free to give it a thumbs-up. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go die in a self-inflicted fire... again. Happy gaming!",1686096492,1686096492,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

     here is what u can expect from noita:
you explore, find good wands with good stats, use potions for buffs, collect health containers, kill enemies to get their gold, and try to find spells to build a super powerful wand that can insta-kill anything (including urself; if u like playing with damaging spells like knives). 

you'll occasionally find secrets some pretty minor and trivial and others hint to the games larger story. the story of noita is up to interpretation, from what i hear it's mostly based on finnish mythology, bird lays three eggs that represent elements or some shit, something to do with a goddess or something, i dunno not gonna even pretend to understand, but i do like game stories that leave it to the player to decide what is happening by providing them hints in the environment. my personal 'head cannon' is that mina is a greedy purple worm that wants to destroy everything in the world by changing it to gold.

noita imo is best played as a sandbox game, just fuck around and chill, enjoy the pixel simulations and blow and burn shit up, mod it up to the point where its unrecognizable, hell learn how to code and make mods for urself. 
the only problem i have with noita is the water lol. i feel like it needed more SPLASH, and when u slowly interact with water, it doesn't provide a reaction :( also when u simultaneously hold down the left and right movement keys the player doesnt stand still, i find it annoying personally, and i wish they just fix it already.

Rest assured that nothing in this game comes close to the destructive force of Minä - yourself. There is no hazardous material as potent, no enemy as difficult, no boss as disgustingly overtuned as your own personal flaws. It is quite liberating to know that no matter what the game throws at you, it can't ever be worse. Curious, but not cautious? Impatient? Just that one spell in an unpleasant area, but your HP bar says 200 - you can absolutely take this, right? Feeling tired? Missed a tap on your keyboard when switching wands, didn't check twice? You will fail so many runs it will not even be funny.

But failing also helps you learn, and honestly there is so much in Noita you can figure out. And the more you learn, the more you can appreciate all the little quirks and nods. The more alive the world feels after exploring it dozens of times over. Knowledge helps offset even the RNG when it comes to loot or enemy generation. You might even keep going against a run with horrible starting drops, just to test how far you go through perseverance - though spite is just as strong when it comes to motivation.

So take a plunge into forgotten depths of the soil. Clear a paradoxical jungle, far below where rays of the Sun can reach. Swim in gold, fly to the Moon and back, turn an enormous lake into liquid energy and drink it all. Find creatures and structures even the deities won't touch.

Its a painful slog through the mud and muck. If you think youre willing to smash your head against a wall until one of you breaks, then thats the choice you get. Not sure if I can play much more of this myself tho.

Jokes aside, this is Noita. Noita is an extremely brutal and difficult roguelike that is kinda like Spelunky, but also not Spelunky in any way except for the part where you descend to multiple areas and biomes.

Story: Long story short, you're a wizard/mage in search for the treasure or artifact at the bottom the mountain and the orcs want to stop you or something like that.

Game: In this brutal roguelike, patience is key. If you're not a patient player, then you probably won't succeed very well in this game. This game is full of surprises. Even after beating the game, you'll still find more and more new things. For the patience aspect of this game, it's exploring and experimenting. There are multiple areas in the game, some hidden from the naked eye, some on the path to the bottom of the mountain. You can experiment with wands at the holy mountain and buy spells/wands there. They all have different results when you apply certain spells to certain wands, all wand stats being randomly generated. Rushing through the game to get to the end will result in your failure.

Enemies: You will find that everything wants to kill you in this game. From creatures, to orcs with machinery, to mages using spells. The game goes on even without you being in the area. Meaning that they fight among themselves.

Brutal gameplay: Every single pixel makes a difference in this game, making it brutal. Don't know what I mean by that? Take liquids for instance. You step on a pixel of acid. Just a small little pixel. Harmless, right? Nope. Even just one pixel of acid can stain and deal damage. This includes fire and other various liquids. But the pixels are not the only brutal crap. In fact, you can die to some really stupid bs. From electric shocks, to explosions, to some creatures causing electricity and the player getting absolutely stunned from it and most likely murdered, or being combo'd to death by melee.

Patience reward: There are other areas besides the mountain. If you can find a way to get to those said areas, you'll be rewarded, but you'll still be asking more questions mostly. Like ""I got past the tree and found a new area. Never seen this before."", making you want to explore a lot more and experiment with the new areas. Some of the exploration CAN take time. A lot depending on where you're exploring. You're not just rewarded for exploring and taking the time to experiment. You are also rewarded for going slow down the mountain as there is no time limit. Some of the rewards include: Extra HP, wands, gold, survival, etc.

Noita, the captivating and chaotic game developed by Nolla Games, is a mesmerizing experience that puts players in the shoes of a powerful sorcerer exploring a procedurally generated world. With its unique blend of spellcasting mechanics, emergent gameplay, and stunning pixel art, Noita offers a refreshingly unpredictable and endlessly entertaining adventure.

At the heart of Noita lies its spellcasting system, which allows players to combine different elements to create a vast array of spells. From launching explosive fireballs to summoning deadly acid rain, the possibilities are almost limitless. Experimentation is key, as each wand you discover holds the potential for new and surprising spell combinations. The joy of stumbling upon a powerful spell combination and wreaking havoc upon the world is unparalleled.

One of the game's standout features is its physics simulation, which permeates every aspect of gameplay. The environment is fully interactive, and each pixel has its own unique properties. Casting a fire spell can set nearby flammable objects ablaze, creating a chain reaction that can lead to catastrophic consequences. This dynamic environment adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, making each playthrough feel unique and unpredictable.

Noita's pixel art style is nothing short of breathtaking. The game is a visual feast, with intricate details and stunning particle effects bringing the world to life. The environments are beautifully crafted, ranging from dark and treacherous caverns to vast, open underground lakes. The attention to detail in the pixel art is commendable, and the art style perfectly complements the game's chaotic nature.

The game's difficulty is worth mentioning, as Noita is not for the faint of heart. Permadeath is a constant companion, and every step forward can be met with danger at every turn. While this level of difficulty can be frustrating at times, it also adds to the thrill and sense of accomplishment when you finally overcome the challenges. The learning curve can be steep, but it rewards perseverance and experimentation.

However, despite its numerous strengths, Noita does have a few shortcomings. The lack of a clear overarching objective or narrative may deter some players who prefer a more structured experience. The game's reliance on procedural generation can also lead to occasional inconsistencies in level design, resulting in frustrating moments. Additionally, some may find the controls to be a bit clunky, especially when trying to navigate through tight spaces or during intense combat situations.

Noita is a game that thrives on the unexpected. Its spellcasting system, interactive environment, and beautiful pixel art create an immersive and addictive experience. While it may not appeal to everyone, those willing to embrace the chaos will find themselves engrossed in a world of magic and mayhem. If you have a penchant for exploration, experimentation, and the thrill of the unknown, Noita is a must-play game that will keep you coming back for more.",1685566330,1685566330,True,25,1,0.726244032382965088,0,True,False,False

combat is frantic and dynamic. explosives can be detonated and structures dropped to do damage to foes, their attacks are also simulated projectiles that can be avoided, though they will attack from offscreen. lower levels increase the insanity, 

exploring will find you more powerful wands, otherwise you can modify the ones you have with speels acquired from shops inbetween stages. every wand has some slots to add spells to them so you can freely mix up your loadouts and see what works best, though you can only do this in the inbetween sections and not inside the dungeons so if you find your loadout is a bit crap, then your stuck with those wands that'll probably get you killed via an explosive chain reaction.

also i'm gonna say for exploration that it pays off to look around instead of just going down

This game is more frustration than fun. If you easily die from shooting at an enemy but you die because your firebolt is blocked by a single pixel, then it shouldnt be perma death. If the game requires you to practice deadly unknown spells and spell combos to find one that works then there should be a place you can do that where you can heal. If the game requires you to collect items to do those experiments then you should be able to cary more than 4. If the game relies on you manipulating the environment chemistry and physics to get an edge then it better be extremely accurate. The few times I got insanely lucky and got the perfect sequence of items to make super powerful weapons, I died the second I left the temple because a lamp got in the way.

The simulated physics serve as an amazing backdrop for some really neat experiences, and interacts with the spell crafting system wonderfully. The spell crafting itself is basically limitless, and there are always new ways to learn how to deal with enemies, or obliterate everything on the screen in one click, including yourself. 

This game is really hard, it's unfair, and you may die a (few) hundred times before getting a win, but some deaths are quick and you can just start right over, and learn from each one. And once you've finally won, you've still barely scratched the surface. 

Absolutely recommend it, just know that you will die. A lot. Mostly by your own hand.

While I suck at rouge-lit games and Noita is certainly no exception, the game has more details and nuance and special conditions than a 3000page non-disclosure agreement. Noita is also made beautiful by its complexity, the effect is similar to Minecraft in-that parts of its beauty and atmosphere seem almost like a side-effect of the world generating algorithm.

 I've noticed people bitching about Noita because of all the horribly unfair outcomes you can run into and because you can't just beat Noita by being skilled. Winning in Noita requires a bit of luck, a bit of skill, a bit of patience, a bit of caution, a bit of intelligence, familiarity with the game's mechanics and features, as well as a willingness to experiment and explore in the face of lost progress.

Good points:
- Great concept
- Pixel physics !
- Wand crafting
- Lots of content
- Map is huge and full of secrets
- Runs vey well (for the most part)
- Moddable
- Steam deck support (although playing with a controller is a no-no imo, see below)

Less good points:
- Ridiculously difficult, probably the most noob-unfriendly game I've ever played, makes Spelunky 2 look easy in comparison
- No tutorial, and everything is extremely cryptic,be prepared to read/watch hours of guides to understand anything
- You will keep getting killed by seemingly random things you can't even process for hours and hours
- You keep getting stuck in walls/floors/ceilings all the time, gets annoying quickly
- Some ennemy bullets are tiny and barely visible
- When you're new, it's often hard to tell the difference between the background and the actual level
- Forget about controller support, it's pretty much impossible to aim efficiently, you'll need mouse and keyboard if you want to have the slightest chance at making progress

Overall 8/10.

(at 30 fps)
most physics objects move incredibly slowly, wand firing stats are about 2x less effective (refreshing firing, cast delay), and your flight goes barely anywhere, but its up to you whether those drawbacks are worse than playing the game in slow motion, if your computer can't handle it.

regardless of that! its a very enjoyable game with indepth wand crafting mechanics, and an expansive world to discover, which, hard as it is, i'd say you should go in blind, for the best experience.

hard to say too much without spoiling anything, so go for it.

UPDATE: if you're experiencing slowdown, you can also go into config.xml and change the two settings called ""internal_size_h"" (or _w) to change the resolution in fullscreen. this might let you get slightly higher fps than the default resolutions and avoid the physics and wand alterations by limiting it to 30, at the cost of messing up the menus and hud. i'm unsure of how to fix this yet.",1674772628,1684636762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Noita is truly brutal. A good run can last several hours and you can die in seconds. But I keep coming back to it because it can give you an experience that nothing else can. A sense of exploration of not merely the world, but the very mechanics of magic itself.

When you play Noita, you're not there to win, or even to survive. Hell, most of the time you will kill yourself with your own magic, but for every step you learn something new, which will motivate you to persist.

But the best aspect is the magic. It is made from a few hundret building blocks that are easy to understand. But then emergent behaviour begins to kick in, and the logic of it all comes together to become a topic that can be Studied. This is a childhood fantasy for me, where I can finally unleash the abhorred creation of magic upon the Denizens who have brought torturous days upon me. Where I can seek deep truths of the great work through countless hours of study and willingness to sacrifice even my life for knowledge. Where with a keen mind the rumoured barriers of you world can be broken.

An entertaining introduction is Noita, a roguelike for the mentally deranged.

The game is too hard even for me, so I use Spell Labs, Glowing Hearts and Wand Dbg from the Steam Workshop. For those who don't want to invest hundreds of hours in this game, Dead Isn't Dead is a good option.

There are too many secrets to get that it would take so long to get them even with guides. The game also dosen't have a real tutorial behind it, they just expect you to learn most things by yourself (like small annoying things, my example being how add triggers work) The areas get significantly harder really fast while it gets harder and harder to get money since the enemies are way harder to kill.

The game is basically alot to unpack with no real indication of what to do, basically trial and error until end of time and I just can't see myself learning it.

Noita is a hardcore roguelike that the only progression is skill (I think). 
It is devastatingly beautiful, frustrating, rng heavy, precise, Power fantasy ridden journey.

There is no tutorial, no handholding, barely any direction, so you have to decide to figure the game out.

That is a tall ask for some, but I am taking the time to do it for the first time since I heard about this game years ago. 
It feels like taking a college course except every time you enter the classroom, The teacher is screaming, Theres 3 mutants and a floating firehead, acid is raining from the ceiling, and there is a pop quiz every day that kills you if you dont pass.

What this game does to the mind is a marvel to be behold. The way it pulls you in and keeps you in its tight grip. There is no escape when you're hooked. You feel it infecting your mind and getting tighter the more you struggle, and struggle you will. I've never gotten more competitive with myself in any other game but this one. This hellish rougelike. Always making me restart in quick succession like the wands I've made with the little hours I've played.
It very much is a skill issue. ""i shouldn't have done this"" ""maybe if i had avoid that"" ""i should've blown up that canister when i saw it"" ""i should've known gigasaw would've merc'd me like everything else"" ""had i been faster with the tele i would've escaped""

Cliff notes:
- Soundtrack 10/10 ""It's my favorite new album, and it comes with a great game too!""
- Fully destructible world with material reactions and effects is amazing. Incredible game engine.
- Massive world to explore, many bosses, and fabulous prizes.
- Wand crafting is fantastic. I'm still learning new, fun builds at 1600 hours played.
- I love the tablet. Fun skillshots, so handy. My favorite thing to do now is just clear the Mines with mainly the tablet. And invis+tablet is a fun run.
- Kicking is good fun too.
- High skill cap. I was reminded, things like the tablet and kicking are a lot of fun once you hone the skill.
Seeing how well you can do compared to how bad you were is pretty cool.

- Great lore. Great game design that accentuates the lore. Knowledge is a boon (and a curse).
- Huge reward for knowledge of the game, especially hidden mechanics.
- Even the replay gif maker is awesome. So many good highlights.

I made my initial review after ~9 hours, and now I'm at ~360 and this game has only gotten better and better since then. In my mind, it's up there with The Binding of Isaac as one of the best roguelites available and one of my favorite games of all time. If you end up picking up the game, don't give up. Don't be afraid to look at guides or get help from the Noita community because the game is an absolute meat-grinder until you've gotten Noita'd so many times that you start to figure out the ins and outs of the game.

Okay game - not bad but you can skip it or try on sale.
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: it is a good rogue like, some weird mix of Spelunky meets Terraria meets... any good procedural rogue like where you need to go deeper each time to get to the next level, while having breaks between each level to refill, buy stuff, etc. Design is smart and rich, art is colorul pixels everywhere... Good stuff. Sadly, the downside for me is the difficulty. My god this game is unforgiving. If you don't like dying because of a stupid unlucky conjunction of tough enemies, deadly poisonous/lava environment, lethal traps, and recharging/out of ammo weapons... and if you don't like the idea of ""well, I progressed that far, but now I have to start it all over again and anyway it will be a new procedurally generated level""... then you will end up like me, agreeing on the quality of the game all the while disagreeing with the harsh reset > repeat nature of it and wasting too much time on it... I can't do this anymore sadly. So, it might be a B or even a A from me if I was 15 again and had all my life ahead of me, OR if there was a coop mode that gave me more incentive to push and try more... If you have the time, enjoy.

after youve learned how spell wrapping works, it can be hard to break the habit of just defaulting to the same busted wand build every time you get the spells available for it. but this is supplemented by the occasional wand you find with a spell built into it thats cast each time for free. sometimes this can give you infinite, high level spells (like Giant Magic Missile) earlier than they would appear normally on wands in the wild. so the randomness does help prevent gameplay from getting stale too quickly

music is *PLATINUM* tier. excellent instrument choice and the drums in every piece are top notch. if you play with no sound/music muted, youre missing out BIG TIME

enemy and environment design are also wonderful. once you master projectile timing, paths, and enemy behaviors, the bullet hell aspect of the game can be a lot of fun. especially if you were lucky enough to get some fun wand combinations in your arsenal.

In Noita's simulated pixel perfection, explosions tear holes in the environment very satisfyingly. Fire spreads, liquids flow and spill, heavy rocks fall and crush. Noita feels like a unique experience and development achievement purely on the basis of the depth of its environment simulation. And when you add in a magic spell and wand construction system that is equally deep, surprisingly complex, and incredibly rewarding - you find an unending variety of gameplay. That's not even mentioning magical potions, hidden secrets, a sprawling world(s) map, and lore and objectives that even after 600 hours I'm still uncovering.

If I had to level a criticism at the game, it would be that it is brutally unforgiving. Most play sessions end abruptly with the player's violent death. But it feels like the majority of the time that's due to of having severely underestimated the destructive power of a newly-created wand, so it's probably not fair to complain.

Incredibly addicting and I adore the fact that a run is exactly as long as you could want it to be. Either 30 minutes or several months long (though the latter gets problematic because of the data saved, so environmental glitches such as some areas missing do occur. Luckily, these areas are seemingly always optional and of low-importance, so it's not much of an issue). 

Noita allows you to make and customize your own weapons in a menu that is very easy to understand. 
It has a colossal variety of different spells that can be combined in an incalculable amount of ways. Even the weakest spells have special traits that could be incredibly useful depending on what you find. Noita rewards exploration, caution and, in general, knowledge of how things work and what does what. Experimenting is incredibly entertaining. Especially when you find a nice combination of spells. 

The difficult tag is no lie for sure. Everything in Noita is skill-based to the players level. There is nothing useful you can bring into different runs other than what you learnt (which is most often something you died to). It can be frustrating at times, but I am always drawn back to it because of the freedom in how you decide the game to be played. Every time I play it I always find some new interesting thing.

One really fun thing in the game is setting stuff on fire, or creating enormous explosions, as the engine allows it to be very accurate and incredibly beautiful. But the best moments are when you kill a powerful enemy with a freshly modified wand.

Two ways to play this i think, and two stages to it.
1. Play slow and experiment like your life depends on it (because it is). its the only way to within the game to understand enough to actually move forward. Its one of the most unique experiences you can ask for in a game.
2. learn shit from the internet and play it like its a rougelike, even as such its still my favorite.

I give this game a positive review because I did have some fun (plus a lot of frustration) for 77 hours and I consider that I got my money back. For the record, I spend 77 hours in this game, about 20 hours of this using Respawn mod and did n't even manage to see the first boss.

Have never played a harder game. Combined with the fact that it has perma-death it is ridiculous, truly. It may be fun to begin with, you spend 10-20 minutes on a run , you die , you learn something and hopefully do a little better next time. This ""learning process"" works well for the first 2-3 levels. 

But as you get better and carefully manage your way deeper, spending 3-4 hours or more  exploring and collecting wands/spells/perks, when you then die and you get to lose all your progress and have to do everything from scratch again and again and again, it just becomes a tedious chore.

Stranger yet, I played two more games after that, one ended in tears, and the other, was my second victory! Both the victories were earned by playing the game the long way, exploring and fighting my way through everything the areas had to offer, getting the best wands, all the health boosts and the best items, combining my ingenious killer wands, energy spheres bursting into 900 damage worth of scrap projectiles and rapidfiring precision lasers and whatnot, but the real noteworthy experience was the confidence-fueled game between those two wins, where tangled up in my crafty bullshit I misplaced two adjacent spells in the wrong order.  My wand of supreme domination, that which was equipped with a trigger spitter bolt meant to lob my hollow egg loaded up with six omnidirectionally aimed lightning bolts had become inverted, where my egg now contained the spitter bolt, that would then at the end of its lifespan, deliver the spicy payload. It just so happens that the eggs are subject to gravity, but the spitter bolts, not so much. So freshly out of the holy mountain, I go down to the hiisi-base, aim to fire my spitter bolt through a gap in the steel and the snow, and whoop, what do you know, out comes an egg that just so barely scrapes the edge of the snow, cracks open, and hurls the spitter bolt of Ragnarok right at my now frozen pale likeness, proceeds to unfold and electrocutes me for 200 damage. Stunned, I fall into a pool of polymorphine, where I then reduced from god to sheep, get domed by a lone kranuhiisi and am promptly sent outdoors to get my daily exercise like I was supposed to, anyway.

Noita presents real innovation in both technical execution and game design.

Except, while they tease you with them constantly, and you may have a very clear way to them, they are incredibly fickle, and often throw not only a wrench in the works, but a whole damn tool box - sometimes both metaphorically and literally.

You can finish the game faster, some people have done it in less the five minutes. The world however is massive and finding all the hidden places is fun. Building your own wand to shoot/dig your way threw the world is always different as well as the layout of each place. With the 8-bit Dark Souls vibe and endless replay value i can't see myself stopping.

Sometimes you can blow up the entire level, and sometimes you get instakilled by a stealth propane tank. Sometimes you're solving huge mysteries that unfold into a game around ten times bigger than what you think you're getting, and sometimes you're walking for 10 minutes through a completely empty desert just to get a little more health. Sometimes you're using the game's ridiculously deep wandbuilding system to create a wand from hell that does 5 *quintillion* damage per second (yes, and without any glitches), and sometimes you're crawling through midgame levels with your starter wand because you never found any good wands.

This is a game only for people who are mentally prepared for it. If you like putting yourself through pain to succeed, you'll love this game. Even if you don't, you might still like it. You can tune the game to your liking if you're not so masochistic. Unless you eat nails for breakfast, I'd recommend playing with the ""Peace With Gods"" mod, to avoid getting endgame enemies shoved in your face on the first floor to punish you for something you didn't even do (damn worms). Just don't be one of those people who uses seed tool to find their lively concoction and alchemic precursor recipes and acts like it's not cheating. Most people won't be able to solve most of the game's puzzles alone, but playing this game with no guide is an experience you can't get from anything else these days. This game is like what you thought videogames were when you were a kid, like using strength on the truck to find Mew.

That is the biggest flaw of this game that makes it extremely hard to enjoy it for honestly about 80% of the game.

After that? It's a breeze and very fun.

But those 20% of really fun time vs 80% of absolutely not fun time makes me give this a bad rating.

I personally think the game would profit from more lore-oriented pieces of information that could give tips on how to tackle the world.
Preferably, you could access that information in safe hubs so you can contemplate in peace and form a plan.

Otherwise it's just learn by dying. And once you've died 1000 times, you will maybe get to the ""end"" of the game. But that doesn't sound fun, doesn't it?

The game element is great, The idea of the game is good.
But ! , the game is stupidly extra super difficult, you think i am exaggerate ? then hear me out.
The game is supposed to be ""roguelite"" but dying doesn't give you any improvement or anything that make your next try any easier.

AND , you DO NOT get any healing restore during the level what makes any damage you take feel more punishing.

AND , killing enemies does not give you any important thing, just 10-30 gold ""which is almost useless"" , which makes fighting more enemies make you take more damage for little gold, meaning fighting less makes your win chance better ?

Because of that, i tried A LOT of time and i didn't even finished the third level.

So ? , to prove my point, i played a run where i didn't fight ANY enemy unless i really have to, picked items to make me invisible, and in my first try, i almost finished ALL the game, got every achievement but one, and that is terrible, i don't want to run away from enemies, if i want that i'll play ""subway"" , i want to interact with the game element, i want to fight enemies, try new weapons, fight bosses,,, but you made it impossible to.

A lot of Rogue-like games are some of my favorites of all time because they're easy to pick up, but incredibly tough to master, Noita on the other hand tells you nothing at all, no tutorial or anything. At first glance that might seem like a smart approach, after all plenty of games have players learn with experience, but this is way too complicated for players to easily learn. I've had to look up stuff WAY MORE than I had to with any other game, especially wandbuilding tutorials, which is something that the game should teach you itself considering it's your main source of damage. Combined with how unforgiving the game is and the presence of Spelunky's ""Sometimes the game just decides you die"" gimmick, with 30 hours behind me, I still haven't escaped the part of every Rogue-like's playthrough where the game feels frustrating to play. This kinda sucks, because as I look online, I see how satisfying successful wandbuilding can be, how fun the world is to explore, how many secrets there are to uncover, but the game requires you to master mechanics that it never teaches you before you can even do any of this. There was a moment, in one of my recent runs, where I realised that not only did I not know what I was doing, but that I was also not having fun and that absolutely saddens me, because this definitely looked like a game I'd enjoy and grind out. The music is really good, the artstyle and physics are very satisfying, the controls are fluid...

Otherwise, the different particles are basically different ways to have something catch on fire. Sometimes this means you'll just burn to death, sometimes it means poison vapor will kill you, sometimes it means oil will explode. Often times these things will happen regardless of your own actions. Ultimately the RNG in this game isn't just with the procedural map generation and enemy placement, but whether or not you get any kind of functional wand, potion, or perks. Runs will come to a dead stop because the game decided this one, this one you just don't get to win. It's why all these reviews talk about death. That might be good in Dark Souls where the game is complex and fun, not so much when everything is just random. Because you have so little control, it encourages hyper conservative gameplay that I just don't have the patience for given how boring the Terreria-esque combat stays.

Step 1
Make the custard: In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well combined. Whisk in cornstarch and salt. In a slow, steady stream, whisk in milk and then the cream. Add butter. Cook mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, just until it starts to thicken. Immediately whisk mixture until smooth, then continue to cook and stir custard until it has come to a very low boil for 2 minutes, about 6 to 8 minutes total. Strain custard through a fine mesh sieve into a small bowl, pushing it through with a small spatula. Stir in vanilla. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic directly onto the surface. Chill for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours.

Step 2
Prepare the cake: Heat oven to 325 degrees. Butter a 9-by-2-inch round baking pan, generously greasing the sides, and line it with parchment paper. Butter parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.

Step 3
In a small saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a simmer over medium heat. When the butter is melted, remove pan from heat. In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until pale and thick, about 4 to 6 minutes. With the mixer running on low, add the milk mixture and beat until combined. Then add flour mixture and vanilla and beat until combined.

Step 4
Transfer batter to the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.

Step 5
Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes. With a very thin knife, cut around the edge to release the cake from the side of the pan. Carefully flip the cake onto the rack, then turn it right-side-up to cool completely.

Step 6
Assemble the cake: Using a serrated knife, carefully cut the cake into two layers and place the bottom layer on a serving plate. Stir custard, and spread it onto the cut side of the bottom half. Replace the top half of the cake, cut side down.

Step 7
Prepare the glaze: In a small saucepan over medium-low, heat the cream to a simmer. Remove the pot from the heat and pour cream over the chocolate chips, oil, salt and let stand for 3 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Spread the glaze evenly over the top of the cake.

INGREDIENTS
Yield: 10 servings

For the Custard
3 large egg yolks 
½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar 
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
Pinch kosher salt 
1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk

The good- building powerful wands can be fun
The bad- everything else. Enemies with blood that hurts you spraying blood everywhere on screen because all the starting wands do slice damage and if a single drop of that blood hits you, and you don't have water handy, you're going to be taking damage for a good five minutes. Those same enemies often spawn blood where they were killed, several seconds after dying and falling away from that spot. Every starting wand takes multiple hits to kill enemies that are fast, perfectly accurate, and can kill you in one to two hits. Healing is only available when you don't need it, unless you get super extremely lucky with spells you find. Any spell that can kill enemies in less than five hits will also do massive damage to you, usually killing you instantly. Some spells that are absolutely useless for anything but digging can take an hour to dig through a single pixel. Enemies can juggle you in the air, chain stunning you until you die. Gold can spawn far above enemies if they're close to a ceiling, making it unobtainable. Worms can dig through the safe areas and spawn a super powerful mini-boss type of enemy right after the first stage, and this isn't an uncommon occurrence. Some spells can cause you damage without even using the wand, they just damage you passively by holding the wand in certain situations, often killing you in milliseconds. There are a ton of secrets in the game, that require hours of research outside of game to even figure out the first steps for. I don't buy a game because I want to spend hours not playing the game just to start playing it. 

This game could be amazing, if it wasn't focused on difficulty over challenge. As it is, it's just another in a long line of games that think pissing people off means the game is good. One in five hundred runs, you're going to find a wand and spells worth using. Basically if you buy this game, you're paying for one minute of fun for every ten days of frustration. If this game was free it wouldn't be worth the price.",1626447294,1681058218,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It isn't fair a lot of the time, it'll punish you with insta-death in some cases. But most deaths in the game are there to teach you just a bit more about how magic works in this game (and therefore, how YOU can use it to your advantage). This game does a fantastic job of making magic really feel like you're actually playing with forces beyond your capability. But what becomes intoxicating is when you really start to learn how to use it to turn yourself into a literal god.
