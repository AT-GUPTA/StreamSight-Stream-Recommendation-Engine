Steam Market closed (was closed short before takeover, they didnt open it again), ingame Market horrible, they raised the prices beyond good and evil for items nobody care about and chances to get them beneith criticism.
they removed sprays and cards etc for whatever reason. events are copied from years above but rewards are devalued as hell.
im really patience and im sure everyone should get a second bite at the cherry, but every update, things  getting worse.^

the key scene: a clan or friends cannot play together anymore!! you arent able to play with 5 together in competitive anymore, you stuck in quick match demolition waiting and never get a game (guys are moaning in global ingame chat too), cannot abort, you have to close the game via task manager to get out of this loop... clan matches are hard to get, there are mb 2 in queue if you are lucky. someone is spamming ddos attack in chat and (EU) servers arent playable. in team deathmatch there are strange things ongoing, players lagging more and more.

i rare write negative reviews, VALOFE help to reversal my/our opinion and dont buy games to let them die!

Black Squad was the funniest game and the best alternative fps after other ones like we all played together till the end.

Conclusion: never was and still is neither p2p nor p2w, but actually l2p (luck 2 play^^) and p2m4fb (pay too much for fancy bullshit)?!!!!!!

after over 1900 hours of gameplay: R.I.P BS, VALOFE DELIVER!!!!
i would really appreciate it if you convince us of the contrary!

If you end up playing this game understand one thing about it. 1 Hackers are allowed to roam freely in this game infact the dms prefer it that way so their so called partners look better then anyone in the game. If you speak out against them you will be banned I have spent a lot of money in this game and what I got was the F U button for speaking out on one of their so called partners.

Here is my review, the Black Squad Devs are money leeches, i tried 4 random boxes and i emptied all of them and NOT 1 box gave me the colored gun, they say is there, but it ain't, also we are having a lot of hackers and the Devs don't even care, now the way the whole CLAN thing is setup is a total WAIST of time, you can't even chat withiin your own clan, because that don't have a chatbox within the clan, there is no way to do anything in this game, it's like youi are their prisoner, and when they say jump. you say how high, well i say good fucken bye.
The score out of 10? i would give it a 3, the game is all about them making money of you, and when you need to get somethings, most of it is TIME LIMITED, I lost already $100 AUD and you will too.",1502280878,1502280878,False,10,9,0.425099045038223267,6,True,False,True

I bought the founders pack going into this game not knowing how it plays or feels.
I can say that was a very good desicion. This game is very good, so smooth, so easy to get into.
It feels like CS:GO and Call of Duty had a baby, thats Free to play. All weapons seem balanced, and are overpowered only in 1 way and always has a trade off. 
So far the player base is at the moment a bit too easy, and every once in a while you'll come across decent players. Its really competitive, and addicting.
