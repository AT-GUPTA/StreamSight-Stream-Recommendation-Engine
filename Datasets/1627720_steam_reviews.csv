But I'm happy with the small balance change so keep it up devs. No the game is still difficult so don't worry souls elitists. Also managed to get all achivements. So overall I can recommend the game. It's the best souls like out there, which is not from FS.

After two playthroughs, I understood, why I struggled in some parts. You have to be patience and don't buttom smash like ZUG ZUG ME SMASH. I'm now enjoying the game far more after some small changes of my playstyle. The machanically part of the game is not perfect but you get used to once you understand it.
I had some improvements I wanted to see in the game and I felt like the devs heard me with the respec system being locked away after CV. Now you can respec after BRBH. Thank you so much for this devs. You going the right direction with the update. Now I have complained about the blocking and parry system alot, but I felt the window for it was very small. I was too impatient to time it right. But some weapons counter fable attack is def to small with the current parry window. The glaive is exception.

Mechanics:
It's very unique in some ways. Perfect blocking and parrying can be rewarded and come in to save your puppet strings. Sorry I had to lol. It's not a perfect mechanic, but you will end up getting used to it. Just be patient about.
If you are struggling with surviving, I will recommend take a look at your p-organ. You can make a good defensive build while remaining heavy hitting as well.
Dodging is not totally useless, you just have to time it right, since you have less i-frams compared to FS games. So don't panic roll, blocking is your friend.
Rally system is also part of the game, when you miss the perfect block but normal block instead. You will take small damage, which you can regain if you hit the enemies as long you don't get hit while regaining back the HP.

Enemy design:
Let me start of with.. Why does so many enemies have so many delay attacks? Elite / unique mobs have either sluggish delay attacks or just insta attacks. It is hard to read and it feels kinda unpredictable. But yeah they are tanky and merciless. On a short note some of them have been nerfed a little so they shouldn't be to harsh to deal with. You just have to be little more patient when to attack and not.
The grab attacks looks pretty similar to other attacks. Again is it gonna be a grab or normal attack? Looking at you SWM.
Fury attack is kinda not my favorite design. These red delay attacks makes it really annyoing to try and perfect block. Delay attacks are the worst kinds of attack, you can put into these type of games. You can't change my mind on that. If it is to prevent dodge spamming, I'm sure there is other ways to deal with it.
Since the enemies are little taller, you can end up with terrible camera angles. Without spoling too much, but there is one boss, which can make the camera angle pretty damn awful. Since I don't wanna spoil his name, here is a little nickname for him: Aldrich the odd looking beast.
Overall enemies could have been designed little better, but if you fight them enough, you will shred them without thinking about it.
Enemy design is ehh 6/10.

Bosses:
The bosses sufferes from the same awful thing. Can you guess what it is? Delay attacks that is correct .So yet again you gotta be patient and watch out for the window to block or parry the attack. But don't be to passive, mix in both defensive and offensive combat style.
Normally I didn't mind second phases, except for BFF and her 3 phases. Multiple phases in this game was used little too many times. No all bosses needs 2 FULL hp bar. Look at FS souls games again, and count how many of them has 2 phases in BASE game.
Gank bosses are still not fun. I dunno why game companies keep adding gank bosses. Stop it. Looking at you BRBH. Update the BRBH is not too terrible of a gank boss fight, but just very annoying. Looking at you bunny with the puppet string.
Now from time to time it really do feels like I'm playing DS2 with ''enemies having perfect tracking'' Like bruh what is this tracking? I still stand by this.
Update Archbishop, King of Puppets (first phase) and Simon got a HP nerf. Not only did Simon get his HP nerfed same did his damage. I'm okay with these changes. Good job devs.
GMOTS is prob the worst designed boss ever created in the souls world. How the heck did that abomination get to be in the game. I'm not happy about that thing avoided the nerf hammer, but I guess I will continue cheesing it lol.
NP fight is cool and all, BUT for the love of videogames. NEVER EVER have a NPC who keep talking during a boss fight. It is so freaking annoying to listen to and it makes it hard to focus atleast for me. Yeah yeah I can just mute it, but still bad design choice.
CV and KoP are prob my favorite fights.
Overall I will give boss design a 6/10.

I will admit, it's kinda cool you can dismantle weapons and then put the parts on other handles and such. Update since the stagger got buffed, it might make heavy weapons little better than before.

Last thing I really dislike about this game is the camera. I had some issues with it, some fights makes it even hard to see what is going on. Little more zoomed out wouldn't hurt.

Well I have some pros
- Music is pretty good.
- Game really looks amazing.
- Game runs pretty smooth, I was kinda shocked by that.
- Storytelling is pretty good, you kinda grow into the all NPCS, atleast I did. Also few ncps that made me want to punch them so hard in the face. So yeah the character development is well done.

Since I have beaten the game two times now. I have to admit, I sucked and got my butt clapped by the bosses. But soon after I learned how to get good, I have been the one bullying the bosses, minibosses and elite mobs. But I still hope we see more changes in the future. But let's wait and see. I do wanna thank you devs for the glaive, it's now my go to weapon of all time lol.
Let me finish saying it's a very good game. It's has to be played as Lies of P and not like FS souls games.
With this said, let's not deny this game has some flaws still. But I can def recommend it. It's tough, but not impossible to beat.",1695242113,1708909115,True,0,0,0.689375758171081543,0,True,False,False

+Cool concept for a game in general. The story is a dark twist on the tale of Pinocchio, during an evil puppet uprising. It's packed with heart, interesting characters, and thought-provoking ideas.
+Awesome weapon building system. Aside from boss weapons, every weapon you find comes with 2 parts: its blade and its handle. The blade determines a weapon's speed, range, and damage types, while the handle determines its moveset and damage scaling. On top of all that, each part comes with a special ability, meaning every weapon will end up with 2 abilities. Tinkering with wacky combinations is highly addictive, and it doesn't cost any resources, so you're free to experiment as much as you want.
+Amazing art direction. Enemy designs are especially well done, featuring some of the scariest robot designs I've ever seen.
+Many quality of life improvements to the Soulslike genre. Quests are easy to keep track of, the respec system is very generous, running back to the boss arena is always painless, and the armor system isn't tied to your appearance.
+Many layers of build customization.
+Good incentives for multiple playthroughs.
+Great level design and atmosphere.
+Great bosses overall.
+Great soundtrack.[/quote]
[quote][h1]THE BAD[/h1]
-Much of the difficulty comes from an abundance of delayed attacks that make no logical sense.
-Borrows an excessive amount of ideas from other Soulslike games. Blurs the line between homage and ripoff frequently.
-Lack of precise numbers in your skill tree choices. Something might seem good, only for it to suck when you actually try it out. I had to do a lot of respecs because of this.
-Other than a few different endings and some more open areas, the game is very linear.[/quote]

It's clearly a copy of FromSoft games (mostly feels like DS3 + bloodborne with a tiny dash of Sekiro) all mashed into one package but it manages to have some amount of identity nonetheless. It doesn't quite measure up to the source material but it comes closer than most. Sometimes it feels like they tried too hard to be similar. A strong DLC with less linearity could round up this game's quality.

Pros:

- Some mechanics are actually improved: stagger + critical attacks, weapon durability being actually fun to manage.
- I feel all 3 damage stats in NG are balanced and work well.
- The P-organ update system adds a bit of RPG/build decision making in NG, which is cool.
- Good sound design
- Weather and day/night system was a nice touch

Neutral:

- Weapons are Ok but nothing too crazy or well executed. In practice, the vast majority of handle + blade combinations are not worth using at all even if the idea was nice. Most boss weapons are not great and the scarcity of update materials make that even worse as you won't even try them. In the end I had more fun playing with different weapons in DS3; in Lies of P, I find myself always coming back to the same 1-2 weapons that work way better than the rest. The movesets are bit boring and samey.

- Boss design is Ok with some highlights (Scrapped watchman) and some very bad bosses (e.g the swamp monster who can spam his tentacles at you then link this into 2 red attacks with no windup) 
In general, long combos and very fast startup/windup are used a bit too often to catch the player by surprise, which doesn't feel as good a nice dance like Gundyr or Nameless King)

- Story/universe is OK. Can't say the item descriptions which are supposed to cover the lore are very well executed. Perhaps a translation issue?

- Combat is OK and better than most souls like but still can be a bit janky when you least expect it (like terrible tracking, stagger working in mysterious ways, etc)

- The legion arms are OK; some (1) are waaay more useful than others. I don't think it adds enough to the gameplay to remove the customizations that are 1 handed vs 2 handed, ranged weapons, dual wielding, etc.

Cons:

- The game is extremely linear and as much as I prefer a linear game over a crappy open world one, I feel like this is going too far. DS3 is way more linear than DS1 and it still has sequence breaks (e.g, Dancer), and path choices (e.g swamp vs cathedral) This make NG+ quite boring and even NG could be spiced up if you could go get your favorite weapon early on instead of having to wait 9 chapters. Almost all chapters have the same rythm which goes like 3-4 elites, 1 boss, go back to hotel for NPC talks; rinse and repeat.

- Level design is a bit boring, with mostly horizontal town-ish environments and very predictable layouts and shortcuts. Sometimes there's a shortcut one minute after another for zero reason.

- Zero fashion. You find a complete clothe uniform you like and use it for the entire game, most are ugly. Hats look even worse.

- How many 2 phases bosses do you possibly need? Less is more. Keep it a surprise. Also you can tell one boss has a second phase because the first phase is pretty tame and the hp bar melts rather quickly.

- Some very strange choices like providing a respec statue that is unlocked later than another, more convenient option.

- The trash mobs are really, really trash and just an inconvenience. I feel they struggled to nail the stagger/hyper armor balance of these vs elites.

I am expecting a good story and good story I get, but it's kinda short. I only wish they add a new content and lore soon.

Combat of this game is great, combat is more focused on Parrying instead of Dodging. Perfect Guard had a satisfying feeling to it. So as an Elden Ring player, this kinda hard to adjust. If you played Sekiro you probably will cheese this. 

As usual, the terrain. ""Lets put an enemy beside a small bridge, oh and lets make it a range enemy so that the recoil of that attack can make the player go splat""

The difficulty of this game is honestly not that hard. the hardest boss battle is the final one, (don't search it, its a spoiler), maybe because there is no option to summon? Nah, its the Hardest boss in this game for sure.  (At least for me)

Most big enemies are damage sponges that have so much life and do so much damage that I'm forced to kite them for minutes (and apparently they heal life when not being attacked, same with bosses), the game wants you to perfect parry enemy to the point of most of them having some sort of hyper armor during their attacks, and some of their attacks (red attacks) are literally immune to normal parries, but not like in Sekiro that you can still dodge the unblockable attacks because the game ignores your dodge invincibility frames during those attacks, they literally state that ""you cannot guard nor dodge you can only perfect parry them"", anything bellow a perfect parry in this game will still damage you, and as someone who has perfect parried Genichiro, for some reason I cannot grasp the timing in this game, this game is very unpolished and if you are coming from a FromSoftware title expecting to have the same feeling when you do a backstab or a parry, you will be feeling very uncomfortable. If you wish build variety, like to play as a caster build or ranged, there isn't any, this game is limited only to melee weapons, the ""builds"" in this game consist in choosing the weapon you want to use and the four amulets you want to use with it, and since the ""armor"" of the game has no visual difference (since the costumes are the things that changes your appearances and they have no stats tied to it) you will just be choosing the bigger numbers to a more and more abstract progression were every piece have literally no other value than the spreadsheet being bigger, most of the game has this aspect were you never feel immersed in it, it's not like darksouls were everything is so subtle and full of intention, in this game you will interact with a pile of debris and it will have a pristine paper telling you all you need to know about the lore of the facility, everything just feels like a game and it breaks my immersion.

I just finished the game. I loved the art, the style, the combat, the narrative (except not being able to tell Eugenie something if you don't speak to NPCs in a VERY specific order :( ). I loved the parry system and I do not find it too strict unlike many people, and this is my first parry heavy soulslike. Somehow found this game to be easier than Elden Ring. I do recommmend this game for anyone who likes soulslikes and aesthetics, as there were several instances where i was like ""omg so prettyyyy AAAAAAAAAAAAA"". It just feels solid and complete (haha pun intended). So yes, VERY VERY MUCH recommend this game. It just feels like the developers love from's games and just wanted to make a game with a slighgtly different take on the narrative and combat. And this game runs at 60 fps on Steam Deck which is *U N H E A R D* of for modern AAA. 

There's one major thing I do not like about this game though: SOME bosses that comprise of 2 separate FULL POWER bosses, which make the entire boss fight last about up to 10 minutes, which is too much. There are several issues with this:
1. The first phase feels like a giant very difficult runback.
2. You are unable to properly learn the boss's moveset.
3. Makes the second phase 50% luck based 50% skill based (or at least that's my experience).
4. Fatigue because the fight is very very long.

By far the worst example of the above is the big swamp thingie (I made up the name but those who have beat him know who I'm talking about). That's the only boss who I, after several hours, had to use specters on. Literally the only one. AAAND I wanted to give up on the opera house boss when i found out about the second phase, but I was lucky there, which I don't feel like should be the case in a souls-like game.

I tried really hard to like this game. And I'm sure many people love it.
But since the question is: Do **you** recommend this game?
My answer is no.
I guess waiting for a bigger sale is best if you want to try this. 60 Bucks is definitely too much though.

Now I think the whole ""Bloodborne for PC"" thing, is nothing that anyone thinks is 100% a fact.
But just in case, this is of course not 1:1 Bloodborne, but I'll talk about gameplay in a bit.

First a few points that I really like:
The art style/setting is really cool and the game is pretty, on top of that it runs really well, and no weird fps cap, so that's a big plus.
The weapon mixing mechanic is definitely cool and worth experimenting with. Even if I ended up using BOSS WEAPONS for the majority of my play-through.
Getting your last flask back for attacking is also a cool Idea, as you can limit the maximum flasks, but still give the player a chance to keep fighting on, it really rewards playing well.
The shortcuts and fewer stargazers (bonfires) are something that I like, it's a good way of designing levels for souls likes, however this doesn't mean the world is interconnected much.

But now I have quite a few points that cripple the experience, and hence make me dislike this game overall.

Combat: The combat is probably the most important or at least one of the more important aspects in souls-like games.
I've heard that the combat leans on Bloodborne, to which I must honestly wonder if those people actually played Bloodborne. This game has rallying, but it's a bad deal. In BB you can rally damage that you take, which encourages to keep close and keep fighting, if you get hit, you retaliate. Here, you can only rally from a block, which means you trade stamina for the chance to get health back. Alternatively you could trade stamina for not getting hit, by dodging. People like to complain that DS3 made dodges too good, too universal. However this games rally mechanic isn't really an answer to that. Also on that note: It works off of blocking, a mechanic that BB threw out the window altogether, again I don't see how this is like BB. 
What's also vastly different from BB is the parry mechanic, which doesn't rely on shooting someone in the face as they start to swing, but rather leans on Sekiro. This leads to one of my main complaints:

This game feels like it has an identity crisis.

Parries work like in Sekiro, you do a timed block to deflect, however the attack patterns do not have that same level of Rhythm they had in Sekiro. I think that it is incredibly hard to recreate that type of combat, and it didn't really work here.
On top of the off feeling, you do not have a posture bar. Instead of breaking your enemies posture to deathblow them, we get our typical critical attack. So instead of parrying and doing a visceral/critical, we get to fill an invisible posture bar with quite a few deflects, to then crit.  This doesn't feel rewarding, not at all.
I was constantly stuck between trying to play DS3 and Sekiro.

Fake-out bosses: This is also pretty annoying to me. I don't mind if there is a boss or two, that has a hidden second phase. In fact, I love fighting Sister Friede for instance. However this game does it too much, and more often than not it's obvious from the get go. You hit that boss once or twice, and you know: wait a minute, there will be another health bar. After several bosses in a row that flop over, put me in a cut-scene and then go into phase 2, it's tiresome.
Transitions mid combat are so much cooler, and add to a fight. Instead I get put to a fixed place after a cut-scene...

Tracking and Range:
A lot of attacks have insane tracking and movement. Often enough an attack looks and feels like it would be easy to zone out of, only for the boss to zip over and track your ass. I have no problem with getting chased or a game dictating a Rhythm where you can't zone, or kite. But this game doesn't really do that. You get a slow, heavy, overhead attack from a pretty stationary enemy only for said enemy to zip closer once they actually swing.",1708862616,1708874490,False,6,0,0.494009345769882202,0,True,False,False

Was constantly happening on the big first boss, the copper thing. Was mainly a problem when he does his 4 attack combo side swings. Like makes the fight unplayable if its gonna do shit like that. Better hope this gets fixed, if i let go of the block button, the idiot shouldn't just keep holding block.

Wow so fun, so i got to the 2nd time doing that black rabbit gang fight, the little one that kicks you up in the air? Yeah, if they land this attack, your character jsut magically dies instantly, your body floats in the air in a falling animation then few seconds later lands, what kind of dogshit game has a boss fight this glitched.

Games finished, the last 2 bosses was super easy for some reason, i'd like to say it was fairly enjoyable bar the glitches and jankyness, but finding out that i didn't lie enough or some nonsense so i don't get the gold weapon from the nose growing just left a sour feeling after finishing the game. Like i went with the more human side choices, missed 2 records cuz the dumb npcs were dead when i found out about them later on. Like do you really think anyone is going to do a 3rd playthrough just to enjoy the weapon? What a rubbish idea this was. If i could continue it's growth in the new game plus then that'd be fine, i'd get it eventually mid playthrough and all is well but knowing that i'm just not going to get to use it at all because of some rubbish that also means i can't do a 2nd playthrough sticking to the more puppet path then human, it's all just annoying and ruined the end feeling.",1695131933,1708843151,False,5,1,0.474265426397323608,0,True,False,False

Edit:
After more than 40 hours, I want to add that this is a very good game. The second half of the game is very hard as well. You do need to ""git gud"" to stand a chance. In my experience, 3 or 4 of the bosses will take 20+ tries. With one more boss to go for me, it might be  a lot more than that. It can be frustrating because I do feel like these devs (as well as Fromsoft) still add way too many spastic moves for second phase bosses. I'd rather have one long and rational boss rather than one that devolves into insanity. All that said, the game is great and I recommend it to anyone that actively enjoys the official Souls series.

As a big fan of the FromSoft Soulsborne games, having gotten all trophies for all of them bare Sekiro, I was eagerly waiting for this on it's initial release but was left  disappointed. Originally this game lacked the balance you'd see in a FromSoft games, it didn't have that ""fairness"" of knowing something you did wrong that led to your downfall, meaning you could do better next time. I got all the way to the end of Lies of P originally, but was so sick of it that by the last boss I simply opted for the ""bad"" ending and sold my first PS5 copy.

Now, I'm happy to say that the game is in a much better place than it was when it first released. There's still some ""total BS"" moments (one boss inflicting a status debuff, which you then cure, only for it to immediately be re-applied simply shouldn't be a thing) but they're much fewer and further between than before. The games' mechanics seem to actually serve their function rather than being barely noticeable - purposefully guarding attacks to reduce damage and following up with attacks to regain some of that lost HP is actually meaningful now, whereas previously it didn't seem to do anything. ""Perfect Guards"" where you guard at the right moment seem achievable and I'm able to actually do so reliably in a way that feels good, whereas before the window to pull them off seemed much too narrow. There are even some noticeable mechanics in the game originally that I didn't even know existed, like breaking weapons from Perfect Guards because of the efforts the team have made to bring more balance to the game's difficulty.

Definitely consider picking this up if you're a fan of the genre. I've thoroughly enjoyed my more recent playthrough compared to what the game was like on it's initial release.",1708832873,1708832873,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I had a blast playing the game and here are some of my points both positive and negative: 
Aesthetic of the game is great, the steam-punk theme fits great and NeoWiz did a great job with the art and level design, weapon design, all in all props to them.

The weapon abomination system as I like to call it where you combine a handle and blade of a weapon is a refreshing really cool system and props to the developers for creating it. 

Boss design is really great and enemy variety is plentiful, each area that you visit feels fresh even tough there are some re-used models or enemies. 

My only complaint is that this game was designed to be played with fast weapons, in my experience I beat the game as a strength (Motivity) build with the sword from the Parade Master, found it looking the coolest, but man, some of the other motivity weapons are really slow (as they should be), but the enemies and bosses in the later half of the game become really fast for those weapons to even be viable. 
Another issue is that enemies have incredible poise, while you cannot even swing without getting staggered from a light attack, which sometimes can be frustrating. 

The legion arms are another great addition to your arsenal and blast huge damage even without you speccing into intelligence (Advance). 

The game didn't feel unfair at any point of my playthrough, which is a huge mistake that other souls-like games face, where the artificially increase the difficulty with really anti-player monster placement or bloating enemies with stats. Every problem had a solution, you just had to be creative or look around. 

Overall, I had a great experience with the game and strongly reccomend it if you are having that soulsborne hunger but want something fresh, the gameplay will feel familliar, yet really different.",1708731585,1708768452,True,1,0,0.533678770065307617,0,True,False,False

Lies of P is a good souls-like game with the familiar gameplay loop. Go from checkpoint A to B. Kill all monsters to get resources for levelling up & upgrading gear. Unlock shortcuts & checkpoints. Kill bosses. If you’ve played a souls-like game before you will be familiar with the gameplay loop.

Lies of P is more story focused, or atleast tells a story so it’s easier to follow. Unlike Dark Soul games that tells the story heavily with the environment & item descriptions. Lies of Ps’ story is good but can be confusing at first. Characters talking about something that will happen. For example, “We have seen more X in this area”, but when you travel there nothing has changed yet. Very small things that don’t really take away from the story.

The game is also very linear with very little exploration. The game is also relatively short, I think I finished it in 40 hours & I can see people finishing it much faster than that. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, I prefer shorter games with higher quality content than big games like Starfield & Skyrim, where most of it is low quality content just so they can market it as “there’s a lot of things to do”.

For some people, understandably, 40 hours is not worth 59,99€. I however think it was worth the cost. The game is incredibly optimised, even the demo was optimised when it came out. It’s, sadly, very refreshing to buy a product that feels finished. It also has replay value with New Game+ if you enjoy the gameplay & are interested in more of the lore. You need to play the game at least two times to unlock everything. You also understand the story much better & therefore see the world with new eyes. I hope that makes sense.

The combat is good but enemies have a lot of delayed attacks so if you really dislike that I don’t think this game is for you. The combat feels very rewarding if you master perfect blocking. The weapon arsenal is decent & you can even take weapons apart. Mixing handles & blades to make a weapon that better suits you. You can't disassemble boss weapons.",1697205506,1708670261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is un-fucking-believable. 

From the day it was announced, I'd been waiting for this to come out. At the time, I really wanted to play Bloodborne, but I didn't have a way to play it thanks to the lack of a port. The game reminded me of Bloodborne because of some of the architecture in the game trailers, as well as... y'know, tailcoats and stylish weaponry. 

Fast forward a good long while, and Lies of P is out. I preordered it on Playstation (and at this point, I'd already played fully through Bloodborne numerous times), and got to play this a few days early. 

And let me just say -- if you've heard anyone say ""ohh, it's just a Bloodborne clone lol""? They're either seriously stupid or haven't played Lies of P. Maybe they just weren't paying attention. Lies of P is *inspired* by Bloodborne, but by no means is it a clone. 

-It has its own art aesthetic. It'll remind you of Bloodborne, but it won't just *feel* like it.

-A unique style of souls combat with a pretty equal focus on guarding/whittling enemy posture and dodging/going full-offensive.
 
-The game *looks* incredible, and it's super well-optimized to boot. Seriously. I'm using a GTX 1660 TI with 16 GB of RAM, and I'm getting a solid sixty frames with maximum settings (except for volumetric fog quality, which is set to high. ONE setting is lowered.)

-There's a good weapon variety, and you can even mix-and-match movesets and certain abilities between weapons. 

-The story is presented in a way that's easy for people who don't like reading a million pieces of external lore content to understand what the hell is going on. It's mysterious in places, as per the soulslike usual, but you won't be totally clueless about what's going on in the game's world.

-As far as I know, the game is still looking to receive a good handful of updates. Some new weapons and outfits here and there, and any bug or gameplay fixes that might be necessary. 

-The enemies? Great. The bosses? Great. Enemy placement, how about? It's all great. Tons of enemy variety, and they're all perfectly creepy for the settings they're in.

-The Riddler? Uh...

-The music? Gorgeous. The boss themes are pretty good, but the collectible vinyl records are something else. 

-The characters? I found myself getting more attached to the likes of Venigni and Eugenie than *most* people in, say, Elden Ring or DS3. 

I could go on for a lot longer, but I'll wrap it up with one last statement -- if the geniuses at NEOWIZ continue to make these games, then FromSoft is finally gonna have REAL competition in the soulslike genre. Lies Of P is NOT fucking around when it comes to fun, and it's REALLY not fucking around when it comes to challenging. Eager for more from Neowiz, because they've displayed nigh mastery of their craft here. 

And they removed Denuvo. :3

Mechanically, this game doesn't feel like a Soulslike. It feels like an extremely safe clone of Dark Souls 3.  There are a handful of unique flourishes, but they're all minor. If Elden Ring hadn't come out, that might have been enough. The problem is that Elden Ring pushed the envelope a lot; not just by switching to an open world design, but by increasing player mobility. Pinocchio can't jump vertically, move faster than a jog, or run longer than his stamina bar says so. It makes combat and exploration feel very dated.

The setting suffers from having come out a year after Steelrising, another Soulslike with a virtually identical plot and setting: Revolutionary France/Victorian England has achieved a Golden Age on the backs of magitek robots, but they've rebelled and slaughtered the citizenry; the most human-like of the robots must now save mankind from its hubris. The Pinocchio angle feels like a subtraction from Steelrising's take, replacing a unique aspect of the story with a retread of a classic story. The Gepetto character being named....Gepetto reinforces the feeling of cold, corporate regurgitation that isn't helped by the CEO stating that they chose Pinocchio specifically because it's a story that's well known in the West.

The whole package just winds up feeling boring, like it's going through the motions. What unique quirks exist wind up sidelined before a game that looks and plays exactly like games I've played before. At least games like Code Vein made me feel like there was *something* going on, even if I didn't understand it. There's no art here, no feeling. 

With the year we just had, there's not a lot of reasons to try out a game that is so determined to be competent and nothing more. Lies of P isn't a bad game, but it isn't a good one, either.",1708626063,1708626063,False,3,1,0.370192021131515503,0,True,False,False

Fable is basically what replaces a mana bar, and it lets you do really awesome attacks or give yourself buffs, depending on the weapon you are using. Legion arms are kinda like a second mana bar that you use for even more unique attacks, from shooting flames to firing a grappling hook at enemies to throwing a small puddle of acid on the ground that does literally nothing because that one arm sucks. I also really love that your ""armor"" in this game doesn't change your appearance and lets you customize purely for cosmetic reasons, it's just a shame that this is used in a game that has very limited cosmetics and no character creator.

I understand that there are some special ""rules"" for a game to be considered soul-like, but damn... Does ANYBODY really like this horrible way of switching between consumables with the help of the mouse wheel IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREAKING FIGHT? Why couldn't they just implement a simple panel with 1-9 bindings at the bottom of the screen? You can literally run out of some consumables you took to a boss, and then they become an empty item slots that you have to scroll through simultaneously tracking the boss's movement to avoid getting killed.

The weapon system is bad. At the beginning, I was very passionate about finding a new weapon since it seemed to be a really rare occasion and their appearances were pretty varied. After a few hours, I still couldn't figure out a suitable way of fighting or the best weapon for my style until I found the dagger. Since finding the dagger, I realized there is no sense in having anything else. You literally lose the opportunity to move fast and waste your stamina with 2 VERY LONG attacks with a minor increase in damage.

The timings of actions are somehow ridiculous. I often find myself pressing the buttons related to specific actions (like drinking HP potions) just to realize it was a little bit too soon for it to work after a dash/jump, etc.

Some UI decisions are really bad and not well thought out. Why in god's name place three health bars of the bosses you are fighting with in the bottom middle of the screen? Multiply it by 5 characters (3 bosses, me + specter), and you have a freaking firework of pixels lighting up the screen. Now let's try to figure out what's going on to avoid getting killed. 

At the beginning, P's robotic hand seemed to be an interesting way to diversify fights, but later I found myself feeling bored with Legion crafting options as well as their usages.

A lot of useless medallions. 

Although you can equip only 4 pieces of ""armor,"" the first one is completely straightforward, with just one stat for physical damage reduction. On the other hand, the other 3 pieces consistently confuse you whenever the location changes. They have a variety of stats, starting with physical damage reduction and finishing with defense against specific types of attacks (slash, pierce, etc.) or elemental resistance, which constantly varies depending on the location you are in and the monsters/bosses you are fighting, so you need to go over and over to achieve maximum resistance for a certain case.

Overall, the game feels interesting, the graphic is very good, and you really want to walk across Krat city learning its history, but I think that the complexity of the gameplay comes mainly from the very poor fighting system rather than the actual complexity of the monsters and bosses.",1708549212,1708549390,False,2,1,0.526076734066009521,0,True,False,False

I have played every single Souls game multiple times, and I would always roll my eyes whenever I saw hype for any 'souls-like' games coming up; as they never encapsulate what makes Souls games so great.

These developers, they knew exactly what they were doing. They poured their heart and soul into this game.

Having playing both Sekiro and Elden Ring prior to this title I have to say the boss balancing is unreal. Fights go from halfway enjoyable to absolute cancer by the later half of the game.

Literally every single boss has 5-10 hit constant combos on repeat with a parry mechanic that isn't frame perfect and has an absolutely ridiculous delay. If you want a game where i have to parry 15 times in a row just to get an attack window, you better have a parry mechanic that is both intuitive and responsive. Bosses have almost no decent telegraphing either which makes it more of a rote memorization rather than any kind of intuitive response to game cues. This isn't fun at all.

Honestly the lore and feel of the game are great but the bosses are just about the worst I've experienced in any soul like title.

Having finished the game, the story, both are amazing, would be my top 3 souls like if this game obviously wasn't budget restricted in terms of mob variety, their moves and art in the environment. 

Bosses: - most are hard, only 2 or 3 i killed in 1-3 tries, what's amazing about them is how u learn through the game to use every mechanic making it easier to play against them but they naturally get harder and harder as you get better keeping the battles interesting and not that frustrating through the whole game.  What I didn't like about only some of the bosses was the artistic design. But it wasn't that bad since they all fitted the story and the lore of the world very well.

Mobs: - Bcs some of them were to easy and way to plentiful of the same kind and u would run through some of the lvls (bonfire checkpoints) for an hour just 1 shoting mobs and finding collectibless until you got to the next boss. 

Mini bosses (mob bosses)  - they have good moves and are challenging just the right amount, but there's very little of them in variety.

Story is 10/10 unlike in other souls games u'll understand what's happening here, it's simple, might be unsatisfying at the begging, but at the final act it all made perfect sense.

Music: It's almost always there, every boss has it's own and you can collect a dozen to chose from and listen at the hotel where u speak to ur friends and upgrade everythn.

the game is basically a 10/10 for a AA game, it's a double a game that almost feels like a triple a one. Obviously it's not as epic and vast as elden ring, but in my opinion it's close enough to be worth the 60 bucks.

Refunded after 2h!

Long Version:
Started the game and hit the first major bug after 2min when I noticed the Y-Axis inversion does not work correctly.
Fixed that with a little google search (by inverting the Steam Controller Input Option, game still has the unresolved bug!)

Picking up new items gives you a short description but the text goes away so fast that nobody can really read it.
After a short google I found out that this was not only an issue for me but lots of people.
Ignored this (extremely annoying) design issue and noticed that other hints/help text, which are like half as long or shorter than the item pickup text, stays on for three times as long....feels like devs/designer did not really care with such basic things that can honestly make or break a first time experience like mine.

And finally, the grand finale: I almost immediately started trying to understand the damage system by carefully hitting easy enemies with a single hit and repeating multiple times after dmg number disappears.
To my surprise I got very different numbers each time. First I figured it might have to do with some hidden hit boxes on the weapon or counter damage or something.
Turns out: The base damage in this game has a built in RNG roll of about 20%!!!
Putting aside the fact that I think Souls Like games should try and keep their damage systems as consistent as possible to reward player skill instead of RNG I could maybe understand rolling for 5, maybe even 10%. But a fifth of your possible max damage is just stupid. Makes trying/comparing builds, weapons and items a nightmare, not to mention hitting enemies just feels inconsistent in general (duh!)

With these kind of problems in the first 2h of a game that has been out for almost half a year I am thoroughly disappointed considering the price of 45€ (not to mention the outragous 60€ for this mess when its not on sale)",1708453366,1708453411,False,3,0,0.525399386882781982,0,True,False,False

All achievements in 73 hours. The game is a hecking masterpiece. The game definitely has more pros and cons in my opinion.

The one thing I enjoyed most about this game is the direct approach to the story. There in no confusion to where you need to go, you are guided throughout the story. Side quests aren't as direct but they are side quests for a reason. Also, main NPCs in Krat Hotel also have character side stories as well. Lastly, there are 3 total endings in the game, so while you don't have to do all 3, to get the most out of the game I would recommend getting the endings, especially the True Ending. 

All in all, it's a beautiful game. It is quite challenging but for those that have played Sekiro, you may find the guard system to be very familiar and the overall difficulty to be similar in comparison as well.

When players get boss ergo it is grouped in with all other ergo. Unlike other souls-likes which have similar uses for boss souls, such as demons souls, dark souls 1, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring, boss soul items in Lies of P are similar in appearance to standard soul items, and don't ask players if they are sure that they want to use them. I collected dozens of standard ergo along with multiple boss ergo, which I eventually used at one time to increase my level. I had not realized that I had used the boss ergo until I discovered that they may be used to create boss weapons at Alidoro's shop. From my understanding, there is no way to acquire this ergo again until the next new game cycle. Due to the inability to acquire previously used boss ergo, and thus, attain a weapon that I was highly anticipating, I was without any alternative other than to create a new save in order to attain this weapon. Though one is able to discover that boss ergo is unique and may infer that boss ergo possibly has an alternate use from reading the item description, those who are not paying close attention to the item(s) description will be likely to use it without realizing. Adding an additional prompt which asks if the player wishes to use an item that will have alternative use later verifies that this item has use beyond ergo gain, and prevents players from unknowingly using a unique ergo item. I have enjoyed many aspects of Lies of P, but find the aforementioned issue too glaring to ignore.",1708412469,1708412469,False,7,3,0.521632194519042969,0,True,False,False

-Running looks like you're on ice, you just spin around with no weight to your movement. 
-The voice acting it atrocious. Inconsistent mixing, tone, and bizarre intonation.
-Parrying is unrewarding and requires knowing the enemy's attack pattern before you get hit. You have to predict the attack, not react to it. 
-Oh yeah, the dialogue is horseshit. Every character you meet is like ""tee hee I know something important you don't know but I'm not gonna tell you, aren't I so important?"" Instead of adding to the intrigue, it just grates on you.
-Uninspired bosses. R1 to victory when they spaz out and miss you. R2 when you finally break their, uhhh, poise(?) to do a not so critical attack
-Speaking of poise, there is no poise in this game for bigger enemies. You can only get an attack or two in because as soon as they miss you, they wind up for another one and you can't interrupt it. Good luck parrying that! Have I mentioned that the parrying sucks?
-Level design sucks. ""Hey here's 5 enemies you can face one at a time down a pretty wide street. Btw, when you're done, here's a shortcut so you can skip them next time."" I have yet to die in the game, but instead of taking the shortcuts after spending my souls, I would just kill the enemies again because it was so dang boring otherwise.

While it is ""harder"" than other Souls-likes, it demands your engagement with the parrying and dodging mechanics unlike FromSoft games where you can just block your way to most victories.

The mechanics, the world and the general feeling is similar to Bloodborne but nothing ever feels copied or directly taken from it as Lies of P has its own story, setting and mechanics, and executes all of it very well.

It's not perfect and has some jank in its movement and writing, or rather translation, but for a first try in the genre it's shining a light on the studio that's beyond promising.

Amazing story, fantastic combat, outstanding world design...the game does hold your hand a little though unlike other souls-likes where you have to figure things out yourself or unravel a cryptic mystery...its actually harder to miss things simply because there's a marker that appears when there's something to do or someone to interact with, but that's all entirely subjective as to how you feel about that type of stuff. I didn't mind personally, just something to mention I suppose.

Loved the ""build your own weapon"" system where you can dismantle weapons you find or buy (excluding special weapons) and mix'n'match handles and blades. The handle determines the style of attacks while the blade determines things like damage and a number of other variables...I have to admit though, having jumped into this just after the Wo Long Collab, you start off with Guan Yu's Glaive that's classed as a special weapon and feels EXTREMELY nice to use, though it isn't overpowered and you can't really upgrade it until way later in the game.

There's no armour in the typical sense of like helmets, chest pieces, etc...you get parts that determine armour, weight, resistances and so forth, whilst your visual appearance is entirely cosmetic and you'll unlock a few different outfits as you go. They are unfortunately limited to full body outfit, hat and glasses so no real deep ""fashion souls"" thing going here if that's what you're all about.

THE BAD

PLAGIARISM

I have played many Soulslikes. I have played many games that took some of From Softs elements and mechanics and made it work.
I played good and bad versions of those. I played Mortal Shell, I played Lords of the Fallen, I played Nioh, 
I played the Surge.
Never have I seen a game that steals literally everything, down to the fonts.
This game is not a Soulslike. This game is blatant plagiarism.

First, I was enamored with the game. ""Hey this reminds me of Bloodborne"". ""Hey this is also like Bloodborne, but worse"".
And all of those ""Hey this is just like Bloodborne, but worse"" quickly started adding up.
The game is ""very heavily"" inspired by Bloodborne. You have a poorly implemented Rally mechanic,
you have status buildups that work exactly like in bloodborne, the atmosphere and aesthetic played a ""heavy influence"", the dark symphonic music, the dark victorian theme, some assets are direct copies, the story is a direct copy of Bloodborne (""puppets gave gone mad, except you"" vs. ""hunters have gone mad, except you"").
Then there are giant rolling balls you have to avoid, the gestures (the shrug animation is literally identical), 
the quest NPCs behind windows, the cube being basically the Elden Ring teardrop flask, the entire Ergo system being literally Souls, the corpse run to pick back up your Souls, boss Ergo being boss Souls you trade for a choice between a weapon and an accessory, moonstones are titanite shards, the healing pulse (Estus) replenishing after killing a bunch of enemies existed in DS3, the prosthetic arm is from Sekiro.
Hell, even the bad camera when fighting large monsters and EVEN THE FONTS are copied from Bloodborne.

Even the basic mobs are a 1-1 copy of bloodborne's torch huntsman. Every time I fought one I expected it shout ""Away! Away!""

COMBAT

- The game is basically Bloodborne but clunkier
- No animation canceling
- Input action delay
- Action queue / animation stacking
- Slow MC animations, especially in comparison to the opponent, meaning you get stunlocked
- excessive amount of delayed attacks ruin the cadence and rhythm of the combat for me
- basic movement abilities are locked behind the P Guard, like rolling twice with reduced delay (and even then the delay is still there)
- The rally system, directly copies from Bloodborne. It worked in Bloodborne, because you were discouraged from blocking,
there was not even a functional shield to find, you were encouraged to be aggressive and to attack, you could stagger
by being hyperaggressive. In Lies of P, the enemies will be much more aggressive, start long combos you will have to
perfect parry 8-10 times or dodge, meaning you can not really make use of this mechanic that is supposedly there to
encourage you to attack to regain HP. It's just copied without understanding why it worked in BB.
- Stagger is technically a good system, rewarding you for being aggressive. However, in order to actually stagger
once the bar is full, you have to use a (slow) charged R2, meaning you're most likely to eat an attack or possibly 
an entire chain of attacks. The enemies are hyper aggressive, so you are not very likely to find a window to do so.
And once you stagger, the window to position yourself on the red circle and do a visceral attack is tiny, and you will
often miss it if you use heavier weapons. This combined makes this yet another useless mechanic that was copied from
Soulsborne without understanding why it worked in Soulsborne.

Something odd I also found:

- The stargazers are copies of the DS bonfires where you can level up, 
the first stargazer lets you level there, yet from then on, 
you can not level up at stargazers anymore and have to go to the hub


CONCLUSION

Many games keep copying and layering Soulsborne mechanics on top of each other without understanding what made them work, and often those mechanics just clash with each other.
This is another one of those. 
However, this is the most excessive, blatant, shameless, soulless and cynical example of it I've ever seen. 
At the same time, they managed to make the combat much, much worse.
The combat is slow, unresponsive and clunky, your animations are slow, your animations are queued, 
there is no animation cancel, and you will get stunlocked. 
Not even the story has any signs of originality, being a direct retelling of Pinocchio.
It's a shameless ripoff. If I want to play Bloodborne, I'll go play Bloodborne, instead of bad plagiarism of it.
This game is what you get if you tell ChatGPT to make Bloodborne with a Pinocchio story.
There is 0 originality and creativity in this game.
The story is not their own, their graphics, mechanics, artwork, music is not their own, so how am I even supposed to rate it?
I hope From Soft sues for plagiarism.

The game also runs amazingly, very well optimized even for low end PCs (which I have), constant 60 FPS with no drops, everything on high.

I can't think of a single major complaint I have with the game, sure it's more linear than your average FromSoft game but that doesn't make a difference if you love the combat here.

this game was AMAZING up until laxasia, but this horrible design of a boss just ruins it. i am amazed that people overlook this horrible boss deisgn and just say 'gEt GuD!!.' this isn't a skill issue. the issue is that a boss should NEVER have 2 healthbars, 1 tap you, dodge, teleport and have 30 second long combos. thats literally taking everything horrible about soulslike bosses and putting it into one boss.

on top of all that, the game wants to be sekiro and dark souls, but cant chose which one to be. the parry system is flat out horrible. the dodge is also horrible. so what do you do when a attack comes? hope the broken parry system works for once, or you can dodge a foot away, while the enemy is still locked onto you and hits you anyways.",1705081025,1708226786,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat system is lazily implemented with parts stolen from other souls like games with zero thought or care to how those parts interact.  What you end up with is a slow as dirt playable character who can't react and enemies and bosses who are fast enough you need to react.  This turns the game into a slog where the only option is to throw yourself at something ad nausea until you learn the fight inside and out.  

The game also forces you to utilize the parry mechanic that derives difficulty from unnatural animations that have randomly placed pauses in an effort to ""trick"" the player.  Additionally, some animation are simply not visible to the player due to the size of the boss.  This is on top of a parry system that drops inputs and often times just doesn't work.  Many times where I am pressing and holding the guard button and nothing happens as you get hit for the full amount.  

This game's setting and story would have had it sitting at the top of the genre but instead it will be known for its lazily implemented combat system.

Edit: List of things I've noticed since this review... more dropped inputs, often time the block just doesnt register.  Enemies can spin on a dime to face you mid attack motion making the dodge mechanic useless.  Seen my weapon pass right though enemies with no damage registered numerous times.  Just lazy, lazy development which is a shame given the story is interesting.

edit edit: just asked for a refund for this game.  The glaring and persistent issues with the combat system make the story not worth seeing such a shame.",1708142796,1708204942,False,1,4,0.346967607736587524,0,True,False,False

And even though I now have all achievements, thanks to saving & reloading, I would still play another time through it. It's just - an absolutely great game. And a great game on its own, even despite any comparison to siblings in its genre.

Performance is just great too: runs very well, very easy, no hiccups whatsoever. Graphics are not amazing by current standards, but animations and models are, and nothing looks off. The faster moving bosses are incredible on screen, and even more incredible when you can react to them.

I love the level design, with its such pure linearity that makes it difficult to miss all items in a run. I like that it's varied enough, and pretty coherent about where it takes you. There's plenty of variety in monsters and environments, and not abusively reused; even the last level brings about a couple of new ones. 

The story is coherent, not overly obscure at it is often the case in the genre, and pretty decent on its own. But it's neither too dull or straightforward to be boring, and playing though it the 2nd time in NG+ still pays off from new perspectives. 

The influence and elements from the Pinocchio book and other stories are such an amazing and tasteful addition. They took the inspiration and made it their own thing, and really in a great way. It's not a rip-off, it's not a cheap shoe-in of some public domain work, it's really a layer of polish and a finishing touch over something that works on its own.

Lastly, there are so many small quality of life improvements to be appreciated throughout, it really makes playing so much more enjoyable. Sure, there are still a couple of quests that can strangely fail when you don't follow a specific sequence, but nothing on the scale of absurdity delivered in other games.

I have played and beaten nearly every Souls game that exists up to this point, and this one is easily my favorite so far, even though it's not made by FromSoftware. It's fantastic to see this genre of game receiving love from new developers!

Lies of P has a very Bloodborne vibe to it, so if you enjoyed Bloodborne, you will probably enjoy this game too. Typically, there are always a few bosses in these types of games that I don't like, but in this one, there was only one boss I absolutely hated. Every other boss provided a solid sense of learning how to handle their move sets and progressing further through the fight, which is exactly what I love about these games. The environment is incredibly immersive as well, the dark Pinocchio vibe felt incredibly satisfying to explore, and I continued to find new areas I never knew existed in subsequent playthroughs. 

My first blind playthrough took around 30-35 hours without the use of phantoms. I ended up playing through the game three more times with various weapons, experimenting with phantoms, and each playthrough was a blast! I will likely play through the full game again once the DLC releases.

This game is what mum has at home.

There is pretty scenery, but the world feels empty. Each zone has 2 or 3 mobs pasted about the place, followed by a zone boss that is not difficult. The beauty of soulslikes is the precision with which the mobs do their attacks, and learning to counter them. In Lies of P, I play with one weapon the whole game, and brute force everything with a strong attack. Mobs don't learn, or counter, they just get wacked. Mobs get stuck on the terrain, hitboxes are janky in parts, block timing is weird. The AI is bad, the trash mobs only have a couple of attacks which they seem to do in order. The game provides no challenge, the weapon upgrades aren't rewarding, the Legion Arm can just be ignored. The mechanics of the wishing box seem cool, but it never gets used, along with any item collected (except status cure on spam). No ranged attacks, but that doesn't matter because there's so few enemies to deal with and few novel situations.

The sound effects are awful, the music is great. The scenery lovely, but the filling is sparse and uninteresting. The scene ratio is odd in places, it feels like I'm running around a dollhouse. at times it looks and feels like a 3rd person game from 20 years ago with visual mods and a texture pack.

The story is interesting, delivered by occasional narrative dump. The levels are linear and uninteresting. I reach a new destination, it looks cool, then follow the rails to the next boss, kill it first time ** NB the last act had a couple of challenging bosses.

I keep waiting for the game to 'get good'. but it didn't. The last few acts were definitely an improvement, but it's just not for me. It's a Dark Souls clone, without the sense of wonder and exploration, repetitive mobs, limited weapons and movesets, boring mobs, and a half-arsed story with characters I have zero emotional investment in. 

I really want to like this game, but it isn't holding my attention. I think I'll slog on to complete it and amend this review later if my view improves.",1706940863,1707818381,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The weapon system is interesting, could've used more of its uniqueness to stand out from other but I did like how you could change the handle for different moveset and the blade for different damage output.
Boss fights swayed a lot for me, I really loved the ""human"" fights, with the monster fights I found that the parrying was a bit weird and dodging could sometimes feel inconsistent.

The level design of areas is well thought of and improves as you progress through the game. Great usage of well-made shortcuts over falling in the trap of abusing bonfires which FROM themselves do fall a bit into since DS3. 

Enemies tend to have well telegraphed attacks. I do think between regular enemies not dealing that much damage, stamina costs being a lil lenient and high amount of healing later on regular levels become not enough stress-inducing to my liking of braving the odds. However, the bosses stay relatively balanced until the end of the game, they've offered a good challenge from start to finish with practically no frustration. I do wish the final bosses had beaten me harder especially with an earlier boss destroying me so bad right before them. 

The arsenal of weapons is surprisingly good with a variety of different movesets for similar types of weapons. Boss weapons slap! The weapon mixing system is fun to experiment with as well.

While I don't remember that well boss tracks on top of mind, there are exceptional tracks hidden that you can unlock as you progress through the game! Lots of french lyrics though that not many will be able to appreciate as much as I did.

The world is interesting and the story is good. I'd say some characters are more interesting than the overarching narrative. Just like souls games, you can learn a ton about the story through item descriptions, though you won't be piecing the narrative together in an eureka moment like Elden Ring. Investing time in reading all items didn't bring gigantic satisfaction like some souls games did. Also, for about half of the game the story felt comically similar to Bloodborne for me to the point I had a hard time seeing it as its own. The last quarter of the game did resolve that and showed off far better its own themes and brought its own fair share of poignant moments.

Overall, Lies of P was a great experience with clear flaws that make it fall short of the better From Software games. Howveer, It is a VERY impressive first souls like from Neowiz that I must applaud and just great experience on its own.",1707693802,1707693802,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great atmosphere, clear visuals. They copied Fromsoft's homework with the UI.

Gameplay: 9.5/10
The gameplay awesome. You need to switch between a dark souls playstyle to a sekiro parry playstyle depending on the situation. Trying to figure out when to switch between the two was really fun!

Story: 9/10
A very simple yet interesting story of how the city came to be what it is. Though I'm looking forward to how they'll connect other fairy tales with this style and atmosphere.

The tracks are very different from other soulslikes. Still very moody yet it deviates from the traditional orchestral pieces which is a really nice change of pace.

Voice Acting: 8/10
I liked majority of the VAs here. But there was something off about sophia's voice.

The fact that you need to make crucial decisions within 5 seconds, not being able to fully consider what you're being asked, does not work at all and many people have posted about having panic selected and picked the wrong answer because they weren't sure which gave them the outcome they were looking for. The entire ending of this game is dependent upon you realising that not giving Geppetto your heart is the good ending (giving you access to the final boss), and not doing so not only gives you the bad ending but leads to you slaughtering every friendly npc in the hub world and replacing them with puppets, which is such an absurd tonal shift in the game, painting Geppetto as some cartoonishly evil villain. 

I'm obviously incredibly bitter about this because it has meant that a nearly 30 hour play through, where I tried my best to pick the high-honour option in every dialogue choice, has gone to waste and I'll have to replay the entire game again in order to have another shot at not messing up. I understand that Geppetto is painted as somewhat untrustworthy in latter parts of the game, and some have pointed to that you following his instructions at the end may make you less of a human, which is fine, if I had time to consider this, instead I'm forced into making a decision on a quick timer to force drama but actually leading to such a disappointing conclusion.

Not to mention, as I say, that you miss out on the final boss if you choose this, and the last boss you will have faced becomes Simon Manus, Elden Beast 2.0. He has infinite poise, constantly casts spells (some literally the same ones as Elden Beast), has huge-range attack strings that he'll constantly spam as you run away from spells, has little punishment windows, near impossible to posture break, constantly jumps away across the massive arena, has a huge health pool, need I go on? Such a disappointing boss, that I have to consider my final boss.

On top of all this, the last location is some elaborately huge castle that has no business being so large, I was so tired as I was nearing the top, always hoping I'd be going into the last bit, but there'd always be more. For context, most areas have on average 3/4 bonfires, but the final location has 10, with the distance between each one being substantial. 

Honestly, the majority of this game is really good, though I'm not rushing to replay it like I was with other souls games, but the latter section is just such a huge letdown that I cannot help but feel angry that I wasted all that time to have some terrible ending/final fight thrust onto me because I didn't choose the right decision quick enough.",1707657912,1707657912,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

From Software did a good job with Elden Ring to allow players select the play of style and to get further in difficulty level step by step but lies of p is pure (go trough or die) = PURE FRUSTRATION (be warned!)

Same experience bosses are even more difficult to ""challenge you more and more"". Even with level 100+ two hits are enough to finish you. Even after completing the game once NG+ is nothing for you it is again pure ""FRUSTRATION and PAIN"" by playing it again.

It really captured everything I love about the genre. How you discover the little bits of lore, the few key choices, how you can miss paths and items, the difficulty, variety of weapons, enemy design, everything.

I will say this though, this is the most familiar souls-like by far, not trying to mess with the formula at all. I played this game *EXACTLY* like dark souls, which for me is not a problem. Another point is that there are a few difficulty spikes and some bosses were made with the player using the shadow summon in mind, so if you try to do everything solo like me, some bosses feel very unfair. Beating them is very rewarding nonetheless.

Back in the day, there were mods called ""Total Conversions"", which meant they changed almost every aspect of the game to the point where it felt like a new game using the same foundations. Lies of P feels like a Total Conversion mod of Dark Souls. It would take a giant paragraph to list all of the identical features stolen from Dark Souls, but suffice to say it really does just feel like a super fancy mod.

But a victorian/steampunk re-skin of Dark Souls is pretty fun! The story is well told and interesting. It feels much more like a cinematic journey than Dark Souls where you have to dig to learn the lore. Lies of P has cutscenes and dialog explaining what's going on. The gameplay is good, and I genuinely prefer some of the features over Souls games. For example parrying being just blocking at the right moment rather than being a separate button, and I enjoyed playing with the ""Organ"" skill tree system. I always wished Dark Souls had slightly more RPG mechanics. The lying/humanity system was interesting as well.

The weapon system in Lies of P really stands out though. I don't think its better or worse than the Souls weapons system, but it's new and fun. Boss weapons that you trade their ""soul"" for (exactly like Souls games) are static, but all other weapons come in 2 parts that you can mix and match to your hearts content: a blade and a handle. The blade determines the damage type and critical strike animation, while the handle determines the overall weapon animation. Total weight determines the animation's speed. So for example you can take a giant wrench hammer head and slap it on a baton's handle, making a very bulky strange club. Or you can pull a big spear head off a spear and put a knife blade on instead, making a rapid-attack poke stick. Some combos aren't as good as others, for example putting the giant wrench head onto the spear shaft means you poke with a blunt object and it's not as effective--but it's not a big penalty if you have an idea you love. My personal favorite was this giant bone-saw-blade (normally a huge two hander) stuck onto a butcher knife handle, making a fast and deadly serrated machete with good reach.

Visuals are pretty, no issues with performance.

I don't have much in the way of criticisms but here are my main 3:
- Personally I felt no desire to play through it again with another character or even NG+. I just felt like I had experienced everything the game had to offer after 40hrs--which is a great amount of playtime don't get me wrong, it's just that I have hundreds of hours put into each Souls game from making bunches of new characters and doing NG+ runs and still wanting to go back and play more. Lies of P didn't have that appeal to me. I think partially because you are a defined character (P) going through his story.
- The levels are beautiful, though often not well laid out like Souls games are famous for. It just kinda feels like amateurs trying to copy the Souls level design to be honest. The attempt is there, but it's just not pulled off with the level of skill that From Soft delivers.
- Derivative gameplay, it doesn't really bring much originality to the table besides the weapon system and dark-fairytale story/setting.

Overall a solid ""B"" rating from me. I'm glad I played it, I had a good time. And now I'm uninstalling it and going back to playing old Souls games for the 10th time.",1707511257,1707511455,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

+ Generous enough with unlockable shortcuts that you can retry bosses fairly quickly, if not immediately, and without risking using too many resources getting back to the arena.

Flaws that have work-arounds:
- I got locked out of the conclusion of a subplot just because I talked to NPCs in the hub in the wrong order (and at that point, you're just notified that they have stuff to say). It definitely feels like a design oversight that the devs should fix.
- Respeccing the level is unlocked a couple bosses too late (I think). I'm sure speccing is more intuitive for Souls buffs, but people like me coming from action games where the character is configured one particular way probably could just end up with a bad build.
- Related to the respeccing issue: The skill tree is very confusing at first, and the way you fill in slots to access additional tiers (phases) is counter-intuitive. Definitely watch one of those video tutorials fans made on how to get the most out of it. Basically you can access the later tiers much sooner with the same number of points by just allocating them a certain way.",1707286119,1707286119,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wanted to like this game, but I can't. It's like walking on a staircase where all the steps are fairly balanced, and then at chapter 8 you suddenly hit a wall of 50 steps melted together. At that point it wasn't fun any longer.

The core problem of the game is that it tries desperately to emulate the souls formula, but it misses the mark: there is barely any sense of progress; the bosses appear just huge hit sponges and take mostly no damage at all to your hits; and some of them are just broken, with no possibility to parry or dodge any of their hits. 
The last boss fight I managed to tolerate (the swamp monster. don't give a sh*t about spoilers) gives you no opportunity to dodge, to block or (even less) parry. If the game decides you must get a hit, you must take it and not complain.

I understood that the developers wanted to give a brutal experience because they believe souls players like it, but that's not actually what makes a Souls game good: it's the sense of progress and growth, which I haven't seen at all in their attempt to emulate their formula. 

Another example is the level design. A beautiful and famously well designed level in the From games is the Cathedral of the Deep, in Dark Souls III. The level is famous because it has just one bonefire where all the routes converge, and you unlock all the routes one by one by progressing in the level. This game is heavily inspired by that formula, which the developer put straight on chapter 3. And then on chapter 4, and then on chapter 5, and so on. 

I'm very sorry as I really wanted to like this game, but it has been a very long waste of time. I would consider twice if I'll take anything from this software house in the future.

EDIT:

I know that a common argument against my review would be ""git gud"". I'm very sorry but I refuse it: gitting gud should be fun, and not a chore. It was fun in Sekiro (best game ever on the genre), it was fun in Elden Ring, it was fun in the Dark Souls series, but not here. If gitting gud for the game becomes a chore, then I'm sorry but I can quit.

Yes I know weapons can scale, and weapon scaling per  characteristic is completely negligible. Good? Bad? I don't care. The important thing is to give players fair methods to defeat hit sponges bosses. And on a certain point onwards, the game does become unfair.

Concerning the specific boss, you enter the arena, and the boss welcomes you with either popping from the ground, or an unparriable charge, and no, you can't avoid either of them. Afterwards, it stands up and hits, and you can block, parry or dodge, but none of them wouldn't work, and you must take the hit. In the end, the only way for sorting it out is to get to their back and stab repeatedly with your fire blade. Then it comes the second phase, where (in addition to the previous behaviour) the boss now can hit you from every side and doesn't stay put. Again: good? Bad? I don't care. It wasn't fun any longer.",1707173941,1707244442,False,8,2,0.508972108364105225,2,True,False,False

Then after a bit of waiting the full game dropped (naturally i preordered it) when i started it was quite difficult and i had a hard time while playing and sadly didn't have time to finish it. After months i came back and finally completed this masterpiece of a game, the final boss was decently challenging but actually felt easier than some of the starter bosses, naturally this was because i had finally grasped the mechanics... I love the weapons in this game most feel unique and purposeful and there is a weapon for any and every playstyle. I would EXTREMELY recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed any Fromsoft game especially Bloodborne for the aesthetic and Sekiro for the gameplay mechanics... Bosses feel genuinely good to fight and it never ever felt unfair well except Luxasia (i hate this boss with a passion), my favourite boss fight was White Lady she was super fun even though i struggled for a few attempts... The world was genuinely so fun and interesting to explore and i always tried to find and see everything before moving on to the next region, i really love the hidden lore details around the place... I feel the endings are satisfying and fit extremely well depending on what actions you chose during gameplay...

+- The game requires you to go through a skill tree system in order to get abilities you have from the start in most Souls games. But the ability upgrades it can offer are actually pretty neat.

- The endgame has super flail-y enemies and bosses with ridiculous long combo strings and no stamina limit.

- The game starts you with the ability to level up at any checkpoint, then takes it away after the first hour. You only have it back in the endgame.

- Bloodborne except if it had Dark Souls 2 level design and an enemy is going to sneak attack you around every corner in the very first level.

(Dark souls, Elden Ring, Sekiro, etc) If so, then you will almost certainly like this game. However, I must stress just HOW GOOD this game is as a souls-like.

This is, bar none, the best souls like experience I have played not developed by From Software. The combat is weighty and feels excellent, there are a variety of weapons and other combat options to choose from, and how you approach various encounters has the proper elements of tension, but with tools to do the job. 

Furthermore, the map design in this game is amazing. It felt like every time I made a decent amount of progress, just when I was starting to worry about the possible trek back through if I died, there would be a shortcut back to a previous checkpoint, or a new one. And in keeping with this, the pacing of the game is almost perfect. It never felt like I had a great deal of downtime between major events, and I was always hyper-focused while playing.

It is a more linear experience than most of from-soft's catalog, but in so doing is a shorter and more focused experience. I was able to beat the entire game in about 30 hours, but that was going back to previous areas and covering every square inch of this title for secrets. You could probably beat it in 20 or less if you didn't necessarily want to find everything.

Especially during a boss fight with lots of animation. It seems the character is stuck in animation somehow, just standing there doing nothing even when the key is pressed repeatedly.

EDIT: Turns out, what I thought was a problem is actually me being dumb, didn't realize the stamina bar was empty. Since then, I have been having a blast with this game! What a gem!

Graphics is beautiful. Level design to me is great. Story is captivating and narrated well. Plenty of options for weapons as well. The best thing for me is the fighting mechanics! Even though the character can dodge and guard, I feel like the game is leaning much more toward (perfect) guarding. The perfect guard window is very tight which I think is intentional (a good decision by the developers in my opinion) since that encourages players to also adopt dodging into their fighting style, not just 100% guarding. Dodging in this game I think is meant to be used strategically in a sense that you dodge not just to avoid being hit but to also set it up for your next counter attack. Once I got a hang of perfect guarding and dodging, the game started becoming more fluid, somewhat easier and greatly more enjoyable.

For me bosses are harder then in DS, especially the last 3, while the road between bosses is quite linear and doesn't give any trouble.

On par in difficultly to souls series, but you can make it super easy by spamming throwables at bosses along with aid from Specters.

edit 1:
It's shocking seeing people say this is as good as the average dark souls game when this doesn't even clear dark souls 2. Struggle to solve the basic dark souls enemy design problem of circle strafing and slapping their cheeks being the end all be all solution to fighting anything. Has the classic problem of a boss that's reasonably difficult solo being less than trivial when summoning a single person. You can't pause this game for some reason despite it being single player. Rips off the perilous attack warning system from Sekiro but rather than this being excusable by being improved upon it's somehow worse. Attacks and rolling don't feel as though they have as much weight as they should, the biggest miss being the sound design around rolling.
Takes the health recovery mechanic from bloodborne where lost health can be recovered by attacking enemies shortly after taking damage. However you can only do this with health lost from guarding for some reason. While this does support the decision to not have shields it also slows down combat by incentivizing hard guarding more. The inclusion of a mechanic to regenerate an estus flask charge by dealing damage to enemies is a good inclusion to help solve the problem of pacing being slowed down by having to retreat to a campfire too often. They cripple their own design decision by making this making only function when you have no estus charges left. This means that the only time it will be useful in practice is in boss fights.
The decision to include a weapon durability mechanic is just awful. I've yet to run out of weapon durability from a single encounter and just repair in between fights. This means the mechanic is just a time wasting nothing in practice.

It has similar elements of story telling albeit still having direct story telling, the gameplay is some of the most polished I've played in the genre, it has a great artistic style, and it feels satisfying. 

Its not without its flaws though. My main complaints are the way perfect guards work, the p organ tree, and gear balancing.

Perfect guard has one flaw that games like sekiro didn't: its too precise for the way its implemented. The timing for a perfect guard changes based upon where you and the enemy are standing. Due to how precise the timing is, you need to stand still unless you want it to be super inconsistent. Combine this with things that cannot be guarded and things that are way too risky to try to guard and you can get a frustrating experience.

The p organ (aka your skill tree) feels padded out: The main issue is invaluable things like dodge improvements are in the tree and if you skip them you will make your time worse. The tree is also counter intuitive wherein you actually want to fill out the first 2 phases in their entirety before moving onto the later phases because of how the minor nodes scale with completed full nodes and not the phase itself.

Every defensive piece of gear will only get heavier and there are no lightweight sets unless you go for basically naked or starting gear which in this game is a major downside. HP scaling is similar to Elden Ring but defensive scaling of gear is almost the same way in terms of carry weight. Pretty much every build is going to want to dump a ton of points into carry capacity because otherwise you'll be getting 1 shot with 40+ points into health.  20 points of health and 20 points of carry weight is vastly superior to 40 points of health. I'd even argue that 20 health and 40 carry is more valuable than the inverse.",1706989508,1706989508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Take Sekiro for example, you get stuck on a hard boss, your thinking of giving up but you desperately want to see the end of the game, you persevere, you overcome the challenge and it is massively satisfying.

I am certain that you could put the Fromsoftware logo onto it and people would believe it given the quality of this game.
Lies of P not only takes elements from the Soulsborne games it even improves on them. Even exceeding Fromsoftware in some regards like weapon durability. The game has the most mechanically similarities with Sekiro and Bloodborne, but is a clone of neither. You can't play it as you would Sekiro because the Parry mechanic works differently and you can't play it just like Bloodborne either because you have to mix up the Parries/perfect Guards with Dodges. 
Major bosses give you a Spector you can summon to help you in the fight and they balanced better than the NPC summons in the dark souls games in my opinion because they do not make the boss an easy win but they are also not useless either. They come at cost of a star fragment and considering how the star fragment aren't hard to come by means that the cost of a Spector is rather cheap. 
The only real critic I have is that I feel like that the difficulty at said major bosses can spike a bit to much from the difficulty of their area. What gave me the feeling that sometimes the intended you to use the sectors. 
I would recommend everyone that likes the Soulsborne games to give this game a shot as it can defiantly compete with Fromsoftwares games. However, I couldn't promise you that you will like it because Lies of P is different enough from Froms games to be its own thing.

I think there's a lot here for the right kind of player, but I also feel that so much of the game is made worse by very strange decisions that only serve to make the game more annoying. I was not able to finish the game, and I was very reluctant to post a review without doing so, but after putting 50 hours into it, I think I have enough experience to form an opinion. 

This is a fairly standard souls-like game. At the beginning, it's extremely fast-paced, and resembles Bloodborne more than anything, including the plot. At first I was worried the game was *too* similar, but it built up its own world as the game went on and introduced enough unique mechanics to separate it as its own game. That being said, I had a lot of fun playing. Unfortunately, the further along I got, the more the game seemed to focus on a plot that is inconsistent with the gameplay, and gameplay that demanded I use certain abilities over others, rather than allow me to focus on the abilities I found most fun, as it did at the beginning. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Like I mentioned before, the game feels extremely similar to Bloodborne at first, but slowly defines itself as the game goes on. Walking through city streets and neighborhoods, the map design felt both fun and realistic, and the enemy placement made sense, and was dense enough to pose a challenge. I found myself just walking around areas after I cleared them just to imagine what they were like before the frenzy.

As the game went on however, closer to the final third or so, it's clear how you're intended to play the game: You either need to dish out damage so fast the enemy can't get an attack in, or perfectly parry everything. By the point in the game I stopped at, the boss Laxasia the Complete, there is no in-between. I felt like most bosses I beat in the late-game were only because they missed me on accident, or they just got stuck in a corner long enough that I was finally able to land a hit. 

I'm very aware that I'm probably just not that good at the game, and that if I tried harder, for longer, I could probably beat it. I've beaten DS1, 2, 3 Bloodborne, and Elden Ring, so I felt rather confident I could *eventually* get good enough. But like I said, it got to a point where I was just hoping to get lucky rather than making any actual improvement. Even a game like Sekiro, which I honestly couldn't beat, took more skill than blind luck. 

There were some very strange map decisions too. One of the side-missions I did had me look across a district for a specific house number. Except only five buildings in the entire district had house numbers, four of them had the same number, and the one I was looking for was on a second-story balcony. I guess the city-planners of Krat had some difficulty with deciding what would go where or something.

[b]Plot[/b]
I don't want to spoil too much plot-wise, and I will say it stays interesting the whole way through, but there are certain aspects that don't make very much sense if you think about them for very long. There's a heavy emphasis on a Puppet King that's apparently mobilizing frenzied puppets to a common goal, but that's not at all how it seems in-world, they just act like their frenzied. Then, after killing the King, there's frequent reference to the puppets losing a sense of direction and aggression, then you go to the next area to find literally nothing has changed. Further along, you can find an audio recording coming from the Puppet King that makes a baseless claim about the instigator of the puppet frenzy, without providing any evidence. Then you have an option to tell someone you ""know"" who's the instigator, or to hide it. But I have no reason to believe the recording, there is no evidence to support the claim, and the claim was made by someone who apparently sought the genocide of the city. 

There's also a character named Gemini who's more or less attached to you throughout the game. Not once, and I mean *never* does this character provide anything at all to the story. He constantly asks questions the player already necessarily asks themself, and restates the blatantly obvious after any plot development is made. I found myself muting the game anytime this guy started talking, because it really was completely useless.

It's a shame, because a vast majority of the characters were quite interesting, many of them very likeable! I really wanted to see it to the end. I came up with a few theories about what was going on, and enjoyed the dialogue and voice acting very much, but the constant ""tell-don't-show"" approach to the story made it very difficult to care later on.

--
[b]In conclusion,[/b] I absolutely loved the environment, the graphics, and really the whole first two-thirds of the game. It was fast-paced, with a spooky, interesting plot, and challenging gameplay that demanded variety from the player. As it drew towards the climax though, it started demanding perfection, and the plot felt confused about what story it was even trying to tell. 

I imagine a great deal of my opinion was formed by my lack of skill, and that my annoyance with the plot could be due to my misunderstanding of it. Most people seem to love this game, and I did really like a lot of it. It just seems like significantly less effort was put into the final parts than the beginning.

[h3]tl;dr:[/h3]
This game is really interesting and fun, and gets more so until about the halfway point. Then it just gets harder and more confusing until it demands perfection, and the plot just feels lost. I might just be bad at the game, or maybe the story would've made sense at the very end, but its just not fun to beat a boss and feel like it was almost pure luck that did it.",1706920745,1706921000,False,10,2,0.563029468059539795,0,True,False,False

Honestly, I don't know what I could criticize here because I don't see any major mistakes or problems, the only thing I missed was the number of weapons because there were few of them, but it's a smaller production, so that's how it is. If you like difficult games that can give you satisfaction from the level of challenge, this game is for you, otherwise I don't recommend buying it because it will become a pain. In my opinion, the dialogues and the fight are at a high level and this aspect is well done. Generally, the whole game is made very well, and there can always be some small problems, but luckily I didn't have any.

In short: If you want a challenge with the feel of the Souls games, this game is for you. If you want a challenge that is also an enjoyable and fair experience, this is not. DON'T get this as your first soulslike either, as even in the genre I'd call it one of the most difficult ones.

The Good: The art style and character/enemy design are interesting and fresh. The lore and setting as a twisted take on the fairytale of Pinocchio is a cool idea with all the references and characters. Recombining weapons is a fun feature that makes combat fairly customizable (although it can feel overwhelming), with different elemental damage, physical damage types, move sets and special attacks. Another welcome aspect is how clothing choices are separate from the ""armor"" that gives your character their defensive stats. Legion arms remind me of the shinobi prosthetics in Sekiro and give you more gameplay and combat options. You can further upgrade your character stats, skill-tree (unlocking more heals, item slots, etc.), weapons (both blades and handles), legion arms, ... In general, more customization is probably welcome for most players (recommended to check out what the stat upgrades do!) and luckily you can reset all your stats from a certain point in the game. The general areas give you a good amount of room to explore but not too much and are challenging enough with some tougher enemies sprinkled into the lot of cannon-fodder.

The Not-So-Good: While I get that this is a soulslike, it seems like it's trying to copy FromSoft's homework a bit too closely sometimes. How the story is told, the very bleak and desaturated atmosphere, and also the types of areas don't really stray away too far from what you'd expect from the genre and I wish they could have made it less straight-up Bloodborne-meets-Bioshock in setting. The fairytale theme could have provided something more saturated and psychedelic elements with e.g. a narrator voice giving you more information about the world and events when discovering books (or basically anything that isn't just reading text in a menu). Level design, while well-executed with the various shortcuts, can feel a bit uninspired, especially when knee-high suitcases or other objects are the invisible walls that block your way. I am split about the weapons wearing and breaking, as they are mostly just a thing to worry about but it's also fair as enemy weapons will also break eventually. Also not sure why we can't get a proper pause button.

The Bad: Mixing core combat elements from Bloodborne (rally) and Sekiro (deflect) sounds good on paper, but it opens up various issues. In Bloodborne, you take damage even when blcoking but can you get back health by dealing damage to enemies regardless of whether you were blocking or not. In Sekiro you don't take blocking damage (unless you're playing one of the ""optional hard modes"") and there is no stamina bar, but your posture can break, leaving you open for attacks. While the former is more dodge heavy and the latter wants you to take on your enemies head-on and deflect, they both have mechanics in place that support the play-styles. In Lies of P, you take damage while blocking, your posture can break if you're blocking hits while out of stamina, you don't get the chance to regain health from taking hits that you didn't block and dodging does not feel that useful in most boss fights. ""Unblockable"" attacks only leave you with the option to deflect perfectly or go out of the way, if at all possible. Adding to that is the very unintuitive-feeling parrying as it needs to be pressed very close to but not quite on the hit and, unlike Sekiro, having no attack-canceling mid swing. Which brings us to...

The Ugly: How the combat comes together with mini-bosses and especially in the true boss-fights is the most frustrated I have been in a long time. The game demands crazy precision and speed with your deflects, which wouldn't be so bad if the boss-design and gameplay mechanics would play into that. Main issues here being 1) how hard it is to read moves with the camera and bodies of large bosses concealing their hits, 2) windup and hit-times being ridiculously inconsistent from crazy long windups with lightning-fast hits to unblockable attacks coming almost instantaneously, 3) the crazy onslaught of hits with precise tracking that some of the bosses put out, especially 2 late-game ones, which also suffer from particle effects blurring a lot of their telegraphs. If blocking was a safer option, if deflecting was more lenient in timing, if attack-canceling existed, if the camera showed the huge fists of enemies coming down instead of leaving them off-screen, if you had different ways to interact with unblockables, the move-sets wouldn't feel so cheap and frustrating.

Overall: Good visual design, lore and music. If you like the atmosphere of games like BioShock, the Souls series and Dishonored, this will appeal to you in terms of atmosphere. If you want challenge, it's an obvious recommendation, but it often verges into the ""hard for the sake of being hard"" category and the difficulty is in part due to the implementation of gameplay mechanics. Definitely a great first attempt by the developer in this genre. However, there is definite room for improvement and also innovation on the genre.",1706878481,1706878481,False,1,0,0.459476709365844727,0,True,False,False

I like the weapon idea of handle blade combinations and getting different fable arts but if slash or stab don't go together u get a dmg penalty reducing the creativity if they got rid of it a great weapon system that's alot more interactive instead of legendary weapons being the go to. Bosses are kinda forgettable or Very frustrating the black rabbit brotherhood fights in particular the first one is better done imo. The combat system is by far the hardest with a mixture of BloodBorne and sekiro but parrying time window is much shorter I enjoyed the challenge. The map structure in this game is very linear and probably their only flaw that there is no alternate paths its more like you're walking in straight line towards the boss which isn't a bad thing but i prefer a more open intertwined map.

Clean timing and hitboxes, fluidly animated attacks which are readable while remaining challenging, and visual and audio design on-point that will have you savouring every blow landed and feeling the visceral vibration of every strike parried... it's got it all.

I played this right off the back of [i]Lords of the Fallen[/i], a game which I feel is so similar to [i]Elden Ring[/i] (particularly in terms of combat) that it must deserve a far better reception than it gets, simply by virtue of being so similar to the latter game so widely hailed as a masterpiece.  Playing [i]Lies of P[/i] strengthened my belief in the kinship of those two games in another way: [b]to me, [i]Lies of P[/i] is the S-Tier combat game which puts these other two Souls-likes firmly in the A or even B-tier by comparison.[/b]  At least for combat - which is the main draw of the genre, I think - these other games, though great in their own right, feel flimsy compared to the crispness of [i]Lies of P[/i].  I also think it's a more difficult game, but since the immaculate combat also makes it more [i]fair[/i], it's less frustrating despite the added challenge.  I never suffered a death in this game that left me uncertain of what I could've done differently to prevent it; even if there are a few ""gotcha"" moments, they're always clearly understandable so that they can be avoided with the proper approach on subsequent attempts.

The developers have also done away with some (though not all) of the genre's unfortunate tropes, and gone their own way, often to great effect.  Even just the small touches are refreshing, like icons on waypoints to indicate new opportunities for dialogue or quests, and placing dropped XP outside the entrance to the boss room instead of inside.  The weapon customization system is interesting, though I didn't find myself experimenting with it too much on my first playthrough.  Overall, though we still have some issues like a few long-ish walks back to boss fights and a bit of obscurity to the mechanics at first (maybe I missed a tutorial popup, but I had no clue of the benefits of ""Motivity"" vs. ""Advance"" at first, and decided to look it up), it feels like the developers understood and improved upon the genre's formula in making this game.

In conclusion, while I spent a portion of this review lauding the greatness of [i]Lies of P[/i] at the expense of other games, the game is so good that what it has actually done is make me develop a new passion for the entire genre, a more complete understanding of it for having experienced the best it can offer.  I feel as though it has heightened my senses, and I want to return to those aforementioned games to see what I might have been missing, as well as try new and old ones which I haven't yet played.  But more than that, I think I might just go straight back into [i]Lies of P[/i] for an immediate second run - something I almost never do - and delight again in experiencing the pinnacle of a genre I've come to love.",1706734046,1706810086,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Like Bloodborne and Sekiro had a child, with ""child"" being the operative word. I feel this game does everything Bloodborne does, but in a less-polished way. To be specific, levels feel extremely linear and the combat itself is nothing to write home about. Also, a lot of the ""show don't tell"" story-telling also just feels sub-par, particularly when comparing to From Soft games.

The theme of this review is clearly ""comparison is the thief of joy"", and I acknowledge I would likely find much more enjoyment were this my first souls-like. As it stands, however, I feel that the sum of the game's parts don't equate to a satisfying experience for me.

There's a lot to like here, but for me personally I find everything about this game to be lacking.

There's no grey area for recommending games here, so I had to go with the no-recommend.

The soundtrack in particular is quite brilliant and records can be found in-game to be used as a mechanic for obtaining a certain outcome of the story. Speaking of story, it is put together very well, with almost all NPCs and bosses having relevance to the main plot. In addition, there are quite a lot of choices you can make that alter the fates of these characters, and not always for the better. 

Highly recommend for souls veterans and newcomers alike, as well as those who enjoy a good story. Just be ready for a fight.

One minute you're fighting through a dismal, dark, depressing world; the next, you're fighting a beefcake boss with a WWE intro as his opening cutscene. Or you're listening to your partner cricket role play as a tour guide. I personally didn't find the cricket's dialogue annoying, but I can see why others might. I liked the idea of including a bit of humor despite the mood, but it makes it hard sometimes to fully understand the tone the game is trying to set. There's just such large gaps of rogue machines, death, dismemberment, and disease between the lighthearted bits that it kinda throws you off guard when it happens.

There is a lack of enemy variety and the game is so riddled with ambush encounters and traps that it just got painfully predictable after a while. Nearly every single pickup item had an ambush waiting next to it; and nearly every single enemy wandering around alone was bait for a second enemy to sneak up on you. A good chunk of the first half of the game was spent fighting the same enemy that opened with the same easily counterable attack every time. While the enemy variety got slightly better as I progressed, it wasn't enough to offset the bad taste from earlier areas.

The combat feels a bit too stiff and slow and lacks that extra layer of polish that's supposed to bring all of its components together. There is almost no poise, so there's less of an incentive to opt in for the heavy stuff. You may be unfairly knocked out of charge attacks or certain abilities because of this, which is very important if you want to land visceral attacks.

Contrary to popular opinion, the bosses were a highlight for me. While the overuse of the ""second phase boss"" was pretty annoying, overall they were a nice throwback to older trial-and-error boss design. Most bosses were a healthy mix of learning the boss' pattern, and general skill.

This game was very close to being a masterpiece, but a lack of polish in areas where it mattered kept it from shining. I'm ultimately torn on whether or not to give a positive or negative review so I'll just consider the current steam rating and decide whether or not I think it should be higher or lower.",1706610251,1706625410,False,1,1,0.444476187229156494,0,True,False,False

It has stunning art, out of this world music, beautiful story, and lovable characters. It's not too deep when it comes to theme, yet not shallow either. Tbh it's quite coherent comparing to a lot of other indie souls-likes.
Gameplay wise it's a nice mix of Bloodborne+Sekiro+Eldenring. It can be a bit off-putting at first because the combat logic has some unique ideas that souls veterans need to learn and not just play it like *insert souls game here*. The weapons and combining system are extremely varied and a excellent innovation.

The level design is very boring (outside of the amazing visuals) and progressing through levels after the first couple just became a slog of doing the same charged strong attack to bring down simple mooks in a single hit. Then to cap that off every boss felt like I was fighting two back to back which wasn't a lot of fun since I quite enjoyed getting good at phase 1, but then having to redo phase 1 again and again and again just to get to practice phase 2? Add to that the fact that I never really got a hang of the dodging because it was just easier to throw on defense and get perfect blocks, so I never really mastered the combat other than that annoyingly small perfect block window.

There is a good game in there if you want more of this sort of combat, and what is does well it does exceptionally well, but for me the bad parts dragged more than the good justified.

The Soulslike genre evolved and refined its mechanics for over a decade. Lies of P came in and tried to redesign most of them in order to stand out. When that didn't pay out it become overly complicated to compensate for bad basic mechanics.

Less is more, and just a litte bit of structure goes a long way - all games in this genre, including FROM, should take notes, because this is currently the pinnacle of souls-based games stories. 

Difficulty can be a bit jarring, especially towards the end, but trudging through it really payed off. I don't say this lightly, but this game can easily be called a masterpiece and not many games can reach this praise, at least not in my book. 

Congrats to the devs for taking souls-games to the next level and proving that there's more to the genre than just haphazardly throwing bits of lore here and there and calling it a story. Soundtrack is out of this world, artstyle is on point, ambience and atmosphere are AMAZING, enemies have variety, bosses are not rehashes, combat and weapons are ingenious, scope is just right and I absolutely adore the setting - very much looking forward to the DLCs, sequels and what other fairy tales we'll get to explore.

Towards all the negativity aimed at the difficullty, especially by the self-proclaimed ""veterans"" around: even though I've finished all Dark Souls, Elden Ring, Bloodborne and other souls-likes - I can safely say that I do not consider myself a great souls player by any means - I'm a sword and board scrub and could never get consecutive perfect parries in these type of games (reason why I never even started playing Sekiro in the first place), thus aiming towards dodge builds mostly. But the difficulty here felt just right and even finished this on NG+ which is a first because of time restraints -  but what worked for me is taking a different approach where i got stuck - what worked a lot of times was going full on aggro with a very fast technique scaled weapon (usually Etiquette), Aegis equipped for easy parries and less than 30% weight for quick recovery and dodging, with a bit of physical resistances on (lose some of the equipment to reach the weight threshold if needed). And just pushing through...again...and again...and again. In the end it all payed off.

 Thanks for an amazing  experience. Truly.

Believe all the people saying that the guys at Neowiz have cracked the code to FromSoft's iconic formula, an incredible feat from the developers behind the debacle that was Bless Online.

The combat is tight and offers many options to approach battles. The weapon crafting system is expansive and deep, allowing for a reasonable amount of builds, and the level of customization is impressive despite the main character being the same for everyone.

A caveat though: while sticking close to the source material, the game is quite linear, going from chapters to chapters with few reasons to revisit previous areas. The level design is also a little lacking -the first few areas in particular- and it only picks up starting with the factory.

Tonally, LoP also borrows from its inspiration, but is distinct enough as to carve its own identity. It is as dark as it gets but it leans more towards a macabre fable than the gruesome dark fantasy or cosmic horror themes from its peers. 
The story, while endearing, is also much less cryptic than your usual FromSoft game, what may be a good or a bad thing depending on whom you ask. But when it lands, it lands hard and by the time you see the credits rolling, you'll be most certainly left wanting for more.

And I definitely hope that there will be more, as this Lies of P has all the qualities to be the start a new promising franchise, on par with the all-time greats that made the punishing Souls genre so successful.",1701258700,1706356288,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I believe Shigeru Miyamoto once said that you should never be prevented from completing a game because of a prior mistake, and while LoP does not formally make completion impossible, I am certain many players will find a certain point in the plot insurmountable.

At the point I mentioned, the game removes your ability to fast travel, to fully respec, and to buy most consumable items. This is before a boss, and there is no warning whatsoever. I anticipate fan rejection of what I've said, so please check my achievements: I beat the boss. It  took a few tries, but I did so. I am also a veteran player of this genre, and I do not expect every player to be able to match that. 'Git gud' is not a response to a flawed game. Asking $50 for a game you may have to hard reset 2/3rds of the way through is not acceptable. The developers made a catastrophically bad design choice, and I will remain a negative review on LoP, regardless of its many other high points.

Original review follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So Lies of P is a good game. I want to stress that, and I'm going to highlight the highs first.

1) The records are some of the greatest music ever encountered in a game. They are just perfect, that sweet, melancholy, aching sort of composition. I invite anyone to hear Feel and not think about the people they've cared about most, and yet lost. I invite anyone to hear Fascination and not just feel the pain of life drawn up and exposed, like someone expertly massaging a knot in the back muscles.

2) The bosses are good! They're quite good, they're nice.

3) The opening levels are great, just fantastic design.

Okay. I really like this game. I wanted it to succeed, and it's a miracle it did. These are the things that don't work:

1) The level design past the first third is awful. If the designers didn't want you to simply run past every encounter, I have no idea what they were doing. If they *did* want you to run past every encounter, that's awful. That's just bad. The frustration of every level will ramp and ramp and ramp for artificial, stupid reasons, and you just have to roll with it if you like the game.

2) The bosses aren't amazing. I required no more than three tries on any boss so far, and I'm near the end game. Most bosses I one shot. This ties back into complaint #1: the difficulty of this game is bad design, not legitimately interesting design. You won't find Friede or Orphan or Malenia (so far, in my experience). You'll get a *ton* of Abyss Watchers-esque fights. Just so many. None of them are as good as Abyss Watchers, or Nameless King, or any other 2HB From boss you want to name, but lord will you have to fight them anyway.

3) The story ain't great. It's fine, but it won't scratch that weird itch. I started finding holes and just, like, 'why is this this way' things early on and it never gets better from what I can tell.

4) This is stupid, but Hotel Krat is obviously a modern-ish situation, the walls don't look Belle Epoch at all. Also, where are all the bathrooms? Does Geppetto pee out the window?",1706250181,1706342070,False,2,3,0.489590853452682495,2,True,False,False

Lies of P iterates very well from the usual souls-like formula. It cuts down on the bullshit parts, and adds some of its own flavours and identity to it. It may not have a super convoluted hide questlines, but the simplicity is for the better, it allows newer fresher players to catch on. Everything about this game is thoughtful and meticulously crafted, no dumb design decisions. 

I absolutely loved the narration. The story doesn't hand hold you. you are relatively free to see, hear, absorb or not absorb anything you want, and you are free to have your own ideas about the game about whats happening. It doesnt explicitly say you should do this, do that.

Music is absolutely phenomenal, the occasional mellow tunes just melt my heart to date. lighting, graphics, art, cutscene is on point too.

This in terms leads to a magical journey/experience. [spoiler] When you feel the emotions in the side quests and choose to acknowledge emotional sides of things and lie to people. The story shows this slow transition from puppet to human-like. And it is super beautiful for a game to indirectly subtely show this journey. No one told me to consider others feelings, but i just did so out of my own conscience and seeing P, grow hair, become human-like was a wow moment from me. ending wise the game does reward the humanity based one[/spoiler]

Lies of P is a great entry in the Souls-like genre, but ultimately, I just felt like putting it down before finishing because each major combat encounter pretty quickly became the song-and-dance of learning perfect guard timings and perfecting them. Once I got to my third phase-two fake-out boss in a row ([spoiler]Green Monster of the Swamp[/spoiler]), I realized I just wasn't really enjoying it like I was at the start of the game.

Beyond combat the game is great. The story and characters are intriguing, the art and graphics are beautiful, and the music and sound design are excellent (I started listening to the collectible gramophone tracks because [spoiler]they increase your humanity[/spoiler], but found myself genuine enjoying the songs for their own sake, for example).

But, in this genre, combat is the meat of the experience, and when the core of the game becomes too samey and, ultimately boring, I just have to put it down.

I'm marking myself as a ""no"" for a recommendation mostly because Steam demands a yes or no, and also because I just didn't think the combat was worth chewing through to finish the story, as good as the story is on its own. If you're a fan of big parries being the defining arc of combat then you'll probably get along better with this title than I did, and will likely enjoy it a lot, but it just wasn't for me in the end.",1706313842,1706313842,False,142,27,0.5763397216796875,0,True,False,False

Lies of P is a game that I never expected to be as good as it is. The quick synopsis for this game would be pretty-boy
Pinocchio beats up monstrosities and robots in a Bloodborne meets Sekiro style souls-like. Initially this concept 
sounds silly as hell, but when you start seeing what this game has to offer with the engaging combat and amount
of polish only seen in the likes of games by From Software as well as the incredible respect and attention to detail it has
for the source material it really is impressive.

Narrative:
• The narrative is actually rather captivating. Something that most Souls-like games lack is a clear narrative, which I can understand since the vagueness of most souls games is what can be intriguing to most people that play these games. BUT this game proves you can provide a compelling narrative that's ALSO full of mysteries and subtle details to discover while not being completely obfuscated. 
• The NPC's throughout the game are all rather charming and unique from one another, they provide a lot of different dialogue depending on you're point of progression in the game and they really start to grow on you. Also if you're curious enough you can find out more about their backgrounds by interacting with them.
• In terms of progression through levels the game can feel pretty linear and to some people who really like exploring alternative paths or fighting optional bosses this may leave more to be desired in that regard. Honestly though I don't consider this much of a con anyway since this game wasn't setting out to do this, they wanted to convey a tightly designed story with engaging combat and they delivered.

Graphics:
• The graphical fidelity and level design on this game is incredible. Seriously these guys understand what makes Souls environments so compelling when take things into consideration like atmosphere, shortcuts throughout levels, being able to see how the world interconnects or looking over places you previously passed through.
• Not only does this game look pretty, but the animations for each enemy is functionally very well done. Attacks are all telegraphed extremely well and things move in ways that make sense.
• Effects look pretty and again very polished, everything is conveyed so clearly that it's not something you even consciously think about which to me shows how well it's designed. You know exactly when a perfect guard is pulled off by the bright orange-yellow flashes, exactly when an enemy is suffering from a status effect both from their appearance such as flames licking off their body and coloured damage numbers by their healthbar to indicate their status effect, as well as the healthbar glowing white when ready to be staggered. You just start to feel these things and it doesn't distract you from the battle.

Combat:
• Combat in this game is the most engaged I've ever felt playing a souls-like. I'm sure if you've heard anything about this game
you've heard my previously mentioned statement of ""Bloodborne meets Sekiro"", and while it might seem like everyone's just repeating the same opinion without thought this statement really is a good way to describe it, BUT this is only the best way to describe it for people who haven't play this game yet. Lies of P does its own thing and you have to play it in its own unique way.
• Previously mentioned under my graphics bullet points is that the animations are all done extremely well, and this lends itself to
combat perfectly. In this game you quickly learn that you can time a guard to perfectly deflect enemy attacks, this not only
prevents you from taking damage but can also wear down the enemy's weapon and make them stagger. Fear not though, if you mess up a perfect deflect you will still block some damage and some of your health can be restored by attacking similar to Bloodborne. Once their healthbar glows white that means they can be staggered, so once you see that you can wait for an opening and smash 'em with a fully charged heavy attack or fable art to get a chance for a visceral attack-- but this isn't the only thing to combat. Bosses mix up their movement and attacks in ways that sometimes using your positioning or dodging can be a good tactic to avoid damage and create openings. 
• Expanding on my previous bullet point when fighting bosses you switch between parrying, moving, dodging, and attacking in a way that makes it feel you're not just trying to kill a big strong enemy but that you are PART OF the boss fight. The tools and tactics you're given never make you feel like you're outmatched or that a fight is unfair, once this game clicks you can take time to feel out the bosses movesets and then develop your own moveset and rhythms to counter and outplay them, like its an fair dual.
• One more point about the bosses is that each boss is memorable in terms of design, their moveset, and their arenas. Everything is hand crafted so well that each boss fight will remain in your head. Each boss being designed so specifically is why I believe the linear progression in this game isn't a bad thing, the experience is so tightly optimized.
• Even normal enemies throughout levels have this cadence in combat to a lesser extent so you don't get too fatigued but still 
actually feel engaged. To me this made fighting normal enemies less of a nuisance like some other souls-likes and more of something I actually enjoyed doing. 

Gameplay:
• Movement in this game feels as you'd expect, responsive and quick all with animations that reflect this. Quicker attacks feel fast and fluid, heavy attacks feel weighty and deliberate, dodging/sidestepping feels responsive.
• Weapon customization is the most fun they've ever been. In this game you can switch out different weapon handles
with different blades. The blade is the part of the weapon you upgrade and the handle is what determines the scaling and moveset, on top of that each handle and blade has a different ""Fable Art"" that's similar to Weapon Arts from Dark Souls so you can mix and match combos you like. You can also use a tool the game offers called Weapon Cranks to alter their scaling to better fit your build.
• Boss weapons are all unique in terms of design, appearance, and capabilities. I seriously wanted to try them all out to see how they'd change my playstyle. These weapons can't be disassembled like normal weapons but they make up for that by having incredibly unique capabilities.
• This game has a skill tree of sorts called the P-Organ(yes this is what it's actually called lol) that can be invested in using a 
resource in the game called Quartz. Each major upgrade such as increasing your amount of healing items requires a certain amount of Quartz socketed to it to be activated, and with each piece of Quartz you socket there are a multitude of minor upgrades to choose from which really makes you able to customize your abilities to best suit your playstyle.
• Throughout this game there's the theme of lying or telling the truth and these decisions shape things and people as your progress. These decisions aren't black and white either leaving you to decide what you feel is right to do.


Conclusion:
Lies of P is a tightly designed souls-like with incredibly engaging and rewarding combat along with a narrative that is captivating enough to keep you entertained until the very end. Seeing what this game has accomplished has easily made this one of my favourite souls-like, I'd even go as far as to place this above some From Software games. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of the genre.

Bosses are either a cake walk or difficult in a not fun way, fast big bosses with weird timing, so far they have no story, background or a narrative reason to be there and beat them. It's a generic placement of elements.
The sound is bad, it's missing juice when enemies are idle/move/windup attacks, same with bosses and there is no good ambient or boss music either. 
The game is kind of dead when it comes to the soundscape and it's a big part of experience that's missing.
The level design and environment art are mediocre and look very appropriate for a mid level dev, everything is kind of flat, on a grid and it's just not fun to explore, every part in an area looks the same and there is no environmental story telling to the sell world as lived in, even let's say the bodies on the streets don't stand out and they don't sell the story well.
There is no reason to have bonefires in this game, it's just a generic linear action game and not compelling to go back to.

Easily one of the more beautiful games I've played in the last year too, the art direction is magnificent.  It adds a few quality of life fixes to From's games as well, like finally being able to warp to a spawn point or HQ without sacrificing any upgrade currency.  That one is long overdue.

The game is set in a beautiful yet creepy world and and touches on a lot of the bloodborne atmosphere. I was worried that the game would have a lot of repetitive ""puppet"" bosses, but I was pleasantly surprised at some of the bosses and enemies that were introduced!

I will warn new players that this game more or less REQUIRES memorization of attack patterns (especially in the late game).  A lot of attacks are well telegraphed, but many enemy attacks are timed weird and require a lot of practice to get down.

Difficulty isnt Bloodborne - Sekiro ball bustingly hard, but it falls in a good middle ground thats just above Fallen Order. It's accessible enough for new players of the genre, while not dumbing down mechanics.

the biggest highlight for me is the amount of customization when it comes to building Pino.  All weapons aside from boss weapons are modular, the game encourages you to experiment.  It's also nice to be able to reset your stats and skill builds really easily from a resource that regenerates itself over time.

The ""Lie"" system is the game's answer to Humanity in the Soulsborne games.  Ultimately It only affects the story's ending, and small details on Pino if you pay attention enough.  It's not that you ""ALWAYS"" need to lie, its more so ""It's better to lie in this situation, and don't be a dick"".   

The pacing of the later half of the game feels off as many bosses suddenly like to have 2nd phases, which can be frustrating for some.  And of course you do not restart from the end of the first phase. This does force the player to learn and perfect the first phase to have enough resources for the next but I can understand many do not like this. I'm somewhat in the middle on this issue.  I would rather have fully developed bosses rather than artificially stretching it out.

All in all, the devs also listen to the community which I appreciate. My initial impression from the demo was mixed because of the weapon durability system, and dodging feels terrible.

Deceits of Urine is hands down my game of the year. Thanks too the implementation of personalized end of year stats that companies like to implement, too let you know everything you do is tracked, and that you can never escape; I know that I wrote 176 reviews this year. That also means I 100% that many games, as all of my reviews dedicate as much effort before the review can be written. This being the 177th review of the year. Without a doubt, this is the my game of the year. Much of Transhumanist (trans?) media, whether books, movies, shows or games, have a tendency to follow certain predictive, yet still interesting political, socioeconomic, and social story tropes. Many of them portray a bleak and dystopian view of the future. Especially from a technocratic, corporatist, or anarcho-capitalist framework. Many consider a nihilistic approach to the outlook of the future where certain long lasting race, gender and sex based social issues still exist. Usually the framework of said issues simply shifts to encompass a new subject for conservatives to call woke. Typically with regard to genetic and/or mechanical modifications. As if we, as a society, will never be free of very basic bigotted societal views. What does this have to do with Deceptions of Wee? It certainly doesn't feature a futuristic setting, however that does not stop the fact that this retelling of the Pinocchio story not only has transhumanist talking points, it discusses the singularity, political corruption, eugenics, and technophobia. Although the political atmosphere of Dishonesties of Piss is never fully discussed, it can be assumed that (based on the notes you find) the political atmosphere is a mixture of an oligarchy (from the flat out political power and influence the upper class has), and a democracy (again due to notes that encompass talks about judges, politicians, courts, police, and unions). Not unlike most of the world. Much of the story pulls influence from Isaac Asimov's ""Three Laws of Robotics,"" Astro-Boy/Pluto, Kill-la-Kill, Batman, Pinocchio (obviously), Frank R Stockton's ""The Lady, or the Tiger?,"" and possibly others. The remainder of this review will contain [b] Spoilers[/b] which I will not be censoring,[u] so read at your own risk.[/u]

[h1] Fun Flattery [/h1]
Before I get into the story, let me appease the people who are looking for the gameplay notes. That way they don't have to see the expansive madness of my reviews. This is for you Harrison, yes you, who else would I be talking to besides you, Harrison Temple. I know you, I know you only want to know about the gameplay. First of all, I want to get this out of the way: [b]If you have not played, beaten, or liked any of the mainline Soulsbourne games (Dark Souls 1-3, Demons Souls, Bloodbourne, or Sekiro) [u]I do not recommend this game[/u][/b]. This game demands more from you than a normal Soulsbourne game. It requires more patients, and more practice than I believe the mainline Soulsbourne game has ever asked for. The controls work mostly the same and can be picked up rather quickly, especially if you have played other Soulsbourne games. Everything is polished and the animations are very fun to watch. Besides the main mechanics of the controls, much of the game is built around the blocking mechanic. Blocking reduces the damage you take, and allows you to recover some of your lost health for a limited amount of time by dealing damage. If you perfect block, you take no damage, and the enemy loses points from their poise. Dealing damage and perfect blocking allow you to break an enemy poise. This is indicated by a white highlight over the enemy health. Dealing a charged heavy attack will allow you to stagger the enemy and follow up with a critical (fatal) attack. Enemies can also do Fury attacks, this is indicated by the enemy glowing red. If this occurs you can either run away, or perfect block. Those are your only options. Dodging or normal blocking will still allow the enemy to damage you. That is until later on in the game/in new game +. Later in the game you can get an equipment that allows you to dodge Fury attacks, and in new game + you can unlock the ability to normal block fury attacks. Plagerism is the talk of the town right now. Although this is a soulslike, I think this is more a form of flattery than a rip off of the series. It is definitely it's own beast. Flattering the games that started the genre with their own unique twists to the Fromsoft original. I've heard this game compared to Bloodborne, but with it's emphasis on perfect blocking, fatal attacks, and poise, it's definitely closer to Sekiro than Bloodborne.  

[h1]Retrospective Retelling[/h1]
Disinformations of Tinkle is, simply put, a retelling of Carlo Collodi's ""Pinocchio."" The main difference in this retelling, is the assertion that telling the truth is the robotic thing to do. That telling a lie is the thing that actually makes Pinocchio human. Or at least more human. Although called puppets, this game plays off puppets more like automatons. Geppetto creates Pinocchio as a stand in for his dead son named ""Carlo."" After the author. Thusly you are called Carlo and never called Pinocchio. As if that is a title for what you are rather than who you are. The blue fairy awakens you and seems to only be able to be seen and/or heard by other puppets such as yourself and Gemini. Gepetto is portrayed as the final villain of the game. Notably it could be determined from the beginning as he urges you to always be truthful posing antagonistically to your search for humanity. As if that's what makes you good, but also more robotic. Gepetto, throughout the game, shows disdain for showing any sort of personality or humanity. Calling you a bad child, explaining you need to be punished for disobeying, and notably having anger for showing any lack of Filial piety (the idea that you owe your parents for simply bringing you to life). Throughout the game your character is forced to make choices between telling the truth and telling a lie. Lying increases your humanity, but both options have their own set of choices or consequences. The game throws interesting results and interesting scenarios at you. Not everything is black and white, many of the scenarios seem harmless to lie in, providing an opportunity for a white lie or golden lie. Shortly before you awaken, Gepetto starts an uprising of the puppets by adding an extra rule to the Grand Covenant. Long before the events of Distortions of Piddle a character by the name of Lorenzini Venigni (who is basically a Batman stand-in) lost his parents as they were coming home from a theater play. Venigni's parents were very well off, and Venigni blames himself for their death due to going back to the theater late at night for a toy. His parents were killed by a puppet that had gained an ego (becoming self aware). However the officials of Krat cover up this fact. Venigni inherits his families wealth and their butler (another self aware puppet). Venigni invents the idea of the Grand Covenant (a reference to Isaac Asimov's ""Three Laws of Robotics"") a set of rules that all puppets are encoded with and must obey. Rule 1: Puppets cannot harm humans. Rule 2: Puppets must obey orders given to them. Rule 3: Puppets cannot lie. The puppet who killed Venigni's parents is a reference to Astroboy/Pluto. Specifically Brau 1589, a mysterious character throughout the game, the King of Riddles, Arlecchino, contacts you via phone to provide you with riddles you solve for rewards. However, as these questions continue, eventually he reveals a sadistic nature forcing you to admit to being a murderer, justified by your bodycount throughout the game. When you finally meet Arlecchino, he's broken already, pinned to a wall with a spear in his chest. Yet taunts you and Venigni while claiming that the very fact that he loves to kill humans is what makes him human, that murder is the thing that makes him alive.",1703465787,1706081358,True,0,1,0.380359619855880737,4,True,False,False

If this game had From Software on the box, not a person would question it. It is THAT good. A lot of the common criticisms of this game are miner nitpicks that would be entirely overlooked if it was coming from well From. 

Let me go over some of the improvements over the typical souls formula. Some are big, some are small, all feel nice.
- Separation of costumes and defense equipment.
- A durability system that doesn't feel unfair but also doesn't feel pointless.
- Showing you the number of souls you could get from popping soul items in your inventory in the level up screen
- An overall improvement on the weapon art systems called ""Fable Arts""
- Good thrown items with proper scaling
- A way to recover charges of the main healing item. (ie Estus)
- Customizable weapons
- UI indication of status effects on enemies
- A way in the ui to see what type of dodge roll / stam recovery speed you are getting.
- A display of which Stargazer (Bonfire) is closest to side quest objectives on the teleport screen
- The use of multiple systems for progression

Then we have some things that are less objectively improvements and more just things that in my subjective opinions improve on the souls formula.
- Binding of parry to the same button as block and effecting based on timing.
- A twist on Bloodborn's ""Rally"" mechanic wherein you can recover health depleted while you are blocking by quickly attacking again.
- Parrying to do enemy stagger damage in addition to regular attacks.
- Dodges are still useful
- More limited weapon types augmented by the ability to mix and match handles with blades making for a lot of interesting weapons.
- A combination of linear progression with DS1esque shortcuts to allow for interesting level design that loops back on itself but usually within one specific area at a time. 
- A good combination of exploration without being overwhelming.
- Quality of life things in the level design such as removing some of the railing in the hotel making it easier to get back to the first floor stargazer from Gepetto's room. If you play it look at this, it's impossible to not notice it once you have it pointed out, these developers playtested this game enough to know that removing this one section of railing would prevent you from having to run all the way around and did that. I love shit like this.
- A more narrative focused story.
- Very consistent boss fights. In From games there's always a poopoo fight or two. Godskin Duo almost ruining Elden Ring, Bed of Chaos etc. Lies has amazing consistency, not every boss fight is perfect but there isn't one that I absolutely hate.
- Builds are more consistent, there are more powerful builds than others but none feel quite as busted as some of the builds possible in other games in the genre. Nothing on the levels of Rivers of Blood or Moonveil. Pipewrench head on Baton handle is very powerful but not gamebreakingly so. The game can't be trivialized by just picking the right weapon and the right build. 

Some other points of note
- The animations are AAA tier, this isn't an overstatement the animations are near perfection. In fact I'd argue they're better than most AAA games out there.
- The soundtrack is amazing. 
- The UI is good, and very functional. 
- The combat feel is best in class. Not another non-Fromsoft game even comes close, hell, Fromsoft themselves are given a run for their money (if not outright beaten)
- Nothing feels unfair, everything is doable, even the poison swamp areas feel very fair in their design. You never actually are forced into getting a status affliction if you play your cards right.
- Excellent character designs.
- Top notch Voice Acting

To address some criticisms I've seen:
- Two healthbar bosses. Every criticism I've seen is basically you have to get through phase one to try phase two again. And well, that's actually pretty dumb. They could give 1 really big ass health bar and split the phases right in the middle and you'd still have to fight phase 1 to get to phase 2. Every two healthbar boss felt nicely balanced for that fact. I haven't seen one complaint about this that really makes any sense. And yes these fights can be difficult, but there is not one boss runback in this game (even the door guardian) that is that bad, A lot of the time there just isn't a runback.
- Difficulty. A lot of the difficulty complaints are basically trying to play it entirely like Darksouls, entirely like Bloodborne or entirely like Sekiro, this is none of those learn to play THIS game and you should be fine. And if a boss feels two hard drop swallow your pride and summon the damned spectre, he makes things easier without making them feel trivial in most cases.
- This game is a ripoff/plagerism. This barely merits a response, it's a soulslike fallowing souls-like tropes, of course it feels similar but it really does its own thing.
- The game is too linear. This might be a legit problem IDK, it's clearly what they were going for but you know I think it's just an opinion thing. I felt less overwhelmed on a blind playthrough. This is partly because I like to explore every square inch of the game and in this game it's actually possible to do that in one run. 

Some legitimate areas where other games, especially from From might be better.
- Overall level design. And this really only counts for the first half of DS1, but if you like these truly go your own route maps that let you tackle things how you see fit in the order you see fit then yeah DS1 might be better. I will add though that Lies is good start to finish. The height of DS1 level design is better yes, but the low isn't. Lies has very consistently good level design so I'd argue that while it might only be 75% as good at its best compared to DS1's best it stays at that 75% consistently, where the worst of DS1 might be 25% as good as it's own best if that makes sense. Still I'd rank it below DS1 and DS3 overall but above say DS2 or Sekiro even.
- The ambience. This game is more colorful than Bloodborn but it doesn't quite ooze the atmosphere that some of the From games do. It;s still VERY strong on atmosphere but not quite as good as From at their best.
- The mystery and intrigue. With linear level design and a narrative story it does less to make you wonder what pieces you are missing or what you might find that say DS1 or DS3, still it's good and only really falls short of these masterpieces. 

So if you're on the fence about Lies of P, I would say give it a go. If you like other Souls-like games at all this is a fantastic buy worth full price. It's got a lot of content and has an upcoming expansion. Even if you don't think it's as good as the best From has to offer it's definitely closer to a From game than say Steelrising or Thymesia. As I said from the beginning, if this had From branding no one would think it was made by the B team.",1706059492,1706059492,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just cant get enough of the combat, i pray that Round 8 studios adds a ""reflection of strength"" boss rush type of thing where i can just infinitely refight the bosses. the 4th official boss and the 3rd last boss are two of my favorite bosses, but theyre so far apart in the story. If you've played bloodborne, or sekiro, then this game is definitely for you. It has the themes of bloodborne, creepy, horror type of aesthetic and a combat like sekiro. One of the main criticisms of Sekiro was that there was no weapon variety, and while it was called a soulsgame, it didnt have the combat of one. Lies of P bridged that gap, while it focuses on parries, you can both block and regain your health, kinda like a rally system from bloodborne, and you can dodge. Dodging has I-frames in this game, so that is an option, unlike in sekiro.  Its also one of the first games, atleast as far as ive seen, where you can literally build your own weapon to fit your playstyle, and all weapons have the ability to parry. The game also took more inspiration from Sekiro by implimenting a Shinobi prosthetic, in this game its called a ""Legion Arm"" and its extremely fun to use.  This was the perfect game for me, as a person who played 4 playthroughs of Sekiro which was 166 hours in total.

- using consumables is actually fun
- the durability system is well integrated into combat/gameplay
- everything feels streamlined, without any warts

- QoL (NPC on bonfire list, auto refilling consumables from storage, weapon testing arena with MP refill)

It's like they looked at FromSoft's combat systems and went ""we can do better than that"" and then they did. They give you the Sekiro parry, the Bloodborne dodge and then put you up against bosses that are closer to Dark Souls 3 in terms of clearly legible attacks and distinct openings where it's safe for you to attack and still managed to make he game VERY difficult in a way that rarely frustrated me, because I always knew there was an ideal way to deal with each attack.

Yeah, in terms of visual artistry I think it's a bit tame, the level design plays it very safe, but the plot really worked for me and the bosses were consistently so good that it rarely impacted my enjoyment.

Even though parry is basically required to have a smooth run, it feels more forgiving than ER and even without a perfect parry it gives you the chance to get the health back you lose while blocking.

All 5 runs were done without the cube and summons, which feel disconnected from what [b]wood[/b] otherwise be a near-flawless, tightly knit combat system. The rest of said system fortunately remains quite engaging and multi-faceted. Something that greatly contributes to its replayability is how it incentivises experimentation in combat. Sticking to one strategy throughout will not work, I learned that the hard way. The weapon crafting and robot arms lead to possibly hundreds of fun builds and synergies, and a lot of mechanics like durability and status ailments that seem annoying and padded on at first, [b]liar[/b] and interact very well later on as fights get more complex. Dodging, rolling and strafing are all viable, and switching between them is always better than sticking to only one, it just looks and feels awesome to pull off.

The lack of any real exploration and extreme level linearity is a little disappointing, but most semi-open world type games get tiring anyway at a certain point if not done properly, so more of a focus on fight encounters is appreciated. Speaking of which, the roster of bosses and trash mobs is nearly spotless. They spared no expense when it came to the creature designs, that's for sure. I love how there are such wacky enemy types that show up for one level and never again, it's a measured and context-driven nature to the encounters that lead to an impressive variety when it comes to enemy designs and the scenarios; it keeps the levels fresh and carries the immersion when the level layout isn’t quite there. Bosses, mini and major, are consistently excellent, disappointing Door Guardian aside. Some of my favorite character designs in recent memory, as well as immaculate animation work. Very readable attacks and [b]strings[/b] have unique but intuitive rhythms that are super satisfying to master, plus how moves flow into each other is almost seamless. Nameless Puppet, Laxasia, and Victor are standout favorites. I am tempted to name more, but I won't for brevity. Scrapped Watchman.

To end on by far the biggest surprise, the music is fantastic. While the soundtrack in-game is nothing too special as most of them are standard orchestral tracks that feel too imitative of you-know-who (they shall go unnamed because I am sick of the constant comparisons), the hub jukebox selection is astoundingly good, so much better than it had to be. Truthfully, I can say the same for the game as a whole. Fantastic.",1705859853,1705863724,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

I am in the beginning of its story line however as compared to its rivals

General Combat 

* Combat Preparation mechanics is very grounded as part of story, Still in the end its souls like game.

* Encounters have variety, I pushed strength so it was easy for me to deal with trash mobs, some hidden elements as expected in genre to add some juice to parkour.

* Dodging is super limited, you have to master it. Its a bit tricky so you generally want to avoid dodging cause the game tells you to. It is limited and recovery wise not also in favor of player, and really depends on the enemy range and reach. Sometimes it gives you advantage to abuse the mechanics like in AOE damages so its interesting in that terms.

*Combats are slow, exaggerated moves so player can learn avoid. Good variety of different types from the beginning of game. Elden ring type of feeling can be expected in some encounters that you are tiny which is kinda I am looking for in games in boss combat.

* Rare mobs are not re spawned like in the other games though it didn't notice that till I die to another trash mob and that time didn't see one of the npc spawned. So its not super distinguishable maybe sometimes their difficulty difference.

*Performance wise it is very good and expected results.

Level Design

* There is generally Souls like parkour mechanics. It is too linear however in its level design, there was a sense of effort to have multiple paths. Sense of exploration somewhat exist in some places , in the dark corners of an alley with some dead end paths etc, still not open world of course.

* Game looking great aesthetically in many terms. Dark Victorian era Fantasy elements with some steampunk elements kinda great. This influences the mechanics of the game a lot of-course and sets in a different corner than its rivals. It is possible in many terms there is also catholic elements.

* There are some traps that can be utilized I saw 1 or 2 so far, maybe there is more aspects to it but I didn't feel that its part of game-play maybe a bit can be an helper to player if you  kite npc.

Game Design / UX

* Controls are good generally even I felt they are more responsive than the dark souls, god of war. It feels good, however there is a sense of punishment for unnecessary elements, like if your ammo is finished checking that put you into a controls blocked state which is OK, you can do that but why that long animation hard to guess.

* UX Feedback Systems wise its generally expected mechanics in this genre. Clear whistles and bells. Playing on PC quite easy too, not blatant so pushes player a bit to think.

* Steampunk setting really unlocks and influences the utility design in many terms, both in level design but especially in combat which opens the room for one of the most important parts which is Legion Arms which is great. It fits the game very well and its fun to play with. I didn't use in couple of hours of gameplay but even knowing they exist its quite exciting.

* Core mechanics wise, I am always feeling a bit bad when I can not jump. It is ok to let player a little bit jump, don't worry about this much breaking the level , we can break it anyway, just don't let go the forward button in these games you will eventually speed-run.  Blocking was well balanced, I felt very good control over my weapon. Felt quite powerful while using it.

* I made in depth analysis of its features when it comes to its usability yet but there is somewhat attention to accessibility, there is a bit player comfort attention to it but definitely way beyond where it can be.",1705854577,1705856710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is hard for me to recommend because of all the issues regarding the flow of combat. Bosses are really unfun to fight because of janky animation and over use of delayed attacks. Some big bosses attack you from off camera and they also have awful hitboxes. Parrying an enemy pushes you back a lot creating distance between you and the enemy which makes no sense as perfect parrying should reward you by creating openings for an attack. Also weapon durability mechanic is quite annoying while fighting a boss, I just don't understand how it adds anything to the game.

PRO:
The game has great atmosphere and story. The weapons assembly system is great. The game is well designed as all the mechanics in game complement each other in general. The level design although linear is quite good. Some humanoid mini bosses are good.

Verdict:
Lies of P is let down by its combat which is the bread and butter of any souls like game. If they had nailed the combat this game would be a masterpiece.

For Better; the art design, atmosphere, music, writing, questing, characters, and the way the game plays with expectations a coziness and love that seeps into everything you do and feel throughout the game. There's so many moments that demanded me to sit down, listen, and eat up the scenery with the production value to more than match From Software.

For Worse; this is more subjective but this is probably one of the least punishing Souls-likes I've played though its still really engaging.

It is easier than people say. Yes, parry (prefect guard) is quite hard to do, but blocking and donging are good enough to handle everything. 
Story is quite interesting. 
Some advices:
You need to have the best body parts in any type of build. Just keep the weight below 60% and never aim for lightwigth bonus (< 30% weight) because it gives you no viable bonuses. 
As for weapons - I used greatswords in first playthrough and daggers in second. Swords/blunts are not very different from greatswords, just a bit faster. But in NG+ you need faster attacks to survive. So I recommend you to use daggers. I used acidic dagger - it is very good for any type of enemies and you can get it quite early (chapter 3 if I remember correctly, maybe chapter 4). Don't bother with second weapon - it will be useless. 
Stats - health, weight and acid damage. With daggers you don't need too much stamina so don't invest much there.
Arms - Fulminis (electric damage) is the best. Shield is good too. Sometimes you will want to use long range arm. 
Amultes - anything you like actually. I prefer damaging amulets and life regeneration for common enemies or physical resistance for bosses. 
Perks (heart improvements) - focus on healing charges and defence first, then attack, and utility at last.",1705837928,1705837928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR: Incredible game that you should definitely play. The combat, story, and world building is superb, but 2 warnings: always talk to the character named Venigni before talking to the character named Eugenie or you will regret it near the end of the game. Second, big enemies and bosses have a tendency to trap you in a corner making it impossible to see.

This game is the best non Fromsoft souls game I have played. Although I would put it below all the other Fromsoft souls games, I would still say it is of equitable quality to Fromsoft souls games. There is a large variety of weapons and tools and to my surprise they all feel unique which I find is a problem that nearly every souls like game suffers from including the originals.

BUT! I have 2 complaints: first, the blacksmith of this game is called Eugenie who's quest line resolves after another npc's quest line is resolved. if you speak another npc named Venigni he reveals a MAJOR PLOT TWIST that is significant to the resolution of Eugenie's story, HOWEVER! if you decide to speak to Eugenie first BECAUSE SHE IS THE BLACKSMITH you are automatically forced into resolving the quest line WITHOUT ACCESS TO ONE OF THE PROPER ENDINGS. I am being vague about the details to avoid spoilers but I feel the need to say this so that whoever sees this and reads it will hopefully be able to avoid my own cruel fate. 

The other issue with this game is that big enemies and especially bosses will trap you in corners completely blocking your camera and preventing you from moving as they barrage you with an endless amount of attacks that you can't react to. Someone might argue that it is my fault that I ended in the corner due to my lack of awareness and this is true, but I am a souls veteran and think that I am pretty good at these games, so if I am seriously struggling with this consistently throughout the whole game I imagine many other people also have the same problem. I feel that this issue could be easily resolved if the code was changed so that bosses backed up just a little bit after finishing their attack if they detect the player is in a corner.

Overall this game is amazing and although it has flaws, what game doesn't? I bought this at full price and don't regret it, although I would never judge someone for buying even a game this good on sale.

I knew I wanted to give this game a shot the second I saw its promotional material and it absolutely does not disappoint. Lies of P not only far outshines non-Fromsoft Souls-likes, it even manages to reach the stars above some of Fromsoft's own works.

Neowiz have a firm grasp on what makes the souls games tick. While bosses should be in the game, it should never become a priority for the devs of a souls-like to cram in as many bosses as possible, Lies of P boasts a whopping 25 bosses (13 of which being optional), and while the bosses may vary a bit in quality (we'll get to that later) it never feels like the bosses are a large focal point for the developers.

The combat is extremely rewarding. While learning to counter is highly recommended, it isn't mandatory. The sheer customisation options for equipment is staggering.  Trading shields or other purely defensive weaponry for Legion Arms pushes the player into a more aggressive playstyle (with the exception for Aegis but even that arm allows for more aggressive counter attacks). It, Guard Regain (Basically the Rally system from BloodBorne), and enemies' generally quick fighting pushes the player towards tackling enemies head-on. And mastering a boss, countering every attack while destroying their health bar is the most rewarding aspects of this games combat.

Let's talk about the bosses shall we..
While some of the latter bosses in this game are really well designed for the most part, there are a few stinkers and unfortunately, some of the really good bosses suffer from issues prevalent in other souls-likes.

Starting with the two worst boss fights in the game, The Black Rabbit Brotherhood fights. Both of these fights hearken back to many terrible bosses from Dark Souls 2, opting for having multiple enemies instead of one really good one. Neowiz were kind enough to design the boss fights so that you don't have to fight all brothers at once, however this doesn't stop the first fight from dragging on due to every enemy being very aggressive and quick, lacking in the kind of duality that made O&S from Dark Souls 1 such a great fight. Ideally you'd want to make the eldest brother slower but perhaps with harder hitting attacks, similar to Ornstein, slowly rumbling towards you as your focus is on one of his faster younger siblings. While he does that when one of his siblings are on the field, only occasionally lunging towards you, when his siblings leave the field, he suddenly becomes much faster. Another factor that just lead to the fights both dragging on is that the siblings all have a bit too much health. It's a similar issue to Simon Manus, where his second phase has too much health, making the fight drag on.

Were I to design this fight, I'd have the eldest brother be similar to Ornstein, slowly walking towards you with lumbering steps, with slower attacks that hit like a truck. Meanwhile his siblings enter the fray one at a time, They'd have varying degrees of speed (much like they do in the game). As a possible trade off for having four enemies you have to defeat is giving the three youngest siblings much less health than the eldest so the fight doesn't turn into a battle of attrition. Also no Rematch. Even my version would have a risk of dragging on for too long so fighting the boss twice would just be frustrating.

There are also a couple issues that plague even the best of bosses in the game, there are two big ones that come to mind...
Firstly, if you do enough damage to an enemy's ""poise"" for lack of a better word, their health bar glows white signalling they are ""staggered"", hitting the enemy with a heavy attack, a Fable ability or a fucking Shot Put renders the enemy helpless for a few seconds, allowing the player a chance to land a critical strike, dealing massive amounts of damage. Issue is, some bosses (and even some regular enemies) will unleash a last, quick attack (usually a quick flurry of attacks or an A.O.E) before you are allowed to do the critical hit. This only really feels like a ""haha gotcha"" from the devs, managing to land a heavy attack or a Fable ability while the enemy is staggered can be really difficult with some bosses, especially some of the later ones, so managing to get them to this state shouldn't make them do a quick ""gotcha"", it just feels unnecessarily cruel towards the player.

The other huge issue being attack wind-ups. It's become more and more common for souls-like bosses to do an attack where they lift their arm, stand still for a few seconds only to then lock onto the players exact ip adress and slash down before you can even react to it happening. This issue becomes most prevalent on mid-late game bosses and is unfortunate since some of these late-game bosses are really good fights. Simon Manus is otherwise an amazing display of spectacle but some of his moves are really poorly telegraphed and giving some of his magic attacks disruption (especially the quick one) was a mistake, Laxasia constantly keeps you on edge, but some of her attacks feel just a bit shitty to avoid or parry. One way you could do this kind of attack is if you clearly indicate before the attack is about to slash down. The Scrapped Watchman has one such attack where he lifts his arm up for a few seconds, and while the slashing down is pretty fast, there is a very noticeable twitch in his arm before he's about to actually make the attack.

While there are definitely areas of improvement with some of the bosses, thankfully, I get the impression Neowiz never made it a focal point to cram in as many bosses as possible because bosses sell copies. The game has a good blend of exploration and boss encounters. Speaking of which, While I can miss the interconnected design in DS1, Lies of P's linear level design doesn't detract from the game's quality. And I can certainly appreciate that Lies of P's story is told to you in a more direct way.

I already briefly touched on the aesthetic in the opening lines but to expand on it a bit. This game looks amazing. The designs of everything from the smallest puppet, to the city of Krat to the Nameless Puppet scream care (Fucking incredible boss in terms of mechanics and design by the way (again with one or two issues though)). A lot of care was put into the design of this game and it is obvious. Krat's atmosphere is one I just want to sink deep into. The music is also stellar! I adore the music in the records you get throughout the game. ""Feel"" has been and will be listened to often.

Finally, while I may have been harsh on some of this game's shortcomings, I truly believe Lies of P stands shoulder to shoulder with some of Fromsoft's best works, I'm very much looking forward to the sequel and I sincerely hope it improves on the foundations built by Lies of P. This game is truly a great display of what a truly great Souls-like game can look like.",1705811138,1705811138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Excellent performance. Smooth as butter, well optimized, and little to no stutters or bugs. DLSS support, no 60fps lock, borderless fullscreen support, etc, it meets all the qualities of a great modern triple A game.  

Many great design decisions and QoL that elevate the game significantly. The crit indicator, infinite resets with coin fruit, ergo outside the boss arena, defensive stats not tied to costume, etc, a lot of minor but excellent improvements. All the systems in the game are well designed and worth engaging with (P organ, legion arm, fable arts, etc). For example, no stat reqs on weapons & the assembly system allows you to experiment with every weapon and customize for a lot of player expression in a way that's harder in other souls games.

The game is not as difficult as a lot of people say. I personally didn't take over 5 attempts on any boss except Laxasia even without spectres, you just need to utilise the full range of your defensive arsenal well and learn the movesets which aren't too extensive and are well telegraphed. Felt perfectly balanced in terms of difficulty and probably the least frustrated I've ever been with a soulslike. I always felt like I was learning and I never felt like I was losing to BS, which was amazing and sadly rare in soulslikes. 

Level design, mob placements, and elite mob design is a massive contributor to the game feeling better than fromsoft titles. Lack of gank fights, annoying encounters, and overall less enemies that aren't as annoying made the levels feel much better. Rarely did I ever die in the actual levels or feel punished for exploring unless I played bad. There was no 'bad' level, hell even the obligatory poison swamp level was done well and fun.

Bosses were all very good for the most part with excellent telegraphs and fun movesets that are hard but never unfair. In terms of fun, best were Laxasia & Scrap Watchman with Laxasia being in my souls boss hall of fame. I found the Human/Stalker encounters were fairly weak overall though.

Story was not bad, not mindblowing by any means but there were some good character moments that caught me by pleasant surprise with their depth and perspective. Vegnini, Arlecchino, and Antonia were great standouts, rest of NPCs were alright. It's much more direct than fromsoft storytelling which I found more fitting for the kind of story Lies of P is trying to tell. The soundtrack is solid and the records are fantastic.

Overall, the best way to describe the game would be consistently excellent. No other soulslike that I've played has ever had such a high degree of consistent quality. I'm a pretty critical and picky, and even I was having trouble finding major flaws. The entire game never dips below the incredibly high bar it sets for itself and remains very consistent quality wise throughout.

It has a compelling story on top of the usual lore type storytelling. Consumables are actually usable here. I like that you can recharge your healing flask if it is empty by killing enemies. Even combining handles and blades might be helpful.

The only problem I have with this game is its parry mechanic. It allows you to regain your health if you block the enemy attack. But your character is too slow and some enemies are too aggressive and because of that, you have two issues:
1. You don't have any room for mistakes. If you block too soon, you will receive some damage that you might regain, but if you block too late, you will lose your health and the opportunity to regain the blocked amount of health. Whereas in Sekiro blocks consume your stamina instead of health, so you have more possibilities for mistakes. So the only option here is either the perfect block, which fully negates damage but is not easy to master, or dodging, which is very slugish.
2. Too little window for counterattack. You are just too slow and there are only a few weapons with a longer reach. So even if you perfect block the enemy attack, you have to get to the enemy and attack them, which takes a lot of time and by the time you get to them, the enemy will start attacking you again. Whereas in Bloodborne you don't have additional steps. If you receive damage, you can take it back almost immediately.

So yeah, it is basically a less fun version of Sekiro and Bloodborne combat. It does not really make the game harder, just more frustrating. Not to the point of dropping the game, but it sure wants to take your time to teach you how to block. It also may be a skill issue because I tried not to use phantoms even on the group bosses.
Don't get me wrong, I still like this game, but I think it would have been better if the developers just stole From's mechanics instead of weirdly mixing them. But despite all that, it baffles me that this is the only souls like game that gets the From's formula on the first try, where every other developer, in my opinion, can't figure it out to this day.

Gameplay is maddeningly hard-fun but Progression is somewhere between bad and and infuriating. 

I love how difficult the combat is - want to smash controller through TV and then come back later and absolutely NAIL a boss fight and it feels so good - then you're lost and there's nothing AT ALL to do or progress, until you finally accidentally talk to X who you swear you've tried talking to 10x, and he says ""I've already instructed Y to talk to you so you should have no trouble"" when until that interaction Y has been saying the current gen game equivalent of ""..."" to you. 
Apologies to the creators for a negative but I must. Purely linear you must A-B-C-D game with no open world options for stumbling your way interestingly back to the plot, but it won't help you recover if you get off track. In fact it punishes you for getting off track in some meaningful and frustrating ways. That's just not fun.
I think at this point I'll finish it, but I might not, and if I don't it won't be because it was too hard, it will be because I decided some of the design choices just made me feel like I was truly wasting my time, and not in the way you intend to when you fire up a video game.",1704764578,1705750516,True,0,0,0.477971047163009644,0,True,False,False

- I really enjoyed world, artwork and characters - a violent steampunk fairytale with really great atmosphere.
- Combat feels very fluid, engaging and fun. 
- Many challenging and well designed bosses.
- You have a great learning curve for boss encounters etc.
- Weapon variety and the ability to swap handles and blades is great.
- Good variety of different enemy types. That thematically fit the area where you encounter them.
- I really liked the level design. 
- Character progression very well done.
- Secrets, story choices and different ending. (Also good ng+)

And yes, it is a comparatively hard game. You wil need to master it's mechanics in order to beat it. So if you are easily frustrated and  just want a casual, easy experience, this game might not be right for you. But learning the mechanics and mastering them feels very rewarding.

Even then is just a messed up design and gameplay. I never want to see another game from this sadistic company. 
It looks like  a nice looking fantasy game following a storybook story jut to lure you in to find out is not fun at all to play. It screws' you over from start .

Ps.
I want to add that if they would have included difficulty settings and letting players decide what difficulty they want to play the game at, might have been much, much less frustrating and give players other than hardcore ones a chance to get used to the extremely frustrating game controls and gameplay.

It is a souls game where you don't need to watch a lore youtuber explain you the story. I heard claims that this is a ""parry focused souls game"" and I can see why some may think that as successful parrying is tied to many perks and amulets, where it becomes a necessity for almost all boss fights to learn to parry, but there are some moments where dodging is the far superior tactic. For example, there was this one boss that kept melting my stamina and then my health with a long combo that I could never fully parry, but then that combo was trivialized by simply dodging to the side repeatedly. What I am saying is, you need to know when to dodge and when to parry. If it gets overwhelming, just block and respond with some counter attacks, you regain health you lost from guarding by attacking.

Now some negatives, levels were too long in my opinion. Too often I simply wished for them to end already and let me fight another boss, but the same humanoid monsters in the same long sets of corridors and rooms just kept going. On my New Game+ playthrough I just ran past all enemies and it still felt too long.
Finally the specter system. Right before boss rooms you can summon an AI controlled specter to fight with you. I am not all that against this as if you simply don't wish to bother with a boss fight on your 2nd or 3rd playthrough you can utilize the specter to skip past it faster. But the bosses focus the specter way too much, making you more of a spectator to the fight until the incredibly tanky specter or the boss dies. So if you want, you can trivialize lot of bosses with the specter and then be left with a feeling of being ignored in the fight.

Still this was overall a good game. Well worth the price I paid in the steam sale.",1705697341,1705697341,True,1,0,0.510041117668151855,0,True,False,False

This game is hot garbage 

Outside of the obviously fantastic QOL features and overall aesthetic there aren't many things this game has going for it. Movement and rolling feel sluggish and clunky the whole way through and levels are packed with enough ambushes to make Ds2 blush. Enemies also have such jacked up attack tracking I'd just burst out laughing after seeing bosses constantly pull off 180 degree turns and lightning-fast gap closers from way too far away while they were halfway through their attack animation. Shit just looks really goofy

Besides that the bosses range from mid at best to needlessly annoying at worst. Most of the time it just feels like I'm playing scuffed Sekiro with how sporadic a lot of the parry timings are due to janky looking animations for some attacks. A lot of the bosses also have Elden Ring type combo extensions where you never know if the boss is done attacking or just waiting for you to get closer so it can continue its combo. Never really struggled with any bosses but after beating them my thoughts were either ""Oh that's it?"" or ""Damn glad that's over"". I'd say the only good bosses were Laxasia and Nameless Puppet which funnily enough feel like Sekiro bosses that wandered into the wrong game. Bosses having additional attacks after landing a stagger on them is also a terribly cheap mechanic. Hope the next game avoids that.

Loot and weapons feel extremely underwhelming too. Most of the time you just end up with useless crap or ergo fragments and since this game doesn't have spells or something similar to spells there's little gameplay incentive to actually explore unless you're trying to find quartz (which is usually just in chests or on mini-bosses anyway). Among the loot are weapons which are also boring since none of them feel like they have any identity due to every weapon essentially being two pieces of lego with some fable abilities attached to it. Even the Fable Arts aren't anything to write home about. I just stopped bothering with weapons entirely midway through the game since it was too much hassle to keep testing out new weapon combinations to see if I'd wanna switch up my playstyle. A lot of boss weapons also just look silly and don't line up with the boss they're dropped from at all (Victor gives a greatsword, Green Monster gives a katana, Laxasia gives a pizza cutter like wtf???). Compare them to Bloodborne's trick weapons or even some of Ds3's boss weapons and you can clearly see the difference. 

Going in I thought the weapon durability mechanic would be terrible and it turns out I was mostly right. Durability just feels like needless busy work during boss fights and in between enemy packs. You could remove it completely and the core game loop would only improve. There's a reason why Elden Ring and Sekiro removed weapon durability completely.

Overall the devs have a lot to improve. I use so many Soulsborne comparisons because it really just feels like this game is trying to ape the Souls games (mainly BB and Sekiro) rather than try and do its own thing. There are decent enough new ideas in here but they're dragged down by the issues I mentioned. It's probably the best non-FromSoft souls-like out there but it's still a far cry from competing with FromSoft's level of quality. Great first attempt for the studio, they can only go up from here.

The combat is a shining jewel where clearly NEOWIZ put a lot of thought and lessons from From Software's games (and developers inspired by From Soft) to create a system that is engaging, fun, and challenging from the first minute to the final boss of the game.  And NEOWIZ decided an exemplary combat system was not enough- Lies of P story is nothing to ignore either.  Originally I thought ""dark Pinocchio, really?"" but holy dang I LOVE IT.  Some characters are hit and miss with people, but overall I cared about these characters and I needed to see what happened to them... and the treat is that finding out what happens, see more of the game world, is all executed through that excellent combat system.

Have you enjoyed From Software's recent games?  Then this is an easy recommendation for an experience you are probably going to thoroughly enjoy!  Heck, even if you're new to this style of game, I still recommend it as a fun and challenging game on its own right.

I had such an incredible time with this one, and the developer really seems to understand the formula beyond simply trying to copy it.

One aspect of the genre that often gets overlooked or lacks focus is the pacing and encounter design, and Lies of P -- for me -- absolutely nailed both. The playthrough where I finally beat the game took about 25 hours, and at ALMOST no point was I bored or exhausted or just wanting to get to the next thing. I think for Souls veterans the bosses MIGHT be tweaked a little on the easy-side? But that's honestly hard for me to judge because I am Poo-Poo Garbage at videogames. I never got stuck or had a ton of trouble with any bosses (save maybe a couple towards the end of the game). Your own results may vary, but I found most of the bosses very, very interesting to fight, and there's just enough of them without being TOO many.

Another area I think this game excels that I will touch on without spoilers but that I don't see a lot of people mention is NPC side quests. There are a handful of them and I found them all extremely compelling. Good characters with good stories that are doled out in a satisfying slow-drip over the length of the whole run. It's just really well-executed.

Bloodborne is my favorite game of all time, so I don't say this lightly when I say that Lies of P isn't just 'The Bloodborne We Have At Home.' Though derivative in its basic structure and function, Lies of P is its own thing and one of the best games I've played in recent memory.

I will offer one piece of spoiler-free advice though for anyone thinking about playing it who hasn't yet, and it has to do with what I said a couple paragraphs ago about ALMOST never being exhausted: Holy MOLY the last area of the game is LONG. Like, way longer than you think it's going to be. You'll think you're nearing the climax and it'll just KEEP GOING. It's all still really good, but bring some Gatorade and take breaks after bosses.

The story is fine, nothing to write home about. Very cool aesthetics, very cool world to be in. *This is a parry game.* If you hated Sekiro, you will hate this less, as it's a much simpler parry system. But you still have to parry. And even though you have to parry, the game does not keep things straight across the board when it comes to weapons. So if you want to use a giant sword, get ready for much slower parry reaction times. 

There are some cool boss fights and cool areas to explore. The in-game systems are easy to understand and there are a couple of interesting tools you get to help you in your battles that give the player a lot of options. There are your standard dex and strength builds, but then a few other options as well. 

Cons: 
Weapon range. I cannot tell you how many times, even with my giant sword, that I swung at things that are very close to me, I missed, and then was smacked by the same mob I was trying to kill. I don't know why, but they really hate the idea of weapon range being any where near realistic. My giant sword will go through mobs' bodies and do nothing. It's infuriating, but you do kinda get used to just being right next to every single thing you fight.

Run back times. The run back times, especially to bosses, are brutal. I'm talking 1min+, through mobs, through obstacles, just to get back to a boss, or if you're trying to get back to the place where you died, it can be even longer. Some elites respawn, some don't, so it can be just the worst grind trying to get through certain areas or just back to the boss.

The end of the game. The end of the game is 95% bosses and 5% mobs, and it's f&%$ing awful. Just grind after grind of these awful boss designs with no break. I think I'm on the last boss of the game at the moment, and I can't even bring myself to play. I'm just so burned out on endless boss reps and endless bad boss design. And I'm serious; the vast majority of the bosses in the last parts of the game are just absolute garbage piles of design. Remember all of the things that you hated in other souls games? Get ready to beat your head against a wall, because they don't give a sh!t and did all of the same awful designs for bosses. I've spent more time repeating boss attempts in the last parts of the game then I have spent playing the entire rest of the game; it's that bad. If you're amazing at parrying, you'll probably think it's easy, but if you're like me and are use to rolling, you're in for a world of hurt. 

Armor. The armor, or cosmetics, or a combination of the two, is seriously lacking. I don't want to spoil anything, but let me just say that it is very basic, and very boring. 

I want to reiterate, this is a good game. There's a lot about it that is good and intriguing to play through again. I just don't know that I would be able to stomach playing through the last part of the game again, considering I can't even make myself do it on my first play-through.",1705617507,1705617507,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Inventory, buff and upgrade system, everything else is a meticulous, and absolutely unimaginative rip-off.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Lies of P is a dark fantasy parody souls-like of the beloved children's tale ""Pinocchio"". By utilising stunning graphics, beautifully rendered audio, and a familiar formula, Lies of P seeks to join the higher echelons of the genre. But does it succeed at breaking free from its strings, or is it bound to be a puppet forever?

	[td]🟩 A wondrous story that stokes curiosity with every step and pushes you to uncover just one more secret.

🟩 The combat is the formula foundation in this game. It feels familiar and yet fresh enough that there is a learning curve. And with an array of weapons and items to choose and customise, you can make P your own.

🟩 Graphically, one of the most impressive games I've ever played.

🟩 The audio is exceptionally high quality and envelopes you in the experience as you explore the world. [/td]
	[td]🟥 Enemy variety is pretty slim, and in the latter portion of the game, you will only really find reskinned enemies from the early stages, who utilise scare and corner tactics to get a free hit in.[/td]

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play as a puppet named P, awakened into a world of lies torn asunder by a catastrophe relating to the puppets. The voice that beckons you begs that you travel through dishevelled and blood-soaked streets to reach Hotel Krat, where she promises you answers, and your story will begin in earnest.

Without wanting to spoil anything, as the story becomes quite involved and intricate beyond the point of reaching the Hotel itself, I will leave the basic synopsis there. I will say that amongst all the games I have played in 2023, this is probably one of the best-written experiences I've had, and while it's far from perfect, it falls into the familiar traps of the soul-like genre. It achieves where many of its ilk fail by captivating its audience with an engaging setting, world and a story that unravels as you progress through it. I would highly recommend reading up some information as you go, as the story does become particularly intricate in the latter stages, and I wish I understood it more intimately before I advanced.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[h3]Bad children get the stick.[/h3]
As with most soul-likes, combat is a foundational part of the experience and becoming familiar with it is crucial to your success. Lies of P is no different and probably requires you more than most to learn the mechanics quickly or spend much of your time stuck on bosses who are often relentless in their onslaughts.

The main tools at your disposal are your weapon of choice and the innate ability to either dodge or parry enemy attacks, which can take a bit of practice to adjust to timings. As you progress through the story, more options for fights become available, such as the ability to heal, use wish stones that can buff you during fights and grindstones that add effects to your weapons to boost your damage output.

Your reward for killing almost anything in the world is Ergo, which acts as your currency and experience in this game. You can use it to buy items or level up your character's attributes to increase their effectiveness in a number of different ways.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3123886439

Thankfully, dying in this game isn't a brutal experience, as checkpoints usually aren't that far away, you can unlock shortcuts to make the run back quicker, and even if you were to die again on the way back to your Ergo deposit, you only lose a portion of the total, instead of it all.

Lies of P does an exceptional job explaining the mechanics as they open up, so you shouldn't have any problems unboxing them as you progress through the campaign.

[h3]Your lies are a rare ability. You are able to choose your own path.[/h3]
One of the most iconic mechanics of this title is your ability to guide your own story in an impactful way through the truth or lie implementation. At several intervals throughout the story, you will have the chance to tell the truth or to lie to progress, and both impact what will happen in the short and long term.

To complete the game, you will need to do roughly 2 or 3 playthroughs, so don't feel too pressured to go down a particular path for completion until you have to later.

[h3]""Another fine day in the city of Krat, but I wonder my friend, just where have you been...at""[/h3]
Exploration is pivotal in this game, as many of the best weapons and items are in dark alleys and rundown buildings off the beaten track. There is no practical way to tell what you've missed, so the best method is to be thorough on your travels and explore every inch of the world before you move on.

But items aren't the only reason to explore, as many of the quests during the game require you to delve deep into the world to complete them. Completing these quests will assist you greatly in your adventure by providing you with rare resources you couldn't have obtained otherwise.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3123885971

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
The graphical quality of this game is above the standard I've experienced to date. It is a stunning experience that captivates the heart and mind of the person playing it from start to finish. The world is rich with colour and dynamic effects to keep you enamoured as you explore its many dark pathways and puppet-ridden avenues.

The audio is of the same exceptional quality. From the enthralling soundtrack that perfectly couples with the unravelling storyline and marvellously detailed world to the atmospheric detail as you walk the cobbled streets of Krat and beyond.

It is a truly captivating experience all-round.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
With the game set to ultra quality and 2560 x 1440 resolution, I never saw the framerate drop below 60 FPS and didn't experience any visual discrepancies during the campaign.
🟨 As with all souls-like games, I played Lies of P with a controller.
RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 43%)
CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 27.3%)
GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 43.5%)

[h1]Final Thoughts - Excellent[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
Probably amongst the best soul-likes I've ever played and rivalled even my beloved Dark Souls in terms of quality and experience. Lies of P is an exceptional experience for veterans and new players of the genre and will provide you with a solid experience regardless. With familiar enough mechanics and a familiar yet redesigned story that many of us would have read or watched at some point in our lives, weighed down only by its limited enemy roster, this is an unmissable experience worth every penny.

[h1]Français :[/h1]
Ce jeu est un chef-d'oeuvre ! Pour les fans des soulsborne et des souls-like, il vaut vraiment le détour !

[h3]Points positifs :[/h3]
- Les graphismes sont sa plus grande qualité. Le jeu est incroyablement joli, même en lowest.
- Très bien optimisé, pas besoin d'une machine de guerre pour le faire tourner.
- Certaines mécaniques ne sont pas simples à prendre en main, mais ça reste un point positif car c'est ce dont on pourrait s'attendre venant d'un jeu qui se décrit comme un souls-like.
- Le jeu se joue aussi bien à la manette qu'au clavier / souris, même s'il est fortement recommandé d'utiliser une manette.
- La difficulté est plutôt facile pour un souls-like, c'est un excellent jeu pour s'initier à ce genre.
- Les designs des personnages et des ennemis sont tout simplement bluffants. Le protagoniste dégage à la fois une aura de mystère et d'innocence et ça le rend bizarrement très attachant.
- L'ambiance générale du jeu est très réussie ; les décors sont sinistres et les cadavres d'humains, ajoutés au comportement des marionnettes et des pétrifiés qui font un peu penser à des zombies, ajoutent une sombre atmosphère post-apocalyptique au jeu.
- Il y a plein de mécaniques intéressantes qui font que, même si le jeu est évidemment inspiré des soulsborne, il ajoute sa petite touche qui le rend unique. Par exemple, les armes sont divisées en deux parties (lame et poignée) et le bras gauche du personnage peut être utilisé de diverses façons.
- Pour l'histoire, je n'ai rien à redire. C'est une histoire typique des souls-like : quelque chose a fait qu'une partie de la population est devenue dangereuse, on joue jusqu'à affronter le boss final et on débloque une des fins disponibles en fonction de nos actions tout le long du jeu.

[h3]Points négatifs :[/h3]
- Le système d'esquive ne sert pas à grand chose et est même parfois inutile contre certaines attaques ennemies, puisque ce sont les parades qui font bénéficier de bonus et d'avantages. Ça aurait été bien de voir un souls-like se baser sur l'esquive plutôt que la parade, pour une fois, surtout que les parades sont assez compliquées à caler et que c'est limite du frame-perfect la plupart du temps.
- Pareil, la durabilité de l'arme ne sert à rien, puisqu'on peut l'aiguiser à n'importe quel moment. La seule chose qui se produit si la durabilité atteint 0, c'est que l'arme se brise. On peut la réparer soi-même en se rendant à un stargazer ou utilisant un item assez rare mais rien de très punitif en soit. Il n'y a même pas de système qui fait que le personnage inflige moins de dégâts si la jauge de durabilité est basse, donc les malus sont pratiquement inexistants. Pour un souls-like, je pense que ça aurait été mieux d'avoir un aiguisoir à usage limité, ça permettrait de rajouter une difficulté supplémentaire.
- On peut changer de tenue et de coupe de cheveux, mais ça reste purement esthétique, étant donné que, de ce que j'ai constaté, ça n'apporte aucun changement aux stats.
- Ceux qui ont un PC gaming bas de gamme devront s'attendre à quelques lags, notamment pendant les combats de boss ou le chargement des zones.

Si vous aimez les soulsborne, ce jeu est ce qui se rapproche le plus d'un Bloodborne sur PC. Beaucoup de mécaniques sont similaires aux Dark Souls et les fans de la saga pourront sûrement apprécier Lies of P, que ce soit pour le gameplay, l'ambiance générale ou même l'histoire.

This game is a masterpiece! For soulsborne and souls-like fans, it's definitely worth a try!

[h3]Positive points:[/h3]
- The graphics are its greatest quality. The game looks incredibly pretty, even on lowest.
- Very well optimized, no need to have a war machine to run it.
- Some mechanics are not easy to learn, but that remains a positive point because it's what one would expect from a game that describes itself as a souls-like.
- The game can be played with both controller and keyboard/mouse, although it is strongly recommended to use a controller.
- The difficulty is rather easy for a souls-like, it's an excellent game to get started with this genre.
- The characters' and enemies' designs are simply stunning. The protagonist exudes an aura of both mystery and innocence and that makes him oddly very endearing.
- The general atmosphere of the game is very successful; the settings are sinister and the human corpses, added to the behavior of the puppets and the petrified, which are a bit reminiscent of zombies, add a grim post-apocalyptic atmosphere to the game.
- There are lots of interesting mechanics which mean that, even if the game is obviously inspired by soulsborne games, it adds its own little touch which makes it unique. For example, weapons are divided into two parts (blade and handle) and the character's left arm can be used in various ways.
- As for the story, I have nothing to complain about. It's a typical souls-like story: something has caused a part of the population to become dangerous, we play until we face the final boss and we unlock one of the available endings based on our actions throughout the game.

[h3]Negative points:[/h3]
- The dodging system is not of much use and is sometimes even useless against certain enemy attacks, since the parries are what provide bonuses and advantages. It would have been nice to see a souls-like based on dodging rather than parrying, for once, especially since the parries are quite complicated to do and it's almost frame-perfect most of the time.
- Same goes for the weapon durability, since you can sharpen it at any time. The only thing that happens if the durability reaches 0 is that the weapon breaks. You can repair it yourself by going to a stargazer or using a fairly rare item but nothing very punitive in itself. There isn't even a system that causes the character to inflict less damage if the durability gauge is low, so the consequences are practically non-existent. For a souls-like, I think it would have been better to have a limited-use sharpener, that would add an additional difficulty.
- You can change your outfit and haircut, but it remains purely aesthetic since, from what I have observed, it does not bring any change to the stats.
- Those with a low-end gaming PC should expect some lag, especially during boss fights or when zones are loading.

If you like soulsborne, this game is the closest thing to Bloodborne on PC. Many of the mechanics are similar to Dark Souls and fans of the saga will surely enjoy Lies of P, whether it is for the gameplay, the general atmosphere or even the story.",1703661410,1705555636,True,2,0,0.539295375347137451,0,True,False,False

- Bosses (very well designed and unique)
- Weapons System, loved it.
- Enemy variety
- Ambientation
- Pinocchio Adaptation
- Combat is a mix of Bloodborne, Sekiro and Dark Souls/Elden Ring with it's unique touch.

Cons:
- Heavy weapons should have some kind of hyper armor.
- Maybe the arms should've seen more love:
- The acid one is slow and enemies most of the times move quickly out of the acid pool.
- The grappling hook is the best IMO most versatile, but when you try to do a plunging attack it gets interrupted so easily.
- The fire one does almost no damage unless you upgrade ADVANCE a lot, also super slow and easily interruptable.
- The shock one again too slow, and low damage.
- The land mine one, never used it.
- The shield is kind of good too, but not something that you'll be wanting to use all the time.

For me a 9/10 experience and one I would easily recommend to fans of the genre. 

I really enjoyed Lies of P a lot more than I thought I would. If you like souls-likes, I think this game is worth your time and money. But I'll list my pros and cons if you're on the fence:

Pros: 

The weapons and animations look and feel amazing. Getting a perfect parry into fable art into heavy attack stagger into heavy attack and then a quick light attack to finish the scripted ""fatal blow"" looks and feels amazing to pull off. I didn't know I needed combos like that, but now I do - they're really cool.

The weapons themselves are really cool. Bloodborne and Elden Ring are two of my favorite games of all time, but in both of those I struggled to find the weapon that really spoke to me. In Lies of P, the weapons were all fighting for my favorite and I regularly switched weapons just because there are so many cool weapons to choose from, not even to get into weapon crafting (which was awesome). 

I really enjoyed the story and characters - I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that I was very skeptical, and the fact that this game mirrored the Pinocchio story was initially a turn off for me. The game changed my mind for sure. I'll be thinking about this story for a while. 

I enjoyed the enemy placement and encounter design. Traps and ambushes were fair and predictable, and almost always avoidable if you pay attention to environmental hints. 

The bosses in this game are sick. I really enjoyed all of them. I kept thinking I would be disappointing by the quality of them, but Lies of P keeps a high bar from beginning to end here. I didn't think any of them were a shocking difficulty spike either, but your mileage may vary here. 

I think they did an amazing job of tying gameplay elements into the narrative. 

Music also slaps.

Runs amazingly on steam deck. I got 60-90 fps right out of the box with no tweaking (I do use tools like cryoutilities).


Cons:

I think the level design was a little too linear for me. The upside of this is that I didn't have any fomo, since all the little secrets are pretty easy to find. In Elden Ring, if you want to complete a story line on your first play-through chances are you'll need a guide, in this game I was able to complete 80% of all the quests and stories in my first blind play-through (and could have done more if not all if I had payed more attention) to helpful hints such as the character icons in the fast travel menu indicating that a character has new dialogue. Regardless - the level design had more of an FPS feel to it where you're basically charging through a level with a straight line to the boss, unlocking shortcuts back to the starting spawn as you go. For reference, my favorite world design of all time is DS1 - I am not looking for open world, but this was really really a line in one direction. 

I don't like the ""grab"" telegraphs. A lot of them look like normal stabs and bait you to parry them, and it can be kind of annoying. I actually think that Sekiro solved this pretty well by providing you with a big ""grab"" icon when a boss was about to go for a grab, allowing you to react. 

Enemy variety felt a bit lacking, but the quality of the enemies felt good. It may be more of an aesthetic variety that I was missing as opposed to a mechanical variety. 

I don't like sprint being tied to the dodge button. Dodging with ""B"" is fine, but trying to sprint around the levels holding ""B"" and not being able to control your camera is annoying. For me this made exploration way more comfortable on steam deck where I could bind a back button to ""B"" and use that to sprint while keeping control of my camera. When playing on controller I had to curl my pointer finger around to rest it on the ""b"" button, which was not as comfortable. Ideally, I could have clicked in the left stick to toggle sprinting, but whatever.


Undecided:

I would say that several bosses have moves that you're supposed to die from on your first attempt or until you memorize the pattern. I really enjoyed figuring out each fight, and going from getting slammed to basically taking no damage the entire fight. That feeling when the tables start to turn on a hard boss is great. However, it doesn't always feel fair I guess? Compared to Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and even Sekiro, there were relatively few bosses I managed to take down on my first blind attempt because of the nature of their moves and attack patterns. I think there were a few main bosses I killed on my first try [spoiler](Parade Master, Mad Donkey, Fallen Archbishop, Corrupted Parade Master, and all of the lone stalkers+white lady)[/spoiler] and two that I killed on my second try [spoiler](Manus and Nameless Puppet)[/spoiler]. To me that felt like a fair enough balance. But there were definitely times where I was like ""oh yeah you're supposed to die on that until you've seen it"".

I like that costumes are not tied to defensive stats, but I wish you got more costumes early. My three favorite costumes didn't come until the final two stages of the game (at roughly the 85% mark), so I didn't feel like I really got to enjoy them until NG+. I also wish that there were more costumes and less re-skins of existing costumes, but at least the costumes that are available all look pretty cool. 

Not sure where I sit on boss runs (running all the way from a bonfire back to a boss room as opposed to reviving at the boss door). Not really a problem unique to this game, but when you're supposed to die until you've learned the boss the runs can get tedious. 

Some of the P Organ upgrades felt like they should have been base abilities (looking at you double dodge). However, it was probably good to be forced into learning the perfect parry, as it is pretty core to combat in this game. Having the improved dodge from the start would have left many players trapped in the midgame crutching on the dodge when they need to have already learned how to parry. So fair enough I guess. 

I loved this game. Highly recommend and looking forward to the DLC.

Either you enjoyed Dark Souls - and other souls-like games - or you didn't, you owe it to yourself to at least try Lies of P.

Around 20-35 hours to complete, more if you go for multiple runs, and *huge* replayability if you want - only parry run, only dodge run, heavy build run, ninja run, the list goes on -.

The perfect guard system works beautifully with the timings being just right as long as you learn the combos and animations of the enemies and bosses you're fighting. It's not quite Sekiro, since you need to hold the guard and figuring it how long to do that for, especially for fast combos, is part of what you'll have to learn. Short of a perfect guard, you take some damage but can regain it, a slightly tweaked borrow from Bloodborne that encourages an aggressive play-style and hints that you may need to try guarding for certain attacks or enemies. The secret lies in a balance of both dodges and guards, as you quickstep when locked on just like in Bloodborne, and finding that balance for each encounter was really fun for me. However, dodging is made a lot more easier if you can fast roll and fast rolling is enabled at < 30% equip load which makes Capacity, if you want to fast roll, the single most important stat in the entire game. A pretty important quirk to keep in mind.

* I do think the feedback for when you hit a perfect guard could have been better. It's there, through VFX and SFX, but it doesn't have enough oomph and I found myself often looking for the health bar to see if I lost any health or not. I did manage to get a better feel for them as the game progressed, but they're definitely not as impactful as Sekiro's ""clang"" of swords when you parry. That particular feedback is unmatched.

+ Being able to recharge one Pulse Charge when you've run out by either dealing damage or guarding perfectly was a stroke of genius. It is such a small consideration, but it affects game-play in a tremendous way, allowing for some breathtaking, nerve-wracking wins where I've managed to pull victory from the jaws of defeat against all odds, so close to dying. It is immensely satisfying when it happens.

+ The weapon system is the only thing bordering on innovation and it's really inspired. You can combine blades and handles of the various weapons you find to create some Frankenstein monsters of destruction. In my play-through I didn't really experiment much, but I've seen enough of other people playing with the system to know that it truly works and can reward you with some really powerful weapons that might be just right for your play-style. Boss-weapons can not be dismantled and reassembled, but they all have their own fun gimmick. I committed to the Two Dragons sword upon finding it and the parry on the charged R2 is so fun. Very difficult to time, but supremely satisfying and useful when successful.

+ Pretty much the entire boss line-up was great, all the fights consistently fun and, most of all, fair. Their animation work was both beautiful and clean, with attacks and moves being easy to read and thus timings fun to learn. Sure, some unnaturally delayed attack animations here and there, something I wish stayed with FromSoft's games, but nothing absurd or truly infuriating. Some mini-bosses also stand out, some truly tough fights peppered along the way to impede your exploration.

+ Visually, the game is an accomplished use of UE4 with great looking materials and direct lighting, a clean image and really stable and strong performance. No dips in frame-rate and no stutters across the entire play-through. There is some geometry lacking in detail here and there and the solution used for indirect lighting is very limited with some interiors showing extremely flat lighting, but overall the game is really easy on the eyes.

+ The story presentation was a step up from FromSoft's entries bar Sekiro with which it is pretty comparable. Even though P doesn't speak, there is a limited dialogue system which also allows you to choose between lying and telling the truth in various instances, a choice which has an effect on your character as well as the ending. That, coupled with some simple side-quests here and there, adds a level of interaction to the world that's usually missing in these games.

- In spite of the better presentation, I found that I couldn't care for the story, or the world, at all. The writing and voice acting are uneven and in many instances downright bad. Because of that, the world itself suffers as well; there is a magic missing that's present in FromSoft's entries, something that makes the world believable and lived-in even when it's desolate. That feeling I got when exploring Lordran and Yharnam is sadly missing here. Then again, FromSoft hasn't managed to recapture that in a while either (for me), so yeah >.>

- The level design is very linear as well, with very few side-paths and very straightforward shortcuts, just a funnel towards the next boss most often. Krat sadly did not employ Yharnam's urban planners. However, the variety of enemies is large enough that it compensates for the linearity and manages to save exploration from total boredom.",1705373795,1705373843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is fast-paced like Bloodborne/Dark Souls 3 and parry-heavy like Sekiro. Dodging in this game is more viable than Sekiro though. The bossfights are an exciting spectacle and a good challenge.  There is no online co-op like the other Souls games but you can summon a NPC specter to help. I did my first playthrough without using them but I might try them in new game +. 

My only complaint is that the camera is your enemy sometimes. In all of the Souls games, sometimes the camera will get stuck inside the gooch of the larger enemies/bosses and you're panic rolling and oh god they won't stop attacking and I can't see anything and JUST LET ME HEAL ok I'm dead.

This game does such a brilliant job of integrating the sekiro deflect mechanics with traditional souls combat; something promised in Elden Ring but not fully delivered beyond a generic stance break ability.
Out of any souls game, this one allows me to approach fights absolutely however I'm most comfortable with. The entire game is playable with dodge rolling for example, although certain bosses will encourage certain combat styles, making it especially rewarding to master each system and recognise when to apply it. 

Better multi enemy fights than other Souls games, with good use of audio cues to help you understand what is going on off screen. Some super derivative bosses and movesets, but the aforementioned combat improvements make this less noticeable.

Lots of world building is delivered in order to flesh out the world; and ensure the endings have impact. Throughout the game it is clear that your choices are going to make a difference at the end, although the ambiguity creates a lot of tension. I ended up not liking my ending very much but that was because my choices had backed me into a corner decision wise.

The game feels very familiar, although progression is somewhat dated in comparison to combat - playing out more like DS2 with linear areas that don't necessarily transition smoothly, although lots of shortcuts and looping back in on yourself to enjoy. This isn't really a problem for me as the souls market is a little starved for linear level design at the moment. Areas are still for the most part memorable and distinct, although I would have liked the boss designs to be more representative of their arenas and the local enemies you fight before them.

[b]19 hours to beat[/b], although I am still missing one boss. Planning to complete the achievements for this as I'm loving the experience.

[h2]Completion Edit[/h2]

Now I have collected all the achievements for this game I'd like to slightly append my review.
I got to experience the rise of P ending for one of them, which requires lots of thought surrounding the humanity system. I think this was a great choice and gets the player to interact with things they otherwise might not, like the piano. 
My final run took me just short of 5 hours which is a great tell of the quality of a souls game. Once you master all of the mechanics and routes this game can be ran very fast which I think is excellent.

The story of this game is quite deep and am looking forward to it being expanded in the future. 

Certainly overall has to be a top 3 souls game for me, really just engaging mechanics used throughout that I will deeply miss when Elden Ring DLC finally releases. The parry, legion arm, fable art meter, health recovery system are all elements that just elevate the gameplay in this game well beyond almost every other game in the genre. It is of course beautiful and very thematic, while also being a solid length with a quality standalone story.

all i really can say is i recommend you take the time to really learn the game mechanics, pay attention to how the game wants you to play it.
really take the time to learn the parrying and perfect guard. i promise you wont regret it. it took me until the scraped watchman. take your time with that fight. learn the parrying while fighting him. it was so much fun learning that boss its insane. that one and a few others were the first bosses since dragonlord from elden ring that i had so much fun learning. dancer of the boreal valley DS3 is another fun one to learn. id say take the time to learn each of the bosses move set. i mean you dont have to do this but i had a better experience this way. dont use a summon for any boss. it just was better for me. i will say the only time i didnt have fun or was annoyed was laxasia.. ive always hated when they make bosses with no damn stamina bar. the just attack and attack and attack. other than that i dont really have no cons about this game. the gameplay is unique. its fun. the bosses were fun to learn. the concept is obvious cool. idk what to say they did something right with this one.

8/10 with my experience
its downside is that it is pretty linear, and its not always a bad thing. just wish it had more open options and allowed you to go to different bosses and come back. but even than its not that big a deal. i can see a sequel having more of that. another thing.. the stalkers! such a cool and fun idea. those type of mini bosses were so fun too",1705332944,1705332944,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played Bloodborne with a friend a little bit previously, this game is definitely a mix of Bloodborne and the classic tale of Pinocchio. It also has lots of dark, dreary tones, but in a REALLY grim n mean way, sorta like the Alice Madness series. Combat is tough, sure. I was worried it might be too tough...But...Honestly?? It's only as tough as you make it. You can swap weapons, take the blade off a handle and replace it with a different blade...make your own weapons, level weapons up, upgrade your character, etc.

In terms of art, action, characters and all, I'd rate this 9/10.

ADVICE FOR NEW PLAYERS/THOSE NEW TO THE GENRE:

- START WITH THE ""BALANCED"" loadout, first. ALWAYS EXPLORE and take your time in battles. Practice the perfect parry with 1 enemy at a time, next to a Stargazer (Campfire). Make it a habit to do this and you'll SMOKE enemies. I don't want to give you a loadout to copy, as you wouldnt have your own journey, then.

HOWEVER, I will say:

- As one of your weapons, just to deal with electronic/robotic puppets better, use the ELECTRIC COIL HEAD and HANDLE as one of your 2 weapons. It'll help A LOT. If you want even more range on it and find a wrench weapon later (assuming you find it), use the wrench handle as a base and the coil head as the blade.

Oh and one more thing! Sometimes there's an easier solution to taking down a Mini boss! Such as the Puppet of The Future in the factory! have a good look around the area! (No spoilers~)",1705314873,1705314873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll start the longer review by stating that knowing a bit about Souls games will make P a lot more enjoyable, but the story is a clear, obvious difference between P and typical Souls games. The classic Souls experience has an immensely fragmented story that takes significant additional research time to put together, if you even wish to do that. Given that the sell for Lies of P is that it's a Pinocchio story, it shouldn't be surprising that they took a different route and placed the story front-and-center. That said, it's wonderful how they asked ""what would this story look like in a Bloodborne universe?"" and then nailed it perfectly. It's actually not just BB, either: As I was playing, I got vibes from a mix of other games, be it Bioshock, Silent Hill, or Resident Evil, among many other influences I'm sure you can find. It perfectly demonstrates how ""derivative"" isn't always a bad thing. 

Similarly, you can expect a far more straight-forward level experience. Although it did at times feel like I was literally playing a copy/paste of a BB or DS area, the game is more-or-less linear. Area A leads to Area B and so on. There is exploration to be had within each area (and I highly recommend doing that), but unlike classic Souls designs, you're always going to be heading in a direction of clear progress that also advances the story. Souls games are almost defined by the exact opposite with hidden areas, hidden bosses (or ""out-of-order"" bosses), etc., and the ability to get easily lost. It's actually quite refreshing for someone like myself that has kids and can't necessarily sit and play for hours on end; I can come back to P and know exactly where I left off. Moreover, the game is good at providing clear indicators when something can be done to progress a side story/quest, which again helps a forgetful person like myself remember what I could be doing. It's a good design in my eyes.

Next, gameplay. P is a mix between BB and classic DS. Your movement is going to feel a lot like BB, but perhaps a bit slower, which is a characteristic the enemies share. Unlike BB, you have a guard, so that's more classic DS. The twist with P is that all enemy attacks do guard damage, which you can regain by landing attacks; however, you can negate this by guarding right as an attack lands, so it acts much like a parry. It's an important mechanic since there are large wind-up attacks that cannot be blocked and thus require this (or a dodge). I personally took a BB approach and went all-in on dodge, and it didn't seem to be an issue. Either way, the result is that you end up moving and fighting in a classic DS style, waiting for those big punish windows, but all with the look and flair of Bloodborne. 

This leads me to my only two real gripes with the game: The sluggish controls and often buggy interactions. Although combat will feel like a mix between BB and DS, it's kind of the worst of both worlds. Your dodge is not nearly as good as it is in BB and your build possibilities aren't nearly as extensive as DS. And then, very weirdly, I found myself getting stuck on walls a lot, even a couple times getting stuck on enemies and dragged about. Or, the occasional disappearing act when an enemy would clip into the environment and be stuck there (or worse, somehow get unclipped and surprise attack; that was fun).

The good news is that neither of those things is a gamebreaker. For one, they happen only enough to make you chuckle and shake your head. For another, the game gives you a ton of offensive mechanics to make up for weak defense. You have your typical DS variety of items to buff yourself or throw at enemies. There's no magic but you do have two separate meters that offer powerful special attacks. There's a durability aspect to your weapon, which I bring up only because you repair your weapon yourself as needed and the item you use to do so can be bolstered to offer temporary buffs as well. On top of that, you have a more traditional RPG skill tree that provides various boosts, be it offensive, defensive, or even utility (by expanding your inventory/etc.). So yeah, there's a lot you have to boost your power.

This actually leads me to the topic of difficulty. Even without all these tools, the game feels rather easy. I actually kept forgetting I even had meter attacks and it certainly didn't seem to make the game any harder. The LONE exception to this rule is the very, very final boss, which was really funny to experience a mostly stress-free playthrough and then have what was one of the harder bosses I can recall in a Souls game lol. Now, this could be viewed as a pro or a con, but like every soulslike, the game can be as hard as you want by simply not using whatever tools you think will make things easy or vice versa.

So, given that we don't (and maybe won't ever) have a Bloodborne 2, it was incredibly pleasant to play this game. BB is my favorite Souls game and it was nice experiencing that vibe again with a sincere spiritual successor.

This game has an incredible combat system. You're able to combine blocking, parrying and dodging, but you aren't obligated to stick with any of them: Play however you want! Your weapons have light, heavy and charge attacks, as well as some special moves. You can stun enemies, riposte them, backstab them, throw some sawblades at them, break their weapons by parrying and blow them up with rockets even. And it all feels so damn fluid and satisfying.

The weapon variety is stunning as well. Your arsenal will have more than 40 weapons, each with its own moveset, special 'fable-arts' and sometimes even a gimmick.

But that's not all there is! You can separate all the normal weapons (29 to be exact) into a blade and a handle. After that it's time to create your own abominations of weapons, and there are literally no restrictions. Wanna slap the edge of a greatsword on the handle of a tiny knife? Do it. The handle decides your moveset and the edge dictates your swing speed. This system has lead me and my friend to sit in the hub area experimenting with different blades and handles for hours!

You're also equipped with a 'Legion arm', which allows for even further experimentation with builds. With these, you can hook enemies, electrify them, place landmines and more! You can also upgrade your 'Legion arms' to obtain new sick moves which add to your playstyle.

Speaking of level design, it seems as if the little bastard Miyazaki himself was involved here. The game is constantly trying to trick and kill you, makes the game feel fresh even after 20 hours of gameplay and keeps you on guard constantly (By the end of the game my friend was so paranoid he was walking through the corridors slowly never releasing his block button lol). The atmosphere and the gothic architecture are fabulous and remind of Bloodborne.

If you are curious about the bosses, you won't be disappointed. I don't remember a single boss fight where there wasn't a second phase. The designs are both awesome and scary. The fights themselves... Gorgeous! The attack patterns are very fluid and diverse. The 10-hit combos are reminiscent of Sekiro, and it feels so good to parry each blow. My friend says some bosses are too tanky, but I think everyone is granted a fair amount of health.

There is also a cute cat you can pet in the hub area. ^^

The only complaint I have is that the game is very, very linear. There are no optional areas, thus you're likely not going to miss on much content throughout your first playthrough. There are a few optional bosses though, but the 'optional' aspect is decided by how you will act in certain dialogues.

Definitely a must-play if you like the souls genre.",1705269514,1705269514,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

i just completed my first playthrough, and i gotta say i'm impressed.
The music hits different and the boss/combat themes are masterpieces.

The areas are beautiful and well crafted. However there arent really any hidden areas/bosses, Fortunately that isnt really a problem for me atleast. There is also alot of different enemies making every new area engaging (i just played LOTF)

The weapon system is unique and fun, making the weapon that best suits your playstyle.
The fable moves are fun and provide some different utility, i didnt play with them that much though. One thing about them is they can be used without stamina, which can be useful in certain situations. The same can be said for the legion arm, not too powerful but useful in its own way.

The parry/ guard is an excellent addition to the souls genre, giving the player more options to counter and attack makes it more engaging. An example would be laxasias first phase double horizontal swing or rapid slash combo, you cant dodge it if you're too close, but parrying works like a charm. the opposite can be said for victor where dodging is your best friend. Sometimes the optimal thing to do is just run around/away from a certain attack to either punish or simply be safe. This makes learning the bosses so much fun.

The bosses were very good, and i can say that laxasia has landed within my top 5 souls bosses. The only bad thing i can say about them is that some of them (Manus especially, since he's the second last boss) need more moves, but I think all souls bosses need more attacks. I guess it doesn't really count as critique then, more a personal wish. 

If wish fable attacks and legion arm played a bigger role / were more powerful to incentivise their use, but they do get stronger from scaling so idk. There isn't really anything I would add/change to make this game better. It has good music and feels incredibly fun to play. I have to give the game a 10/10

Great Soulslike with more replayability than FromSoft titles for me. Lies of P is a lot shorter than DS3/ER and is linear and quicker paced. This, combined with the additional progression systems of Legion Arms / P-Organ which are kept and expanded in NG+/+1 are an incentive to replay it multiple times to completion. The game is definitely more fun in NG+ than NG, in this way it's similar to Nioh 1/2.

Game controls great, basically the same scheme as ER/DS3. Looks very nice and runs well. The in-game records you can find and listen to are well-made and are way more memorable than the general soundtrack, which didn't really stick with me. The additional progressions (Legion Arms / P-Organ) are a very good addition that let you customize an alternative attack/tool and various stats. You can't obtain every Legion Arm upgrade in a single playthrough, but by NG++ you can have them all maxed out. New P-Organ tiers and bonuses are unlocked in NG+ and NG++. Unfortunately no new tiers are unlocked beyond NG++ apparently, which I'm hoping gets expanded on in the future. Resetting your Level, P-Organ, and Legion Arms is possible, though it costs a resource obtained just by waiting. I'm also delighted that only about 3 bosses have a grab attack, thank God.

Parrying feels more useful on NG+ runs, as on a first run you'd never really spend long enough on a boss to learn the timings for perfect parries. It's also more punishing than just dodging, especially when it comes to Fury attacks. On my NG run I almost never bothered with parrying, relying almost exclusively on the dodge and quick attacks of the Rapier. The lack of parrying and blocking also meant I usually never had to repair my weapons mid-fight (except bosses who use a status effect to break your weapon). The game features a lot of two-phase boss fights which feel like (or are) completely different fights between the phases, so I hope you like those. There also multiple-boss fights which are probably the most annoying ones. Thankfully there is only one single gimmick fight.

Overall, just play it. And hope they add more stuff for NG+++.",1704651272,1705196852,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,4,True,False,False

If someone told me FromSoft made this game, I would have believed them. This is the only soulslike I've ever played that met the quality of the actual Souls games, feeling like a true successor to Bloodborne. While most boss fights don't feel as difficult as From's, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Each boss is a spectacle in its own right, and the more gimmicky ones are incredibly fun to fight. The OST is so much better than it needed to be, you can feel the amount of time and effort that went into each track, especially in the collectible records. The weapon assembling mechanic is great, increasing your available weapons exponentially each time you find a new one, granting an insane amount of build variety. It's super easy to respec your character whenever you want, so you never feel locked into one build, and there's no need to worry if you level up an unnecessary stat by mistake. The game has Sekiro's parry, Bloodborne's rally, and a connected world akin to Dark Souls 1, among other things from From's games, making it feel like a celebration of the genre in the best way possible.
If you're a fan of Bloodborne, or any Souls game, this game is a necessity.

1. All of your usual ""souls-like"" mechanics are locked behind items and unlocks you don't get till after you beat the game. So the regular dodge, block, counter, iFrames, that are core to the Souls-Like genre are missing until then. NG+ ends up being what the first play through should have felt like.

2. The balancing is backwards in the most un-fun way. This means mini-bosses and story bosses move lightening fast, with massive string combos and instant teleport/lunge strikes. The rest of the enemies in between move like slugs, with slow attacks that are just ""free kills"" with no fun - because the game is so short they NEED you to grind for it to last more than 5 hours.

3. Your character moves rediculously slow in comparison to other souls-likes. You will be wishing you were in Elden Ring, Lords of the fallen, or Monster Hunter instead. This makes most boss fights seem super annoying and spammy, without any cool boss moments in the fights other than all bosses being multi-phase transformers.

4. Almost all of the ""items"" you pick up are throw-aways. Not worth using. Why? low damage, and with your ""summon"" for all the fights that matter, the summon will do most of the fighting for you. Your character just spams attacks while not targeted.

5. The Skill point system (P-ORGAN) Most of the skills you unlock are just basic skills you get from the very START of souls-like games, with the exception of healing items. I didn't feel like I was getting more powerful when I was leveling up, I just felt like I was trying to get closer to the starting character of Elden Ring or Lords of the fallen. Really felt bad for skill progression.

6. The weapons are mostly bad, with the exception of 6 weapons, not counting the end boss weapon. Additionally, even though you can ""craft different weapons"" most weapons only had stats for 1 of 3 types of gameplay and were poorly optimized. This meant only one third of the weapons found would be useable, and of those only 2 would be keepers. 

7. The story - oof. I bought this game for the concept of a Pinnochio souls-like story. There is almost no story. The razor thin veneer of the story just has Geppeeto & the cricket with maybe 15 lines the entire story, which are just casual observations of what is already going on. No character development, no attachment to characters, no feeling that this is a Pinnochio story at all.

4种攻击攻击如果安排得当、相互衔接，并对敌人弱点进行针对，那么整个战斗就会舒服无比，而且这种优势是游玩时可以明显感受到的。
另外，武器组装系统的加入，使得普通（轻攻击及重攻击）更加多样性。后期我用的是人偶斧头+匕首柄，其轻攻击相对较慢但威力充足，而重攻击反而攻速较快、可形成多段攻击，使得战斗中不仅攻击力足够，也容易打出硬直。
不过上面这些，都需要在后期升级完成的情况下才能感受到，前期的进攻手段确实非常受限。而且有些地图也非常恶心。另外，谜语之王以及冻结盛宴的支线任务奖励很丰富，但是太容易断了。",1704217641,1705135698,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

It's got the movement-heavy dodging and customization / stat distribution of Dark Souls / Elden Ring. It's got the deflection / blocking / stamina system from Sekiro (with a twist to up the skill required and to make it align better with the more traditional souls-esque mechanics). It's got a similar health regain mechanic to Bloodborne that emphasizes constant aggression, and similar weapon functionality (with more customization).

Its story and art direction, imo, is absolutely fantastic, and the music you find on vinyls throughout is nice too. I think where this game really falls off, though, is area variety. Though the combat, enemy variety and level design is on par with, if not better than, Fromsoft's games, I think the actual visuals are a little lacking. Though it's very graphically impressive - certainly moreso than Elden Ring - it struggles to make full use of that graphical fidelity to its full potential. Most areas feel very similar. Some areas seem like they're going to have potential only to end up being the same drab, desaturated tunnel / city street / wooden-plank-platform area. Its areas also don't feel lived-in or real in any way, making the whole experience somewhat video-gamey, turning what could be very cool areas into somewhat boring paths that lead from boss to boss. 

That being said, the bosses are excellent, as are the enemies. If you're willing to live with areas that are about as colorful as half of Dark Souls III, you'll have a great time.",1705124280,1705124280,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a 7/10 at best. I really don't like the parry mechanic being the main point. I hated Sekiro as well because of the ""perfect parry"" mechanic. I think it really takes away from what makes these games good. It wants you to be aggressive like Bloodborne, but then also play slow and just parry until you get a stagger off. It doesn't really work well in my opinion. 
My personal build is Motivity, so my attacks are very slow. I will parry and barely get 1 attack in after the enemy's chain of attacks. The heavy charge attacks are also so slow, that it makes it really hard to get it off before getting hit. 
The world is linear, which isn't a bad thing, but the areas feel really small and have no real substance besides enemies. I think the areas with ""zombie"" like creatures in the woods is also pretty random.
Lastly, I feel like the enemies are either too easy or too hard. Minibosses are everywhere and even sometimes right before a checkpoint. I will choose to run to the checkpoint door and open it before fighting them, which I never felt I had to do in other souls games. Bosses are extremely hard, as it's all just about parrying all the attacks. Bringing in a summon almost hinders you in certain fights, because it makes it harder to get a stagger off when they take the aggro.
All in all, it's an okay game with many similarities to FromSoft games. I just think the world, story, fighting, and enemies could use work.",1705090526,1705090526,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't really recommend unless you're a Soulsbourne player. I did my first playthrough with specters (summons) because of the difficulty and it made the game hard to appreciate. I did my second playthrough by fighting all the bosses alone and that made the game actually click and feel fun and empowering.

Gameplay & difficulty:

I'm not a huge souls person, but LoP is really good and kind of worth it. It's not perfect, and some of the challenge is just made messy by certain architectural decisions of the fights. The main complaint is that every attack has this obnoxious arbitrary pause window that makes the flow of enemies feel unnatural and you thus can't intuit when to perfect block, you can only learn the timings via memorization.

Story & world:

Absolutely fantastic world building and characters. Still has the NPC conversation story telling mechanics like other soulsbourne games... but I think this does it better, and it also has cutscenes that both tell a story and are artistically brilliant. Specifically the animations & music in the boss entry cut scenes are absolutely superb. I did 3 runs of the game to get all trophies and I skipped most cutscenes where the weight of them was learning the story, but there's a few where I watched at every opportunity because they're just that good.

Trophy collecting:

If you're only doing a single play-through, you can ignore this.

The fact that you have to do NG+ (or at at least most of it) to get all the trophies kind of blows because NG+ makes the game kind of frustrating as all basic enemies do 10x damage, so exploring the world becomes annoying as there's so many enemy traps that assume you're going to get ganged up on and surrounded... which basically means you die. I ended up just running straight through a lot of the last level which is full of this, whereas I actually really liked that level in the base game.

You also have to do a lot of playthroughs to get all the trophies. Though if you have multiple devices there's ways to get multiple endings in a single playthrough.

Performance:

This thing could run on a potato. I get nearly 60 FPS consistently on the Steam Deck at low settings. On my 3080 PC at 4K, I get around 105-120 FPS depending on how busy the current environment is (e.g. boss fights run consistently at 120 but areas loaded with enemies run a little closer to that 105).",1705032796,1705033238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Gorgeous art style and visuals, the game captures the magnificence of the belle epoque down to the smallest detail, from buildings to clothing it is a masterpiece to look at from start to finish.

+ Varied and versatile combat system, between the dozens of weapons, legion arms, items and passives you can build your personal P to face the horrors of Krat, making this game the first one to really challenge From Software in the combat quality department.

+ A gripping story that reinvents the Claudio Collodi characters into a spectacular dystopian tale about the nature of one self, from our protagonist P to all the supporting casts and bosses, every character has a place in the story being told.

+ Top Notch level design, the streets of Krat and surroundings are filled to the brim with stuff to find, secrets to uncover and vistas to enjoy, exploration in this game is a pleasure.

Cons:

- Some players might find the maps to be slightly too linear but its really a minor nuisance.

Lies of P is a masterpiece in the Soulslike genre, reaching From Software level of polish, quality of combat, level of character costumization and fairness and brutality of bosses. No player that has even the slightest passion for the genre should skip on having Lies of P in their collection of games, especially with an expansion and sequel on its way.

This game's movement and combat feels directly in line with Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring, despite having significant mechanical differences. If you enjoy how those games feel, compared to Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, and Dark Souls 2, you will have a good time.

The game's parry system is sort of a hybridization of Bloodborne's rally system and Sekiro's parry system. It works very well. For the vast majority of the game you can just dodge, but there are advantages to mastering parrying.

Atmosphere is very similar to Bloodborne, but not identical. This is not just Bloodborne at home.

Performance is perfect. I'm on a Ryzen 5800X and Radeon RX6600. Buttery smooth. Graphics are excellent.

The thing that this game actually does better than FromSoft's Soulsborne catalog is telling a story. With the exception of Elden Ring (and Sekiro if you believe that Sekiro is a Soulsborne game), Soulsborne games are exceedingly light on NPC interaction outside of the player hub, and the lore usually requires extensive item reading and YouTube video watching to understand. Elden Ring, IMO, is a partial improvement in this regard. Lies of P has a clear and straightforward narrative, not dumbed down per se but definitely not requiring the mental gymnastics and item description consumption that the Soulsborne titles do. There is nothing wrong with how FromSoft does things, but it is refreshing to play something in this genre that mixes this gameplay style with more traditional storytelling.

Soundtrack is top tier. I bought this game on sale but went back and picked up the soundtrack as well.

If you are a Soulsborne veteran, most of this game will not challenge you. All the lessons that you picked up from those titles will make large portions of this game a breeze. Moreover, there is so much quality of life upfront that it blunts the difficulty: You can easy teleport between ""Bonfires"" and after the first boss you get an item that lets you teleport to ""Bonfires"" and the player hub without losing ""Souls"". Pocket ""Souls"" tell you how many ""Souls"" you get from using them. Mid-to-late game gives you respec options. You don't have boss runs once you unlock level shortcuts. There are items that let you adjust weapon scaling depending on preferred stats, and non-special weapons can have their blades and handles be mixed and matched to let you craft weapons that match your preferred stats and weapon abilities. The game has an extensive perk tree that you can upgrade your character with, allowing for very extensive customization that lets you make your character very strong in your preferred way. There is probably more, but these all standout. If you are a Soulsborne noob and want something to ease you into the genre, I can't think of a better game (Code Vein is also good but even easier yet). If you are a veteran, you may have a bad time if all you care about is difficulty. If you are a veteran and want something that will punish you for lack of effort but won't push you to your limits, this is the game.

There is only one reason why I don't rate this a full 10/10. Two of three endings of this game require you to fight an optional final boss after the main final boss. This optional final boss is a huge difficulty leap over every single other boss in this game. Unlike before, I had to farm for throwable items, respec into a parry build, and master the parry system, which I had managed to otherwise skip purely due to my mastery of previous Soulsborne titles carrying me through. I subtract 0.1 from my score not because of any resentment over having to get good, but because this explosive leap in difficulty crashed into my immersion from the prior portions of the game's emotional ending. This nitpick is barely worth talking about compared to the immense amount of fun I had otherwise, but I feel that I would be dishonest if I left it out of this review.

Despite not being able to give this a full 10/10, I do consider this to be a masterpiece. It's worth the full price, though I always recommend people buy on sale when they can. This game deserves all the love it's getting. There is a small sequel hook at the end, though based on what I could see it's not a direct sequel to this game's story so much as another story set in the same world. When it comes to sequel hooks, you know that the game you are playing or movie you are watching is excellent if you have no problem with said hook. I had no problem. I hope these developers get a chance to make the game they hinted at and I will gladly buy it when it releases.",1704947837,1704947837,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

If you like Soulslike go for it, but if you played Elden Ring first and now you're thinking about buying this one, don't do it. 

The game design is impressive, but like the old Dark Souls games every time you die you will have to run a couple of kilometers (miles for Americans) to reach that boss or side boss dodging all the little enemies again and again which makes the game very repetitive and tedious.

As a positive point, the story is easy to understand since it is a European children's story, and you will not have to watch hours of videos on YouTube to understand who are you killing.

After Sekiro, I have been feeling discomfort around From Software’s releases; on one hand, I enjoyed Elden Ring and Armored Core 6, but on another hand, I didn’t get that overwhelming satisfaction I had, completing them in the vein I felt when completing Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. Since I haven’t found a 3D Soulslike that clicked the way those did, I felt like I needed to resign my hopes for another experience like what I had in 2019.

Then P showed up out of nowhere for me and blew me away in its execution. I will now refrain from referencing From’s catalogue and focus on P and only P. It’s easy to compare it to those other games, but I believe P deserves to stand proud without references. There are three strengths to P: [u]Combat Mechanics, Encounter Variety, & Atmosphere.[/u]

Mechanically, the way you engage with combat seems, at first, like a standard-fair experience, but there are a lot of little nuances that create its own identity. Let’s talk about what you’re going to be doing a lot in the beginning of any new Soulslike: Getting hit, something you’re inevitably going to endure before you can git gud. P offers a twist in how you mitigate damage by taking blocking and turning it into a temporary punishment. You lose temporary health when you block, requiring you to quickly attack in between blocks to restore that health, or perfect-time block to take no damage. This is in addition to dodges w/ standard I-frames. Where this becomes engaging is how you need to find a sweet-spot between dodging difficult hits and then taking gambles to perfect-block more predictable hits. Your encouragement to perfect-block is two-fold: One, you can only perfect-block fury (red) attacks unless you can physically out-run the attack. Two, successful perfect-blocks cause posture damage more rapidly than hitting, allowing you to swiftly guard break foes for massive damage. A fun detail about this is you’re not necessarily required to always perfect block, as a later-perk allows you to restore temporary-health from perfect guards, meaning that if an enemy is flurrying you with several hits, getting a mix of perfects and non-perfects can still result you taking no damage, so long as you are landing those perfects in the end of that flurry.

In my opinion, this is very engaging. On top of that, you have a healing and weapon-degradation system that brings new twists on these played-out aspects of the genre. Healing are basic, replenishing on resting, but the real show-stealer is the unique comeback mechanic, where dealing damage and perfect-guarding after your last charge is spent allows you to slowly refill 1 charge (and only your last). This means even when a fight is not going well, there is always a chance to turn your pending failure into a last-minute success. Weapon-degradation is also built-in perfectly by creating a tension you need to be wary of, specifically during long-engagements with boss-fights. You’re always able to replenish your durability, but it costs you seconds of exposure, meaning you need to find gaps in your opponent’s aggression to repair, which is exciting and intense during specific encounters.

Finally, regarding combat mechanics, weapon-equipping has no restrictions apart from weight (an easily avoided problem with well-considered loadouts), which means you are free to equip any weapon and experiment to your heart’s content; upgrade resources aren’t too hard to acquire apart from cap-stone resources, which means it doesn’t feel like a grind-chore to boost up a new weapon you’re interested in. Best of all is the weapon-crafting, itself, where you’re able to mix blades with move-sets. Another way to think of this is mixing damage-type and current-level enhancement with move-set and scaling. Found a greatsword you boosted early-on but want to try out this spear you just found? Stick that sword onto that shaft and now you have a spear-sword. Or maybe you’re a mad-lad and want to stick it onto a rapier-hilt so you can pretend that big hunk of steel is an estoc. You’re never really punished for making these decisions, and it’s just fun to find combinations that suit your current needs. There’s no spell-casting, which in a way keeps you focused on honing the aforementioned combat, but there is Legion for limited-used special moves, and Fable attacks, which are unique to your weapon and hilt, which are replenished from hits and perfect blocks. Customizing your puppet and seeing the combinations you can land with these tools keeps the whole package rewardingly fresh.

Enemy variety comes with its own discovery, as the roster is as perfect as one can expect from this genre. Without spoiling a fun twist that happens past the half-way point of the game, you can be sure to expect new enemies and new ways the enemies engage with you from beginning to end. Up to the very end of the game, you are being introduced to either new enemies or new twists in previously-encountered enemies; even the final non-boss enemy you fight is unexpected. As for boss-variety, it’s solid and comes with all different flavors: Slow moving, Fast-moving, passive and dangerous, aggressive and flurrying, you name it. Even on a third playthrough on NG++, I was always excited to revisit each boss, because I knew I was going to have the opportunity to enjoy the dance each of them provides with new loadout perspectives. Challenging yourself to perfect-block the majority of their moves is some of the most enjoyable game-play I’ve had recently.

Last detail I want to highlight is the atmosphere, and it doesn’t disappoint. In addition to being moody and thick with excellent music, I found this to be one of the rare Soulslikes to make me feel engaged with its world in a way many do not. I’ve never been a fan of the ‘items tell the story’ approach, and I found that because there was an active narrative being told, it made me want to learn more about the world. A question I like to ask myself when playing any game is “What would life be like in this setting?” And when it comes to a lot of soulslikes, unfortunately, I always find myself unable to really imagine existing in those settings. They are, for the most part, worlds to explore and destroy bosses in. In P, however, you’re given a bleak depiction of what the setting of Krat was, and what it has become, which means I’m not just motivated to enjoy fun combat, I also feel like more attuned to what my character is and his goal. As annoying as Gemini sometimes can be, I enjoy having exposition and world-building to help me care more about the world I’m exploring.

Did I say the soundtrack is excellent? I did. I’ll say it again. It’s excellent!

Shortcomings are focused primarily in one section for me, which is that the exploration is only satisfactory. It’s not awful, but it’s also not amazing. If everything else I described is between B+ and A+, this is a C+. It’s engaging and has visual variety, but it is ultimately linear, with only few deviations from course to find fun treasures. The combat and weapon-variety do some [i]intense[/i] heavy-lifting to compensate for this shortcoming, so I believe if a future sequel addresses this problem, I’d call it a perfect package. One plus-side is that the rest-points are well-placed, so I never feel like I’m running into them too-frequently. That adds good tension, especially on that first play through where you’re still learning to stop getting hit.

Overall, Lies of P is a wonderful time, and if you are someone who found From’s latest games to be a bit on the disappointing side, you deserve to check this out.",1704904904,1704905042,True,2,0,0.523650884628295898,0,True,False,False

The soundtrack is also pretty good with a couple of songs that have gone right onto my Spotify playlist.

I did originally play this game on release before the (arguably game-fixing) buffs were granted and dropped it back then, because it was a bit too finicky. But I have thoroughly enjoyed it upon returning and seeing the game balance in a much better state. 

My only major nitpick would be that the areas towards the end of the game are essentially just back-to-back elite enemy encounters that go on for far too long, to the point of tedium. It's a slog and it made me wonder whether the devs actually wanted anyone to reach the end of the game.

This game has high praise and it's well deserved. It's extremely polished, extremely fun, and extremely difficult. I have flawless performance, the game looks gorgeous, and it even supports ultrawide displays, too.

It's awesome, fun combat, cool enemies and bosses and a story/lore that was actually more interesting than I was expecting. As far as wearing your inspiration on your sleeve I feel like this game does it about as well as you can. The inspirations are clear but they've definitely used it to their advantage to make a really solid game. Personally I'd say this team has done a surprising amount of innovating on the formula as well as bringing new things unique to this game to the souls-like genre. If I had to make some critiques the biggest would probably be the levels/world. While it isn't completely linear they could've done more with exploration and the layout of level progression. But the actual issue is more related to the architecture, many textures used are pretty copy and pasted and a bit uninspired at times. Additionally many buildings or other structures in the world often don't fit together well, in a literal sense, like building parts overlapping and feeling out of place or not thought through. The only other genuine complaint I'd have is that a lot more could've been done in regards to legion arms and p organs skills. The arms that are there are interesting and useful but there is a lack of variety overall and quality use cases for utilizing every legion can sometimes be infrequent. For the p organ skills it did feel like too many of them were uninspired behind the scenes incremental stat increases, and while those have their place and are good to have more interesting/fun skills are definitely needed. Overall legion and p organ are both solid systems but they have a lot of potential that wasn't utilized, hopefully the dlc will expand on this.
 
Lies of P is a great game, its highs are very high and its shortcomings are all reasonable and can be improved upon with more budget/time this team will hopefully have with future entries or other IP's they'll work on. If a 9 is a masterpiece and a 10 is an industry defining masterpiece then lies of p is a very solid 8/10.",1704887140,1704887140,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Beautiful design: Seriously, the world artstyle is amazing and depending where you are on the game the hotel will start changing , like your nose on the wall painting , really good details . 

-Combat: Perfect blocks feel SO GOOD. Unlike most Souls games, hits feel powerful and slow, but landing that perfect parry is euphoric. Especially the fatal attacks, they feel incredible.

-Weapons and builds: Mixing blades and handles to change scalings is awesome , Literally any weapon can be viable, which is super fun. Plus, the Fable Arts add another layer of customization. And resetting Paragon with gold coin fruits just lets you experiment builds all you want. The Legion arms are cool too, this game just nails build variety.

-Rich story: Your choices, your lies, your humanity, all shape the story and lead to different endings. It's dark, sad, and depressing, but in a good way. The cinematics are great and you get attached to the characters, so the ending hits hard.

Bad stuff
-Camera: It NEEDS more options. Stop rotations, adjustable FOV, especially for big bosses. Not seeing their attacks because they're off-screen is annoying.

-Level design: 70% is amazing, but the other 30%… ugh. Annoying enemy placement that blocks paths or pushes you off edges. Not cool nor fun.

-Body blocks: This is the WORST. Jumping enemies cornering you and getting stuck with no movement or visibility? Died to this SO many times. It happens everywhere, stairs, corners, even under bosses! Getting stuck under a boss after a perfect block is just unfair specially with the swamp boss.

-Artificial difficulty : Some bosses are super annoying with faking attack animations , NG+ you literally get 1/2 shot by almost everything , grabs are super annoying on some bosses , the game has a lot of artificial difficulty implemented but if you get used to it you'll clear the game with no problems.

Things to keep in mind

-Difficulty: It's HARD. If you're new to Souls games or a casual, get ready to learn about perfect blocks, if you don't learn you're not going anywhere.

-Linear: No Elden Ring freedom here. Stuck on a boss? You're stuck until you beat it , no cheeses , no get OP early , no ergo (xp/runes) farms , no going around the world for different bosses that are easier.",1704876877,1704876877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FromSoft is still quite a bit ahead in game design in my opinion. Story crescendo'd in a good way, but the latter half of the game just felt off. Made more sense just to run through everything than risk dying to a collapsing floor or getting two-shot by some random shitter mob because you didn't perfect parry their micro window.

The game is quite a lot harder than FromSoft games in my opinion, maybe I just had a shit build, but it never felt hard like ""wow this is a complex boss with interesting move sets"".  More like ""wow this boss hits like 16 times in a row and you need to perfect parry every single one otherwise you lose half your health, and there's no opportunity to chug a heal and get it back because you're in a tiny 4x4 attic and the boss which already doesn't take a break just summoned a second version of itself"".

There's a difference between tasteful, complex challenge and just a soulless click timing fest like some souls-like equivalent of OSU or something. The typical neckbeard response is 'skill issue'.

Cons: weird writing and confused story and themes. A lot of the dialog feels very amateurish. The comic relief does not hit. The story is a tired ""search for immortality creates a zombie disease,"" but with puppets mixed in.

Combat is incredibly fluid combining elements from both bloodborne and sekiro creating a unique vibe. Neither parrying nor dodging is the best you have to use both in tandem. 
Boss design is great and challenging, but it's pretty easy to get very strong in this game i'm shredding boss health bars so if you want to power through stuff you can. 
Game is pretty linear but I'm not going to complain about something intentional. Enemy variety is also fantastic you keep seeing new enemies up to the endgame.

In many ways this is better than some of fromsoft's own games and if you're a fan of bloodborne or sekiro you should check it out. It's on par with DS3 (which I consider near the top of souls) and unlike that game, the bosses don't start terribly and get better they're all good (with one very annoying exception).

It's not a perfect game by any means, but if you're looking for a pure souls experience that isn't marred by stuff like an open world. This is an incredibly competent polished experience.

Still would highly recommend for just the fact that it was able to competently make a souls game while trying a lot of new things which I do appreciate. While it is challenging, with specters and throw items, you can make the game a lot less challenging to suit your taste. Personally, summoned a phantom once to try it out and rarely used consumables cause I was enjoying the parry system. But that's just me, play a game for your enjoyment; and I definitely think there is plenty of enjoyment to be had in this game (first run is probably around 30 hours, mines more cause I really enjoyed the hotel music records). 

Speaking from a first run through mindset after doing just about everything (I'll do NG+ when the DLC drops) some pros would definitely be the guard hp rally and parry system. They elicit a more aggressive play-style which I found fun (wish I could have played Bloodborne). And while I'm not good on parrying, I'll say the timing issues are largely down to just me not fully meshing with it for awhile, and still having skill issues even now. However, I do think the guard animation your forced into after a perfect block is far to long leading to some frustration when I just want to get my attack in (I'm a strength or well, motivity build, so I need some actual time to swing). In fact a lot of animations feel like they could have been sped up a bit. But I'd only call those mild frustrations. A pet peeve would be the weapons bouncing off walls, that has never and will never feel good. 

The world itself with interesting with minor side tracks that give you a good but more linear experience, granted that's what I was looking for so that was a plus to me. The voice acting as well was so good I actually feel like mentioning, far from just serviceable, it was honestly a stand out (Red Fox voice still gives me shivers). Though again small, actually I wouldn't call this a annoyance; but honestly the amount of shortcuts and/or new save points in the early game was almost overbearing. 

Now for combat... it's good, don't let what I'm about to say overwrite that. It was genuinely a fun and challenging experience, however some of the annoyances stuck out so much I have to now rant a bit about them. Starting off with probably the most minor, the jumps and the platforming in general. The whole walk across the beams bit got old quickly, and with how the jump is, honestly would have been better without it. Feels more like a animation is being played of you jumping while your still very much grounded to the floor; that probably doesn't make sense but it's the best way I can explain my feelings on the jump. Second, the whole enemies jumping out at you bit was a bit overused too. Thirdly, kind of wished some of the save points were closer to boss. They aren't a jaunt through the level, but it's just enough leg work to be noticeable but not challenging; so just felt like a waste of time. The Laxasia was a good one, which I'm thankful for cause I wanted to try the break weapon to win phase 1 strat. 

Now these while they annoyed me I wouldn't exactly call them negatives. The telegraphs on some of the attacks is a bit, well, just feels spiteful. Manus was a pain because his resting animation and a attack animation were similar, the slow down to bait out parries is darn near criminal sometimes, and those last ditch attacks after a stagger on the bosses (while I get what they were going for) is all just a bit much. The rope arm specifically I pray it got some hyper armor, came out faster, or had tighter hitboxes. Cause seeing a opening and hitting the rope the second it was safe to do so but still having the enemy get a hit out before you (especially when its like a horizontal swipe that isn't even close to you) and knocking you out of the animation was just depressing. They could have leaned a bit more into the rule of cool for rope arm, the fact it's just slightly to short to grab a enemy across a gap or the fact you move back a little so you cannot use it to yank a enemy into the abyss while on a beam were disheartening. On that note, kind of wish fables were a bit weaker but charged quicker so I could weave them into combat more though that issue is reduced in the later game and NG+s.",1704777162,1704777855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is the closest to a FromSoft game you can get, except the structure is pretty much linear (which I did not find to be a bad thing). All in all a great game if you are a From fan. I would not recommend to people who have not played a FromSoft game first as this is noticeably harder and more complex. 

The main issues I found are--
Gameplay: there's too much going on in terms of combat options, and there's too little reward for parrying. Not a complaint about difficult, as I beat it with mostly focusing on parrying; but it does not have the satisfying immediate staggers of Bloodborne, nor the build up to Sekiro-style actual executions. It's both very cumbersome to build up parry stagger, then fiddly to trigger the stagger once it is built up. and then often little damage is done, and late game bosses also get a counterattack to your coup-de-grace.
Story: scenario and storyboarding are excellent, but the lie/truth options are often basically just being normal vs. being asinine rather than hard choices about whether to lie. 
Graphics: (I played on a Steam Deck OLED on Best graphics setting for most of it) while the environments were great, the character faces were all a little out of focus around the hairline, which was distracting.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this.

 Good, because this is genuinely on the level of Fromsoftware in many ways.

Combat is the best i've seen since Sekiro, and the Bosses are just an absolute treat.

Only con that comes to mind is the extreme linearity of the levels, which didn't bother me, but if exploration is a primary selling point of Souls for you, maybe you should reconsider.

At the time of writing this, I have achieved the true ending and completed most NPC questlines in a single playthrough. The world is intuitive and the systems are so incredibly user-friendly! I did not need to look up anything outside of very hyper-specific instances unique to my playthrough. There is a system in place that shows you what areas of the map an NPC you have already met is in, or wants to talk to you at. No more ""This NPC travels to a really hidden area at a hyper-specific, easily missable moment, good luck finding them lol"" moments like in the actual From Soft titles sometimes! Things like that, and many more things I want you as the reader to find out for yourself as you play the game, are why I am recommending the game.

However, I want to adress the Bloodborne comparison. Sadly, I haven't been able to play that game yet, but from all I have seen and heard of it, this game is not very much like it outside of a first glance and a bit of setting and theme. It plays a lot more like something in between Sekiro and the mainline Souls games, yet it still has a unique feel and the enemy design allows them to get really creative with attack patterns. Perfect Parrying is a MASSIVE mechanic that I wish they went into more detail on during the tutorial section. Don't try to play this game without it!

The only major downside I can think of is that while the weapon variety is excellent even if you weren't able to swap out the weapon blades and handles, it also didn't feel like I needed to experiment with the arsenal much. I quickly settled on putting the highest-damaging blade on the handle with the highest Technical scaling, and then switched to my final weapon, which was a ""Special"" uncustomizable one, and it worked solidly throughout the entire game. That being said, my gear never felt under or overpowered, though the mid-point of the game felt a bit easy, especially the bosses. I fist-tried many of the rather impressive roster!

Still had fun the whole way, and a lot of it at that, and that doesn't even speak about the phenomenal story! It is definitely the best non-From-Soft Soulslike I have played... ever, and I couldn't recommend it more. Honestly?

Sekiro was so good that it ruined many other games for me, that is, until Lies of P came around. Lies of P recaptured that 'Sekiro/Bloodborne' magic that I'd been missing for so long. The combat in this game is absolutely sublime, but only if you're willing to meet it on its own terms.

Don't be surprised if you spend 1-2 hours on a boss fight. A lot of the enjoyment in this game comes from trusting the designers: It's really easy to get beaten down a few times and assume ""this boss is unfair"". Instead, I recommend that you trust the design, learn when to parry, when to dodge, and when to run away, and you'll find that every challenge in this game is actually very approachable.

Every boss is fun in its own way. Every level has tons of interconnected paths, with only a handful of checkpoints per chapter that get re-used a ton. There aren't many secrets, and outside of the many shortcuts, the levels are mostly linear. This is okay to me: The combat is the real focus of this game.

Every aspect of this game's design is yelling ""don't give up"".  You can always rally back some health if you mistime a parry. You can always recharge 1 health flask if you're out of charges, meaning you can always make a comeback. Boss attacks are consistently telegraphed so you can always learn the mechanics of a fight if you're willing to put in the time. As a result, this game is much more forgiving than you'd expect.

I don't want to hyper-fixate on the insanely high-but-satisfying difficulty though: This game is also absurdly polished. The music, the visuals, the performance, the controls, everything is executed amazingly well. Soulslikes often die by their least-polished or most-clunky aspect, so to have a non-FromSoft soulslike execute everything so well is really something special.

In the end, I think non-FromSoft soulslikes are, ironically, often held to a higher standard than their FromSoft counterparts. Think about all the nonsense you've excused in games like Elden Ring or Dark Souls 2 and ask yourself: are you willing to give Lies of P the same clemency? To that end, I think Lies of P is an excellent game that gets nitpicked to shreds by soulslike fans who've forgotten how tough a soulslike is supposed to be. After years of playing souls games, I think we've all gotten a little too comfortable. Lies of P is a great wake-up call.

Remember how hard Bloodborne and Sekiro felt when you first played them? Lies of P is tough, but if you accept that it's NOT dark souls, and learn the correct way to play, I really think this game will recapture that magical feeling you've probably been missing since you first started playing soulslikes.",1697076258,1704731063,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-
Certain game design decision when it comes to combat and the scaling system for weapons had me very confused. Not being able to fan deflect and cancel attacks into parries like Sekiro, and the game being much slower than Bloodborne, made combat feel very awkward at times. I had reached the midway point of ""King of Puppets"" at the 8 hour mark, defeated the rematch with the Rabbit Brotherhood at 13.5 hours, stuck on Laxasia from hours 15-23, then beat the final two bosses in ~2-2.5 hours, mainly being stuck on Nameless for a bit..Manus was a second try. Despite my relative fast completion of the game, I felt like I never mastered the combat mechanics by the end. Instead, I felt like my progression was gated by behind damage walls and trying to *push* beyond them. By the end, my Twin Dragon Katana was doing ~150 damage (35 technique) to Laxasia per light attack. The Acidic Crystal Spear, which I had since after the cathedral that I avoided since it had split damage, did ~400 (40 advance) damage and applied a DOT debuff that made an enemies weapon break faster. Flat numbers are king in Lies of P and it really seems scaling is secondary to initial numbers. Obviously, I re-allocated to make the S scaling Acidic Crystal Spear be functional, but much of my damage was from the high-base elemental damage. I felt as if the ""weights were off"" and after allocating my stats to Advance, I first tried Laxasia (my personal wall). So I don't know if it's a skill issue, or if it's more the fact that I never truly understood the systems of the game by the end and was unintentionally limiting my damage since around the four hour mark. 
-
I recommend this game for it's unique experience. I'm glad some competent and ambitious developers decided to take a crack at the souls formula.

Also, bosses SCALE with you so it doesn't matter if you have 10 str/dex or 40 str/dex or a +1/+10 weapon, you will always deal a set % of damage to bosses and mobs. IDK who thought of this, but it's the dumbest thing I've ever encountered in a Soulsborne. It's like the developers didn't know how to make the game difficult so they just set a slider on bosses/enemies and cranked it all the way up the 2nd half.

I wish I could refund this game but I'm past the 2 hr mark, it  takes about 10 hours to reach the puppet king and it's been all downhill from there. I went from loving the game the first 10 hours then hating it literally 2 hours after (2 bosses after puppet king).

I mean, I am nominating it for game of the year and have 60+ hours on it. BUT, and this might be a wild take or something, I disagree with everyone who says this game is on the same line that fromsoft games are and I HIGHLY, whole heartily,  disagree with people saying that it's even better than some fromsoft games. Now, I'm not saying fromsoft games are perfect but even with their problems, they're still amazing. With this game however, I noticed a lot wrong and also somethings that just aren't great about it in general. First off, gameplay. After almost 3 full playthroughs, I think that the timing for a perfect block is absolutely abysmal. I wouldn't say im anywhere near great at parrying but I wouldn't say I'm that bad at it either. I mean, sekiro was pretty much a breeze for me. I think the window of opportunity is just too short which is the main reason why I almost completely rely on dodging. Now this isn't a horrible thing because I actually do prefer the dodging/quickstep more than parrying (one of the reasons I love bloodborne) but its still a big problem. The second part is level design. People who say the level design in this game is fromsoft quality CLEARLY havent played a fromsoft game fully or really even appreciated it because the level design is also abysmal. It is SO linear. I know people say that ds3 has linear level design (which I agree with but I still love it) but this is like triple the linearity. When you're greeted with branching paths, they usually end INSANELY quickly and only give you like the lamest throwable or consumable that you probably aren't gonna use. I'm not saying that this game doesn't have its good moments. The last ""level"" of the game is BY FAR its best. It has pretty great level design and this is why I feel that people say the level design is great, because their judgement is clouded by the last level that they played. It's just nowhere near as good as fromsoft in this category and I genuinely don't understand why people say it is. The third thing isn't really a ""problem"" like the last 2 and more so just, something I don't like. The soundtrack. Now when I say the soundtrack, I mostly mean the boss themes. I love the record music this game has, I think its really creative and just overall unique, but the boss themes are the complete opposite. They are so bland and boring. It feels like they put all of their creativity into the record music and none into the actual themes that most people will listen to. Lastly, this is kinda gameplayish I guess but idc. The new game plus scaling. It's awful. Bosses last up to 4+ minutes per fight. They demolish your health instantly and they have SO MUCH health which you can really not do anything about since you cant upgrade your weapon any further than +10. Anyways, that's it. I love this game but I don't think its anywhere near the quality that fromsoft delivers. I really hope the dlc addresses some of these problems and I have really high hopes for whatever their next game is considering they've probably learned many things throughout the development of this game. 7/10 for me.

EDIT: About a month and a half later now and I can safely say that this game is like, an 8.5 to 9 out of 10. It's not like I've really played a lot of it or have forgotten the cons that this game has but man, I just really really enjoy the game. The gameplay is incredibly fun albeit sometimes irritating. The atmosphere and visual designs are great. The bosses are really fun. I can't help but feel that it's almost a ds2 situation (I havent played ds2 but still) in which it may not be the best souls/soulslike game but it is still an absolutely incredible game.",1700626251,1704636412,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of creative mechanic in this game that will definitely surprised you by how good and creative it is. There are quite a few collectibles to find in the world and the rewards for finding those are very satisfying. This is no doubt, the best souls like game out there, I dare say it can even rival the real DS or ER, or BB. Even the visual reminds me of DS, ER and BB, it's nothing cutting edge but it's very well done. The voice acting is good and the character designs look fantastic ( I mean it's a Korean game). 

The only downsides I can think of about the gameplay is that some bosses are very lackluster in the design. All of the ""big"" boss only has 2 phases. The game is relatively short if you're decent at souls like game, around 30 hours, could be a lot longer if you really suck. But the game is designed for multiple playthrough with more skills to unlock and multiple endings. But with all of that I don't think this game should worth 60 dollars, it's a very good game with a delusional price tag, with the amount of playtime and the quality this game should be at max 50 dollars. I mean Elden Ring is 40 bucks in my country, and it has 3 times the amount of content.
Definitely recommend but get it on sale or on gamepass.",1704604350,1704623186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I’m mentioning this to state the fact that I have had no love for the genre at all. 

This game, however, may have changed that. It is easily my favorite single player game of the last decade or two. I just started my second play through, and I’d say that the game lost nothing of its appeal yet. I’d say it’s even more fun than the first time around. 

There's nothing good that hasn't been said about Lies of P already. What I’d like to highlight is the fact that I could play the game “blind” (as in, not following guides on the internet) and have a fantastic time. I looked up some boss strategies after failing many times, but that's the extent of it. 

The game can be tough and frustrating at times, but the difficulty feels well-balanced over all. 

I can't wait for what these guys cook up next. It also made me want to re-visit Elden Ring, maybe when the DLC comes around.

The combat might be my favourite among the soulslikes, even though I prefer the build-variety other games such as Elden Ring offer. Haven't played Sekiro or Bloodborne yet. 

Nailing the perfect guard and figuring out when it is better to dodge or parry is immensely satisfying. Had to play all the way up to NG+2 just to be able test all the cool shit I found.

The visuals are great! Graphics, animations, atmosphere...all exceptional!

Exploration was good, but too linear for my taste. I prefer huge vertical mazes with obscure paths and secrets.

It's honestly indistinguishable from FromSofts' souls games. If you told me it was a FromSoft game, I would believe you and tell you that it's their best one yet. I think one of the most impressive things about this game is how interconnected each level is. 

There are tons of shortcuts back to the initial bonfire in each area. Often, the first or second bonfire has a shortcut to the region boss. There isn't much cross-region connection, a la Dark Souls 1, but the inter-region connection is after all the more important part. 

There are plenty of weapons to utilize and a wide range of movement sets, amplified by the ability to interchange the hilt and blade of each weapon. I.E. you can put a greatsword blade on a dagger hilt.

There is a parry system similar to Sekiro. However, if you are coming from Sekiro, it is going to feel off until you get used to it. The primary difference is that the parry window increases based on how long the block is held. Releasing the block too soon significantly reduces your parry window, a stark contrast to what is seen in Sekiro. While I do prefer the Skeiro system, this approach is entirely serviceable once you adjust to it.

Barring the true final boss, overall, the combat encounters are what I would describe as incredibly fair. Probably the most fair in the mainline souls games or otherwise. There are zero bullshit encounters, which is actually a really impressive accomplishment. 

The true final boss being a bit overtuned is the only criticism I can really come up with. Even then, it only took me 15-20 attempts and some googling about status effect weakness and general strategies for phase 2.",1704606142,1704606185,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've spent many long nights as a person who thinks that titles marketed under the ""souls-like"" genre often underwhelm me compared to the projects released by From Software themselves. Often times, the more a studio tries to copy directly from souls (and, in this case, Bloodborne and Sekiro) the less likely the game is to live up to that standard. This game breaks that cycle. I waited until this game was on sale to give it a shot because I was worried it would disappoint. I almost wish I hadn't waited. For reference, I finished my first play through after approximately 30 hours.
[b](TL;DR-> If you have any interest or experience with the souls-like genre, this game is worth the your time and consideration.)[/b]

[h3] Comparisons to From Software [/h3]
Full disclosure, Bloodborne is my favorite game. This game is not only inspired by Bloodborne (and the other From Soft titles) but it almost seeks to recreate many of the major aspects of these games. The combat is quite close to the soulsborne-kiro games, if only a little bit less quick than bloodborne. It has a sekiro-like parrying system and stagger bar. It has the item progression of Souls. It has a health regain (rally) system similar to Bloodborne. It has bosses and level design that are clearly inspired by all of the From Soft games. It even has a safe hub area that evolves and changes as the characters and story does. 

[h3] Differences from From Soft Titles [/h3]
This game is more linear than the Souls games, but it also provides a few solid improvements on the formula. For example, if you are expected to return to a previous area to develop an NPC questline then you will see a little icon on your map leading you to which stargazer (bonfire, lantern, site of grace) with a picture of the NPC waiting to speak with you. There is a lovely hub location music mechanic where you find records in the world and come back and can play them in the hub area (and doing so has some minor story implications). This game allows you to customize the scaling and move-set of your weapon to a fantastic degree by allowing you to swap the blade of some weapons to other handles. This is the case for all weapons aside from the special weapons (primarily boss soul weapons). There is no summoning or invasion system in this game, but you can enlist the help of AI specters to fight with you for some of the main story bosses. There are no chalice dungeons (some of us liked them).

[h3] Verdict [/h3]
If you are a fan of souls-like games, this one is a contender for the best non-From Soft title ever;
- Buy it.

If you are a fan of only the From Soft titles, this game may be the first to come close to that feeling;  
- Give it a shot.

If you are interested in the souls-like genre but haven't tried them out, this is a more linear game that can act as a good introduction to the genre;
- Wish list it and try it when it goes on sale.

[h3] Final Thoughts [/h3]
Lies of P is a relatively solid substitute for 60FPS Bloodborne on PC for now :/

[h1] Combat [/h1] 

The combat in this game is immaculate. The developers clearly understood the foundations of a souls-like game and were able to implement this with their own spin on it. There are a lot of tools the game presents to you in order to find a fun build to engage the game with. The incredible diverse weapon assembly system, the addition of various legion arms that supplement your build with a cool ability, the adequately named ""P-Organ"" system that gives you upgrades. 

But what use would all these cool additions be if the core gameplay was no good?

Thankfully, the creators of Lies of P really do understand what makes combat feel fun in this genre. Combat-wise, you have two main responses to enemy attacks, either blocking and parrying or dodging away and iframing with the more advanced applications of the two responses being the latter options. In terms of execution versus reward, all the options are viable and depending on the situation, you will have to weigh which one to go for. The game presents these build options to you in order to encourage you to engage with their core combat systems in a fun way. You are not limited to one type of response and are able to freely mix and use both types of responses through combat. You can also use one type of response exclusively if that is how you wish to play. Having multiple viable responses to enemy attacks allows for a more enjoyable experience in learning enemy and boss movesets. It does not matter if you pick the easier responses of blocking and dodging or the harder, but more rewarding responses of parrying and iframing, it is this freedom of experimentation of how to approach fights in this game that allows for the player to easily reach a flow state and enjoy the combat no matter what approach they use. 

Some other additions to the combat that help elevate the game include; 
1. Weapon durability for both you and the enemy, you will need to repair your weapon periodically so it does not break, conversely parrying the enemies weapon consistently can break their weapon, lowering their damage and range for whole fight. This adds one more small factor to keep track of in boss fights.
2. When you have no healing charges left, you will slowly recharge 1 healing charge by hitting the enemy. This keeps you flipping between the safety of 1 more heal versus needing to be aggressive to regain the heal back once you use it.
3. An enemy's health bar will glow white upon accumulating enough stagger damage through parrying or hitting the enemy. While the health bar is glowing, enemies will be staggered upon taking a heavy hit (charged heavy attack, a throwable, fable art attack, or a legion arm attack). This encourages you to make a risky attack in hopes of staggering the enemy and turning the fight or just getting hit and dying. 

In terms of accessibility, the game does lock you into melee builds for the most part and the game expects you to engage with its core combat mechanics of dodging and/or parrying. There are some additional methods that could make the game easier such as some pure ranged options available in the legion arm add-on and throwables(which are surprisingly strong in this game). There is also a standard AI summon you can use for the main bosses that takes the boss aggro from the player. However it comes attached to a clunky system in which you need to wait for in game resources to replenish the summoning material and buffs/pots for the summon.

[h1] Enemies [/h1] 

The bosses in this game are all quite unique and well designed outside of maybe 1-2 misses. Each boss is a unique, eventful encounter that concludes an area and comes with a unique moveset and tons of variety (there is a boss you can beat by only parrying, how cool is that?). Bosses are all quite aggressive but fair in that a lot of the moveset is very readable and reactable even on your first fight. There are many amazing fights in this game, and I was expecting a drop in quality at some point, but thankfully until the end, the quality of the boss fights never dipped or felt unfair. 
The enemy variety in this game is quite solid, usually you would see a solid amount of reuse of both general enemies and bosses in these types of games, however, I found that outside of a couple instances, the game generally was still able to keep introducing at least 1-2 new enemy types for each new area all the way until the last area of the game. This kept the areas feeling unique and instead focuses on giving the player more of these gameplay moments as they run into new enemies or minibosses throughout the game. 

[h1] Level design [/h1] 

Lies of P is quite a linear game, there is usually only 1 optional side path in an area so for the most part the game follows the same structure of new area into boss, then next area into next boss. Each area does have some exploration to do for finding loot and mini bosses but even then, its quite contained and linear. The levels themselves are designed simply as a big circle with a shortcut back to the save point. Depending on how you play these games this might not even be a negative as the linearity means that you would not need to look up guides or be too scared of missing anything important within an area as you can easily explore the whole area. There seems to be only one optional side area in the game and even that is on the shorter side.  While the level design was predictable at times, I was still able to enjoy the games atmosphere and environments in each new area. 

[h1] Story [/h1] 

Narrative-wise, I was quite surprised at how enjoyable the Pinocchio theme was. The game nudges you in the direction of lying to present its main themes of humanity vs being a puppet and it culminates in quite a solid ending which is uncommon among games in this genre. 
The game has a clear narrative structure and explains its story really well. The game still has some hidden lore that you can discover but this is just to supplement the story it already tells so you wont have to go digging into lore as the game just shows you all the important bits. The various NPCs in the game all have their own charm and you are given enough interactions with them so that when their part in the narrative comes to a close, you could actually care about them since the game gives you enough to chew on. 

[h1] Soundtrack [/h1] 

The soundtrack is quite solid for the most part but I felt as though the general OSTs were forgettable for the most part. The songs that really stood out to me were the songs that you could collect in game as vinyl records which the game does encourage you to play while you are running around the main hub upgrading and experimenting with your character.

[h1] Final thoughts [/h1] 

In a fantastic year of gaming, Lies of P might have flown under the radar for some, but it is one of the best in the genre and has shown itself to be an amazing inspiration rather than a pale impersonation of the original souls-like games.

Unlike the soulsborne games where bosses have movesets you need to memorize, Lies of P bosses will randomly string attacks together making it  impossible to properly dodge/block their attacks. Enemy Charge attacks have a tendency to be slow windup and impossible to react to when they go off (worse than Margit, The Fell Omen in Elden Ring). This happens a lot more often when you get in to the later stages in the game. Enemy placement in this game is very similar to Dark Souls 2 where they will try to surprise attack you every 3 seconds which gets annoying after awhile.",1704557863,1704557863,False,1,1,0.482758611440658569,0,True,False,False

It was my first Soulslike experience, and was an absolute blast to play from start to finish. A few design quirks with its morality system led to a few headaches when attempting to earn all achievements, but that's the only negative thing I can say about this game.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
If you've played a game in the Soulslike genre, you'll be very familiar with this game. If you haven't, allow me to break it down very simply.

Everybody wants to kill you, you have very little health and take a lot of damage, and your options are to dodge, guard or hope your attack lands first with enough force to get you out of harm's way for the moment. If you do get hurt, you can heal, but you only have a finite number of heal charges between checkpoints. You'll need to use these sparingly and hope you avoid taking too many hits.

The game itself plays in third-person, and the progression is very linear, tasking you with progressing from one map to the next in a very straightforward fashion. Each map will have a minimum of one mini boss and one major boss, with a sprinkling of lower-tier enemies throughout.

As you slay enemies, you earn Ergo, which can be used to purchase new items like equipment, consumables and others, or to level up your stats. You can level up your HP, Stamina, Weight Capacity (heavier gear will weigh you down and slow your moments without this), Heavy Attacks, Light Attacks and Elemental Damage. You can choose to build your character based on your playstyle. If you wish to experiment, there is a respeccing system in the game as well.

Lastly, the P-Organ is a passive skill tree that you upgrade with Quartz, a currency you acquire from quests and mini bosses/bosses as you play. You can increase your damage, resistances, improve the effectiveness of abilities, etc.

The game primarily plays out of the hub area, Hotel Krat, where you'll fit your character before pushing on.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
The story of Lies of P is best left discovered as you play, but the basic principle is that you play as Pinocchio and are awoken to help save the world from the madness known as Puppet Frenzy, which is driving all of the puppets in the world mad. The narrative is far more nuanced, but is worth experiencing with no spoilers.

[h1][b]Performance[/b][/h1]
The game runs like a dream. On my RTX 3090, I'm able to play at a locked 120 FPS with everyone running on Ultra at a native 2560x1440. While my machine is very high-end in nature, the game scales phenomenally across all hardware implementations, seeing Ultra settings running smoothly on even older generation GPUs. Zero shader compilation or traversal stutter, not one single crash in 80 hours, and the game is a visual spectacle.

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]
[i][b]Lies of P[/b][/i] is my GOTY for 2023. It's an incredible experience from start to finish, and I never felt bored or uninterested as I went through it... four times. The New Game+ system motivates you to go through again to push your passive bonuses a little further and to experiment with new builds, and the linear nature of the game complements quick runs. Where your first may take you 30+ hours, subsequent runs can be done in 6-8 and feel completely new due to the vast array of builds available.

my main critique is the linearity of the levels. I'm spoiled by dark souls 1 and 2, where you have some options in which areas to explore first. This game takes it's design que from DS3, where your order of exploration is more or less set in stone, which makes it feel like progressing through a hallway. This isn't a very serious complaint, as the game is still fun regardless. Just figure I'd mention it because people who like souls-likes tend to compare them to DS. 

The environments in this game are all very beautiful and distinct. The enemy design is varied, which is something indie/lower budget souls likes tend to mess up, so points for this! I'm also surprisingly liking the story. I thought grimdark Pinnocio would be something I'd roll my eyes to and generally hate, but it's serviceable. Has a few dumb anime style moments, but overall I like it. 

Enemy designs for some of the puppets are really creepy. I keep wondering how these were marketed, before the frenzy. Who would buy a zombie puppet baby with a face straight out of the binding of isaac? What's with the eight legged spider Marie Antoinettes? Who is buying these things?

[b] Variety and Flexibility [/b]: Lies of P offers something that we saw a little bit of beginning in Elden Ring, and I'd really like to see developers expand on with future souls like games: weapon and tool combinations. Lies of P has a robust weapon combination system that drastically changes the way your skills affect your weapons. If this weren't enough, you can also imbue them with specific abilities, and you can then further customize those with grindstones. They took it even one step further by letting you do the same thing with your gauntlet, which is a bit like the sekiro tools with more flexibility in their use. 

[b] The Music [/b]: The music sort of lurks in the background, and it is definitely Sakuraba quality, if not better due to a classical element that lurks within it. The music hangs out in the background, almost as a pleasant white noise until the moment when it needs to crescendo, and oh boy does it do that well. I think the addition of the record player system also adds a unique element- restoring ""humanity"" is done through a mechanic focused on specifically music.

[b] Combat [/b]: The combat is smooth and intuitive. While not as complex or quick as games like Sekiro, the combat definitely feels fun and enjoyable. The weight of weapons feels immaculate overall, until you run up against the big bad bosses who just sort of shrug it off because well- an ant won't make a bird stagger often. The weapon skills are all definitely unique and combo really well with the basic attack combos.

[b] Lore [/b]: I thought I had an idea of what I was getting into: Pinocchio, robots overrunning the city, chasing after a wish or something. Let me tell you, the name of the game only scratches the surface. The story is so much deeper and so much more well told than I anticipated. I do feel that the level of lore is somewhat shallow, but overall the storytelling and the quality of existing lore is definitely a solid 9/10.

[b] Complaints [/b]: I think if I had to have one complaint about this game is it feels a bit rushed/short. The zones immerse you just in time for the boss room and the end of the zone. I think that with a bit more content, this game would definitely feel as expansive as a True Dark Souls game.",1704389127,1704389127,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Masterpiece!
That's i would say one of the best souls-like on the market. And for me personaly - game of 2023. Amazing story, phenomenal optimization (v1.4), weapons, items, interface, mechanics - all top quality.

Thank you NEOWIZ for that experience!

In my opinion, they're always lacking something, which is to be expected, they are derivative, after all. 

Warning: below I will be delving slightly into vague spoilers, regarding the overall premise.

But with Lies of P, I was skeptical, albeit interested. A game taking its main point of focus from the story of Pinocchio, yet wearing the guise of a gearpunk coat of paint, which then leads into a subversive lovecraftian angle, and is then eloquently juggled and eventually meshed together in what I can only call genius.

As for the gameplay part of the game, the controls feel tight and responsive. Now, while it isn't as fast as Bloodborne, Dark souls 3, Elden Ring, or Sekiro, it does have the rally mechanic of Bloodborne, and the parry mechanics of Sekiro. And while it unfortunately it lacks the trick weapons of Bloodborne that we desperately wanted, it has it's own unique compromise, in it's handle/blade system, which allows you to deconstruct the blade and handle of any weapon, and then combine it with another weapon to make a new weapon,  which allows for insane customization and freedom regarding combat. and I always was excited to see what I can make. The bosses are all rather well designed, with only a few leaving me with a neutral response, so the main opinions I had were from great to amazing. And as for their difficulty, they're all fair, but rewarding.

There's only a few complaints I have regarding the game, and that includes the lack of more options for advance (your magic stat), the admittedly small arsenal of legion arms and their lackluster upgrades, and the sort of samey clothing options in the game. 

Other than that, the game is a fantastic play. It controls like a dream, looks fantastic, has amazing art and sound direction, and it just superbly fun. I highly recommend it, if you like soulslikes and will personally be excitedly waiting for more in the already confirmed sequel and dlc.",1704368660,1704368660,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It borrows mechanics from the aforementioned games but never innovates in any meaningful way to set it apart from them—worse, it often reverses QoL changes made in recent FromSoft titles.

This would've been “Mixed” had Steam allowed for the option. The moment I decided on Negative was when I realised that I wasn't having fun—I was playing more out of obligation to satiate the stubborn, masochistic Souls elitist within me.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Presentation & Story[/h1]
The worldbuilding is fantastic, and classic Souls lore items are everywhere. The music is phenomenal too.

However, the lying theme doesn’t go further than being a lame gimmick, and there’s a weird understanding of what it means to be human (i.e. you need to be a lying, [spoiler]murderous, riddle-solving music lover[/spoiler] to be a real boy, even in instances where lying is clearly the less “human” choice). The plot contradicts itself, and the game sequel baits with numerous loose ends.

[h1]Engrish[/h1]
Either ESL or KSL (or both) writing results in weird, uncanny valley dialogue. This is exacerbated by how the NPC permanently attached to you has a horrible voice actor who sounds like an influencer promoting crappy mobile games.

Tooltips are super unclear, which makes buildcrafting a headache. Guess what this upgrade does: “Enables dodging when on the ground” (Answer: [spoiler]Lets you press the dodge button when knocked flat on the ground to get up quicker[/spoiler]).

If your game has a western aesthetic and exclusively English voice acting, maybe put a bit of effort into making sure the English isn’t ass, yeah? [b]YOU DEFEATED[/b] is funny and iconic; [b]LIE OR DIE[/b] is just cringe.

[h1]Mechanics & Exploration[/h1]
Quests are straightforward (i.e. When there are quests or special items at a location, they will appear on the fast travel menu). This is one of the few good innovations, since I prefer to play the game instead of Googling where the fuck Blaidd went.

[u][b]Level design is superb:[/b][/u]
- No illusory walls (Thank God)
- Loads of ambushes and deadly traps
- Great tense feeling of clearing the way to the next Bonfire/shortcut

The reason I'd rather rate this as Mixed instead of Negative is because of how well the maps are designed. The people responsible for the maps did an excellent job at shortcut construction, baiting with shiny chests, various ambushes, cannons shooting at you from afar, groups of monsters charging at you, and so on.

These situations test your ability to deal with a wide variety of scenarios and adequately punish you for not paying attention.

[u][b]Recent quality of life improvements the devs stripped away for some reason:[/b][/u]
- Forced to return to the hub to level up (Can do so from the Bonfire in NG+)
- Respecs and Physick Flask equivalent require waiting for a stupid plant to grow and then harvesting said plant every hour or so
- You have to constantly fight the camera trying to auto-center to the direction you’re going in
- Dodge on button release instead of press; dodge buffering is hilariously long
- Annoying runbacks to the boss
- Stamina depletes even when out of combat
- The player character is worse at jumping than a paralysed 70 year old

[u][b]Gimped-or-overpowered upgrade system:[/b][/u]
In Sekiro, upgrades enhance and build upon the base mechanics, rewarding aggression and good play (e.g. Mikiri & Descending Carp). In Lies of P, you’re either lacking basic mechanics in NG or ignoring core mechanics in NG+. There is no in-between.

First, there are many upgrades that should’ve been part of the base kit, such as being able to press dodge to get up after being knocked down. This leads to portions of your first playthrough feeling gimped. (There are also QoL “upgrades” like consuming less Stamina when running, which is necessary if you dislike annoying runbacks.)

Next, later upgrades let you ignore game mechanics—especially the few new ones not plagiarised from Miyazaki. Dangerous red attacks you need to either Perfect Guard or outrange? Well, with an upgrade, you could just hold down block normally. The boss being able to regenerate a portion of their HP if you don’t attack them constantly, encouraging aggressive play? Completely removed with a few upgrades.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
If I call a Soulslike a FromSoft ripoff because the player loses currency on death and there are Bonfires, that’s not really fair. However, when a game so blatantly copies the smallest details of Dark Souls—all the way down to poison swamps, Boss Souls, Resin, Gestures, no pausing, the level-up process and stats, and even the fucking menu layout—it opens the door to comparison, since they’re riding on DS nostalgia.

I finally started DS1 after Lies of P, and the mechanic where your weapon DINGs off walls feels so much more natural in the 2011 game. For some weapons (e.g. Holy Sword of the Ark), this mechanic will drive you insane; for others, it's practically non-existent.

[u][b]New mechanics are uninteresting:[/b][/u]
- Fury Attacks, attacks you need to either Perfect Guard or outrange, are mediocre and a worse version of Sekiro’s Perilous Attacks.
- Staggering Enemies for a Fatal Attack is an imitation of Elden Ring's Poise but with an extra step that barely matters if you possess a modicum of patience.
- Breaking Enemy Weapons so they do less damage and have shorter reach is satisfying but ultimately useless. It rewards players who've Perfect Guarded a lot with something that doesn’t matter to (or actually hurts) players who’ve Perfect Guarded a lot (since the shorter reach makes attacks harder to read).
- Repairing your Weapon in the middle of a fight is bothersome because you’re never chased down hard enough to be punished—this is a worse version of finding openings to drink your Estus.

[u][b]Fighting your eyes and instincts and having to memorise attacks:[/b][/u]
One of the greatest things about Sekiro is how rhythmic it feels—it becomes a game of instincts once you’ve mastered the mechanics. And even the most comical of delayed attacks in Elden Ring make some sense.

In contrast, Lies of P necessitates [u][b]Memorising Timings[/b][/u] because of how poor visual clarity, tells, and hitboxes for many attacks are. Also, sound cues are bad—if not completely absent. (This wouldn’t be as bad in a dodge-focused game, but there’s a reason even the most cancerous Sekiro boss fights have good tells.)

- The timing window for Perfect Guarding some attacks is way before the attack hits; it’s way after for others. You have to memorise which is which.
- Some attacks seem natural and can be reacted to by instinct—others are just the boss raising their arm one moment then teleporting the arm to your face the next. You have to memorise which is which (and timings for the latter).
- Some bosses can manipulate gravity and somehow delay a full-body elbow drop by levitating in the air.
- Bosses can raise their weapons or even jump off screen at such an angle that it’s impossible to see what’s going on.
- The game prioritises flashy animations over the player understanding what the boss is doing. There is a 10-hit combo from a boss that visually appears like a 14-hit combo, baiting players to try to Perfect Guard the fake hits.

Overall, the worst part of boss fights is how awful the risk-reward ratio for Perfect Guarding is. It is often better to dodge or outrange attacks, which turns the entire game into a boring cakewalk.

[h1]Final Words[/h1]
If your favourite Sekiro boss is Blazing Bull—and if you think the Runebear and Giant Crayfish (i.e. lobster bro) in Elden Ring are great fun—then you'll probably like this game. If you just had a negative visceral reaction to the things I listed, stay far away (or at least wait for a sale and go in with tempered expectations).",1696614871,1704364616,False,116,14,0.511215627193450928,57,True,False,False

1627720,155185768,76561198145719056,0,2,41,0,41,1703736139,"Steam Deck performance was great. I played with a locked 40 fps with FSR2 Quality at 12 watts. The game can also run at 60 fps with some dips to 50 fps. At the time of writing, Lies of P is classified as Playable, but I think it should be Verified. I saw no bugs/glitches, but the text size in the menus are kinda small. 

No spoilers here, great game. Completed it twice and it was just as fun the second time as I continued to experiment with weapon combinations. One playthrough takes about 20-25 hours, but probably varies quite a bit from person-to-person.

Round8 did not try to hide the FromSoftware inspiration and down right mimicry in some aspects. What they copied was executed very well and did not feel like a budget version at all. If someone told me the developers at Round8 had ties with FromSoftware, it would sound believable. Despite taking several gameplay mechanics from multiple different FromSoftware titles, it was still able to create its own unique identity. 

[h3]What I liked:[/h3]
The combat feels great. Every player character animation has a slight pause afterwards and input buffering is included. This may feel clunky to some, but I enjoy the harder commitment to an action and the required deliberateness of each button press. While the game heavily encourages the player to perfect guard, the use of guarding, dodging, and spacing from attacks provides a great mix of viable options in fights. The perfect guard sounds great as well. Being able to break weapons from multiple successful perfect guards was super cool, and a fun way to reward to player for nailing the timing. I also think it justifies implementing the player character's weapon durability mechanic. While it may feel tedious at times to repair your weapon, it's only fair that if boss weapons can break, then so should yours. 

I will not say too much about the boss fights to avoid spoilers, but I just thought they were unique and were simply great! 

Weapon customization was one of the best mechanics implemented in the game. It made finding new weapons much more exciting since you get to try out new blade and handle combinations. In souls games, finding new weapons can sometimes be disappointing because of stat requirements or because it scales better with a different build. This issue does not occur in Lies of P because due to weapon assembly and handle modifications, making exploration feel more rewarding.

I liked the character progression system through the P-Organ. While the abilities you get are not super unique, was a nice addition to make P stronger outside of just leveling up. The progression system through the leveling system was not very interesting and I don't feel like there is much distinction between choosing between motivity, technique, or advance since you can alter the scaling on handles anyways. 

[h3]What I disliked:[/h3]
I think the weakest part of the game is the level design. I wish there were more hidden areas or branching paths to make exploration more fun. Overall, I still found the level design to be just ok.

The gold coin mechanic felt out of place. Overall, the way this was implemented was strange, but I didn't find it problematic as this whole mechanic can be ignored. The rewards for trading gold coins also seemed underwhelming since most of them are specter buffs. Similar to FromSoftware titles, the summons used in boss fights completely trivializes them, but I'm still glad it was implemented for those who would still like to experience the full game, but struggle with bosses.

I found the the most of the dialogue options to be uninteresting, but giving the player the option to lie is cool.
I did not find the Legion arm to be interesting and often found myself forgetting about it. 
I wish Geppetto would stop calling P a good boy.

9/10. Extremely excited to see more from this studio in the future. And no, this is not [FromSoftware Title] from home!

So far I'm getting strong DS1, Sekiro, and Bloodborne themes which I LOVE, and an added new style of world with interesting enemies and challenging fights. The character weapon customization and combat styles are very fun and well done.

This game is living up to my expectations and scratching the FromSoft itch I've been having lately.

First, holding block is far more rewarding because of Guard Regain, which lets you regain chip damage by attacking or parrying. Second is that heals are generous and virtually infinite, you can always attack to regain a spare heal if you run out. Essentially the game rewards defensive gameplay only if you are willing to follow it up with aggression and risk, which feels like a fair compromise.

Lies of P feels like a soulslike that prefers to offer you the satisfaction of beating a boss rather than keep you there until you've memorized every attack pattern, opening, and parry timing, it's okay with letting you scrape by. It's not an easy game by any standards, but if you're properly upgrading yourself and your weapons, and understand the mechanics, you will beat some bosses on the first try.

If you're coming from FromSoft games, the worldbuilding in Lies of P might feel offputting. FromSoft is especially good at establishing a consistent tone, something you take for granted once you realize Lies of P doesn't execute as well. Voice acting can feel strange, some accents feel out of place, and dialogue feels too casual at times. But in other areas, like music and artstyle, the worldbuilding is fantastically done and is genuinely beautiful.

Level design in Lies of P is simple but effective. It is more linear than I expected, and the spaces seem larger than they actually are. You'll find areas of the map that are sectioned off and are only there for window dressing, and it can feel frustrating to realize how small the playable area of a level is. There is often one main path, and one side path, and it's not always clear which is which. But it's effective in that a level will always entice you to explore all of it, typically with items that are just out of reach, or blocked gates that invite you to find the other side and unlock shortcuts.

There is a lot of content in this game, probably more than you're expecting if you've played for just a few hours. Enemy variety is a standout here, the game gradually invents new enemies that make exploration more interesting and tense. There are a respectable amount of weapons in this game of every variety, you're likely to find a weapon with a moveset that you really click with and a playstyle you enjoy. I didn't rely too hard on the Legion Arms, but their designs are pretty inspired, they look great, feel good to use, and I could see myself using them more on a second run with a different build. It's honestly overwhelming at first how many game mechanics there are, but it's never necessary to engage with every single one. If you want to fly around with Puppet String and spec into Fable Arts, you can do that. If you want a parry and riposte simulator, you can choose that, it never felt the game punished me for choosing to neglect those mechanics, you control the buttons you press.

Ultimately it feels wrong to compare this to Sekiro or Elden Ring or any Souls game because I think you could easily find things it does a bit worse than its predecessors. What it does achieve is being a fantastic game in its own right, and is probably the greatest game like it made by a different studio.

Most if not all bosses felt fair and fun to overcome, in exception for some of these elite enemies. It is really tiresome that so many bosses have two phases in which you must go through two health bars, sometimes the second phase having more HP than the first one.

Id say if fromsoft is chill with it you should be too. If you like any of fromsoft souls games you will certainly enjoy this one. It’s Story, secrets, and side characters are not all directly “one for one” taken from pinoccio but some references and themes definitely show up during the game. 

-Music
Why this game didn’t win best soundtrack is crazy to me. Seo J, Did such amazing vocals for songs like feel, and Quixotic. Maybe I’m just a sucker for jazzy classical themes. But it’s the best music I’ve listed to in a while. And love the record player in game that promotes their own music not in a selfish way but more along the lines of giving credit to musicians and artists that may not always get the publicity they deserve when being featured in games. I honestly wish more games did that. Even going as far as to fit its music into the game as a mechanic is a nice touch.

-Combat
Sekiro stagger and perfect block made its way into the game, If this games combat felt a little less clunky between attacks and recovery times after actions kinda. I don’t think you could tell that this game wasn’t made by Miyazaki. Very solid

-Mechanics (Potential spoiler warning)
 I like the new mechanics such as weapon assembly I fiddled with it a bit early game but once I got boss weapons I never touched it again other than to make cursed weapons like a fire axe head on a rapier handle. I’ll be lookin to YouTube for wacky weapon mods, and terrible weapon combo runs. grind wheel I liked only in open world, because having to sharpen in the middle of a boss battle was just kinda annoying to me but items in the game help this issue. The cube was interesting I’ll probably use it more on my NG+. but first time around I only used it once and couldn’t cancel the action of casting it so I died insta and never pulled it out again. The P organ I was nervous at first because I’m not typically a fan of skill trees in games like these because there’s always something on them that trivializes the game, but I didn’t actually mind it, there were useful tools to min/max but didn’t break the game. I still got canned by final boss plenty of times even with a pretty full p organ.

I love the art direction, the characters, the story, the enemy designs, etc, the weapon customization and legion mechanics are also great.  I know alot of people are complaining about the perfect guard mechanic but you’re not supposed to parry every move, you can mix a few dodges too.

•I do have some minor complaints, sometimes the camera hides the health bar of minibosses when they glow white, we should have another visual indicator for that.
•The perfect guard shouldn’t push you because there’s a part where there’s an enemy that throws projectiles at you when you’re on a ledge and you can only perfect guard the attacks not dodge. The slight push makes it very easy to fall down.
• Slow weapons are almost completely useless
•Also, please add a pause button because it makes absolutely no sense, there is no multiplayer here but even Elden Ring got a pause button.

Theme is awesome though and it has some unique ideas like the weapon system, which allows you to mix and match handles (move set and scaling) with blades (damage type, speed and range).

If you love Dark Souls and/or Elden Ring, you need this game yesterday. The developer's clearly loved and studied the Souls series to create a game that could easily stand alongside the best of FromSoft's games. The big differences I noticed were the following:

- Builds are limited to melee via DEX builds, STR builds and Quality builds. There is no option to make a ranged or magic build nor is there any build that I would call a ""cheese"" build. Although it is compensated for via items that can be thrown, buffs via consumables and weapon upgrades, you are going to have to learn to ""get good"" via guards, parries, and dodging.

- You actually know what's going on in the story. There's lots of world-building via item descriptions, collectible letters/diaries/posters, conversations, and visual storytelling, but you aren't going to be left confused on what is going on with the narrative. It leaves stuff open for interpretation but you aren't going to YouTube for an explanation on what just happened.

- Out of all the bosses there are only three, maybe four, that I have any real complaints about. Some bosses that come out towards the end of the game don't know when to chill out with their animations and have small timing windows for you to attack, making them last longer than they probably should. I not expecting to button mash but I barely have time to get ONE hit in before they start another combo that uses up all my stamina blocking/dodging. Still, I wouldn't call them unfair. Difficult, even if you manage your stats correctly, but not impossible.

Long and short of it is, the few complaints I can think of are just nitpicks to a game that captured my attention enough for me to go for 100%. You have to be something truly special to make me want to do that, especially if doing so requires multiple playthroughs. Strongly recommend the base game at full price.",1704243852,1704243852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the story and atmosphere to the gameplay, I was hooked until I beat the game and already started my first NG+. A truly polished game with little to no performance issues made by a smaller developer. Quite the fantastic treat given the current state of AAA games. 

Below, I will summarize the game and my thoughts.

[b] SPOILER WARNING

In Lies of P, we play as P, a puppet thrown into the City of Krat. This city is sprawling with other puppets, except something is tragically wrong. Within the streets lies countless dead human corpses and the city is on fire. All we can find are other puppets mindlessly killing civilians, and I couldn't help but think, what is going on?

We eventually come to a hotel, which houses individuals seeking refuge and shelter from the puppets wrath. The main person of interest to us is Sophie, who originally called us from our starting point to meet her at the hotel. We find out the the City of Krat houses a rare mineral called Ergo. This mineral was then used by puppet-maker Geppetto to further his creations. This lead to puppets being made to work jobs around the city. This on paper solved a lot of things for the cities population, however, the puppets rebelled, which caused an even known to us as the Puppet Frenzy. After we learn this, we come face to face with our maker, Geppetto, after saving him from a Stalker who is trying to harm him. Stalkers are humans who go out and kill as many puppets as they can. Many if not all of them are hellbent on killing Geppetto, as he is the creator of all the puppets, who are now killing innocent people.  

This game follows a mostly linear path after we arrive at the Hotel and save Geppetto. We are tasked with doing multiple different things, but our main goal is to eliminate the puppets terrorizing the city and save as many people as we can. We encounter many bosses and characters along the way, but the main standout is the antagonist, Simon Manus.

Simon Manus is the leader of the alchemists, a faction of individuals who experimented with Ergo. We are told from Manus that Ergo is a pure crystallized form of human souls, which in part, is why it works so effectively with puppets. With all the experiments conducted, the Alchemists created a mutation/disease - which would be later called the Petrification Disease. This disease mutates the host, starting with blue growths on the body and face, until it fully takes over and turns the host into a monstrosity. From this point, we hunt down Manus and find him at the Isle of Alchemists. We kill him, and in theory conclude the game, but, there is one more choice that must be made.

Throughout this game we are given dialogue options to choose from. One answer is us telling the truth about any given situation. The other is us lying. While on the surface, this may seem like something useless, in this world, puppets can not lie. They have been programmed from Geppetto to always tell the truth. So what gives? Why can we as P lie, but other puppets cannot? This brings us to the true finale of the game.

We find Geppetto underneath where we fought Manus, and he asks us a question. He wants us to give him our heart, so that he can turn us into a ""real boy"". The only trick is that Geppetto wants to use our heart and insert it into a puppet named Carlo. We are thought to believe all throughout this game that we are Geppetto's true son, when in reality, he built us and used us to strengthen the P organ (our heart) so that he could give it to Carlo, his actual son. This decision leads to the different endings in the game. We either give our heart and die (bad ending) or refuse and fight the nameless puppet. No matter what ending you choose, an end game cut-scene will play, hinting at a DLC / 2nd game. 

I highly recommend checking out the video done by Gingy on YouTube. 
He is by far my favorite video game channel and does amazing story breakdowns/retrospectives.

This game has it all for me. A fantastic story, choices that change how the game unfolds, amazing weapon design and combat system, and enemies that pose a real challenge. I have seen many people say it plays too much like a FromSoft game, and is almost a ""rip-off"". I disagree. Are there elements that are similar/the same, yes. Does this take away from the unique and stylized game that is Lies of P, no.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys souls-like or FromSoft games.",1704243779,1704243779,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This might be an opinion not many share, but I enjoyed this game more than Elden Ring, but that is probably because I prefer the parry mechanic to the classic dodge roll (which is why I liked Sekiro more than the Souls games that I played). Make no mistake though, as dodging is still required in many places, you will not be relying solely on parrying (or Perfert Guarding, as it is called in this game).

The story is quite enjoyable, but also way less obscure than the way narrative is presented in FromSoft games. Some people may not like this, but I do prefer this style of storytelling.

There are many more aspects of the game that are worth detailing (such as the customization options in weapons, the legion arm, P-Organs, how well the game is optimized etc), but I will stop my review here.

If you like soulslikes, and are not afraid of a (quite difficult) challenge, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.",1704226188,1704226188,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it does have a focus on blocking, don't let that fool you, you will still dodge most things that you cannot reasonably parry. You will still need to dodge on parry timing anyways; your dodge timing is tight like Dark Souls parry timing, but your parry or ""Perfect Guard"" timing is even tighter. Take a page from Capn Jack Sparrow; sometimes the best strategy is to run away to fight back (literally, dodge an attack or tap the dodge to backstep, then run away, and run back in to punish works for a LOT of bosses).

The game takes some time to adjust due to its own mechanics being slightly different (no generous roll windows, no poise, skim amounts of hyperarmor on heavy weapons), but it gets much smoother as you play more. I definitely recommend having a quick weapon and a slooooow weapon on hand, some enemies can be spammed to death and others you can abuse the small amount of hyperarmor at the end of meaty charged heavies to chunk their health.

Anyways the game is like others have said: it's hard but fair, and once you figure out the unique mechanics you'll really love smashing puppets",1704225535,1704225535,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Ngl, the beginning of the game, I hated it, all of the enemy attacks felt super janky, and the parry very inconsistent, coming from someone who has hundreds of hrs in sekiro, and platinumed every fromsoft game, and countless other souls likes, I wanted to scratch that itch, specifically that parry itch. In the beginning, all of the enemies would wind up like 7 times super slow then suddenly attack, which I didnt like. Felt like when enemies would attack (specifically puppets) they would attack in 15fps. Also, didnt find the game challenging at all, the first 10 hrs or so I had only died a couple of times to being overwhelmed by trash mobs, or a status effect debuff, none of the bosses gave me any challenge and would kill them all first try, maybe healing once, which was definitely disappointing. I kept playing solely because I just spent 50 dollars, and wanted to see why this game was getting so much praise. After about halfway through, I genuinely started to like the game, and the bosses and enemies actually took some effort to kill, and the weird attacks began to make a little more sense. The parry started to click, and now starting my 2nd playthrough, I genuinely like and recommend this game, at first it might seem a little janky and very easy, but trust me, just see it through, anybody who loves soulslikes will surely like this game, especially the 2nd half and beyond. I recommend trying out a bunch of different weapon and handle combinations, as this game will flood you with upgrade mats, and at the end, can purchase all mats for up to +9 for regular weapons, dont be stingy, try new weapons...to think I almost abandoned this game due to its differences from other souls games Im ""used to""...

It isn't an incomprehensibly obtuse world I can barely relate to. It isn't wildly different character classes and build customization. It's just a classic game that tells a great story, has great combat, and hits all the notes along the way. 

For me, the best thing about LoP is the combat. It just feels enough faster and snappier than my vague memory of DS3/Elden Ring without the developer going out of their way to try and kill me every 50 steps. The level design is straightforward but never feels linear. The more you play the more you appreciate the weapon system (which is a little hard to grasp at first). Lot of ways to make things easier like spamming throwables or using spectres on boss fights, but the challenge is there for those who want it by only using their weapon and their wites.

Although the ""levels"" are generally much easier than FromSoft's titles, the bosses are still troublesome (especially in the last few chapters) because it's hard to take a breather. You can't iFrame dodge as much as DarkSouls or block like Sekiro your way out of a flurry off attacks and perfect parries are almost over emphasized in LoP (and unforgiving when you inevitably miss A LOT).

I have never completed a souls like game before so this was quite an accomplishment, even if i got stuck on a boss, I had the ability to get creative and think outside the box to complete the task at hand. The design of every little detail is immaculate. Truly a 10/10!

The progression:
Every time you upgrade your character, the upgrades actually make a difference. The different builds and weapons really complement the upgrades to wear you can iron out and perfect a build. 

The flow: 
The pacing of the game was great, you never felt too under powered when facing your next challenge. Just make sure to explore a bit and grab good loot, because even if you die you keep all your items except for ergo (currency).

The Combat: 
The combat was truly exceptional!! I love the parry system, it was very satisfying when you parry at the right time and break an enemy's stance and/or weapon. When you parry enough times you can stagger an enemy and deal a great amount of damage. The regular enemy and bosses are all very unique and give a perfect amount of variety. It makes you think light on your feet, and use your build in different ways that are extremely satisfying.  
(My set up is The Puppet Ax with the Police Baton Handle, the Puppet String Legion Arm, spec'd into motivity and capacity. Its awesome!) 

The Story: 
No spoilers here, the story was captivating and left me wanting more. I wanted to explore more to get more story and world building. The scenery was absolutely stunning and really hammered in the story was trying to tell.",1704151505,1704151505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BEST SOULS-LIKE OF THE DECADE. BUY IT. 

---

- 优秀的美术风格，和性能优化，即便是我的SteamDeck和MacBook Air也能跑满60fps，游戏本更是2k 120。在2020s这狗屎优化/劣质游戏满地爬的年代，真是可遇不可求。服装作为纯装饰品也是个不错的设计，至少不会影响我暖暖了。

- 相比魂系，游戏对玩家来说更加友好，每张图都标配的捷径，boss房外掉魂，以及npc支线提示，对玩家的惩罚没有那么大，玩起来不累，能够一直有热情玩下去。可选的npc助战（虽然我还没试过），配合上炼金师那买的方块，只能说非常轮椅，不会有人这样还打不过吧？

- 富有魂味的地图设计，陷阱，机关，柳暗花明的捷径，符合逻辑而非纯迷宫的室内外地图，不能说完美，但也可以说是优秀的模仿。虽然大部分时候对于魂ass来说可能是意料之外情理之中，但打完黑兔帮后直接回到了酒店，还是把我惊到了。

- 没有联机可能失去了一份和朋友一起游玩的快乐，但考虑到剧情，其实是情理之中，而且没有魂5入侵让游戏体验大大提升。

- 战斗可能是大多数人觉得不行的点。在我看来主要问题还是人物常驻韧性和出手韧性都太低，拼刀拼不过小怪，不马上翻滚还能被boss一套连到爽 —— 要是我也能像对面的白人偶一样打都打不动，那估计爽死了。但对于刺剑/小雨伞从头玩到尾的我来说，90%的战斗体验其实还不错。个别几乎没有硬直，还连招贼多的精英怪/小boss确实让人血压飙升（忍耐锯骨刀蓄力，请），大部分更多的是熟练度问题。
  - BOSS战说难真的不难，说简单也不见得简单，但整体来说BOSS的出招和派生其实都比较直白且简单，多被打几次肯定记住了，解法也没有非常复杂，吃的就是基本功，这一点更像是只狼 —— 打过一次就有一万次。但问题就出在boss的血量很长，且伤害高，导致不熟练的情况下容错率大幅度下降。对我目前来说，初见过的boss只有那个马戏团古达和菜鸡维克多。如果你习惯魂系的云里雾里过boss战的话，可能要多坐牢一会儿了。
  - 不过话说回来，这个完美格挡的时机确实难了点，多个一两帧（60fps）可能会体验好不少。加上没有狼的抖刀术，初见不建议无脑弹反，该使用超长无敌帧的回避。

- 作为一个类魂，LoP除了完美复刻了魂的经典元素之外，也加了不少属于自己的东西：与剧情相关联的撒谎系统，提升主角性能的P器官，可以根据自己的喜好（手感，技能）随意组装的武器，跟Sekiro借的高级忍义手（后期甚至能带俩？），还有好听又放松的唱片。是一个内容丰富且完整的游戏。

- 既然他能被拿来和正统魂系作比较，不论输赢，LoP作为Neowiz的第一作类魂，都已经非常成功了。而且在我心中他远比早期魂系优秀。

------

怎么还有人会觉得他差？能不能先玩一玩游戏。抛去玩家自身的Skill Issue，LoP是一款短板很少的“类魂”，也是最接近魂系的作品。",1700635576,1704115127,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I've always been intrigued by the Souls-like formula and concept, watched a lot of gameplay and tried several titles from the genre, but I couldn't genuinely enjoy any of them all the way through due to minor gripes. LoP ""fixes"" most of those for me.
A lot of my appreciation comes from personal preferences when it comes to combat style and pacing, story and characters, aesthetic, soundtrack, RPG elementes, UI & UX etc., but I think it's at least decent enough if not quite amazing regardless of that.
The various influences are very obvious, but there is some original flavour and the developers did a good job combining it all. Difficulty is consistently present in different aspects as expected, but it doesn't feel unfair or artificial. There are so many ways for you to adapt, change the approach and play style or make it easier / harder. It's certainly dark fantasy and while it may not be as impressive as FromSoft titles in certain regards, the existing content and systems are well done and I loved how it doesn't shy away from breaking up the grim and depressing parts both thematically and visually from time to time.
The game also runs very well and I haven't encountered any bugs or issues in my ~50 hours of play time.
I recommend giving Lies of P a try both to fans of original Soulsborne games, since it is the closest to FromSoft quality and experience I've seen so far, as well as people who are simply into more traditional action role-playing titles as long as they don't mind a certain degree of difficulty.",1704114928,1704114928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game looks amazing and it's very detailed. I love games inspired by old stories. Great game. Pinocchio is hot - would smash. He's my favourite puppet, even if he isn't one*. The music and dialogue at the end made me depressed and want to disembowel myself in a hara kiri ritual for making a few mistakes. I stayed loyal to Geppetto because I'm a good boy and I felt sorry for him. 

This game is very fun, detailed and immersive.



*Believe it or not, there is no puppet in this game or in the Pinocchio story. In the old Pinocchio story, Pinocchio is a marionette, not a puppet, despite the author, Carlo Collodi's usage of 'puppet'. In this game, Pinocchio is an automaton. He is both biological and mechanical, so he's basically a cyborg too. Anyway, if Carlo can call Pinocchio a puppet, then these devs should of course just call this mechanical cyborg automaton thing a Puppet because otherwise, you'd be kind of ruining the connection to the story a little bit. At the end of the day, nobody cares and it would be weird if this game didn't refer to Pinocchio as a puppet considering the story he comes from did. So why am I mentioning this? Because I'm bored, and if I want to point out a fact nobody needs to know in a review to satisfy my extreme boredom, then I will.

So as I was saying

A puppet is something you shove your hand and arm inside.

A marionette is what has strings and is controlled from above. Kind of like that real boy that's got no strings to hold him down.

An automaton is a mechanical robot thing. Some of them are nightmare fuel, but they are very cool.

Souls-likes are always fun to play and are my favorite genre for a reason. Some of the best gameplay elements mixed with a lovingly crafted and extremely detailed world... at least, they should be. However, many ""souls-likes"" replicate the gameplay, but never the vast lore and world-building found in Dark Souls or Elden Ring or Bloodborne. Lies of P, does this phenomenally, and is probably one of the best ""souls-like"" that isn't actually a souls game. 

First, lets get past the stuff that I didn't like personally. I found that the zones and maps that you trek through were kind of empty. The environments were beautiful, with so much to look at and so much environmental storytelling to observe and appreciate. But besides from a handful of areas, these places aren't as in depth, maze-like, or sprawling as Bloodborne (this game's main inspiration.)  A lot of areas had maybe one or two things to go out of your way for, and that was about it. This game is very straightforward, and from start to finish you will always be on goal. Now I haven't looked anything up, so if there was an optional area I missed, or a whole bunch of items passed me by, that's my fault, but I feel that the average player shouldn't need to look up all that stuff, though, part of a ""souls-like""'s charm is unraveling the mystery inside the maps of the game. One other thing I wasn't a big fan of was the Gold Coin Fruit system. This is mostly a personal thing, but I feel that in a ""souls-like"", there shouldn't be any unlimited currency that just appears over time. But those are my only persevering complaints. 

Now, you might ask what's good about this game? All of it. It is the closest you can get to a Soulsborne game while still experiencing new and fresh ideas that will keep you engaged for the entire game. The combat was incredibly fun, with the fantastic perfect guard system that kept combat satisfying and tested my deflecting abilities. The Legion arm was also a ton of fun, with a ton of different arms that all played a little differently, suiting plenty of styles. I found that the Aegis was my favorite as it helped my blocking build immensely. The equipment was also very nice. This game introduces an interesting feature ""weapon assembly"" allowing you to swap the handle and the blade of a weapon. This often results in very wacky looking swords and spears, but it is incredible with the level of customization you can do. 

The story of this game is phenomenal, but most importantly, it actually strays away from the storytelling style of the Soulsborne games. This is perfect for me, because I know the Soulsborne games have incredible stories, but I don't feel like becoming Sherlock Holmes to figure out why one boss is sad all the time, and I especially don't feel like watching a 12 hour video on the lore of the game. Lies of P gives you all the tools to make sure you can experience each character's story line and the lore of the land without you missing out. Not everything is told to you however, as there are certain stories that you'll have to do some digging to find. With this story telling format, Lies of P is able to tell you a heavy and dark toned story, and fill it with more twists than any other ""souls-like"" I've seen. You will be on the edge of your seat at the end of it, and you will hate some characters that you loved in the beginning. It is fantastic. 

Now, saving the best for last, what is the one thing you should play this game to experience? The music. The score of this game is one of the most incredible pieces of music I've ever heard. I'm convinced that the composer for this masterpiece only created the game so more people could hear their music. I love it to death, and I will continue to listen to it. Music is also extremely important to the story of this game, as you can collect records to listen to in the hub area which will affect the game as it goes along. Trust me, every single piece of music in this game is downright beautiful, and I love it to death. There were multiple times I stopped just to listen to this wonderful soundtrack. 

Lies of P understands exactly what it means to be a ""souls-like"" while still adding new elements to prove that they're more than just copy cats. This fantastic, bizarre, and beautiful spin on Pinocchio is perfect for any Souls player, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.",1704059735,1704059735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Developers haven't simply checked all boxes for a ""modern Soulslike game"" (although, quite a lot of game design decisions look like they were made just because ""you gotta""), they truly brought some new ideas, some of them quite bold, like the weapon assembly system or attacks that completely ignore i-frames.

But of course, if you have played Souls/Bloodborne/Elden Ring you would notice a myriad of direct borrowings from there, some of them almost outrageously straightforward, like ""talk to coughing people behind closed windows"", ""very nimble swordswoman that undresses in the second phase, calls herself a sharp-edged weapon of some other person and has some infuriating combo-attacks"", ""character named Manus that has an enormous hand"" and so on and so on.

It copies straight many things from several From Software games. The combat is a combination of Bloodborne and Sekiro with a twist and the level design seems like its pulled piecemeal from the entire franchise. Albeit much more linear than what you are used to. I think that is one of the weaker parts of the game. 

Copying things is not bad mind you. Its like the game was made by a souls fan that really understood what made those games great. He then copied and applied those ideas perfectly with excellent skill while putting his own spin and expanding on some areas. 

For example: The combat system in a vacuum is probably better than most From Software equivalent. Or at least more complicated. Instead of just dodging everything you are expected to either dodge, block or parry depending on the boss and the attack. Thus making things more interesting! 

Another thing they did well is that the heavy attacks are actually useful now. In FS games you usually just spam the light attack as the heavy ones take too long and does not help you all that much. Here they have three attacks with three movesets per weapon combination. Light, heavy and charged heavy. And while the heavier attacks might be slower they often have advantages like longer range to compensate. Which they don't in FS games. 

Also just like Sekiro, part of the combat is often to break the enemy poise to kill bosses faster. You can do that by perfect parrying the boss or by hitting with a charged heavy attack. This existed in dark souls too. But were rarely used. But here its often essential which makes Charged heavy attacks useful. 

The block system lets damage through, but it can be regained by attacking just like in Bloodborn. The difference here is that it only apply to blocked damage. Which is a fine compromise. 

All in all a very good game! 9/10 probably. Game of the year for me 2023. (But I have not played Baldurs Gate 3 yet.)",1704024308,1704024308,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

I am so happy that I was proven wrong. From the polish, enemy design, boss fights, ost, lie mechanic, and the weapon system, Lies of P really blew all of my expectations in terms of quality. 

Despite looking nearly identical to the fromsoft games, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it actually does a lot of things differently. For one, it mixed up the Sekiro-style parry system with the Dark Souls combat, resulting in various ways to deal with the various fast and punishing movesets that the bosses have. Pair that with the weapon disassembly system and the lie mechanic for the story, the game ends up with some pretty good replayability. All while letting you roam a pretty world and a great OST to listen to while you go at it. And the P-Organ upgrade system adds a sense of progression that's pretty unique to the souls-like genre.

But what about the combat? I will admit, in the beginning, I thought that the parry windows were too tight, the attacks were too fast, the dodge i-frames didn't last long enough, etc. But once you get the hang of weaving through attacks and knowing which ones are worth more when parried, the combat flow becomes really really satisfying, especially with the hit effects of the game. And as mentioned before, the weapon disassembly system can lead to some really fun and bizarre combos of movesets and weapon blades. While some weapons are much more viable than others, most are enough to get you through the game.

You can also switch out how each weapon scales (to a point, only moving a letter at a time, B->C or  B->A) for the 3 different attributes that scale your weapon damage, allowing for pretty much any weapon you want to use, with pretty much any build and keep it working and doing damage. This seamless process is also not difficult to understand and is introduced to the player very well. Gone are the days of sticking to one build for the entire game, now you can do whatever you want, whenever you want in the game, as long as you have the materials to change your weapon scaling and then to upgrade it.

The controls feel responsive, most bosses feel unique and have fun patterns. The story was pretty engaging, with an incredibly immersive atmosphere. At one point you are able to look over the whole city and pick out areas you have explored and the paths you've taken to get there. The areas that you explore feel fun to traverse.

For the bad parts of the game, while the areas are enjoyable to explore, there's not much exploration to do. At most there'll be a slightly tougher enemy to kill for a slight upgrade or a new weapon that you may or may not use. There are some sidequests in the game that are at most a ""make sure you come back and talk to this guy after progressing through the area"", but not many sidequests. I think the game would have done a lot better with maybe one whole optional area with an actual boss. Speaking of bosses, the entire latter half of the bosses were all overly difficult, all relying on the trope of having multiple health bars and usually transforming into almost an entirely different boss with different movesets. This does the game a disservice, as this type of mechanic should be used sparingly, in my opinion. Imagine my surprise in my playthrough when a seemingly unimportant swamp monster turns out to have a second phase for no good reason other than it being closer to the end of the game.

Also the end-credits scene was stupid. Imagine if at the end of the 2008 Iron Man movie, they had the scene of Nick Fury showing up and bringing up the Avenger Initiative lead into another scene where Stark buys the Avenger tower and puts the symbol on it, just to really hammer in the point that it was THOSE Avengers and not anything else like it wasn't already obvious.",1704004046,1704004046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not just one of the best ""souls-likes"" I've played, but I would argue that it was genuinely a better and more fun experience than half of the souls games, and at the very least rivals Bloodborne in terms of quality. The world is beautiful and the setting is amazing. The writers knocked it out of the park because practically every single character is lovable and a joy to hear dialogue from. The gameplay is incredibly satisfying and rewards aggression, and the parry system is actually extremely fair.

Pros:
- Almost perfect combat system
- Interesting and fresh setting 
- Intriguing story, that is not vague (maybe a little)
- Great bossfights 
- Tons of badass weapons to play around with
- Weapon customization system to build your own weapons from the parts of already existing ones

Cons:
- Level design is pretty straightforward most of the time with not much to explore
- Game linearity

If you are a fan of these types of games then this one is an absolute mustplay.

This game is one of the few ones that I've played over the years that wears the ""Souls badge"" as an undivided inspiration and definitely lives up to its premises instead of just trying to jump on the bandwagon copying and pasting concepts on a surface level. The developers at NEOWIZ seems to really understand what makes Souls games intrinsically remarkable experiences.

Lies of P succeeds at what it's trying to do on every level and seems to never drops it's quality. The moment to moment gameplay feels super satisfying, combat feels precisely engaging with plenty of room for player's expression, the level design is phenomenal, there's a good balance between direct and indirect storytelling, plus the great art direction aligned with the soundtrack makes for a magnificent atmospheric presentation.

I think that is also important to mention that the PC version is excellent with great scalability and runs like a dream. Fortunately they didn't inherit From Software's technical problems, which is kind of funny in retrospect when I think about every From's Souls games back at their respective launch excluding Demon's Souls, be it on consoles or PC and I say that as someone who considers Bloodborne one of the best video games of all time.

Yes, it's challenging, yes you need to learn the parrying timing, but you need to do so in Sekiro too.

The story is beautifully narrated through items and descriptions, it's a clever take on a classic fairy tale.
The combat system and the builds you can create give you the chance to adapt and either improve what you're best at or mitigate what you suck at.

After unlocking all achievements I felt bad because I just want more. A DLC just cannot be here soon enough.

Most souls copycats have some issues. They feel clunky, or look bad, the story is bland... But this? This right heel plays smooth and looks wonderful.

Overall and in general, i think this is an absolutely well made Souls-Like that that stands out with the unique systems you have available to modify your tools to fit your playstyle (P-Organ, weapon disassembly system, grinder)
The general look and feel of the game is great and i [b]truely[/b] think this is hands down the best Souls-Like in the style of the original souls games, that ISN'T developed by FromSoft!

[h1] My personal positives [/h1]

The level design feels well thought out with the shortcuts you can unlock and some neat hidden things here and there in evey zone.

They implemented very nice quality of life stuff to show the player that an NPC has new dialogue or sidequests that can be continued in different zones.

Bosses are very fun to learn, have overall well telegraphed attacks. You don't have to rely on perfect guarding, i played through 99% of it just dodging and spacing. (And you can summon a Specter (an NPC) to help you fight bosses if you want)

All the lore is easy to understand(!!), the concept of lying is well done and has actual influences on characters, with there also being sidequests and little sidestories for you to explore [spoiler] and it gives you some optional fights depending on your choices [/spoiler].

Yes some of the lore is hidden behind item descriptions (mostly collectible stuff like books and notes and so on), but the vast majority of it is told during exploration and speaking with NPCs
The cryptic text on some boss dialogue is also neat imo, so if you wanna take the time and read it, you will find some more hidden lore. [spoiler]But also if you're playing NG+, it just becomes readable, so if you just play through without bothering to read the cryptic stuff on your first playthrough, it will give you a different feel re-experiencing the story through NG+ [/spoiler]

Ah yeah.. also gearing and fashion are separated!

[h1] My personal negatives [/h1]

For my first point i wanna preface that, this being the developers first Souls-Like of that scale, they've really done their homework in how to make a game like this..
BUT the main story progression is very liniar, with no way of influencing the order.
While it works to tell the story, i just wish there were more ways to deviate from the main path and explore more, i hope they give you more options if they really do a sequel.

On that note..
The game only has a single, pretty short, actual zone that is optional [spoiler]with an underwhelming end to it [/spoiler]
It feels very ""Demon's Souls-y"" with how little exploration outside the main story it has, minus the choice to do areas in different orders that you'd have in Demon's Souls. 


The only other negative point i have, is probably very much my own fault due to how i skilled, so take it with a grain of salt before you keep reading.

I wish had more reason to use the different Legion Arms while exploring.

Some Legion Arms [spoiler](Flamberge, Fulminis, Pandemonium)[/spoiler] only do decent damage when you skill into Advance and they can inflict status effects, but while exploring and fighting new enemies the status infliction felt pretty slow and i ended up not bothering to try and find out what is and isn't effective on enemies anymore.
For those Legion Arms it must 100% be a Me issue, because i didn't skill into Advance very much, and ended up refraining from using them, since the build up is too slow (because the build up probably scales with the damage the respective Legion Arm does).

[b]But[/b] even for Legion Arms that scaled better with Technique or Motivity, they just felt very slow to use for the damage they dealt [spoiler] Deus Ex Machina[/spoiler] while exploring.
And for moments where there are ranged enemies that are further away and maybe a bit more difficult to engage, [spoiler]Falcon Eyes[/spoiler] would have been great to use i guess [spoiler] especially on the stationary enemies that throw stuff, that you cant pull with the Puppet String, or big enemies that you want to chip down[/spoiler], but throwable objects are just way too strong and often 2-3 shot those enemies, so that Legion Arm kinda doesn't feel worth using at all.. unless you're out of throwing objects i guess.


[h2] In conclusion [/h2]
The large amount of positives massively outweight the negatives, and simply put if you're looking for a great Souls-Like experience, i can't recommend you enough to try it out and pray with me that the sequel or DLC won't take too many years :')

To see a company nail this style of this game on their first attempt while many others fail time and time again is insanity. I have beaten all Fromsoft souls-likes on PC except DS2 as of right now over the past year, and I can confidently say that I enjoyed this game more that the DS series (I'm still working on my DS2 playthrough, but this game stole me). 

In terms of gameplay, I ranks above Elden and DS series, and sit sits next to Sekiro for me, but overall I would still rate Elden Ring and Sekiro over it, as I like the narratives, exploration, and set pieces throughout more. Lies of P lacks side levels, limiting exploration, but it makes up for its stellar combat and amazing level design as a whole. Absolutely no filler content, but the final act/major level drags a bit IMO. 

I give lies of P a 9/10. It's not perfection, but it doesn't have to be. The game has a fantastic foundation, it's built upon extremely well, and a solid story as well. There are areas I hope they build upon in DLC or future installments (side levels, side bosses, maybe having the lying system impact gameplay in some way, but these things lacking does not hurt the game they have now). 

HIGHLY recommend. It's hard, but the best tip I can give is that dodging is more important than some may expect when guarding is highly encouraged throughout. 

BONUS - Current Ranking from my souls-like experience:
1.) Sekiro
2.) Elden Ring
3.) Lies of P
4.) DS2 (not finished, and I know that would have me killed in some states, but I like it)
5.) DS3
6.) DS1 (loved lvl design, did not enjoy combat, but it's just old so its not really fair)|",1703930810,1703930810,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a total love letter to the whole soulsborne series and it shows. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this game.

Pros
-Boss fights are fun and memorable (except for probably two of them) 
-Great combat system and very stylish as well as engaging
-Story and atmosphere are on point
-Level design is on par with the rest of the souls series.
-Music is killer
-Has a lot of quality of life things that should be standard in all upcoming souls games
-The overall pacing is fantastic
-Performance is great! Nice to see a modern PC release not have BS performance issue (All of Jedi Survivor, Dead Space Remake cut scenes and stuttering, and the entirety of The Callisto Protocol)

Cons
-The way the belt system works is awful. The lack of any hold to go to first slot function is absolutely unforgivable
(The souls series wasn't best but I would argue after DS3 and Elden RIng there is not excuse.)
-Weapon Durability - This might be controversial, but I am not sure. Besides applying buffs to your weapon, the entire durability mechanic was either negligible or downright aggravating, I absolutely despise having to repair my weapons in the middle of the fight. I know that there are rings and items to help, but if you have jump through so many hoops to mitigate or complete remove it than why even have it. Completely useless mechanic in my opinion. * Cries whilst having DS2 durability bug PTSD

Overall I would recommend this to any souls veteran whether they be casual or super hardcore into the series. It's really nice to finally see a true souls like experience that is on par with its influences and in some ways better. 
I would not recommend to new players who have no experience in any of the games, Obviously I'd recommend new players playing one or two the souls series games, especially Bloodborne.

Congratulations on the team that made this game possible. Can't wait to see what they put out next.

There are many doppelgangers, plastic mimics, and shoddily-crafted counterfeits that crack with the slighest nudge among the now-generous Soulslike genre. One of those... Lies of P is not. It's true, it takes liberally from the mechanical and environmental design of the Miyazaki catalogue, sometimes to the point where it's annoyingly fond for From, but alone amongst its equals, it executes them to the very same level. I didn't think it possible because of how often it's been fumbled, but the game outright feels just right, just like how these games best feel. The combat and animations, enemies and visuals, are across the board top-notch. Though I regard the game as being a healthy notch more upbeat and happy than any of the Souls series, it still absolutely nails the dark fantasy atmosphere at every opportunity. It's tough, undeniably, especially in regards to a player that's new to the genre (exceptionally linear locations aren't necessarily a problem because of the fantastic checkpoint placement and enemy progression keeping things snappy and moving, but they do prevent finding alternate paths around tough spots), but the vaguely Sekiro-like prosthetic arms, and vaguely Bloodborne-like Guard and Regain system open up combo and combat depth options that are immensely exciting to try and chain together. A good machine is the form the player's arsenal takes, dashing in, cranking out a wicked attack, dashing out, gearing, winding up, grinding, ugh, it's a delight. The sounds are excellent, the music competent (would've preferred something slightly more aesthetically unique, though there are one or two absolute bangers). The voice acting... leaves a little to be desired, and the dialogue is mildly annoying (Gemini in particular I could have done without), but there's not too much talking to make it a proper nuisance. The story is simple, sweet, and enticing enough to get your P-organ pumping a little by the end, not much to say on it. I appreciate finally getting to play as a twink in a well-written game with some emotional pull to it, rare demographic it seems. To summarize, exceptional combat that surpasses some Souls titles in my opinion, fantastic visuals, very linear but well-realized locations, good story, and nothing that gets in the way of any of that otherwise. It's not doing enough on its own to be a legendary title in the way of From's best, but it'd be a crying shame to rank it anywhere else than right alongside the inspirations it cherishes so dearly. Lies of P isn't for Perfect, but it's made itself pretty damn Precious in my heart.",1703911035,1703914682,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Okay - as much as I wanted to love this game, I really couldn't. It's Bloodborne's younger challenged brother, trying so hard to be its inspiration. When the game is not trying to be Bloodborne, it's great, but then falls flat on its face with poor and emotionless voice acting, certain poorly designed enemies that will stun you into oblivion no matter if you try to block, because another one will bend you over from behind, a combat system that wants you to block even though you might be more interested in dodging, boring NPC stories and basically no choices. The silhouettes in the windows felt more like a shoddy reference to Bloodborne than anything, with your choices ranging from 'shallow' to 'really shallow' to 'this seems deep... oh no, wait, I can't not give the Fox a gold coin fruit'. The game is filled with the most fetchiest fetch quests in the world.

Krat is alright, nothing special. The soundtrack is generic and forgettable besides a few compositions here and there. NPC voice acting besides like three of them is the worst I've heard in a long time... Their tone never changes, and their talking mouth animations are absolutely horrible. Not to mention the slightly boring character design of a few of them. Every time I was met with a new NPC or choice, I was left disappointing with the outcomes. NPC's not commenting on big things happening was just a cherry on top. Items aren't craftable and rewards just get worse and worse near end game. 

Now being in the last area, the game feels dragged out and like it should have ended 10 hours ago. I never spent more than an hour on a boss, usually getting them in the first few tries, so it's not like my hours are due to bosses. 

The theme of the game is all over the place.

Gemini is the most useless and eye-rolling companion since Paimon from Genshin Impact. It's almost like the developers didn't believe the player had half a brain cell to comprehend anything that's going on in the game. I often wished you could just throw him out or disable the voice.

If only this game didn't try to be another Fromsoft rip-off, maybe it would be worth the money. Overall, it's the most 5/10 experience in my opinion. The game is just a frustrating experience. There really are better ones out there.",1703799593,1703903716,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the music and theme was absolutely nailed while in the city walking down a street with everything barred up and frenzied robots roaming the streets filled with fire and bodies while gramophones played french accordion music from the apartments with open windows such a great setting

I'd much rather do like 1 hp of damage than not being able to hit shit half of the time. I swear there is more chasing in boss fights than actually landing hits. Funny thing is, you can't even fucking respec until the 8th or 7th area, which is more than half of the game. So if you did do a strength build like me, great! you are just fucked.

However, a few of my gripes with the game:
 - Delayed attacks. 90% of the attack patterns (both from simple enemies and bosses) are insanely delayed. And not just that but also very counterintuitive and poorly telegraphed. And some attack are not only delayed but when the enemy finally swings their weapon it's just slower than what you'd expect, so you'll still block too early. And the timing behind flurry attacks makes no sense. As if the devs just chose random delays between the attacks with no real consideration. I have a really hard time believing they carefully tested each boss and concluded ""yes, this is perfect"". If we consider Sekiro's deflect timings the golden standard then this feels like a poor Chinese (or in this case Korean) copy. Despite all this, the game is not that difficult, it just ultimately makes most of the bosses not fun.

 - Linearity. The level design and progression is a 100% linear. Unlike in Dark Souls where you have access to several areas from the get go, here you always have one path you can progress towards. They tried to copy the shortcut system from the souls games too, but they ended up being meaningless.

- Cheap traps. This game has way many of those, and like 50% of them just don't work. Either the enemy waiting in ambush lunges out too early or too late, but in most cases they just miss. Enemies dropping from above when you walk up to a suspicious loot is also a recurring theme that consists throughout the game. And it's not like they do a plunging attack, they just drop near you and get staggered from the landing so you can easily take care of them, which makes this type of ""ambush"" even more pointless.",1703852076,1703852076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When Lords of the Fallen was announced I though about it but heard so many of the reviews about how that game doesn't feel much like a souls game but Lies of P does.

Originally I played this on game pass... beat it... days later I couldn't stop thinking about how much fun I'd had. When Elden Ring came out it was my GOTY. Now For 2023 Lies of P has taken that title. The game is good enough ""in my opinion"" to go from a game that I got on game pass to something that I felt I should support by buying the game on Steam. I'm not rich but I do understand that investors in game companies don't care about a parry mechanic, an awesome story, cool combat, branching paths, sick weapon designs, and enchanting music. They care about the money... how much did it bring in and if their investment paid off. So I did what I thought was the right move to keep GOOD companies that make GOOD games going, by supporting them. 

If you like souls games, like parries, robots, monsters and ear worm music ""close your eyes"" (once you play it you'll know) Then you'll love this game.

Personally, I found I enjoyed Lies of P more than Elden Ring!

Some notes:
-If you're coming from Elden Ring or enjoy open world, you will find the game too linear. Whether that is a pro or con is subjective. 
-Good *general* story telling by following the general dialogues, NPC interactions and cutscenes. You get a lot more out of reading item descriptions as well
-Parrying tip: For people who've played parry heavy games like Sekiro or Thymesia, you will find the parrying in this game is NOT executed by *tapping*. You will have to press and HOLD your block key a few frames before it would connect.

Plays like Sekiro, but spamming parry key is not allowed. Every attack is parryable - even huge AoE clouds and even grab attacks, but dodge is also viable (more viable than Sekiro). The weapons are fun for customization, but Two Dragons sword was like picking an entirely new class - huge variety of attacks and even parry hidden in the charged heavy. The most satisfying weapon to play in any game.
The game has unique elements from all 3 Dark Souls 1, 2, 3, but also weapon customization as in Bloodborne and Elden Ring (being able to select the stat scaling and weapon art separately; also being able to select handle size, moveset and also the speed of a particular moveset), with a parry like in Sekiro, but slightly slower and cannot be spammed, but more responsive than the one that's similar in Lords of the Fallen, and another parry option like Golden Parry Buckler in Elden Ring.
Playable with keyboard and mouse, but I also played with KBM Dark Souls, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Lords of the Fallen

Calling it another soulslike is a disservice, its a mainline souls game!  

For Elden Ring only players - this is basically one big end-to-end Legacy Dungeon, but if you decide to try it you will need to learn to parry multiple attacks as only dodge rolling doesn't cut it on the bosses (also note, this is single player game with an AI spirit summon option only, no multiplayer summon options available).

Theres a demo available, however it only shows a small part of the game (chapter 2) and the setting of the game is a lot more varied than shown in the demo and keeps improving after chapter 3. 

Lastly, the game is extremely well optimised and will run well on most mid range PCs and up.

It looks fantastic and runs like a peach, and most importantly there are no stability/crashing issues or bugs at all that I experienced. That being said, it's hard for me to recommend it to people for a few reasons which I'll go into below. But I'm not going to give it a negative review because it's the best game I've played this year and do really think it's a fantastic experience in its totality. Let me clarify that I'd recommend it to everyone as being a great game, I just wouldn't recommend it to people who don't know what they're getting into. Before you spend $60, I'd read about the game for sure. 

First off, it's a soulslike (more like a soulsexact, but that's a topic for another day) so the main conversation will always be surrounding difficulty. There are a few points I have here. The real trouble with the difficulty in Lies of P comes through its curve. The first half of the game is insanely easy. You could play it blindfolded. Pretty much any gamer of any skill level, if they utilize the tools the game provides, could beat the first half of P (let's say up to the Swamp Monster) no problem whatsoever. And then the rest of the game is so insanely difficult, so often gimmicky, and so annoying to traverse, that you're left cheesing bosses with throwables more often than not (exceptions being the Walker of Illusions and Laxasia, which are phenomenally designed, fair, rewarding fights). And traversal becomes less so walking through the world encountering enemies than fighting a mini boss (who has a more unpredictable moveset and does more damage per attack than the actual bosses) in nearly every room you have to walk through to get from point A to point B. The mini bosses in this game are astoundingly difficult, typically moreso than those encountered in the main quest, and are also usually not designed that well in my opinion. The door guardian is one of the worst bosses in the history of videogames; whoever came up with that idea should not be in the industry any longer. My other main complaint here is that most of the endgame enemies are reused from earlier in the campaign, albeit with different (and you guessed it, more annoying) movesets. So with some exceptions, my answer to the question of is this a difficult game is to ask a followup: which game? It's a tale of two halves, and of the 30-odd hours it took to beat the game I probably spent 8 on the first half and the rest on the second - which is arguably okay, since most people want endgames to be harder than when they start. But the rate of progression is completely unacceptable to me. You go from one hitting everyone you see to unparryable 20-part attacks and other random bullshit insanely quick. And even though I spent way more time in the second half, I actually felt more rewarded from beating most of the bosses in the first half. Beating the King of Puppets/Romeo felt like I learned something and improved each time I attempted it. Beating Simon Manus felt like I got lucky. I don't dig that, especially since endgame should be where your boss fights shine (Elden Ring also fell into this pattern, which was one of my main complaints when that game came out). There's gotta be a better way to scale souls game difficulty into the endgame than just throwing shit at the wall and seeing if it sticks. Really I just wish every boss was Laxasia.

The comparisons to From Soft are inevitable, and I'll use that as a segue. In my estimation, the combat in P is slightly better than the From Soft games I've played (all of Elden Ring and Bloodborne, a small bit of Sekiro and DS1, and a tad of DS3). The reason for that is not the weapons (I like the handle/blade assembly system here a lot but From Soft just has better weapon variety and they're generally more fun to use) but rather all the extraneous stuff the game gives you to use in combat. (Circling back briefly to my point on difficulty, you'd think this would assuage some of the late game issues but it really doesn't). But you do have a ton of options here: fable arts, throwables, elemental application to your weapon, the wishing cube, a patient gamer-core tree that grows you battle aides. And defensively you can do more than just roll. You can parry (and you have to, a lot), perfect guard, just get out of the way, run, dodge, etc. The combat feels fluid and fun and unlocking some cool advanced legion arm tricks helps there too. This is where the big missed opportunity came from in my opinion. They had a great chance to make the boss difficulty really scale with your power as a player, but it doesn't feel like you keep up with the insane hp bars (almost always two full ones, by the way). The combat is too fun to feel like it's lagging behind artificially herculean boss design. 

Where this game falls short of From Soft is definitely the vibes (although great, nothing can live up to the stunning vistas of Elden Ring or the cosmic horror in Bloodborne). I love the story of Pinocchio and they really tie in a lot of great stuff lore-wise but it's not quite there in its totality for me. World exploration also falls much flatter. It's more linear which is a good thing (no googling every 10 seconds where to go because you're lost), but there's also not that much to explore outside the main storyline which shows you exactly where to go - with a couple area exceptions that I found more annoying that complex. Oftentimes you'll go down an alley for a minute only to find a chest or a pointless drop, an enemy (maybe) and nothing else: then you have to backtrack back to the main path and feel like you wasted your time. So while not as rewarding, the world exploration and terrain reversal does feel less frustrating than From Soft. The side quests in P are also pretty stupid. I did one or two the entire game because they were short and the rewards weren't good. The only reason to do them is for the lore tidbits. 

Overall, this is the best 2023 release that I've played and I have mostly good things to say about it, even if it doesn't seem like it in this review. I'd rather provide some criticisms because I think this studio has a true masterpiece in them, and I can't wait to see what they do next (watch the end credit scene in P for sure). Props to everyone for working on the game. My one line takeaway is: tone down some of the bullshit and make the difficulty scaling more fluid, and this shit would be near flawless for me from a gameplay perspective. Aesthetically there's some room for improvement despite it being great, and I hope they work in a less drab setting next time. 

For the most part, I had an excellent time playing Lies of P and will definitely be embarking on NG+ adventures sooner than later.",1703803872,1703804238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Soulslike :
In terms of ""soulslikes"" it's linear but (mostly) interconnected like dark souls 1 or 3 and the combat is much like Sekiro where the ultimate strategy is a well timed block. As you progress through a level you start unlocking shortcuts that lead back to the original ""bonfire"" (stargazer) making it really satisfying to unlock everything and explore around.

Weapons and upgrading :
The weapon variety is great, and the system where you can mix the handle and blade of different weapons is a great twist on the standard weapon upgrade system. The scaling of your weapon goes off of the handle and so does the moveset but the blade determines the overall damage. Both parts have their own ""special move"" and you can combine them as you please. The game showers you in upgrade mats late game (and they are purchasable from an NPC) so you can try multiple weapons at max rank. At the end of my playthrough I had 3 max upgraded weapons.

Bosses :
There were very few points of frustration, mostly one specific gank bossfight but ultimately the fighting is fun and doesn't feel unfair. All bosses have 2 phases so don't get too comfortable. You will need to refight the first part of the boss to get to the 2nd one over and over. It sounds worse than it is. Usually, after a few runs, you are able to defeat the first boss pretty easily and move on to the ""real challenge"". Learning the moveset of the first phase will help a lot for the 2nd part as well.

Performance :
The game runs very well, there are no laggy areas or anything that breaks your PC. (I have a 3080 and all my PC parts are about 1 or 2 years old at this point - your milage may vary depending on your set up, of course)

First to the positive:
Great enemy design
Very good story
Good overall atmosphere, very fittig for the game
Ok graphics - much console fit
Level design is all right - Some shortcuts make no sense while on other levels you would want to have a savepoint more.

So far looking good but now my main issue with the game: The combat system.

You basically have to parry every hit to avoid dmg.

Of course, you can just guard, but you lose a part of your health, as well as a good amount of stamina.
You can regain part of the lost health by hitting the enemy again after guarding but especially early game you quickly run out of heals and late game when a boss snaps 1/3 of you health with one hit.

When an enemy throws a long combo and you aren´t full health, yes you can die or you run out of stamina and can´t evade or continue blocking the attack.
There are also attacks, you can only block with a perfect parry making it overall frustrating.
Paired with some enemys / bosses that constantly throw fast and many attacks, it is a dissatisfactory experience.

You also find a surprisingly high amount of scripted enemys waiting behind corners for an ambush.

I can´t reccoment it for casual players, while souls like fans might have fun with it.
For me, the first playthrough was a pain, the second one was medium difficulty after figuring out how the enemys work.",1703779872,1703779872,False,5,6,0.45708155632019043,0,True,False,False

The combat is tight and feels weighty, precise and responsive as any good souls-like should, I particularly like the blade-handle system, one of the game's few original ideas, as it solves one of souls-like's age old problems, that being the average player will ignore 80% of all weapons they find because they could only afford to upgrade a handful of them.

Boss fights that range in quality from pretty good to incredible. Solid level design, reasonable difficulty, enjoyable world/lore/characters. Surprisingly enjoyable story (you also don't have to watch a Vaati video to understand it). Soundtrack is good as well. I'd say the game is highly replayable, but mileage may vary. Everything ""new"" this game does it does well (that being said, it doesn't innovate too much). The game is linear, and a lot of enemies have really nasty delay attacks, so if you hate either of those things you probably won't like this game. It also has slight variations in damage when you attack (you can roll -10% - +10%) for God only knows what reason. It's not really noticeable except for when a trash mob sometimes takes one more hit. The voice acting is also questionable at times (never down-right awful, but it's definitely noticeable). I also don't care about voice acting in games, but it is worth mentioning (only played in English). There are also a few instances in both text and voice-acting where I'm not really sure if things were translated to English as well as they could have been. The final area of the game could also be cut in half and it'd probably be more enjoyable. It's clear actual effort and possibly love went into this game, and it's not just some slop trying to cash-in on the recent ""soulslike"" trend.",1703752978,1703753290,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything from the aesthetics to the leveling system and combat have all been really enjoyable for me and it has been a top-quality gaming experience.
There are only a couple things I'd list as a con such as some attacks from enemies have massively long wind ups and hit boxes that feel needlessly generous.

pros: good weapon selection and with the ability to mix blades and handles for standard stuff made for an interesting way to create a weapon both suited for you or a particular boss.

the bosses themselves were mostly all really cool and interesting and while many have a faze 2 i do not believe this is a bad thing like others do, and while the stalker fights can be easy they do tend to add to the story based on who they are.

the combat is really fun feeling like a mix of sekiro and other dark souls/souls like games and while the parry timing could be a bit funny at times they have definitely fixed it since launch and even when bosses were particularly hard (i am not a souls vet only play 1 sekiro and elden ring) they never felt impossible and while some people complain they are too easy i think the vast majority will find them to be a good challenge at first.

the story is actually very interesting and piecing it all together as you go along isn't as bad as some other games ive played its a really interesting take on the story on pinocchio story especially with the 3 endings and lying system.

cons: like and souls/souls-like game this isnt for everyone so if your not into that style avoid.

there isnt as much need to make certain builds like in darksouls/elden ring except for a few situations with bosses but even then if your looking for something that makes you think about what armor and weapons you want to use this isn't that kind of game.

unfortunately they haven't completely fixed the parry system and sometimes its not as smooth as it could be and definitely not sekiro levels like i would have liked but its still not terrible hopefully they fix it.

Final thoughts: i love this game despite its flaws small and big it truly did something worth looking at for a souls like game unlike some other souls like games ive seen and while not everything game play wise can be considered original it doesn't take away from the fact they did it really well and it was incredibly fun to play through and i will be doing more runs to 100% it and for whenever i wan't
(too those who complain its a copy of bloodborne all i have to say is good i never got to play that because im not buying a ps4 for one game and its not on pc and most likely wont ever come to it unless sony decides to be nice with the remaster)

I mean games I've played this year. And I've played some absolute banger games this year. Mario Kart, Ratchet and Clank, and plenty other games that are all Masterpieces in their own right. 

Lies of P stands up there. More than any other game this year, it sucked me into its world, its music, its culture, and I wept at one point, and I weep now remembering how it made me feel as I write this. 

The goal of a game is to create a world that didn't exist. To connect to something that isn't real and feel it as if it's something you've personally lived. And Lies of P is one of the most expertly world-built games of all time, and just existing in it gives you a feeling of what life must have been. 

And that's just the story and set dressing. 

The gameplay is peak. Challenging in all the ways it should be. It is absolutely one of those games where you spend an hour losing to a boss, putting the game down, go to sleep, and get back up and then it clicks next match. That's the kind of game Lies of P is. It's a perfect follow through of intent, challenge, and pacing.

Some of those boss fights stick out in my mind as the greatest of all time. Some of them even standing next to the Masterpieces of Dark Souls Artorias of the Abyss fight or even Orenstein and Smough. Heck, even the Soul of Cinder from Dark Souls 3. 

If you aren't convinced, play the Demo. It's hard. It's absolutely got those ""Hurdle"" moments that just test you. But when you put the game aside, and return the next day... It's something special.

If you like Dark Souls and love Sekiro, you want to play this game. This is the 2nd generation SoulsKiroBorne we've all been waiting on. I love the art style, the story is coherent and the soundstrack is incredible. They really put in the work. Great weapon variety, simple yet powerful and interesting skill tree, surprisingly good enemy variety, and where it's re-used it's done so well. Everything about this game is just so good.

Fair warning, the game is very challenging, so if you're not patient and motivated to actually learn and improve, this game is not for you. The only way to beat Lies of P is to git gud. For those of you that want to be the next ONGBAL, the floor is yours.

There are attempts to address these decisions, which I have to give Neowiz credit for, such as the Regain system, but there is too much wrong to even be positive about that. It takes a bunch of ideas from things the developers clearly like, the Pinocchio story and FROMSOFT games obviously, and crams them together in a poor imitation of each. Presumably, if you are skilled at the game there's a lot to enjoy, so if you fancy yourself someone that leans to playing games with high technical skill, it may be a rewarding experience. I didn't run into much difficulty but that was solely because I found a high damage output build that didn't make me engage with the systems. The systems are so hobbled though that I found no genuine want or need to engage with them, and that is a damning realization for a game with so many.

I knew this was a ""souls-like"" game, but never imagined that a team that wasn't Fromsoft could create something this amazing within the genre. The atmosphere/setting, story, exploration, and side quests are top shelf! Never a dull moment within this world, and the constant feeling of progression drives everything forward in a way that never seems rushed or forced. 

The combat is super fluid, and there are no shortage of weapons or builds to expand upon. I very much enjoy the way that the weapon system works in this game. Mixing and experimenting with different weapon builds is something that continues to be so much fun, and allows a lot of room for player expression.  The boss battles are intense without ever feeling cheap or unfair, and the enemy variety continues to surprise me. I would recommend this game to anyone at full price. I'll be sad when my first play-through is over.

Graphics are pretty
Builds/Weapons are highly customisable
Story is more direct compared to the souls series
Pure single player experience

Cons:
A small number of bosses are a little cheap & need a tweak
Enemy variety starts to dwindle by the midway point
Lacking a few QoL features (Leveling up requires you to go to main hub for example)

The only issues during my playthrough was a single display driver crash so performance seems pretty okay too.

The graphics are quite stunning for a souls like the art direction and gothic nature is very much like bloodborne which may be a positive or downside depending on how you like games atmosphere to be but i think it is very fitting and works well with the narrative.  

The story in this game is told quite well even though I am not far in i can tell what is going on without having to watch lore videos such as dark souls or elden ring for example. ( vaati is the GOAT) 

Now the combat and the combat at first was quite hard to grasp for dark souls veteran as you cant really dodge to win here you have to parry and break posture in order to get a  stun attack a visceral if you've played bloodborne before adding an interesting but really challenging combat loop. 

The systems within the game are qutie good for player expression with the weapons being able to be dismantled into new ones that you can make which ive never thought of before and it is just great. It works really well with the legion arm system in which you have a robot arm that can be changed to give you new abilities like a hook or a shock attack.

The story of Lies of P is somewhat intriguing as it loosely uses the classical tale of Pinocchio as its premise but twists it around in various ways. If you know the children's story then you can recognize the various characters from it that you're encountering and just like in Pinocchio itself lies play an important part in the early parts of the story.

Visually the game is serviceable. It's not exactly impressive by current standards but also not ugly.

In terms of gameplay it borrows heavily from Dark Souls in the principles but also makes a lot of the same mistakes with inventory management for example which is just as much of a pain here as it is in games like Dark Souls and Elden Ring. Everything must be prepared before a fight because you can't just pause the game and change something. Everything must be done live during the fight which always carries a lot of potential for frustration.

The thing that actually breaks the game for me though is the gameplay during combat itself as it is centered entirely around blocking (or rather parrying as you're doing the blocking with a weapon and not with a shield). When you ""block"" and attack your character takes reduced damage and you can recover the lost health at least partially by attacking the enemy. In addition you can do perfect blocks by timing the blocking perfectly to damage or destroy an enemies weapon and/or stagger them more quickly for a heavy damage attack. Dodging is possible but severely limited in effectiveness. So if you cannot block attacks perfectly in terms of timing then you have to rely on static blocking and slow movement with occasional dodges to then deal out heavy attacks in the small time frames you have available. In addition without perfect blocks you cannot damage or destroy an enemy weapon from what I've see so far.

The gameplay therefore (when you cannot block perfectly) comes down to:
1. Walk to an enemy
2. Hold block until weapon combo is done
3. Strike enemy 1-3 times
4. Hold block until enemy combo is done
5. Strike enemy

Rinse and repeat. 

There is a secondary weapon in the left arm of the character but outside of the grappler and flamethrower type weapon arms which can be used to affect enemies at a range (pull them in or put them on fire) I haven't seen any use for the off-hand. I have tried that once or twice but the energy management is annoying and the usability is limited. 

In any way if you have good timing with the blocking ability you could get fun out of this game. If however you are like me failing 9 out of 10 times when you try to do a perfect block and have to stick to more basic strategies this game may become very tedious, frustrating and boring.

It's unfortunate as with more options in making blocking and the perfect blocks more easily usable and dodging a more viable alternative the game could be more fun even if the enemies and bosses were overall tought to defeat.",1703618050,1703618050,False,1,0,0.413816690444946289,0,True,False,False

Conclusion: The Games is super nice too play, like of course if is soulslike, you will die 10 Millions times, but it doesn't matter how many time you die in the boss, when you kill it, you will fell much better, Just don't be a cry baby because you die, ok?

Lies of P is a souls-like that closely resembles Sekiro's mechanics most. Although there is a dodge button, you are going to have a really hard time with certain enemies & bosses if you dont learn how to parry.

I finished my first playthrough after roughly 23 hours. This included collecting most of the loot, secret items, and some NPC questlines that the game has to offer. 

What makes this game really hit home is it's beautifully crafted story and the immediate familiarity one gets when it comes to mechanics, level design, and overall gameplay of the souls series. For context I've played all of the From Software games except for Dark Souls 2 and lies of p is way up there as one of my faves. 

[h3] STORY [/h3]
The narrative is simple and straightforward but the world building and environments you explore really do a good job at setting the tone for the whole game. NPCs add a bit of complexity with the various interactions you have with them. The game does a good job at connecting their storylines and giving you a few options as to how you would want to respond to a conversation. The whole puppet and human thing.

[h3] ENEMY VARIETY [/h3]
I've had no issue with enemy variety. In fact, I found it very interesting every time I would encounter a new foe in a new area and that it would completely make sense as to why these enemies look and act a certain way. It doesn't feel generic and every single area has something to keep you on your toes

[h3] COMBAT [/h3]
Combat is challenging and satisfying. The dodging, parrying, and stagger system feel just right. Everytime I die, I understood why and didn't completely feel like random BS (Except for one boss). Also, I don't know who thought of the whole separate blades and handles system but it is genius. I would find myself spending a lot of time experimenting with builds just to see how a specific weapon handle would work with a new blade I found.

[b] This game was a good experience, definitely a must buy for fans and first timers to the genre 
P.S. The soundtracks and music in this game are phenomenal. [/b]

It has some issued but, it looks gorgeous and if you enjoy the setting of Bloodborne, this is definitely a good game to pick up

Originally based off of ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" by Carlo Collodi, the game takes the fairy tale into a dark and twisted turn with a souls-like theme. You play as Geppetto's puppet, also known as ""Pinocchio"" or ""P,"" and you're job is to go around Krat to kill off enemies and discover what's really going on in the city. Throughout the game, your choices affect the characters around you and the protagonist himself. Will you dare to lie your way through, or tell the truth?

The plot in the game is linear, but topped with clues and hints for the players to have an idea what really happened before the fall of Krat. When you do your first run, you wouldn't know much while you follow the story in a straight line until your 2nd run. The 2nd run is when things get really, really spicy. It gave ""Nier"" and ""Drakengard"" vibes, which quickly grabbed my attention right off the bat as I'm a sucker for Yoko Taro's work, different scenes/dialogues, and choices leading to multiple endings. 

The art direction is phenomenal, and is the main reason why I stayed. As an artist, I incredibly admire the world building in the studio's own way even though it's based off of a fairy tale. This includes architecture design, culture, characters, and graphics. Especially the legion arms, outfits, and the protagonist. I love the grim tale series, and ""Lies of P"" perfectly fits in that category! If the devs do decide to continue on re-creating fairy tales into a dark souls-like game like ""Lies of P,"" then I would love love LOVE to play them all.

The key in the game is timing and parrying, and planning ahead. I came into the game after they adjusted the difficulty, but as a newbie to the genre I still had a hard time in my first run, until the next run later. Memorizing small enemies/boss attack patterns help and aren't too complicated to master (sometime). You can build whatever you want Pinocchio to be, either  mainly strength, dexterity, magic, or in this case: Motivity, Technique, and Advance. You choose how comfortable you want to fight, but parrying and timing is incredibly important.

The challenge and the thrill of killing a difficult boss after dying so many times brings a wave of satisfaction. It is your typical RPG with a sprinkle of pain, trial and error. While playing the game the first time, I was overwhelmed by enemies along the way, not knowing how to level up and properly upgrade weapons until a friend guided me through. Eventually, I managed to finish my first run on my own. Now, I'm on my third run, and eventually will be doing my 4th run. I came into the game with high expectation, and instant dislike right off the bat. But, ""Lies of P"" helped me cope through a tough time with personal struggles, and now it has a special place in my heart. The game opened my eyes to the souls-like genre, and I decided to give it chance. I would love to go back and play Bloodborne, and maybe Seikro, now that I have a better perspective in the genre.

If newcomers are coming in to try, I highly suggest this game first. Surprisingly, the game is short once you've mastered the mechanics, but the game is always incredibly fun in multiple runs.

Imma great Bloodborne fan and I'm waiting for PC port like I'm waiting for my boyfriend coming back from army.

On a serious note - I didn't get much BB vibes from this game. Nevertheless it is very fun game. 

Side note - I got easily bored with dark souls and elden ring, since gameplay-wise they are very simple (don't mix simple-complex with easy-hard). You can only master dodge-roll and that's all you will ever need. Autotarget magic is boring, parry is optional and those games aren't MADE to be parried.

- However Lies Of P is made to be parried
- You must master parry like in Sekiro, however parry in Lies of P doesn't feel like a dance to me
- Lies of P is made with love and care for the player, not only for the game itself
- You get so many Quality Of Life small features, that From Soft didn't came up to
- Game can be hard sometimes, but to me it was always FAIR during all my 50+ hours NG+3 playthrough

It's no ""Bloodborn on PC"", not even close, but it's a good game on itself.
the design, the artstyle, the world and the mechanics are all mesh together beautifully.
BUT THERE'S A BIG BUT, the game sill has its issues (as of my playthrough of version 1.4)
sometimes weapons attack and legion weapons straight up didn't respond, I found myself plenty of times tapping the buttons just to be sure they'll get the attack.
Same goes for dodging and parrying - and that's a HUGE issue I had with the game, the game expect you to have pinpoint accuracy at some cases but it seems that the game just can't handle so many actions at once or the response time just can't handle the players response time, that was a huge turnoff for me..
and there was a certain boss that her attack launches you in the air, but for some reason I stayed up in the air instead of landing, the game response by killing me - happened twice and I got lucky that I just didn't let her do that attack on me the third time
->>>A game that requires full precision from its player and is itself with unpolished mechanics, and reaction times that do not match the player's reaction speed and the challenges it poses to the player is a game that must undergo further polishing before it goes to market.
Also I'm not a huge fan of locking the best weapons for the near end of the game or even worse for the NG+ run.
Other than that,
some of the late level designs were just tedious and felt like they were built just to add padding, lots of cheap cliffs to die, lots of ladders and elevators do make a shortcuts instead of giving the player a checkpoints, BAD BAD BAD platform sections, and enemies that can jump and smack you even if you were a mile away from them

-> yeah it's a good game, but it needs more polish before it can be a really great game
-> I do truly hope to see the studio improve of it's work and looking forward to their next project.

Anyone who has avoided this because they don't like souls games should be aware that they're missing out on a crucial piece of our modern zeitgeist. 

I think that this game will eventually find its way alongside games like Bioshock because little moments just kind of stick with you and it has mechanics which improve the gameplay so much that it's hard to go back to the way things were. I recently played through DS1 remastered again and definitely wished a few times that I had a weapon repair tool on my arm with infinite charges.

Without being long winded, the last thing I want to call out about Lies of P is its music. The soundtrack in and of itself is something of a marvel. They're bringing back jazz pop songs from the 20s and 30s but with modern feels and instrumentation. I don't want to spoil it but it cannot be overstated just how great the music is and its done in such a way that everyone who experiences this music is taking it all in without distraction. I was genuinely shocked when I first heard these tunes and this is the first game I've ever played where I was actually tempted to buy the soundtrack.

But gameplay itself is VERY solid and responsive once you get into the swing of it. Story and world building are good, less esoteric than dark souls and elden ring but I appreciated that personally. It has true RPG choices. I think it's the closest thing we will be getting to bloodborne on PC. If you can run it, and have the money definitely worth your time.

I say closest thing to bloodborne but it does stand on its own two legs too. Has a bunch of unique and innovative mechanics that I hope to see elsewhere, namely making your own weapons. You can take the blade of a strength weapon chuck it on the hilt of a dex weapon and tune both to scale with your stats.

Difficult but satisfying combat that rewards mastery, insane boss fights (seriously Laxasia almost made me cry), a good amount of build customisation provided in the various systems and a unique weapon system that can be mixed and matched. All of this is tied together in the brilliant re-imagining of a classic story in a beautiful setting with great music.

Only thing I can dock points for is enemy variety could be expanded a bit more and some weapons are so bad and have no upsides unless you are purposefully trying to make the game harder while others are just giga broken. It would be nice if everything was at least viable as a baseline.

That said, my complaints did not affect my enjoyment of the game in a major way so well done to the team. I'm looking forward to seeing how Round8 builds on this. I feel like it can only get better (hopefully).",1703416013,1703416013,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is just factually wrong. This mechanic exists to prevent getting a hit and two in every once in a while and playing it very safe.

For example my two weapons blades I didn't like the attack style but liked the blades where a electric weapon you get fairly early and a great sword, two of the hilts I likes where a swords one and a saber one, do I took apart all 4 weapons and I put the two hilts onto the two blades. So now instead of having two weapons with a swing I don't like now I have an electric weapon that has a tight enough swing that I can block easier and since I am using it to just apply a status effect I am ok with it doing a bit less damage than on a hilt that fits it's style more, and I have a nice long blade that is still snappy when it comes to getting to where I can dodge sooner which in turn allows me to play the way I want to play while still keeping that same type of challenge where you have to learn how enemies attack to be able to properly respond to their tells.

And the nice thing is, it doesn't take any resources to break apart or glue together the weapon parts so you can test all the combos until you find one you like. Enemy design is good, level design is good, enemy placement in the level is good, it feels like a Souls game just without the controls feeling intentionally jank.

For starters, the performance is smooth. I've experienced no stutters or framerate issues, something that can easily make a soulslike feel horrendous to play. Animations feel fluid, and telegraph attacks well while still demanding a level of memorization, and the hitboxes feel accurate and representative of the attacks they're attached to. The fundamentals are 100% there.

Lies of P takes a really creative approach in addressing many of the criticisms people have had with the various fromsoft titles, adapting them instead of simply removing them. Case in point, the poison swamp. A classic in the souslike, something we've all gotten used to but hate nonetheless. Lies of P addresses this by never outright forcing you to get poisoned. This is achieved by ensuring there is always an island or river embankment within the player's reach, forcing them to approach the situation swiftly but cautiously, ensuring no enemies are in the way. It rewards both patience and aggression when the times are right, something you'll come to find is a recurring theme. In addition, a decent portion of the poison areas are actually just simply drained at the end of the level by dropping a giant torch on them, burning all the poison away. It's an incredibly satisfying reward for reaching the end that allows you to reapproach the area with more free exploration, with things often hidden beneath the poison.

In a less-subtle tweak, we have the weapon system. In Lies, weapons come in two pieces, the blade and handle. The handle determines the scaling and basic moveset of the weapon, with the blade determining damage output, damage type, and the weight class of the weapon. You can put a greatsword blade on a curved sword handle to make a heavy curved sword. You can put that same greatsword blade on a spear handle to make an incredibly long-ranged greatspear. You can put an elemental blade on a dex-scaling handle, simply bypassing the special stat requirement you often see. In addition, both pieces contribute their own special move, one that expends a special bar seen beneath your stamina, known at fable. The blade is often a strong attack or buff, with the handle often contributing a defense buff or special parry. The system doesn't just encourage experimentation, it facilitates it. If you want to try a new blade, just put it on your handle. If you want to try a handle with different scaling, there's a training area in the game's hub area that'll let you test its moveset and decide on a respec. It's so much fun, there's no other way to put it. You're no longer just building for a single weapon or loadout, you're building for a playstyle.

I feel like i could go on and on about stuff like this, but at that point I'd just be explaining the whole game and not much more. I didn't even touch on boss design since I feel like they're all great and need to just be experienced. The positives of this game are self-explanatory and evident from the start, and that's the best part of it all. All in all, while I don't feel like Lies manages to hit some of the explosive highs of the fromsoft games, never once did I ever feel like something in the game was mediocre or bad. There is no Bed of Chaos or Capra Demon, no Curse-Rotted Greatwood or Farron Keep-type area. Everything this game has to offer is at least good, and that's an incredible achievement.",1703286582,1703286582,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Fantastic enemy variety, good (if not a bit linear) level design, and a number of bosses that rival even the greats like Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. Absolutely no jank to be seen either, something that tends to be a plague with games of this type.

Aside from a fairly low distance dodge and a possibly below average swing speed for certain weapons there really are no good reasons not to fall in love with Lies of P.

The mature take on the Pinocchio fairy tale is very refreshing and the world/lore is very well crafted. I’ve played all the dark souls games, including Elden ring and bloodbourne. From soft could take some notes on what the developers have implemented here, especially narrative wise.

My only very minor dislike would be the linearity of the gameplay and level design. Don’t expect dark souls 1 connected world levels. Having said that, the linear design is a great match for how the story progresses and I had to make myself stop playing the game.

Also loved not having to rush to bosses as they put stargazers (bonfires) very close.

The weapon-handle system is one of the most creative, and fun combat mechanics in a ""souls-like"" ever made, allowing you to use blades and such, without sacrificing damage because of your chosen playstyles, allowing players running a Technique (Dexterity) build, to use weapons of Motivity (Strength) as an example. Not only that, but swapping handles also changes the weapons' moveset, to that of the handle. Although this can nerf weapons that deal a certain physical damage, if the moveset doesn't contain gestures of attack, such as Slashing. 

The Story is also pretty tight knit and well done, it may be predictable to an extent, but the way it is told is just so much fun to experience. The bosses all have their own unique challenges, movesets and designs, as expected, but the care put into their animations is truly unlike anything I have seen in any action rpg in a while. I don't hear too many people praising the visuals as much, and also the score, which are both so beautiful. ""Feel"" is definitely one of the best songs in the game, and one I've been listening to outside the game itself. 

I was also able to run this game at a mostly consistent framerate with my mid range PC, which is genuinely a surprise, as most games passed 2020 have ran like crap for me. So seriously, the optimisation is fantastic. Overall this is a great, tight knit package, and definitely worth the full price. I hope more and more people play this game, and understand how amazing of an accomplishment this game is, adding on to the fact that this is the first ever game from this developer.

If you compare it to literally anything but a Souls game, it's serviceable... okay, make sure that's a narrow range of games.  Like, compare it to something bad.  There are things that will just fall apart about it having ""cracked the formula"", which frankly I don't want to get into.  As for why that is, while I think for a first effort, even Demon's Souls obliterates this game in terms of things like map design or, just overall, general themes... these are things I don't think most people actually care about because they don't know why they're making this comparison in the first place, let alone whether this comparison is actually true.  And it's the part where you know they don't actually know or care where I'm not going to waste my time.  

I'm going to go in an admittedly backhanded direction just so say, instead of saying why I think this game wasn't that good to me alone, I'm going to instead list why you might want to get this game:

IF you happen to dislike Souls games, but you want something extremely watered down and simplified but in a way that is in no way going to be apparent to a low attention span or investment, absolutely get Lies of P.  If you love playing dodge/take turn with things in a way that feels like what an awful single player version of Tekken would be where you can't just punch someone out of an unblockable/hard to block able, absolutely play this game.  If navigating maps with actual substance to their being interconnected is difficult to perceive, often not being interesting at all even on this game's own merits, definitely play Lies of P.  And if you want to just experience having stuff in a game whether the designer understood why it was interesting or tolerable in the first place, DEFINITELY get Lies of P.

There are clearly people, who are defensive of the game, who really feel like this is ""their game.""  You may be one of those weirdos!  In action games, just being good at something can be its own reward, so much that you have to realize you're likely talking to someone high off their own shit.  I beat the game, I did a lot of stuff, I felt like my time was mostly wasted because there was never a moment where I was ever impressed.  A lot of it just comes down to what you want to hear and if you happen to like struggle games where the struggle feels extremely arbitrary and is focalized through a void that is apparent in someone's soul, where nothing can mean anything or is actually ever significant, this crappy game is for you!  

Just expect a lot of odd moments where suddenly the game really requires you to fight poorly designed fights with overtuned things, cause it thinks that's what you have to do.  And mainly the point of contention there is moreso the combat system and the difficulty, which if you're a weirdo you're gonna have an amazing time.  Get the game if you check that block, couldn't be me.  Beat it, did the block real good with the timing, experienced it for the sake of it, I actually think the DLC hook could be interesting, but I don't recommend this for someone who actually wants to play a game that Lies of P so desperately is trying to imitate but does mostly in superficial ways that don't merit much credit.

Looking forward to future titles from this studio. Hopefully they dare to deviate more from FromSoftwares formula in the future and find their own voice.

""best non-fromsoft souls game I played so far, amazing plot very immersive and brilliant"" now thats what felt like completing the game first time around, I had few doubts at first up 'till I started the NG+ and thats where the game mechanics became much more clear as I kept upgrading my character's stats and leveling up. 
First issue I noticed is the scaling, it doesn't make sense having high stats in Defense and Resistance while still die from foot soldiers with a couple of hits, my level currently is 196 and yes, I still die from literally two-three hits by regular enemies (first chapter). 
With that said, the scaling issue unfortunately extends the bosses and mini-bosses, not only that, but almost 90% of the time it feels like the bosses are privileged with abilities, stamina and speed that extends far beyond yours, no matter if you are level 500 or ten, you'll still experience the broken boss mechanics, you'll immediately notice this after the tenth boss (or ninth) you can't miss it : sometimes they would go on illogical frenzy where no matter  how high your health and stamina are, you won't be allowed to dodge nor parry, why? cause the bosses are much faster than you and sometime they can reach you from across the room with charged attack or fable attack, they can chain link their combos even if was after their fable attacks (when they go red) and charged once which makes you think, how much stamina this enemy is packing?! None of that happened first time playing the game.
Some bosses you can't hit when they are knocked down flat on ground, some you can. whereas the minute you fall, their attacks will land on you, dodging will still not be an option, though you are allowed to guard sometimes when you are knocked down flat on the ground. Moving on further with this critique, I think this is my last point, more like a question really, Why is it really easy to get staggered by enemies (so much so by regular chapter one enemies) while its harder to stagger them in return?  personally I can only recommend this game only for first round completing it, the NG+ mechanics and scaling really needs some fixin' and adjustin'.",1702320464,1703104563,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

All that thanks to NEOWIZ taking all the weird and wonderful shit that happens in the story and adapting it to a solid mix of Dark Souls 1's, Sekiro's, and Bloodborne's gameplay.

Last year, I wishlisted Lies of P because I, like many others, want a 60FPS remastered PC port for Bloodborne, but LoP does its own thing with the combined elements from the aforementioned games that I would have to get my own Playstation with Bloodborne to truly get my fix. It takes quite a bit to get used to for veteran Soulslike players, but I think this and DS1 make for great entry points for this type of action RPG. The enemies and bosses can both wreck careless players, but they have wide, predictable tells for their attacks much of the time; such that they can be blocked or parried with good timing. There is nothing quite like parrying several times in a row, seeing the enemy health bar get bordered with white, and landing one strong attack to stun them, affording the opportunity to knock out yet another significant portion of that health bar with a riposte attack. 

The binary choice mechanic is one of the game's more unique (for a Soulslike RPG) elements, which fits the Pinocchio theming. It plays more into which of the three story endings one will get than how it affects relationships to the friendly characters. There's not much else to say about that.

In conclusion, this game's playable Pinocchio is cute and I want to take him out to a night on the town. The game's as hard as it should be for one of its type.

I'd say this is more ""like Dark Souls"" than something like Lords of The Fallen, but both have really cool, new, different ideas on how to approach certain aspects.

I can't give it a 10, because there were a few things that bothered me, but they're kind of minor, so let's go with a solid 9.

Things I didn't like:
- I found that 2-handed, slow weapons weren't worth the trade-off in damage.
- Some areas kind of drag on.
- It starts very slow. To me, it was a ""kind of boring"" for the initial Krat area, but as I unlocked more, and as the story progressed, I was glued to it.
- Gear weight. I found myself putting more of the weight stat than my main damage stat. At the same time, again, there's always a positive, even if I was to go into NG+, levels would still give substantial stats. I'm not mega hard capped and then wondering what to put my points in going forward, like souls ends up being most of the time.

Things I liked: Everything, but more specifically:

- Weapon customization, the way they did it, is very *very* cool! But at the same time, it goes hand-in-hand with my first con. We're talking giving a 2-handed blade a 1-handed moveset type customization. It kind of invalidates some of the non-customizable weapons in my opinion. Still, I prefer tinkering and trying things than keeping the same boss weapon throughout the entire game (Remnant).

- The story is cool. It's possible to make a somewhat cryptic game without it being 99.9% cryptic and have a strong emphasis on story. I wish to god NEOWIZ makes more grim, dark takes on childhood stories like this to be honest. It's right up my alley.

- The world is amazing. Light Bloodborne vibes through and through.

Therefore, some of these issues may have been fixed or worsened since my playthrough. I played around launch to give you a picture of when I played. 

Let's discuss the positives first:

The game encourages a fast-paced, close-quarters combat style reminiscent of Bloodborne. The emphasis on blocking over dodging adds an interesting dynamic. For instance, when you get hit while blocking, a translucent HP bar can be recovered through a perfect block. Additionally, you deplete the enemy's invisible stamina bar(perfect blocking also depletes this invisible stamina bar)., potentially staggering them and creating an opportunity for a charged attack, leading to a stun and the chance for fatal attacks (riposte).

Furthermore, the game features a weapon system where you can dismantle weapons into blades and handles. This allows you to mix and match, adjusting stats and changing the charged attack based on the handle(I believe not 100% certain on this because I haven't played in a while). Not all weapons can be dismantled, as some are special. Additionally, the game has visually pleasing graphics and a lie system which is just this game's choice system.

Now, let's delve into the negatives:

The dodging mechanic is underpowered because of the insufficient distance. Using it often results in getting hit more than it helps, creating an issue since the game doesn't always favor blocking and actively wants you to dodge sometimes. While the dodge can be upgraded, it requires P-organs, which are rare and obtained mainly from boss fights and side bosses. The upgraded dodge, allowing a roll off the ground and double dodge, improves the distance but turns more into an I-frame button than a repositioning tool as the game progresses.

Moreover, the player lacks poise, making nearly every attack interrupt actions. Some attacks require perfect blocks, and the window for this is extremely tight, feeling close to frame-perfect. Compared to Sekiro's parrying system, with a more forgiving window(I was told this by my friend who also played the game so I can't confirm or deny this). There are instances where enemies can double-hit you, making the perfect block pointless since it will hit you regardless, this becomes more of a problem with longer enemy combo strings.

As the game advances, longer enemy combo strings make boss fights increasingly challenging. I encountered one boss fight where a specific attack prevented effective dodging or blocking, leaving me with limited options—either continuously attacking to stagger the boss before they could get those attacks off or relying on perfect blocks throughout the entire string of very long attacks. Status effects, like decay, have nearly instant build-ups. The combination of quick build-ups and Decay draining weapon durability and HP can be frustrating though I don't mind decay for merely existing just how easily it builds up is a problem. depending on the enemy, some attacks are poorly telegraphed or look similar to others, making it challenging to predict and parry effectively and this just makes fighting bosses in this game an absolute dread as they are the worst offenders of this.

The game encourages you to kill all enemies with some placements that are cruel, punishing attempts to run past them for progress not inherently a problem just a thing that exists. However, there are particularly challenging enemy placements, such as some with ranged attacks while you have to cross narrow beams which potentially causes you to get hit with an attack that could knock you off and make you restart from the beginning. 

TLDR, the game has its strengths and weaknesses, with room for improvement in gameplay mechanics, especially dodging and perfect blocking.  With that being said the game does have DLC coming and a potential sequel so hopefully it will fix these things in those.",1703018825,1703018825,False,4,0,0.459419220685958862,1,True,False,False

In all seriousness though, I haven't even beaten the game yet but can confidently say that this game is a must-play for souls-like fans, or even for people who don't like souls games

The graphics are amazing, the combat is so fluid, satisfying and impactful, and unlike most Souls-borne or souls-like games, the story in Lies of P is actually pretty good. You actually can follow along with what is happening, and it's not super cryptic like other souls games, for example Elden Ring. You also care about the characters, and the game is extremely detailed in many ways. Even in exploring through the areas, theres shortcuts to make things like boss runbacks not that bad, and everything is connected so well it shocked me when I first found it.

 In conclusion, you should buy this game! Warning: it is pretty difficult though, a lot of people say its harder than Elden Ring. Even if you don't like it, you can just refund it with less than two hours of playtime! Good luck and have fun! :)",1703007863,1703007863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm glad I purchased the game.  The combat is fun, the use of Legion arms allow for a lot of flexibility in build design (Puppet String lunge/drop attack with Motivity weapons hits extremely hard), and there's lots of room to explore.

It's a fairly linear game, paths wind and double back on themselves for shortcuts in a Soulslike fashion, but there's basically one route to follow in the main path.  That said, the environments are far more varied than 'Victorian-era streets and rooftops' that the demo portrayed.  It also ultimately pits you against more than just the frenzied puppets rampaging through Krat (the city in which this takes place).

Boss designs are varied, gorgeous, imposing, and disgusting.  My jaw dropped on some of the boss intros and phase changes.  Boss movesets are learnable, varied, and difficult to master, some starting with the same few attacks but switching it up with a backswing, dive, or other 'gotcha' requiring better reactions from the player.

As with most Souls-likes, lore can be buried behind items and descriptions, and the player has to check windows and listen for clues to possible quests in certain areas.  The story is much more prevalent and openly presented than From's titles.

Weapons are amazing.  The ability to interchange weapon 'heads' and handles to create a multitude of Fable special attacks and weapon movesets is the best I've seen in a Souls-like.  The unique boss Ergo weapons (which can't be modified like the found weapons) were equally varied and were strong in their own right.  I found myself gravitating towards an end-boss heavy hitting weapon in NG+.

I'm about 35 hours of play time in.  My NG+ playthrough is going significantly faster since combat has 'clicked'.

the game is great but has a few shortcomings mostly when it comes to mechanics instead of the story.

it is true. the game is probably thus far the most correct souls-like adaption that has been made by a non-fromsoftware developer. Ever. In fact i cannot think of a single game right now that is a more venerable adaption. The game is a mixture of Sekiro, Dark souls and Bioshock
~~~~~~~
-Overall:
There are a total of 11 Chapters if i am not mistaken. Which is fairly short. Now i am against forced game prolongation by making you walk in places where you do not want to go back and forth doing quests just to grind the main mission. 
This is not like that. I believe you can just do minimal interaction with the main characters and still get away with ending the game. Which is fair and nice. 
~~~~~~~
-Main storyline:
The main story is pretty entertaining and holds a few decent twists that i really enjoyed. Unlike other modern games (all brown-shooter games) the characters are not forgettable. You will end up wondering who is where and what are they doing, what will they offer, what are their backstories. Just like classic fromsoft games a lot of details about the world are crypted behind messages, leaflets and various collectibles that hold the actual Lore of the world. This is a negative point for the read-lazies but positive for the exploration kind of gamer.
~~~~~~~
-Mechanics:
O man where to start. As mentioned above the gameplay itself is a venerable copy of sekiro and dark souls. You have dodge-rolling, full block, full deflect. On top of this some extras are added like weapon durability and debuffs that affect it. Once in a while your weapon will lose durability and you have to grind it. This is a a non issue once you unlock the skill tree that the weapon gets auto grinded when you use your secondary. Because you can put 2 weapons of the same playstyle at your usage. But until then it can be an actual factor in prolonged bossfights. Just like fromsoft games the bosses (not mobs) will read your input commands and stall hits if you are spamming deflect. But not if you hold block. This is imo STILL a bad practice withing these kinds of games. But it is the least relevant point, because the main problem is the deflect itself.
You see games like Sekiro that have sword deflect mechanics rely on a simple principle. Frame timming. When you fully press L1 (p.s joystick) to block, the character holds his weapon upwards. The whole animation takes 1 full second from start to finish. The first half of the block animation is the actual deflect. That means if a hit lands while you are in the first half of the animation, it counts as a deflect. This puts the brunt of the skill on the player, and by such logic the devs SHOULD make this a skill based system and not a memorization based system.
Yes the deflect is giga broken this game and i am probably not the only one who feels like it. The block animation is also a full second. But the deflect time FEELS much shorter than 0.5. It feels on the edge of 0.2 sec from my fast eye. Which is ok. The main problem i have are the enemies. Some bosses (will not spoil) can cast an attack in less then 0.1 seconds. Running at 100 fps means you have 10 frames to react. 
This time-frame is beyond what the human eye-brain-hand synapse can account for. In fact even most CSGO pros peak at 0.145 sec eye-brain-hand reaction time. And that is when the brain is in auto-click mode on a website designed for you to click once. Here you have to account for other factors too. As far as fromsoft games go the only thing i can think of that had very few frames to react were few attacks from Isshin. Namely only few of the charged wind slashes fell under this category of attacks. Where you cannot react, you must memorize the timming. If you have played the last Isshin you know what i am talking about. Now imagine for example all of Isshin's auto attacks cast as fast as the wind slash. 

This is not inherently a bad thing but i think it takes away from the skill-factor. Because you force the player to either memorize the timming or just glue their finger to the L1 block. 
I also disagree the player should be able to heal after blocking and attacking. The higher stagger damage is fine but why heal? Up until mid-game the bosses are very easy,  which takes away from the satisfaction of beating them; the players needs not heal off of autos after a block.
Another important thing to note is that if the player fails a deflect he will go into a very short stagger animation and CANNOT recast deflect immediately. Even if the player is not actually staggered/stunned you need to wait to cast deflect if you failed to deflect. This is detrimental against bosses that spam attacks in melee quick-succession. Your best hope is to have invested 80 points in HP and see if you can fit in a dodge-roll real quick. 
~~~~~~~
-Gameplay:
Very satisfactory semi-exploratory. Why semi? The world  is linear. If you get lost here is probably because you have not figured out yet that there is truly only 1 path. Which is also ok because the design of the worlds itself is very immaculate in my opinion and it makes up for this. Besides not everyone is an open-world enjoyer.
~~~~~~~
-Weapons:
The second weakest point this game has. Weapons fall under only 3 categories of fight-style. Rapier, sword, heavy sword. The animations are the same for all weapons in the same class. The differences between weapons comes mostly from the stylistic art and whatever effects you want their handles to have. This was very underwhelming so i stuck with the rapier Umbrella for all the game because the rapier actually breaks the game. 
Yes it is a very OP weapon that will literally go unpunished, which imo is AI fault. Heavy swords can do a lot of stagger damage but also drain DOUBLE the amount of stamina per attack. And each attack is 3x slower than other weapons. This means the rapier dps is actually insane and you should use heavy swords only for critical attacks once the enemy is staggered.
The umbrella is also too OP because it becomes a mini shield once you cast a heavy attack. Blocking any enemy hit that lands during the animation. This combined with the stagger talisman make the umbrella TIER ZERO in this game. 
~~~~~~~
-Shields and attires:
There are no shields this game but attires are the number one most underwhelming point. There are too few of them and they offer very little. They are mostly for fashion and i was hoping they could actually make-or-break full builds like for example in Elden Ring. Very disappointing the attires and their attributes
~~~~~~~
-Side/Main Characters:
I personally loved all characters i was presented with this game. Especially Sophia and Gepetto. There are very few characters in this game overall but that makes it even more commemorable and special once you complete their specific quests. Over all character design 10/10
~~~~~~~
-Items and various consumables
Nothing too out of the ordinary you have your hp flask, your anti-debuff flasks ... practically everything you expect the game to actually have and a few more for show. 
I loved the addition of the clock that teleports you to stargazers. I would have been actually tilted if that was not there considering how much you have to walk.

[i]Lies of P is a thrilling soulslike that takes the story of Pinocchio, turns it on its head, and sets it against the darkly elegant backdrop of the Belle Epoque era.[/i]

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story in Lies of P is really good, and I'm not going to spoil anything here. What I can say is that during the course of the story, you have to make choices several times whether to tell the truth or lie. There are different endings to certain characters' questlines, and different endings to the entire game, depending on how truthful or untruthful you have been. You can even miss the final boss if you choose the ""wrong"" choice at the end, so it might be a good idea to check that out beforehand.

[h3]The City of Krat[/h3]
The environment in Lies of P looks pretty much the same throughout the game. There are not really any memorable areas. If you compare to Dark Souls, each area is unique, and it is easy to remember these areas. In this game, the city of Krat is gray and dark, whether you run on the streets, on the rooftops, through apartments or through factories. Even parts when you run through forests and swamps, everything is very gray and dark.

[h3]Ergo & P-Organ[/h3]
In Lies of P you level up by spending Ergo (Souls), just like in Dark Souls or similar games. For each level, the number of Ergo needed to level up increases. The difference in this game compared to other games is that the increase is minimal. When I played NG+ I noticed that it increased by only 1 Ergo per lvl, which is nothing! It hasn't always been like that, but I noticed it around lvl 125 when it took about 16,000 Ergo to level up. Then after lvl 150+ it started increasing more again, but still not that much. There are only 6 stats to choose from when you level up, so you hit those softcaps very quickly and easy, too easy. These stats are:

[u]Vitality[/u] (Health, Defense & Guard Regain)
[u]Vigor[/u] (Stamina & Defense)
[u]Capacity[/u] (Weight Limit, Defense & Legion Bar)
[u]Motivity[/u] (Strength & Defense)
[u]Technique[/u] (Dexterity & Defense)
[u]Advance[/u] (Legion Bar, Legion Damage & Resistances).

There are no spells or magic in this game, so there aren't that many ways to go when it comes to spending your Ergo. Basically you go either Strength or Dexterity.

There is also another leveling system called P-Organ. P-Organ is a skill tree that features both passive and active abilities. You unlock these new abilities with the help of a special material called Quartz, that is available in limited quantities in each playthrough. The P-Organ skill tree consists of several phases, where you have to spend a certain number of Quartz in phase 1 to unlock phase 2, then it continues to phase 3, 4 and 5. Here you can increase the number of Pulse Cells (Main source of healing, like Estus Flask in Dark Souls), strengthen certain attacks, reduce the amount of stamina used for certain actions, etc. When you progress over to NG+, one more phase is unlocked, phase 6. NG++ unlocks phase 7, which is the cap. This increases the replayability of the game, which is great, because then you have something more to strive for while you play the questlines again to achieve different endings.

[h3]Enemies & Bosses[/h3]
The bosses are the funnest part of this game, no doubt about it. They are extremely well done in combination with how well done the combat is in this game. There is no Co-Op in this game, but you can summon a Specter to help you in almost every boss fight. The enemies are of good variety with varying attack patterns that you have to learn if you want to achieve Perfect Blocks.

[h3]Combat & Weapons[/h3]
In Lies of P you have your main weapon in your right hand, and your left hand is your Legion Arm, similar to Sekiro. There are different variants of this arm that you unlock as you progress the game and you can then switch between them. Each Legion arm can be upgraded with a special material that unlocks new abilities for that arm.

Experimenting with different weapons in Lies of P is a lot of fun, as you can build weapons yourself. You can take a handle from one weapon and put it together with the blade from another weapon. Basically, the handle is the source of scaling with different Stats and determines your move set, and the blade determines Base Damage and Damage Reduction while Guarding. There are more to this, but I'll leave it at that. There are also boss weapons that you cannot take apart and rebuild, they are simply as they are.

You also have something called Fable Art Attack. Each handle has its own Fable Art and each blade has its own Fable Art, which is something you also have to keep in mind when building your weapon. It's about finding the Fable Arts that you like.

There are no shields in Lies of P, instead you block with your weapon, called Guarding. When you block an enemy's attack, you take less damage, but you always take damage. Reduced damage while Guarding will be transferred to Guard Regain. Guard Regain allows the player to recover a portion of their health by attacking the enemy back, if you are fast enough, similar to Bloodborne. Each weapon differ in how good your Guard and Damage Reduction is. There's also Perfect Guard, which means you hit block just as the enemy's attack is about to land. Then you take no damage at all, plus it can be used offensively to interrupt an enemy attack, Stagger them, or even destroy their weapons. This is extremely satisfying and what makes this game extra fun. This Perfect Guard system is reminiscent of Sekiro as well.

[h2]The Verdict[/h2]
Lies of P is a perfect mix of Dark Souls, Sekiro and Bloodborne, and which at the same time does its own thing. This game exceeded my expectations. I think Lies of P is the best non-FromSoftware soulslike game out there right now. 9/10.",1702744835,1702894043,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The Pinocchio/puppet aesthetic I anticipated would wear on me and was what put me off the game most. However it was handled quite well and you get acclimated to it very quickly. The world building and story have that typical souls-y feel but manages to be its own thing and not merely another in a long line of copycats. That can be said for much of this game. It's familiar enough that you feel content playing it, but is unique enough that you aren't bored by familiarity.

A shorter experience, but rightly so considering the quality of the game design. Level design especially was handled masterfully; it was more linear than some in the genre but I actually consider that something of a boon to it,

My biggest gripe is that the ""strength"" (called motivity in this game) build seems just objectively stronger/easier to play than the ""dex"" build. Difficulty is also not that high, though some of the bosses are bound to give you some trouble, but that might vary depending on your build as just stated.

If you like souls-likes, give it a try, it's a more compact quality game in the genre to tide you over for more 'major' releases.",1702869816,1702869816,True,1,0,0.513489603996276855,0,True,False,False

This game is super fun, I love the parries in this game... especially the weapon-specific parries like the etiquette's and Two-dragon katana's parries. 
played the entirety of the game trying to perfect block and parry every enemies attacks including the bosses.

The sense of accomplishment from killing things by whittling them down through perfect blocks goes crazy, and the fact that not many things killed me through bs, [i] besides the occasional lag spike(might just be me) and the disruption effect (Dark souls has curse so fair game ig) [/i] , made the game incredibly fun.

The boss fights were definitely the highlight for me and the story was pretty Great! I even listened to all the music discs cuz of the lore.. 

all in all, Amazing game! 8/10, The only thing that made it miss the 10/10 was the incredible amount of lag i had playing it. . . again might just be me though so if you don't have this problem just assume i said 10/10

I wasn't really aware of this game when it was announced but my friend that really got into souls games found it by chance and told me to test the beta out . I wasn't very keen but i was optimistic . I played it as any other souls game quality build, fast weapon and prioritise dodging but i was shocked to see that it would be better to parry and get timings which was more rewarding . That simple force mechanic of having to most of the time to parry got me really intrigued to keep playing . 

After a while i forgot about it and then my friend told me it was a full release and after seeing some reviews how its like bloodborne and sekiro ( both games i love ) i just had to get it . 
If i had to say the design , the story , the characters where just amazing simple but good . It wasn't to long but not to short so i had something to do and enjoy . Its challenging but not extremely difficult ( i believe that there was no need to make the game easier )  . I would recommend this game but not for those who don't want to learn or play like puss*** ( throwables are just a bit to unbalanced ) . 

If i had to rank bosses : ( easiest to hardest 3 to 1 )
hardest 3. laxasia and black rabbit hood 2.0 , 2. Simon manus NG , 1. puppet king ( just because of the fire dance in second faze ) .

easiest 3. victor , 2. police officer , 1. parade master 

This game was called just another Souls game copy but i would say it was a good addition to the lineage as a amazing souls like game that wasn't made by from software .

Thank you Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio for making such a amazing game .

The positives and the negatives.

+ great story, further you get the more it captivates you.
+ smooth gameplay
+ no performance issues
+ interesting world and setting
+ good boss designs
+ weapons are very unique from each other and there are plenty
+ edit: very very good soundtrack.

- + Graphics do their part but if u compare this to LotF youll be a bit let down.
- + while the end bosses where cool the actual area was pretty dull, felt like it was added as a last second thing.

- no negatives

in overall this was a 9/10 game.
game got better and better the further in you got but the last area you are in was a bit of a let down. bosses where cool tho. the story telling and the smooth gameplay is what really made it great.

8/10 Combat

More forgiving than bloodborne. Enemy placement could be better spread. It makes killing small enemies a bit too easy. However the larger enemies have great move sets that keep you on your toes. Bosses are difficult but never unfair. And 2 phase bosses are always great. Tons of weapons and switching handles is a lot of fun. 

8/10 Enemy variety

Enemy variety is split between puppets, the infected, human enemies, and bosses. Id have liked to see a bit more puppet variety but the infected variety and the human enemy themes more than make up for it.

Setting 10/10

Absolutely gorgeous environments. Soundtrack is beautiful as well, and makes you actually want to collect more songs for the record player. Story is fantastic. My one complaint is gemini. He kinda just repeats whatever just happened, whatever note you just picked up, tells you stuff you already know, or just kinda word vomits. Shut up Gemini your just my lantern

10/10 would recommend, especially if you enjoyed Bloodborne

My first playthrough took just over 30 hours (I afk'd 2-3hrs and steam counts that). Be warned, Parrying is key - if you do not wish to practice it, you will likely struggle with this game.

The good:
TONS of interesting weapons to experiment with.
*I experimented with strength, dex, and elemental weapons, switching things up while learning boss move-sets.
Beautiful world with great shortcuts throughout to make exploration smoother.
Almost all of the bosses have a helper-summon for players whom are struggling.
Combat system is easy to learn, hard to master.
A few of the soundtracks were amazing.
Overall pacing and progression.


The bad:
A few boss run-backs were too long for no reason. Luckily this was only a small amount of occurrences.
Multi-phase bosses (I do not find it fun having to beat phase A to practice phase B, I find it disrespecting of the player's time, but that's just my opinion)
Sometimes the camera is a bigger threat than the boss you're facing. This is common in this genre and LoP is not an exception.

This game is the closest we have to Bloodborne on PC. 
- Character- and environmental designs are beautiful 
- Linear level design that gets a bit boring towards the end
- Handle and blade mechanic allows modification of weapon movesets. Finding the suitable moveset for a specific weapon is fun
- Combat pace is similar to Bloodborne, but the responsiveness is much better due to 60+ FPS. A Sekiro-like posture break mechanic rewards aggressive gameplay. Chain parries are viable and are accompanied by satisfying sparks and sound effects. Parry timing is a little bis less generous than in Sekiro. 
- Boss fights feel really good. Getting good is required and is rewarded with the joy of victory just like in a Fromsoft game. Hitboxes are almost always well-done. Some boss attacks could be telegraphed better. The boss fight soundtrack fits to the setting but is not exceptional

I've needed 34 hours for the first all bosses playthrough. I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys fast-paced combat and gitting gud.

Gameplay
 this is where Lies of P really surprised me to be honest. The combat looks very similar to other souls like on the surface but that hides a depth of design that really makes the game stand out. it borrows a lot of separate  elements and weaves them together in a gameplay system that never really has you taking for granted what you should be doing. From Sekiro the game takes a perfect parry, press the block button at just the right moment and you take no damage and put the enemy into a staggerable state. from blood borne we have the rally mechanic where you can attack back to regain lost health. however unlike bloodborne where you get hit and can regain health from the health lost. in Lies of P you block and then can attack to regain health lost. combined with the basic of i frame dodging and you have a plethera of moves on how to handle enemy attacks and the game doesn't discriminate what you should be using. wanna roll away from an enemy swinging like wild? go for it. wanna stand in the middle and perfect guard it all? exellent choice. wanna just stand there with your high damage absorbing sword and eat it? perfectly fine. the game really encourages you to find out what works for you. 

Story
Another pleasant surprise while nothing thats gonna win an award for best story Lies of P does a good job. getting you invested in its world, its characters, and more importantly its premise. the puppets you meet in Lies of P predominantly want to kill you. but along the way you find touching moments of humanity that give you pause. You will have Empathy for most characters and disdain for others. not all characters are equal in this but none of the characters feel like cardboard either. hell one of the most enthralling characters is a puppet. 

Level Design. 
Lies of P never quite reaches that level of interconnected world you would probably expect from a souls game. but thats not really a deal breaker for me. levels are fun to explore have a good amount of verticality to them that makes it all feel more real and the shortcut game is on point. but the levels are just that Levels incredibly well designed levels though. 

Enemy Variety 
Honestly really nice and on point while the beginning levels of the game keep the enemy design mostly samey its not long at all before the game starts introducing new enemies and it pretty much never stops.
im serious a new enemy type will appear maybe every level to two levels. the game gets an A+ for enemy design

Length
I'm not gonna lie (probably) I kept expecting lies of P to end. like 3 times i would think Okay thats the last fight what a nice game really had a lot of fun and... oh its still going SWEET. and thats the important thing i never wanted lies of P to end. i just thought that surely thats what would be coming up at this point right? and when the game didn't it was always a pleasant suprise. Guys i got 30 hours on this game. Thats with Zero grinding, a normal amount of exploring and except for a couple exceptions doing most bosses on my second and 3rd tries. 

Conclusion
Lies of P is wonderful and unfortunately much like the first dark souls game something of a sleeper hit. those who have played the game all seem to agree on the level of quality and care put into every aspect of this game especially the combat. so buy the game and tell your friends about it!",1702735527,1702735527,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The soundtrack is amazing.
-Wow, there's actually a nice story here. The NPC side quests are simple but emotional.
-Weapon customization lets you create a unique playstyle, the legion arm adds a new way to approach combat, and boss weapons have their own gimmicks to make up for not letting you customize. Lastly, the P-Organ adds another way of customizing P's abilities/gameplay.

As a fan of pretty much any ""soulsborne"" game this sits up there as probably the best non-From Software take on the genre.

You're allowed to beat the game (mostly) however you want. You can 'Perfect Guard' every encounter, dodge every enemy attack, or do a mixture of both whenever you see fit. Typically, there are better approaches to every fight, but the game will meet you on your own terms and give you the freedom to choose how you tackle it. You're allowed to build any weapon you want by combining different blades with different handles or use any special boss weapon from the various fights throughout the game. If you want to stick a giant wrench to the end of a dagger handle, you can. If you want to put a greatsword blade on a rapier hilt, you can. This simple tweak to a standard weapon selection system adds so much variety between every playthrough and every person's experience with the game.

You'll encounter several boss fights over your 30-hour playthrough of the game. Most of them are good, if not great, while a few of them not so much. Bosses are incredibly aggressive, but readable and reactable, say for a few 'Fury Attacks' which require memorization in timing as opposed to testing of reactions. I was actually surprised to see how many fantastic fights this game offers. There are several bosses I would understand seeing at the top of someone's favorite Lies of P boss list. The game is also a lot harder than I was expecting with several bosses taking over an hour, sometimes up to 3, to beat. 

Another thing to note is the game's story. I won't be giving any summary here, but I'm surprised at how invested I actually was in the characters and story surrounding them. It's a refreshing change to see a game in this genre with such a defined and explicit narrative. There were more than a few characters I grew to genuinely really like and feel for. Complementing the story is the great soundtrack through the game. This includes boss themes, as well as the vinyls you can obtain and play in the Hotel hub area. The songs used give the desolate and depressing world so much more life and context. The world of Lies of P is beautiful and feels lived-in and overrun by the puppets and corrupted roaming about. It could have done better with more impurities in the objects around the levels and architecture, but that's more of a nitpick than anything.

The game isn't perfect, however. It falters towards the end and stumbles in it's final act. After [spoiler]Laxasia[/spoiler] , you feel like you're closing in on the finale, but then it sort of just continues for a bit too long before the actual end of the game. The reason I take issue with this area is because up until this point the game has done an incredible job at making every location feel fresh with new or remixed enemy types, level design, and area visuals. But this final stretch feels like a retread of the last few areas without enough of a difference to warrant being included. You could argue that this serves as a sort of down-time before the final fight, but the enemies here are just as aggressive as usual and you'll probably end up running past all of them at this point.

All in all, Lies of P is one of the biggest sleeper hits in recent memory and surpassed the expectations I had for it by a  long shot. It's one of the best 'Soulslike' games I've had the privilege of playing, and I'm incredibly excited to see the upcoming DLC and whatever next game comes from this series.",1702724065,1702724660,True,156,2,0.888087451457977295,0,True,False,False

Lies of P is a wonderful game that experiments with the souls-like layout, sometimes to its detriment. If you were told this game is bloodborne or sekiro you will be disappointed, but it would not be lies of P if it were more like either. Definitely worth full price if you love the formula, Lies of P is a gold standard of what a FromSoft-like can be.

PROS:
A robust combat system that almost demands you interact with every part of it at some point.
Weapon heads changing the animation speed of your attacks offers more trade off's beyond simple stat changes.
A decidedly FromSoft inspired world that feels gently caressed by Miyazaki's blood-soaked hands.
Beautiful Visuals from character models and environmental effects.
Set piece boss fights with tight parry times and uniquely tricky enemy movesets due to most enemies being robotic.
Quality sound design, and solid voice acting that brings feeling and energy not usually seen in FromSoft games.
CONS:
Denuvo. There is no PVP, why is there anti-tamper? There should not be anti-tamper.
Weapon customization starts and ends at Head + Hilt + Crank, which feels less than it should even though it's technically more than dark souls.
Many weapon combinations, although humorous to look at, are not practical and some whole weapons feel like filler.
Despite bloodborne being its most obvious inspiration; weapon movesets have heavy animation commitment and strong enemy tracking once again makes aggressive play and dodging attacks feel punished. Weapons overall never fill enough situations to feel complete like every weapon from that game.
Weapon durability makes another case as to why it's a bad idea in a souls-like, A unique idea was had in special grindstones but the, again, bloodborne levels of speed sometimes makes even running low on durability a death sentence.
The ability to chain dodges, dodge after performing certain actions, and other abilities that should be base mechanics, are locked behind progression and fairly deep in said progression.",1702703832,1702703832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR, it's just kind of boring with a series of decisions that were ALMOST good. 

Visually, and audibly, the game is wonderful. There are spots in this game that had me stop and stare, something guaranteed for me to do in a From Soft game. Everything else about this game feels like a series of decisions that were ALMOST great, but fell into the hole of mediocrity. And I hate to immediately compare this game to a From Software title, but that's what this game is trying to imitate. 

It saddens me to say that the balancing of this game is all over the place. Your character doesn't feel nearly fast enough to parry or counter or dodge attacks from enemies whose attacks are quite fast. Enemies hit for quite a lot of health, and nothing felt particularly ""challenging"" on a skill based level, more on a ""gank"" based level. It gives me Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin vibes if you can picture what I mean. Something just feels off with the execution. 

Of course, I am aware I don't have too many hours logged into this game, but if you're the ""Trust me bro, it gets good at the ten hour mark."" you've been brainwashed. Entertainment needs a ""hook"" at the beginning to keep an audience engaged, after all, and if I'm not having fun because your game is boring, that's not on me. 

That brings me to my next point, how boring the game is. Story wise, you know what's happening but you just don't feel invested. This was more like ""Go to the hotel and I'll tell you what's good."" Then you get there and you get ""Now go and do this thing."" There's no motivations, no particularly interesting characters. You just get a mound of information, and you're expecting to find things interesting with what little they've given you to chew on. 

Finally, and the worst thing for me, everything you do in this game is inconvenient. Save points are either too close or far too separated, which leads to a lot of runs where the enemies you caught the attention of will follow you to where you last died. Then, of course, there's the fact that you HAVE to travel back to the blue chick to level up. From Soft moved on from that design with Elden Ring. It's annoying and makes the game more of a chore than it is fun. The design feels old, nothing new has been added, just designs from From Soft titles bundled into one package.",1702692992,1702692992,False,3,0,0.478985399007797241,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed the atmosphere and graphical quality, similar to bloodborne but better quality.  The story line was really good, intriguing yet fairly simple, I liked that it didst try and over complicate things. 
Loved the mechanics, the mix and match of weapons was inspired and although its not a fully customisable character there was enough that you could (and in some cases had to) adapt for different play styles.

it definitely felt souls-like but with enough new ideas to be a great game on its own. Loved it up until teh last chapter - I wont dwell on that, but it sucked a lot of the joy out of the experience for me. I dnt mind hard games but make them fair, and if you put a mechanic in, make sure it works consistently. Blocking, using the Aegis and perfect guard are random
lessons for the Devs is to stay true to the story and the game you have created rather than attempting to ""change it up"" to create a cool ending - it didn't work.

Just like other souls-like when you are exploring the game(non boss-fight areas), there will be no music. So, it really is up to the sounds of the environment/enemies that must create the atmosphere. <Some spoilers ahead> There is an area of the game where your character is in a train station platform. All the enemies here affect the character with decay. It's dark and you will be able to hear the sounds the enemies make, the sounds of the air blowing, the echoes of your footsteps all amplified by the cold. It's eerie yet beautifully crafted. I was just in awe of this game especially during that level.

When I first heard of this game last year I was intrigued; curious to see how the devs would make a souls game based around puppets and lordie, was I impressed. I played the demo when it was released several months before release and the feedback the devs got they took to heart because when this game officially dropped it was like a bomb. They improved the gameplay and mechanics from the demo drastically and unlike a lot of the AAA games that were released this year on PC, the devs made damn sure that it worked first day and any issues got ironed out immediately. I am a loyal fan for life with these devs as they obviously care about their customers. As far as gameplay, it has become one of my favorite souls games ever. The unlimited ways you can customize your run is insane and they even allow you to make your own weapon by dismantling handles and blades from weapons you find and combining them with each other to make interesting and new combinations. The game ran like butter and I loved every single level, boss, NPC.....everything. The bosses were challenging, especially up to NG+2 and I tried a different build for every run making the consecutive runs for the Platinum achievement fun and not repetitive.

It very much feels like a mix of Bloodborne and Sekiro, but it brings a TON of original additions that elevate the gameplay to maybe even above what it is inspired by.

 The game is very much linear and mostly only focused on the combat, but what incredible tools they gave us to engage with that combat system. Finding new weapons that do not work with your current/desired build or playstyle doesn't immediately make them worthless because of the blade-handle swapping. And the weapons also all feel unique and badass in their own way with a different moveset or Fable art to try out. I ran a full Technique (DEX) build with unaltered weapons for most of the game until I found a Motivity (STR) blade that perfectly fit with the weapon fantasy I wanted and I didn't even have to respec any stats to use it!

 Despite its considerable length my first playthrough did not feel like a drag at all. The level designs are sometimes very straightforward and I didn't have a lot of wow-moments when it comes to loop-arounds or shortcuts, but they did show that they know what makes a good level. There are ample opportunities to catch a breather and there is a good amount of variety in platforming and themes. No location feels like it overstays its welcome and there are no horrendous design moments or incredible long run-backs. This is also complemented by the large array of enemy designs. They are unique and memorable, and feel logical for their point in a playthrough. The developers didn't just copy-paste the enemies to later parts of the game with the only difference being inflated stats.

 The soundtrack is wild (especially those records are amazing), the animations of enemies/bosses and your own moves are clean and readable, and the art and setting are downright beautiful. Honestly where did these guys come from to make such a good game in this genre?!

That being said, there is one aspect that I can comment on that I feel is left mostly unsaid; the symbology and themes bizarrely match Elden Ring's in some major ways, which I find amazing considering what must have been overlapping development periods. Now I know even ER's symbology is derivative of christianity and other world religions, as is the case with most souls games, but it is the way those are implemented that is so similar between both games. I wont got into detail, as it is lore/spoiler heavy, but if you are learned in the occult, alchemy, and religious symbology, as well as the lore of ER, it should be apparent to you that the Lies of P devs directly took, but also surprisingly deeply understood some themes and symbology from ER after it's release.  Considering this, I feel Lie of P is basically a linear companion piece to Elden Ring; the experience you will have with each enriches what you will take from the other.

I would recommend it to any souls fan; pretty much a must play.

Hallways are getting too narrow? better off switching to a smaller weapon for now, enemies on this area are too fast? modify your weapon to a better suited combination, the game has so many options for you it can feel overwhelming some times, and that's without considering the extra layer of possibilities when including the different legion arms with their own abilities and character traits.

Adapt your play style, experiment with different weapon combinations, use your consumables!

One of the absolute best titles to make use of souls-like mechanics out there; the game is absolutely gorgeous, they really went all the way with the attention to details, a beautiful looking game from start to finish. 
One of the best level design I've experienced, not only visually but also making Krat a joy to traverse; its unlikely you will ever feel the need to rush through an area first time exploring and shortcuts are conveniently well placed. 
Tons of unique and variant enemies with their own combat patterns, also the enemy placement is excellent, with enough surprises here and there, but never punishingly unfair.

PROS

1) Game fixes all the flaws that usual souls-bornes are not fixing, and there is a lot of them. Firstly, it's the camera. I have never complained during my previous two playthroughs about the camera, maybe it's the design of world, or just the pace of this game allows you to avoid such situations where you die stupidly, but the camera never betrays you during mass fights, which means there is a fair chances for you to survive the encounter

2) Finally the developers realized that the souls(ergo) in the boss rooms should be left outside the boss arena, because sometimes it's really frustrating, when you reached a good amounts of ergo, and then surprisingly appear in the boss room and just can't get these souls back. It was infuriating in previous souls series games, but not there, which means you can fairly reorganize your spendings and inventory after the fight

3) Intuitively understandable system of shortcuts and levels. The problems with Dark Souls 1 was that despite having an interesting level-design and rich amounts of secrets inside them, it never was undestandable for you, which meant that when you approach certain level, bu going further, you increase the risks to forget where must you go after you die. Considering the vast size of a Dark Souls 1, it was really hard to track your destination, and you can even enter the area for a levels too high for you, which meant you can be stuck in the areas like TOmb of the Giants if you approach this place without the lordvessel

It's not the same story for Lies of P, despite having a linear Level Design, it still preserves an interest in player to research the areas while making it easier for them to find the necessary shortcut = it is really clever, because this game is already difficult enough to compare itself with sekiro, and the understandable shortcuts will save the player their time and nerves, and make it interesting for them to observe the area's secrets

4) Optimization. Damn it, never have i questioned my sanity when i looked at the FPS tracker between LoP and DS Remastered and noticed how smoothly and quickier the optimization in this game works in compare to DS1, which was released in 2018, 5 years before LoP damnit. And it still works better than Elden Ring or Sekiro, they also had problems with FPS

5) Combat system. Honestly, i was quite surprised, while waiting for the PC version of the bloodborne to receive the child of Bloodborne and Sekiro, where i will indulge myself in Parry mechanics, which was fun to study. Having a fast paced and smooth gameplay during fight and boss-fights, it creates an aesthetic pleasure to make certain moves and combos with prosthesis and weapon during boss fights. This combat system is far better than of the Elden Ring or Sekiro, because it is more versatile and allows you to experiment a lot, which allows players to make their own builds and styles to beat this game. It really is fun, and i take it as a really fun part of it.

CONS:

Despite being a polished and calculated perfectly masterpiece, some parts of the game still have a problems. The first is:
1) Movesets of bosses and mobs. I noticed, that compare to ER or Sekiro, where the attacks of bosses are easy to block because of their smooth pattern, the pattern of bosses in LoP are way smaller and faster in compare to them. It ,eans that when we have a preparation before the attack and the attack itself, we see that the attack of the mobs are almost immediate, which makes it really hard to react in time when we need to block some attacks. The visual hints are also not intuitively understandable, which means when you are trying to teach yourself to block some attacks of cetrain enemies, it becomes easier to learn the time pattern of the attack, rather than the visual hints, because they are too quick and small to notice at the first time, so parry is quite hard in this game and you need to spend a heft amounts of time to nail it

2) Dodge system. The numbers of i-frames of the dodge are too small, which means that you can't rely only on dodging in certain times, and even if you are doing dodging well, there is a problem of the wide swinging attacks of the bosses. Which means that you can probably dodge one attack, but the second will reach you soon after. And it happens almost everywhere in this game, when the attack of mod will have a wide range or the demi-boss have a vast combo, you just can't dodge in time after the first dodge

That is all the problems and Pros that i've noticed whileplaying this game. And honestly, in compare to the previous souls-likes LoP is like a jewel, and coming back to ER or DS 3 after LoP was quite hard, which meant that the quality set by this game is better than the standard Fromsofts made before.

It tries to be a souls game while having its own puppet story and universe, but I feel a sense of contradiction or imbalance since I started. 

The game tries to mix Sekiro's perfect block system and prosthetic with slow attack by attack pacing of dark souls series, but this does not work. Sekiro's pacing is very fast. Swing is fast and recovery is also very fast and windows are tight. Failing to block does not cause health penalty. Dark souls' pacing is relatively slow and encourage cautious act but fail to block also not cause health penalty. In Lies of P, fail to block reduces health and perfect block requires pin-point timing. Attack actions, like Dark souls, is slow and clunky. The pacing in Lies of P is rather awkward and confusing for me. I tried to dodge but walking away is more efficient. I tried to block but my health just keep going down and no way I can perfect block 100%. HP recovery from guard recovery is not nearly enough to cover the reduced HP of imperfect guard. Sekiro's perfect block system is difficult pull off here as it is much slower than in Sekiro. I would need to stop my attack and pay attention and time and block and hope the block is perfect. With the same time cost, I'd rather just walk away and keep my distance. No need to block and guarantee no HP reduction.

No mini-map. Scenery is not very catching for me. Action is less polished than a FromSoftware game. Overall quality is expectedly less than that of FromSoftware game and It felt too much like souls game. The maiden, the bonfire I would just play a souls game. The field of view is short and the camera keep looking down.

I recognize that there are some original idea. The puppet, the story and universe, the weapon assembly system. I like those elements but they are not necessarily bound to the souls' like gameplay. I would prefer it to be a more Devil may cry style or full Sekiro style or any other style that are relatively fast paced and less punishing to failure than the typical Souls' slow, cautious and punishing gameplay. For a story rich game, the slow paced gameplay is very distracting.

Try on sale, but not recommended for full price.

The vibe, story, characters and locations are all wonderful. The music is truly amazing, and the boss fights are - for the most part - fun and challenging. 

The system of letting you deconstruct weapons into blade and hilt and recombining them is so cool, and gives each playthrough even more variety. It's a shame that boss weapons can't be deconstructed though - seems like a missed opportunity. 

Also having armor being only cosmetic is nice, because you can just wear what you think looks cool. Though that also leads to the actual defensive gear being very cookie-cutter - just the same thing, better stats, more weight. Oh well, that's a minor gripe.

It is very linear, but I didn't mind that, because the levels are designed really well and shortcuts are frequent and still give that ""Oh, I'm here!"" feeling. But I would like for them to experiment with a more interconnected world in the sequel.

The following is just what came to mind in the little time I set aside for this recommendation. I want to clarify again before starting that I love this game to bits, and I hope it only gets better from here on.

[h3]Pros[/h3]

The intro cutscene right after the name drop. It absolutely slaps.

Combat feels focused and tight, which is something missing from several souls-likes. Unlike Sekiro though, you cannot feint an attack into a block in the startup frames, so you have to find openings and fully commit to either offense or defense (I totally did not learn this the hard way)

The ""bock to rally"" is perfect, and the duration the rally stays makes it a viable defensive option that requires CAREFULLY EXECUTED OFFENSE to fully capitalize, as getting hit by any attack will remove the entire rally pool. This is a welcome change from ""unga-bunga go"" moments with Bloodborne's rally system, as it forces focused play.

Getting a heal item back by playing well delivers moments with rushes of adrenaline you wouldn't think were possible from sitting on a chair and starting at a screen.

*Weapon variety is insane, but I feel it kind of shoots itself in the heel by introducing special boss weapons, that are pretty much better in terms of raw power, and come with unmatched flair. Still, for people that stick to non-boss weapons, the playground here is huge, if somewhat limited by the decrease in power introduced by putting a blade meant for a specific type of damage like striking on top of a handle meant for another type of damage like stabbing. Case in point, a hammer on top of a rapier handle. This makes sense, obviously, but it does limit what you can do with the system.

Narrative pacing is great. The atmosphere and story is intriguing, and the theme of ""awakening"" is presented very interestingly. The game's endings feel complete, but open many doors to follow which I hope the devs do later on. I won't spoil with examples, but if you like Isaac Asimov's works or other media around such themes, you are very likely to appreciate this game's presentation.

NPCs storylines are good (except Belle) - you grow to care for them. I genuinely panicked at a certain moment in a certain Chapter, and that speaks to the quality of the voice acting and character work that went into this game.

[h3]Non-Pros, Non-Cons[/h3]

World is linear, but honestly whether you like it or not is completely subjective. I was okay with it, but I know that some might not be, so I am putting this in neutral.

Would like a few more interesting side quests. However, the game does take place over two game days and nights, and since the side quests we do get are fairly nice (again except Belle), I chalk this up to a design decision and therefore neutral.

P isn't voiced. Again, this feels like a design decision for a studio dipping its feet for the first time in a very intimidating pool of games, and personally not a dealbreaker for me. Multiple endings probably makes it really hard to decide how the character should be voiced based on various branching decisions up until that point. So, I would rather not have a voiced character than have one poorly done.

[spoiler]If time turns back when P dies, how is it that choices made from the last moment of rest to the moment of death aren't undone? It doesn't make sense, unless time manipulation is exclusive to the subject like Inoue's powers from Bleach. I don't recall this ever being explained, and it's a little nitpick I have with the game.[/spoiler]

[h3]Cons(?)[/h3]

The depth of weapon move sets feels a little lacking. What we get works fine, and this is primarily a personal feeling for me as even FromSoftware haven't really tried it, but I would LOVE to see some take on feinting attacks to force enemy reactions. I would additionally like to see the ability to chain lights into heavies, and heavies into lights with specific attacks for these transitions.

The lips move, but don't seem synced (English). Again, this is not what the game's focus is on and so it classifies as a nitpick, but it would be nice to see some more animation work on the narrative end of things in general.

Belle's character literally does nothing, so I am hoping we get to do something in the DLC.

*I want to stress that despite my problems with weapon assembly, I put it as a positive because the concept is quite good, and I would love to see it fleshed out further, e.g., by introducing weapon type as category rather than damage type. This would preserve realism. For example, if there is a sword category, one of them should have a moveset that primarily utilizes slashing, another that primarily utilizes stabbing, one that uses half-swording or so with some strike attacks from the hilt, and one that is balanced in all respects. Something like this might work, and would suit all playstyles. But, it takes a crap ton of work and research, so this is merely a suggestion.

[h1]Final Remarks[/h1]

I personally am not sold on DnD and turn-based combat, so while I appreciate Baldur's Gate 3 getting so much praise, and I have no doubts the praise is rightfully targeted, I argue that Lies of P does the same for the general souls-like genre. Soulsborne and souls-likes are some of my favorite things in life, and all things considered, Lies of P frankly delivers an experience so familiar and yet so memorable that I am happy to consider it not just a souls-like, but a fleshed out Soulsborne game in its own right. I was hoping it would win an award so as to get it more recognition, but oh well, it got nominated at least. It's my personal GOTY :)

I also want to spend more time playing it, but honestly am just too busy to do so. However, I look forward to getting all the achievements, the DLC and the sequels the developers have promised, and I wish them best of luck in topping their own miracle.",1702488290,1702488525,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also pleasantly surprised by good mob variety as the game progresses, especially when different mob types melded together and gained extended move sets.

I finished all runs with the Boss Weapon from the Factory Boss -- it's basically blade of the blasphemous from ER with a handle parry. The handle parry (which can be found on some other handles) can break boss combo (yes, including laxasia, manus, and even the nameless doll), trivializing each encounter to a few tries as long as you mastered it once you acquired it.

The fights weren't too hard or too easy, of course some fights were easier than others but there was always a good balance. If you are looking for easier boss fights as well, you could always summon a phantom to help deal damage to the boss and take aggro. Finally, the way weapons work in this game is perfect as well.

Welcome to the only developers who took a fantasy game with the terrible battle system of Dark-souls theme which whoever likes must be shot immediately and ACTUALLY made a phenomenal masterpiece without ruining it with woke. The game is based on Pinocchio who is trying to stop the puppet frenzy who has turned on the humans and started to massacre everyone. This is totally not the plot to “I Robot” but I like it.

Pros:

Story: Hands down the script that was written for the story was beyond unbelievable, with every chapter the game got better. This game left me in suspense in wanting to find out more. The details they put into the characters, the ways you react to certain events, the choices you can choose to make to alter the entire story will leave you wanting to replay the game again. 

Characters:

A Wonderful job in keeping the Character all the same to the children's book, whilst introducing more into the game. I found that the more you dig into the characters' past the darker the story got, which I thought was more fascinating considering the major plot twists.

Battle-System:

I will put this in for all you masochistic Dark-souls smash your heads against the wall to feel any emotion (over-exaggerating I love you all). Yes the battle system is to be patient and time your block. Whilst doing more forward rolls then the entire Olympic Gymnastic team because that is how realistic fighting is done. Please try this in real life and see what happens <3.

Cons:

Battle-system:

I will put this as a Pro and Con, only because not everyone likes having to focus and be patient in timing your strikes. I miss the old hack and slash like Devil May cry, where you only had to dodge once or twice and move around. I hate this only because when you are exhausted from working all day, you want to play games like this to find out the story you end up dying so many times to the point the game no longer becomes fun. I gave up after completing it once and lost all interest and youtube the other two endings because I no longer wanted to put myself through all that hell again. 

For those who want to just play it for the story. You enjoy the experience of the wonderful storyline of Lies of P, it truly does ruin the gaming experience. 

Overall:

This game I would give it 7.5/10. I truly loved the Story, The plot twist at the end made it worth completing and made my jaw drop. The game truly flourished in this beauty and artwork. It’s upsetting that I can’t give the game a 10/10 only because of the battle system. I wanted to enjoy the game to its fullest but constantly having to dodge and slash and die really put a downer on it. I highly recommend for those that don’t like Dark-soul themed games, just watch some pros on youtube for the story, it’s worth every second and not worth the pain and suffering.

Peace out all and hope you enjoy it.",1702416788,1702416788,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

First things first, I find this to be much easier compared to Sekiro, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring. This is because parrying, dodging, and blocking are all viable strategies which may be used either in conjunction with each other or by themselves in the course of a boss fight. The health regen from damage taken while blocking is also very generous. Of course, do not expect to breeze through the bosses, they aren't easy. However, they are very learnable, and so long as you go into a fight first with a view to learning/understanding/memorising the patterns and tells before starting to do any damage to the boss, you will get along just fine. When all else fails, I'd say that the summon you get for each boss encounter practically trivialises the boss because of how tanky the summon is. 

You will also have a wide variety of weapon combinations to experiment with to suit your playstyle. So far I've found that the policeman's baton handle with the saw toothed blade work extremely well together, outputting greatsword-like damage with the speed of a medium weapon, but that's just one of many viable sets that you could use in your playthrough. 

With that out of the way, the game is absolutely gorgeous and each new area (of which there are 11 all in) are unique in their design and art style. Game also runs flawlessly on my RTX 2080 with everything on high @ 120fps with dips down to 110-ish on the very very rare occasion which I notice only because I've got the FPS counter in my peripheral vision.

It clearly takes inspiration from both Bloodborne and Sekiro in its combat systems, with a bit of Dark Souls 3/Elden Ring weapon skills added in for flare. It distinguishes itself from From Software's work by being much more upfront with it's storytelling, allowing most players to grasp the details of the world more easily. It's greatest flaw is that there is a relative lack of build diversity as, after the second boss, weapons can be customized in such a way that where you place your stat investment is significantly less important. The P-Organ System helps with this slightly, but not by much. There is also a relatively low stat soft-cap for both your damage and health stats, after which point leveling up can feel less and less impactful. In short, this game suffers from a sharp drop off in replayability.

After enjoying my time with the game, I completed Sekiro (a masterpiece) and about half of Elden Ring (a game which I did not have a good time with and probably deserves its own review at some point down the road). Before moving on to Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, or a Dark Souls III replay, I decided to move off the beaten path and check out Lies of P. I am happy to say that Lies of P offers some of the best that a Souls-like has offered thus far.

Lies of P uses a combat system that employs a mix of other Souls-like games, taking the dodging and rolling from Dark Souls and combining it with the ""perfect parrying"" system of Sekiro. This blend of combat keeps fights feeling urgent while also leaving a lot of choice up to the player as to how they beat certain bosses. Getting a feel for a boss's attacks? Perfect parry them until you break their weapon, negating most of the damage they give out. Finding it hard to learn timing for said attacks? Dodge around them to get behind the boss and sneak attacks in. Even if not every boss is amazing, the combat system feels great and keeps you engaged throughout.

Aesthetically, Lies of P is also a huge success. Using the Pinocchio fairy tale as a barebones framework, the devs construct a world that blends steampunk influence with corruption, zombie-like creature design. The overlap between these two, especially in the latter half of the game, is striking. These gorgeous visuals combine with a lush soundtrack in a really masterful way.

My major gripes with Lies of P are mostly found in the third act of the game, and largely have to do with an overreliance on status effect encounters. Balancing in a Souls-like context is tough, and oftentimes devs have to ride a very fine line between satisfying challenge and frustrating challenge. Unfortunately, the amount of enemies (both bosses and normal enemies) in the final third of the game that inflict obnoxious status effects on you is staggering. These status effects range from decaying your weapon faster to just killing you immediately. They are easily the worst the game has to offer, which may be a positive thing in a game full of stuff to love.

The boss quality in Lies of P is great overall. Although the game has its fair share of your average beast-like Souls bosses, there are some pretty stellar fights scattered throughout that feel like fast duels which really force you to learn there moves. One in particular, Laxasia the Complete, is perhaps one of the best fights in a Souls game period. The feeling of slowly learning her attacks and chipping away at her until you finally best her calls to mind many of the best encounters in Sekiro, which is some of the highest praise I could offer a game of this caliber.

All in all, Lies of P is a very good Souls-like that makes improvements not yet incorporated even by Fromsoft. I look forward to the DLC for Lies of P, as well as the other games they make down the road. If you are at all interested in Souls-likes, you would do well to check out Lies of P..",1702334840,1702334840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Art style is also awesome; like a marriage of Bioshock's art deco with Victorian steam punk, Lovecraftian horror. I don't know how the designers made a bunch of really disparate ideas and themes come together so fluidly with a Pinocchio story in a Souls-like game, but it's phenomenally done and absolutely scratches the twink-murder itch finishing a souls game leaves in your heart.

Edit: Played about 20hr more of it and I still love it. 

@Devs: Major QOL improvement could be made on the P-Organ screen making the select system free-move with the joystick instead of grid/cell-based. It's really clunky and awful to navigate as it is.

Edit again: I'm to end game bosses/areas and the way they managed difficulty gets cheap. It's the trap many Souls games fall into where instead of making bosses require consistent, great skills, they just let the bosses cheat. Whether that's making them meatshields, energizer stamina bunnies, impenetrable poise, or whatever, it's lame and cheap and having to constantly cheese minibosses (because you sneeze and there's a miniboss/elite at the end), it's putting a negative slant on a game that's been so incredible up until this point.",1700969012,1702331172,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

(Score and summary at the bottom)

I want to preface this review by saying that before I played Lies of P, I have never finished, or even made it to a boss of any of the other Soulsborne games I tried. I played the beginning of Bloodborne at a friend's place a few years ago and got destroyed for a few hours without making it to a boss though had fun learning the game, and I also own the ps3 version of Demon's Souls, which I stopped playing really early on as well, and after having finished Lies of P, I'd love to revisit at some point.

I'm a bit of a literature guy and love games that tell darker retellings of classic literature (if you haven't played Alice Madness Returns, 100% recommend that game) so seeing this game retell the story of Pinocchio, it caught my attention, even with many reviews stating this game is harder than any other Soulsborne they had played.

The story for this game is so interesting, with a memorable cast of characters that you truly start to care about as you progress through the game. Each character brings something to the table, and also subtly hint at information that'll make more sense later on. The tragic world presented here is top tier and the environmental story telling is some of the best I have seen.

Now for the meat of the game, the gameplay. I've heard Lies of P described as Sekiro and Bloodborne combined and having watched videos of Bloodborne, and picking up and finishing Sekiro after finishing Lies of P, I think that's a fair description of the game. This game is brutally hard and the best advice I can give is be patient. Because the devs are evil and made most of the enemies puppets, the arms on swings will wind up 4 or 5 times and then just snap onto you. Enemies will constantly fake you out, delay attacks, attack much sooner or later than you'll expect, the variety of encounters in this game is fantastic and makes every new area you explore so much fun. I don't wanna spoil encounters for those who want to enter the game blind, but I'd say the challenge in this game for veterans of the Souls-like genre is that NEOWIZ knows how you like to play and they basically give you the finger. I actually think me entering this game with no experience in the genre helped because I didn't have a set play style and habits for tackling games like this, so ironically, a game that challenges the most hardened Soulsborne players may be easier for folks who are new to the genre! Though having picked up Dark Souls 1 after finishing Lies of P and Sekiro, it saddens me that the ""parry everything"" strat isn't nearly as viable in DS1 so in a way I ended up developing habits that'll make Dark Souls even harder for my first time playing which will be interesting to see as I progress that game further!

The music in this game is absolutely beautiful and the use of vinyls in the hotel to help Pinocchio gain his humanity is such an interesting way to use music in a game. Also the use of lying throughout the game makes for interesting story beats as well. It's established early in the game that puppets cannot lie, Pinocchio being the exception, and I enjoy this different take on the classic story since [spoiler] the game equates being truthful with being a puppet, whereas lying is being human. Painting this picture that there's nothing more human than to deceive, to tell a lie. Even the death screen in the game (which you will die a lot playing this game and ever Souls-like needs an iconic death screen) with the phrase ""Lie or Die"" hints at the fact that lying is humanity. I love the use of this, it's like the game's way of saying that to be truthful is to obey, is to be a puppet. Whereas lying is to think for yourself, to rebel, to be a human. Which also adds to the character of Geppetto who constantly says that Pinocchio needs to be a ""good boy"" and always tell the truth. I love the way the game subtly hints that Geppetto is just trying to manipulate Pinocchio, and later in the game Pinocchio becomes the puppeteer. When Geppetto asks if you trust him, you already know damning information about Geppetto, so if you pick yes, Geppetto believes you since he's convinced you're still a ""good boy"", but in reality, that answer is a lie. [/spoiler]

I know I put spoilers over the last paragraph, and if you haven't played this game, I highly encourage you to enter this experience as blind as you can in regards to story, because this is one of the best I have seen in a long time.

Lies of P is going to get a 10/10 and I am extremely picky with scores, but even with a few minor flaws like back stabbing being a bit finicky, Lies of P is one of the best games I have ever played and I loved it so much I immediately started playing Sekiro Shadows Die Twice and finished it. If you have the patience to learn this game's systems, you'll find probably the best Souls-like game not made by Fromsoft, I'd argue Lies of P may actually be better than some of the Fromsoft games.

Absolutely fantastic game. Best non FromSoft Souls game I have played and it isn't close. Excellent combat, great story, fun bosses and ran great on my Steam Deck. Motivity Build and Sword of the Holy Ark >>

Didn't find it near as hard as many seemed to make it to be. Loved the mix of systems on display, the guard regain and the legion abilities took the best from Bloodborne/Sekiro and mixed it very well.

Unlike a lot of souls games, this game is generous with upgrading materials , so the player can use different weapons throughout the game.

The one downside to this game compared to fromsoft games is it is a bit too linear, there isn't a lot of side content to fill in the gaps, exploration most of the time is straight forward, not many secrets lying around.

Things that should be easy are made unnecessarily difficult to create the illusion of challenge. Things that should be simple are made unnecessarily complicated to create the illusion of sophistication. A great reminder of why hack 'n slash is a fairly niche product.

Movement is incredibly stilted and jerky. Maybe this improves as the character develops or maybe it's part of the silly puppet conceit. Either way, I'm finding myself persevering rather than enjoying. I'm playing out of frustration and drive to beat this stupid game rather than revelling in a new world or basking in a sense of satisfaction. This game seems to be 90% about mastering the control system and 10% making your way through the world. I'd like those proportions switched around.

The story so far is confused and completely idiotic. I have no idea what the ""lying"" metaphor is supposed to contribute other than adding even more pretentiousness. This game does not need more conceit. It has plenty without the cryptic, apparently meaningless, figurative plot device.

The American accents of the voice actors in an Italian story with a Victorian London-ish setting are so tacky and tasteless. Every time I hear California drawl coming from a supposed East-End street rat, it jars me back to reality. The soundtrack overall is nothing special and the music is AWFUL and I cannot get any sort of respectable surround sound happening.

The combat is still very solid and very well polished, with a big emphasis on parrying, but don't let that discourage you because the dodge works too, just a bit less forgiving than a game like Elden Ring is. Where this game falls behind in combat to the Dark Souls franchise, it stands toe to toe, and in a lot of aspects, exceeds it, in atmosphere.

You can get some really cool combination of weapons, which I really think will be expanded upon further in future dlc or future releases from this studio.

Overall recommendation 8/10

Has many of the best qualities of souls-like games. They do a good job with the atmosphere like most games in this genre. Definitely less build variety than Elden ring or Dark Souls, but they still leave a decent amount of room for customizing weapons play styles. I ended up using my starting weapon for the entire game, as every time I switched to another one it just did not feel as fun. That just proves that you can pick any weapon you want or customize and level it up to have for your entire play through if that's what you have the most fun with. 

I would say its on the easier side of souls-like games, but I would also not call it an easy game. I very very rarely died outside of a boss fight throughout all 28 hours of playing. Blocking/guarding is also very forgiving as the mechanic called Guard Regain lets you get back some of the health you got while blocking if you hit enemies after taking blocked damage. If you use the specters to help you with boss fights, many of them become almost too easy as the specter will soak most damage and the boss will just focus them while you freely get in damage. Without summoning specters the boss fights are challenging but fun. Most of the bosses and their move sets feel fair with only the occasional cringe ""what am I supposed to even do against that"" move. The hardest boss in the game is an optional boss at the end, but I recommend fighting it. 

There are different physical damage types in the game (slash/pierce/blunt) that both the player and the enemies do / are resistant to but I literally never paid attention to the detail (except the very end of the game) and everything went smoothly, I'd imagine it would matter more in NG+, though. The elemental dmg types, however, should definitely be noted and utilized as they are extremely helpful and switching your resistances for them can be a life saver. 

I found it was much more fun and rewarding to parry than to dodge most of the time. so more like Sekiro than DS/ER in that regard.

I think Lies of P is the first one where I feel like a soulslike is giving From Software a run for its money. It is absurdly high quality in a way that I'd only expect from the creators of the genre.

The combat (which, of course, is paramount in any soulslike) is great and the hitboxes are very tight, but it takes some getting used to since your dodge is significantly weaker baseline. It has less distance than a fat roll and definitely less i-frames. On the other hand, there is now a focus on perfect blocking, especially since enemies will occasionally throw out a bright-red Fury attack which pierces i-frames and normal blocks (and thus can only be perfect blocked). The Guard Regain system further encourages blocking over dodging by allowing you to restore health lost during normal blocks by fighting back, Bloodborne-rally style.

Ultimately though, you can upgrade your dodge and keep your equip load under 30% for Light encumbrance (which is much more valuable here than in dark souls) if you want to focus on dodging over blocking, and doing so is perfectly viable. There's really only one boss that very nearly requires perfect blocking, and if you've played the game you know who they are.

Your combat options are also quite expansive. Non-boss weapons have a blade and a handle slot, and you can mix and match blades & handles of different weapons to find a combination that suits your playstyle. The blade determines the base attack power of the weapon and the speed of the moveset, while the handle determines the moveset itself and how the attack power scales with your stats. You can stick a greatsword on a rapier handle and poke enemies with a giant stick from 3 meters away if you want, but it'll be a lot slower than a dagger on the same handle. I found this system really weird at first, but I appreciate the possibilities it allows for in builds.

The presentation and world are very high quality. The environments are on par with Dark Souls level design, in my opinion [spoiler]with a few less poison swamps, thankfully[/spoiler]. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring them, and there's a lot of secret items to be found. The story, while not incredible necessarily, is better than Dark Souls. That's honestly not a high bar though--nobody really plays Dark Souls for the story. You are the only puppet that can lie, and you are heavily encouraged to do so. This is one of the few pieces of media I can recall where lying is treated as a [i]good[/i] thing.

There's some very helpful quality of life improvements too. NPCs with new dialogue are highlighted on the map selection screen, making it easy to track the different questlines and know when to talk to them again. None of the Dark Souls games did this, and Elden Ring only noted NPC positions in the world, not if they had new dialogue.

The soundtrack is also really good. On top of the typical area & boss themes, you'll also unlock pieces of music to listen to on a gramophone in the hub area. While you are incentivized to listen to them, they don't really need it. The tracks are great.

One thing I do find odd though is that it seems like there's some low quality explanations for some abilities & upgrades. ""Lowers the Guard Regain reduction"" is not exactly easy to understand, especially when it actually means ""the amount of health lost from guarding that you can restore by attacking decays slower"".

Overall, this is--surprisingly--well worth the price, and that's rare for a $60 game nowadays. I went in expecting to scratch the soulslike itch but instead got something that goes beyond Dark Souls in many ways.",1702110356,1702110613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I did. Now, I've played a few FromSoftware games, and as much as there are undeniable qualities to them, all of them have tended to frustrate me for some reason or other, sometimes leading me to leave them unfinished. So when I decided to try Lies of P on Gamepass, I went in with some apprehension. But not only did the game prove my misgivings wrong, it actually made me realise exactly what I didn't like about FromSoftware titles in the first place (it isn't the difficulty). 

Yes, you heard me right: I actually prefer this game to FromSoftware games in general. This of course being my own opinion, please don't hate me too much. 

If I had to summarise why I prefer Lies of P: this game is much better at teaching the player how to ""git gud"". This includes feeling fair, encouraging skill and not shaming failure. Mostly, the changes Round8 made could be considered slight tweaks to the genre’s formula, but I think they impact the experience in a profound way. 

Yes, of course the player should get their ergo back at the entrance of a boss room so they can focus on actually learning the boss. 

Yes, of course ergo should be recoverable even after multiple deaths, only in smaller amounts, so that players who are not as skilled can still level up and not feel shamed in being in the process of learning, not just reward already skilled players by making the game easier for them because they lose their ergo less often and thus can increase their stats more easily. 

Yes, of course the game should offer situations where the player can actually take mobs by surprise if they're observant instead of feeling like the whole world is just waiting in ambush for this one dude to arrive at their spot. 

Yes, of course a game whose gameplay revolves around melee parrying and dodges should be very controlled with a status effect that results in instant death, since the mechanic circumvents that gameplay loop. 

There’s very little bulls***t, no health item farming, no enemies that snipe you from the other side of the map, no excessive groups of enemies, no locking out the player out of side content as punishment for dying too much and, again, no abuse of the instant death status effect to hinder the player from using their actual skill in the combat system. 

I thoroughly enjoyed learning this game, even if I had to try bosses again and again. The difficulty never felt unfair, and I didn't feel like I was slapped and mocked for failing, unlike even some of FromSoftware's own games. 

Plus all the other things that other people have already remarked upon: great boss designs, linear but very polished exploration, very good graphics with great performance on PC and straightforward but effective storytelling.

Some cynical people could point out that this is just a copy of what FromSoftware does. But even if it is, it's a great copy, and my wish now is that FromSoftware would copy Lies of P.",1698353294,1702073039,True,1,1,0.50151979923248291,0,True,False,False

SUCH a fun game. Feels like a true FromSoft game apart from a few minor issues (like some aspects of level design). The story is beautiful and I love how you are guided through it, somewhat unlike souls games. The characters and art are gorgeous and I absolutely adore the setting.

I was anticipating this ever since the first trailer dropped two years ago, and it absolutely delivered. The best way to get across how fantastic this game is is to list everything I DON'T like about it, as it's a very short list. Walls and obstacles hate you and your weapons bounce off them way too much. A couple particular bosses are a bit annoying. That's it. You get a variety of weapons with unique movesets, and the option to attach any weapon's blade to any other's handle is a real game changer that more or less guarantees you can make at least one weapon you really like. In particular, I like that weapon durability is now interesting instead of an unnecessary hindrance like it is in most games. Weapons will take damage and break in real time unless you repair them with an infinite-use grindstone, though it takes a few seconds. This makes for fun scenarios against bosses when you have to pick the right time to repair.

I'm told Lies of P is particularly hard in a genre known for being hard, but honestly I don't get why. It does expect you to perfect guard at least sometimes, and it is rather precise to do, but it can be adjusted to with a bit of time. The game will certainly lay you out at first, but the same can be said of the likes of Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro. There are a lot of movesets to learn, and dying is a natural part of that process. I wouldn't say any of the bosses quite reach Sword Saint Isshin status, though they will offer quite the challenge. The areas are engaging to explore, full of secrets to look out for and regular enemies arranged in interesting ways that'll keep you on your toes. Any elite enemies that are particularly tough to deal with will reward you fairly for killing them. The plethora of shortcuts and the number of times you loop back to the hub area really evoke that feeling of ""Whoa THIS place was next to THAT place all along?"" that Dark Souls 1 gives you, despite being far more linear. It's remarkable how interconnected everything is. Compared to most of From Software's repertoire giving you a pocket dimension of sorts to settle down in, Hotel Krat feels very much like a location in the world just like any other. Your route will take you to and from Hotel Krat several times throughout the game as more locations are unlocked.

The story makes for a unique take on the classic fairy tale that is Pinocchio. Most famously, the puppet's nose would grow when he lies. Here, though, you are encouraged to lie because it is a distinctly human act, and something puppets normally cannot do. Other human things, mainly appreciating music, are encouraged as well. It actually TELLS you its story as it happens, which I guess some people dislike, but I consider it a refreshing change of pace in a genre that generally expects you to dig for story elements yourself. Still, it doesn't exactly spoon feed you the events of the game. You do have to be paying attention, and it rewards you plenty for doing so.

I would touch on other aspects like the graphics, but just look at the pictures on the store page. It's gorgeous. The collectible music discs give you some lovely songs to enjoy. I'm a big fan of boss themes, but most of them in this game are a bit underwhelming with a few exceptions. Overall, though, I cannot give Lies of P a glowing enough recommendation. Almost nobody in my friend circles has even tried it, which is incredibly sad.",1702017148,1702017658,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

A Souls-borne game based on the story of Pinocchio, but that’s where all similarities end. A twisted take on lies, where instead of becoming our downfall, lies become our way of achieving humanity and protecting our companions. Compelling characters, easily digestible lore, and likable and evil characters alike. The main character P seeks to save the city of Krat from the mad puppets only to fall in a rabbit hole of an even greater evil. 
Pros: 
Smooth gameplay, fast combat and perfect blocking system is where action combat is streamlined together for the most satisfying gameplay experience.	
Rechargeable pulse cell (heals) during combat, a nice way to reward the players who excel in combat and make use of the Perfect Parry system it has saved me many times during critical moments. 
Custom weapon set-ups, high replay value, humanity system, sound design, P-Organ system.
Cons: 
Camera issues in critical moments: This was infuriating at times, when you are cornered by a large enemy and the camera shrinking into itself making combat near impossible and you end up in a stun lock and are unable to escape. 
Stats have a significant efficiency drop-off after a specific level which makes leveling useless after a certain point. Maxing all stats at 100 will be not much different from 50s across the board. 
TLDR:
Despite some issues I had during my experience they were significantly next to nothing compared to all the positives. I normally don’t go out of my way to plat a game but this game is different and heading into NG+ ill be finishing the last few achievements. All in all, this game is amazing and having played DSIII, I’ll say this with confidence: Lies of P is the best non-From Soft game ever. Highly recommended, even at full price, it’s worth every damn penny.

The game is not bad, but rather infuriatingly close to being good.

[b] Immersion [/b]
The entire scenario of the game is that something horrible happened, lots of people were killed and we try to find out why.
The atmosphere is grim and dark... until you have carefree conversations with residents needing a bottle of wine, unarmed civilians showing up in deadly zones, a cheerful hub area and the most annoying PoS sidekick imaginable who explains the most obvious shit and gives us ""comedic relief"" we didn't want or need.

[b] Design [/b]
This game is trying to copy Dark Souls / Bloodborne wherever possible, from status effects to weight, leveling, hub, stats, bonfires, traversal, jumping and dozens of other mechanics to actual copied substages.
This is not an issue most of the time and often feels familiar. They overdid it in quite a few areas though.
In some levels, you can encounter 5+ doors that open from the other side and 5+ collapsing floors/bridges.
Another issue (labeled ""great QoL over Bloodborne"") is that every collectible, sidequest, backtracking,... is spoonfed to you by showing it as ""teleport here!"" or ""this NPC wants to talk!"", making it worthless to think about things you encounter.

[b] Gameplay / Combat [/b]
Traversal is mostly fine, while the combat varies between tough and interesting fights, grinding through hordes of mobs and complete horseshit enemies.
I love tough bossfights. I want to be challenged and die a few (dozen) times until I figure things out.
Some enemies and bosses are just ridiculously annoying and it felt like luck/rng plays a big role in too many fights, while other fights are trivial. The parry timings and attack times feel disconnected at times.
There seems to be close to no hyperarmor for your character which makes slow weapons, especially charge attacks, incredibly frustrating to use at times when an enemy deals close to no dmg but cancels your attacks over and over again.
Many enemies are recycled over and over again, just as adds or with a different color or more numerously.

[b] TL;DR [/b]
Nowhere near Bloodborne levels of greatness.
Decent when on sale.

[b] Addendum [/b]
Addendum: other reviewers talk at length about pacing and camera issues and the generally weird nature of some decisions like the fact that this game is - by design - unsure whether it wants to be dodge and hit, block and hit or aggressive.

The weapon building mechanic is interesting and unique which allows for some interesting weapon combinations.

One of my main critiques is that there are a lot of two-phase boss fights where if you die in the second phase you have to redo the first before you can try again. This gets exceedingly tedious, particularly in the penultimate fight of the game, which gets boring after the first couple of times you beat it since all of the boss's attacks are very samey and drawn out, and its health pool is predictably bloated. 

Lowering the required number of parries for the boss's weapon to break, then concluding the first phase if the player manages to meet that requirement could rectify this issue. To be clear, the boss's weapon shouldn't remain broken in the following phase. As it is, the enemy weapon breakage mechanic is very underutilized, which is a shame since it's a really fun addition.

amazing game. you can clearly feel and see bloodborne influence.
i really enjoy the weapon parts system and the classical dark souls grinding and leveling system.
feels nice to play, combat is fluid and satisfying most of the time.
environments and atmosphere is amazing

but i think it's still a little rough around the edges, but nothing a couple of fixes and tweaks couldn't fix.

[*]the camera sometimes spasms out, dunno what causes it. i think it might have to do with the lock on / targeting systems
[*]some animations feel stiff, and weapon swing hitboxes seem too short and small to me. you should be able to dodge earlier after swinging, and almost all weapon swings should have more range.
[*][strike]not sure if i haven't unlocked it yet, but so far i haven't seen a respec option for your ergo level and quartz skilltree - this is desperately needed imo[/strike] there IS indeed a respec option - but you cannot change your path. if you chose strength - well - sucks to be you, the best weapon in the game by a landslide has S scaling in dexterity, so enjoy 6 wasted levels you will never get back
[*]equipment and amulets do not appear on your character and make a visual difference - a big missed opportunity - sad
[*]outfits and masks do nothing - they are just visual. feels completely useless. would be incredible if they would add some bonuses and stats - like grime did with a patch later on
[*]i get that it's supposed to be pinocchio but i would have loved a character creator
[*]imo enemies in the later chapters need to reward more souls (ergo). the very first enemies in the game give 60 - the ones in the very last chapter give 180. Leveling takes forever in the end
[/list]

Make no mistake. This game is INCREDIBLE difficult. In my opinion a lot harder than Bloodborne for example. Enemies have insane ultra quick combos, with widely varying swingtimers and delays. Attack patterns change based on your position. Monsters will react to your item usage and suddenly do an extra hit at the end of their combo. It's almost too hard sometimes. Some enemies don't have any opening to attack at all if you are on a slow weapon.",1695590447,1701970071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Summed up in one word ""Balance"" the one thing all of FromSoft gets right and what makes them great. This.....doesnt do, it has a weapon customization gimmick, thats the extent of the originality here. It took all the negative aspects of souls games and made them features. Fat Rolling, nobody starts a souls game and immediately over encumbers and starts fat rolling and says, ""yup, this is how i want to play this"" well you said, ""hold my beer because im going to make dodge rolling crap so you have to use our block mechanic.""

Your block mechanic is like Sekiro, but worse, if you miss the perfect block in Sekiro you still block 100% of the damage, here its, perfect or die, you dont have the standing as a developer to demand, block perfect or die and like it. FromSoft can, they dont, but they can, you....cant. You havent figured out the balance portion to demand such things. Why is my carry weight stat the second highest investment, second only to my main damage stat......thats should not be, ever, its a failure on your part to have found balance, instead you artificially manipulate depth and complexity by making it so for every 2 points in one stat, I HAVE to put one in carry weight, so by the end of the game i can barely have 2 weapons and the part upgrades teetering on ""HEAVY"" and ""SLIGHTLY HEAVY"" again, this is something that should not be, especially when every single enemy has super human, uninterruptible attacks, when you can get whacked out of your weapons special move in its last few frames, zero ""HYPER ARMOR"" one of those balance things you failed to take into account from the games you stole yours from.

Why does every single enemy have unlimited stamina with the ability to chain 4-8 hit combos back to back then performing the unblockable move that i no longer can block because i missed one perfect block in one of those furies from your standard enemy, it just ramps up for bosses. Again, zero balance, enemies clearly do not have to follow the same rules of physics your confined to, apparently we're the only puppet that cant move like an X-Man, cant barely roll out of his own way.
Enemies have infinite tracking, even while in the air, they can turn and hit you because they dont want you dodge, they want you to use their block mechanic and thats it, if they didnt, it wouldnt punish you for just blocking or rolling out of the way, maybe they decided it was too easy with an actual dodge roll, so they created a problem for artificial depth and character.
Either way, you failed.

Where are all the souls streamers doing no hit runs? why are all the fans of this game asking, ""why its not universally loved as the greatest souls game."" Because its not, plain and simple, it lacks the balance FromSoft has spent decades perfecting. Sure there are a few no hit runs, but NOWHERE near the level of the actual Souls franchise you obviously got your.....inspiration from.

Probably the best souls-like that continues to innovate on the core design. The modular upgrade system (P-organ), the weapon crafting system, and simple design concepts like leaving souls/ergo in front of the boss arena and marking side quest progression changes at travel stations are all welcome design changes building upon what Fromsoftware has done. Combat is the best its ever been since Sekiro and art direction/animation is great at every point in the game. The music was always good and sometimes great. I genuinely enjoyed collecting all the records and listening to them all the way through. The story and the lore were both interesting and interwoven nicely with the gameplay and decisions made by the playable character. Using Pinocchio the the backbone is a nice touch compared to the drawn out dark fantasy settings (Demon/Dark Souls + Elden Ring) to the point in which I want to read the original work. I've always appreciated multiple endings and NG+ material, but this is the first game that I've fully committed to completing fully. Thankfully, the game offers some additional content and intensives for doing so. There are some areas/aspects that could be improved on and some design choices that may feel lackluster for players. The game is strictly designed linearly and that might not sit well with returning souls veterans right off the heels of Elden Ring, which touted its open world design. At the same time, the level design for each chapter seems fairly basic. The path the player travels never strays too far from the main path and there are very few dead ends. While this may sound like a good thing, some people - myself included - still like getting lost and exploring paths with perhaps minor rewards.

I played each update from the start. Saying that this game is like incredibly good. Before updates their was alot of complaints about difficulty but even before the updates the game was incredibly fair and always gave you tools you needed to fight any boss let that be a Electric type of weapon to deal damage on puppet types or throwables to deal with gank fights. The boss roster is incredibly strong as well with i think outside of sekiro might have the best boss line up quality wise in souls games in general. Very fun combat loop as well with parrying/blocking and dodging.But you might be wondering what makes this game stick out  compared to other games like darksouls or bloodborne. Besides its more Bioshock like aesthetic its very linear in level design which is really up to you if you dislike that or not since i believe some people might enjoy linear and less confusing/Convoluted layout (and i know a decent amount of people have been turned off by the souls series for being as confusing/convoluted and this is a great game for people who want to play a souls game but not get a headache and need a wiki to find stuff) It also has alot of good QOL (from elevators resetings to tell you when you can level up by turning your ergo blue their just alot of good QOL that doesnt make it a hassle) and brings a unique weapon system i haven't seen in a souls game which is a combo system for handle and blades. Blades are the damage/attack type/ Elemental/ and range/speed with each blade having its own fable art. While the handle defines the attack animation and has its own fable arts and their around 29 Handles and blades that are all interchangeable. Their also weapons that are 1 piece which are boss weapons are their really fun to play from a sekiro like sword to the range of puppet ripper. Their so many weapon choices that really its up to you to find your favorite and stick with it lol. The story is also really good but does suffer from some meh translation but most of it is fine just 1 off issues here and their. the ost is really good. Like REALLY good from the boss OST to the music discs you can collect. Lies of P has alot going for it. If you enjoyed Sekiro and or bloodborne combat i 100% recommend this game to you! If your wanting to get in to souls games and couldn't really get in to dark souls i recommend you try lies of P as it easily one of the more casual takes on the souls genre thanks to alot of its quirks.,1695067526,1701902505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The level of detail, customization, and exciting combat shows the care and research that went into development.  
There are definitely some things here and there that could be improved upon or expanded, but I don't think any one thing negatively impacted my game-play to the point of distraction. Combat is definitely difficult, but over time, I think the player will find the play-style that works best for them. Again, the level of customization in this game allows players to experiment with how they want to engage.

After I didn't have a great time with elden ring due to it invalidating my build choices (Not engaging with magic and summon system mainly), it is wonderful to have a souls-like that encourages a very in your face melee focused combat system.

The game is quite difficult and you will need to both get good at knowing when best to dodge and best knowing when to stand your ground and perfect parry. It's like a middle ground between dark souls and sekiro.  This sort of defensive variety and the amazing boss design in -every- single boss means every encounter with a big baddie was a joy to learn and defeat.

My favorite thing is the weapons, you get a lot of weapons as you play through Lies of P and you can mix them how you want.  The 'blade' part of the weapon determines speed and damage, the handle determines stat damage scaling and the moveset.  Using this I crafted a long heavy weapon using the bone saw and a pickaxe handle.  With this I was able to beat the entire game and every boss by using -just- the charged heavy attack in between boss attacks if I dodged or parried them into a stagger state.  The fact I could beat this game in an enjoyable way with such a slow BONK focused weapon was amazing.  Most other games would demand me to use a fast weapon or abuse something like a jump attack over and over and damage trade with bosses while they fly around the arena with the power of god and anime on their side.

Graphics: Beautiful top down. Big note for me, I want to be drawn in. I don’t want to spot imperfections or remember it’s a game. I want to be excited, interested, and enjoy the developer’s hard work. That said, the game is flawless in artwork. The environment, layout, the detail kept me focused on the game. Nothing stuck out and made me get distracted and focus on the bad points of anything. The setting, the lighting, and the music and tone are married together in amazing harmony. In the artistic viewpoint, the game crushes it is setting the ambience, scene, and tone. Truly A+ Here.
Weapons: This game is the best in the genre, my one of two comparisons I intend to make. This is the best in genre for picking a weapon you want, customizing it how you like, and playing with it. There’s only a couple of weapons that make the experience “easier.”  From my view, any weapon is workable, and fun based on your style in this game. Sweats will say this is the case for any entry. I speak as a casual dad with sweaty hands (sometimes.)
UI: The interface and HUD are very clean and simple. I like that the game has notifications for when side quests progress and reminds you of the location for the quests. It’s super helpful, and nice not to have to refer to google and fextralife to understand what steps need to be taken.
Below is where we start to become critical of the game.
Difficulty: I found this to be an easier game for the most part. Aside from 3 bosses with aggravating skills and status affects and 2 world areas where they throw lots of mobs and multiple effects at once. The aforementioned 5 points are not hard they are just punishing. This game is heavy on the parry, only in a handful of spots it’s your dodge helpful. You’re gonna be tested heavily on your parry. This game starts to fall off for me because, the “challenge” is punishing enemies with 2-9 attacks continuously, and one missed block can be detrimental. Now, some of you may read that and say, well that’s a fair challenge. But there’s 2-6 enemies doing the same thing. This may come off as a whine but play it yourself. You’ll see. Added note, You as the player have a plateau of damage, meanwhile the enemies will only get stronger and more health. 
Story/Mechanics: The story started very interesting, quickly got predictable. Loosely explaining it to a friend, we were able to guess the ending clearly. The story is easily found throughout the game in pick-ups, which is nice. Unfortunately, the plot twists don’t catch you off guard. The “Lie” mechanic that determines the ending, but “lying” in the game isn’t always clear what’s the lie, and what’s the effect? Theres a actually “nifty” easter egg drop, after the game for the sequel but personally I have no interest in a sequel. 
The game captures the bones of a SoulsBourne game but, it lacks some creativity to really be a great title for me. It’s a good game, but some glaring issues for me in between the lines. The last third of the game starts to get un-creative and punishing. It's great visuals and weapons don't pull it that hard. If they do make the sequel they hint at, there's a good amount to fix to really make it a great game and an original entry. It’s a solid 6/10 game, play it once.

Gameplay will be very familiar to anyone that has played a souls game and especially sekiro. It's more like ds3 combat with a stagger system and perfect blocks, and instead of weapon arts you have fable arts that consume fable that is recharged as you fight enemies. 

But what really intrigued me more than the game-play was the world and the story. Much more than CodeVein ever did, or any other souls game. Especially the story, there is more of a clear message/theme with this game, which makes sense as it's a dark re-imagining of a Pinocchio. What really does it is that as you progress in the game, and become more ""human"", the little details the game adds. The cat in the hub area gets more friendly, and you get better at playing music at the piano. 

The lore is also very interesting, and definitely still need to read the notes scattered around the world to get a better sense at everything that was going on. But the game also makes sure you understand what is happening even if you don't read anything. This game is more narratively driven than fromsoft souls games.

and with it's puppet-organ/p-organ progression system(that carries over, and apparently gets to even higher levels until I believe until ng3 ) and ng+ narrative elements(like Nier:Automata, you can now know what the puppet bosses are saying more clearly) it has been the only souls game that made me really want to play the game over again right away.",1701869071,1701869071,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's by no means perfect, but takes the perfect parry emphasis of Sekiro and throws it into a souls-RPG system with really cool weapons and a beautiful, underrepresented aesthetic to boot. 

Mechanics that stand out: 
-Recharging your health pot when you are out by dealing damage
-Mix and match weapons (blade gives you size and damage type, handle gives you moveset and scaling)
-Fable Arts - Special weapon abilities bound to blade or handle, Similar to Elden Ring's Ashes of War but you get two 
-Stagger/Fatal attack mechanic is very fun
-Armor is boiled down into a couple of equip slots which leaves you to fashion it up without worrying about stats
-I love the setting of this game

A couple of small pain points:
-Leveling needs to be done in the hub location, you can't do it at the checkpoints (past the demo chunk of the game)
-Perfect Parry timings can be rough to get used to at first if you come from a Sekiro background since the parry needs to be held down over the hit, not tapped
-A lot of disjointed and/or wonky attack timings - Need to approach new enemies with block to get a feel for the moves
-""Sneak"" attacks are wonky and hard to pull off. Jump attacks feel like an afterthought
-It's not super clear how certain stats work, and some translations are a little off (cube anyone?)

IMO, most of those pain points are pretty easy to overcome besides going back to the hub to level (seriously, who thought this was a good idea?) and Lies of P brings enough new ideas to differentiate itself from other entries of the genre. 

This game has managed to grip me in ways that very few single player games nowadays do, as well as inspire me to actually put a review out and for that, I give it a strong recommendation.

The combat is a perfect blend of Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Dark Souls 1 systems, striking a perfect balance between aggression, parrying, blocking, and dodging.

This game gets so many things right!! The souls-like approach is evident but misleading in a sense, yes it is a souls-like but as much as swimming in a pool compared to swimming on the sea, in both you swim but they are very different in approach and trainning. 
Defending is not just defending and waiting for your turn to attack when the boss finish his combo. Yes, there is the option to dodge and attack, but with fury attacks that can't be dodged(at first) you will be forced to learn the parry and OH BOY does the game open from that.
Enemy variety is great and follows the story in why the enemy is designed like that and why he is on that biome, when they mix it is understandable, not once did I think that an enemy was out of place.
I played this game after the nerf patches and to me the game always seemed fine from a difficulty perspective, you have throwables, consumables, a specter to help you fight, the game is designed for the player to find the difficulty he wants to conquer, be it using nothing but the dodge and weapon, or using everything.
The weapon system is great, instead of chaging a weapon to a better one from late game, Lies of P make the blade and handle different parts so the player can test and find what he prefers, just like the legion arm that would be youf off hand weapon and becomes a very powerful tool later on, there are lots of legion arms to choose.
The gameplay really ties well with the theme of the game, choice.
Story wise I am dumbfounded by how well they tied the robot aesthetic with Pinocchio story and themes, literally it is an amazing way to feel the meaning behind the story, and tells a lot about lying which is truly complemented with the superb voice acting from the entire crew. If I had anything to harp is that some minor villains are given big roles but not enough interactions to make a true decisive impact, the impact is still there for some but could be a lot better.
The game is way longer than I expected, clocking at 30 to 40 hours un my first playthrough.
One very special part is the music, what a great soundtrack, for ambience and SPECIALLY for the collectables.

Many of the mechanics feel familiar, but the story and setting are what set it apart. I think they did a great job creating a game that feels like a tribute more than a copy. The story sets up so much potential for future titles and settings as well. 

As far as gameplay, my only complaint is difficulty. Personally, it was too hard but I made it through. I give the devs credit for hearing feedback and tuning the NPC summon to help on bosses. I think the buff to the summon makes the game much more accessible for most players. I like the Legion Arm mechanic for approaching bosses in ways that suit your own playstyle. There aren't as many weapons as a Souls game would have, but the handle swapping adds a layer that was fun to play around with and I never felt like I was lacking in interesting weapons to try.

The scope of this game is considerable smaller compared to Dark Souls games or Elden Ring. But smartly the developers didn't overextend themselves and just stuck what works. That does mean that the game is somewhat limited in level design, weapon variety, enemy variety and classes, to name a few, but what is in the game is done very well, and this really is the best Soulsborne game not made by From Software. The game's story is also much more straightforward. The world is well established and you don't need to guess or piece together what has happened, the game tells you. That doesn't mean that the story is anything special, but the use of the source material of Pinocchio is pretty unique. Still, it's told well enough that it keeps you going. Though I have to say that the ending(s) was a bit anti climatic.

Probably the easiest Soulsborne type of game that I have played. Took me a little shy of 30h to finish the game and the only boss that gave me trouble was the very final one [spoiler]The Nameless Puppet [/spoiler], if you chose to fight it. That said, I got the game only after the 1.30 patch was out, so maybe that made the game easier, but all the bosses, except the final one, were pretty damn easy. But I guess the NG+ and NG++ and NG+++ and so on, will truly test you.

some minor criticisms or rather preferences I have is they abandoned most overworld music in that souls esq vibe and I really don't like that. whenever you do hear music it's definitely big on atmosphere but I loved elden ring for always having some kind of music happening in the background.

the other thing I'd like to see in a sequel is a more sprawling world with diverse locations. most of the game is in a town/city esq environment. I could think of a ton of locations to add in a city. A forest, a meadow, national park, etc. The final location was definitely sick.

But putting comparisons aside, even if you've never played a Souls game before, this is a must play. It's very difficult and that's gonna turn a lot of people off, including long time FromSoft/Souls fans. But if you can stick with it, if the game clicks for you like it did with me, this is one of the best experiences of 2023 and my personal GOTY rivaling Armored Core 6.

A couple of criticisms though: The emphasis on parrying is great, I love the mix of Bloodborne/Sekiro. However, the parry windows are a bit too small, certain attack chains and furry attacks basically feel impossible to parry, especially with how janky and unnatural the enemy puppet animations are. Another issue I feel is that the tracking on enemy attacks is too high. The way the game expects you to play is that you either parry or dodge attacks, which means that, a lot of the times, there is a weird rubber-banding effect that happens when an enemy attacks you, because the game is forcing the attack to land in order to force the player to engage with the systems. I feel like this was unnecessary and it makes certain enemy encounters, and even some boss fights like the Green Swamp Monster really frustrating.

The nice refresh of an almost linear story and world exploration through an immersive, mix of a Gothic-steampunk world. 

GAME PLAY:
Perfect parrying was difficult to get useful, but is so rewarding and fun to use. Weapon diversity and customization is crazy how fun and unique it is. Legion, although feeling under powered eventually as you play, becomes a amazing way to alter how you approach different bosses and areas. However, much like souls games, there are strong bosses and there are weak bosses, for example, the ""final boss"" (IN MY PERSONAL OPINION) is clunky and unfunny to play against, but the boss preceding it is one of the most cinematic and difficult hurdlers to play for the first time and required me to adapt and break my previous souls knowledge and master perfect parries. Areas, as mentioned are linear yet not simple, and reward the player for completing them.

IF YOUR ON EDGE:
One main thing if you are reading this review and considering playing this game. PLEASE, and I mean please understand, this is not a fromsoftware game however, it is not another Sekerio or Bloodborne like people say, it has its own combat, so avoid the baby rage of the combat ""feeling different"" and learn it just like you did when you first played those games. The game is hard, and definitely punishing but that brings along charm. One of the beginning bosses took me 4 hours, yet was so worth it. 

OVERALL: 9.5/10
This is an incredible game with an immersive story and environment, and is defiantly an amazing title to come out especially during the drought of no Fromsoftware content (besides Fires of Rubicon) until the Elden Ring DLC. I recommend this whole heatedly to anyone who likes Demon-Souls-Borne (or Elden Ring) style games.

That phrase was invented to scold people like me. I only complete games like this through sheer attrition. You've got this. The only bosses that really gave me grief were the first handful, and only because I was stubborn about not learning the systems and always dodging instead of parrying.

Considering how long this game is, it's remarkable how sustained the quality is from beginning to end. Every hour feels polished and well paced.

Lies of P has a much more linear story than any other Souls game and it makes for a more rewarding final act. I was not prepared for this game to be so emotionally devastating. I can not wait to see what the DLC has in store. Genuinely, this is a beautiful story, with some really harrowing reveals.",1701723544,1701723544,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

The people who worked on ''Lies of P'' took what is the Souls formula and truly innovated on it. The combat alone is so addictive that you'll have an extremely hard time putting that controller down. The Art design is easily one of my favorites out of any Souls game I've played, up there with DS3, ER and Bloodborne. The music? I have no words, the music will make you cry with joy at how beautiful it is and how seamlessly it fits with the whole aesthetic of the game. It's PERFECT and all the Artists are incredibly talented. Just perfect, I have no words, I absolutely love it...

Now for the story. This is a twisted re-imagining  of ''Pinnochio'' mixed with extremely dark elements and an outcome that solely relies on your decisions, which do matter in this game. Make no mistake, the fact that it's based on the classic tale does not mean that it's a shameless copy, on the contrary, ''Lies of P'' is a story on it's own while only borrowing elements of the classic story. It's deep, impactful and everything a lore lover could ever want.

I will not go into  detail but I'll say this. The level of detail these people added into this game is astounding. It's pure quality in every turn you take, incredibly well polished and obviously crafted with a TON of love and care. There is nothing that they did not think of and on top of that added so extra little details that you as a player would have never noticed were missing if they hadn't, but they did and it gives the game a lot more immersion and some of those details will really tug on your heartstrings. It's amazing.

This Soulslike is so good that it deserves it's place next to the best of Fromsoftware's releases. Easily.

If you're looking for a new Soulslike that not only nails every detail of the souls formula but greatly innovates on it at the same time, then this is where you should stop looking. It's a thousand miles ahead of it's direct competitor which was also released recently on UE5 engine and I've also played and is lackluster to say the least. 

''Lis of P'' is worth every penny especially if you're a souls fan, you will fall absolutely in love with it.

With that said I would like to thank every single person that worked on this game. Not just the developers, but EVERYONE. It's clear that you gave it all the passion, love and care that you had in order to offer us this absolute Masterpiece. You're all extremely talented and it shows.

So thank you.

I started the game off with little to not expectations and chose it over lords of the fallen based on ratings. I will say I am disappointed but might come back later at a lower price point.

My negative review is tentative, and hopefully I will change it into a positive one in the future, but that depends on if the development team is willing to make slight quality of life changes that would drastically improve the enjoyment for the player. This game does a lot well: the level design, the aesthetic, the music, the weapons, the various ""legion arms,"" all of that is great. However, I do genuinely think this is the absolute limit of difficulty that Souls fans are going to be willing to put up with.The lack of animation cancelling and the unnecessarily tight perfect guard windows are incredibly frustrating, both things that Sekiro does better. There are decisions in this game that come across as oversights at best and spiteful at worst. The deflection system comes across as overly punishing with red attacks not being able to be dodged as it's entirely arbitrary as to what can be i-framed and what can't. There are also an over abundance of red attacks in comparison to Sekiro where they felt more special and thoughtfully placed. Another issue with the deflection system is how inconsistent it is in conjunction with grab attacks- while unblockable attacks glow red to let the player know to either perfect guard or avoid the attack entirely, there are also grab attacks that need to be perfect guarded or avoided entirely that don't glow red, and the only way to figure that out is to perfect guard the very first time it appears or to be punished for something you've never seen before. Another thing I hate is how the game tends to break its own rules- the guard break system in particular. Normally if you posture break a boss it slumps down so that you can get in a critical, but the second rabbit boss fight the big brother does a crazy flailing swing when you ""guard break"" him (literally going against the name of the mechanic) to get in a few cheap hits on unsuspecting players that could cause an unfair death. This also happens with Laxasia and it's just a cheap surprise. The worst instance of this ways throughout the whole game, big enemies falling down don't have a hit box as they collide with the floor, but the shitty Door Guardian boss does, and his head hitting the floor actually killed me, causing a huge chunk of my time to be wasted. And why are we still doing the weapon upgrade system? Of all of the things to copy from Souls, this is the worst. How can I be expected to experiment with different weapons if I have limited and expensive upgrade materials? If the game is also going to include a weapon durability system (which is pretty harsh in comparison to something like Das1 or Das2), then at least let me change weapons on the fly without worry of how upgraded a weapon is. Lastly, I hate the withered health. Losing stamina to blocking is trade-off enough, and it's obviously just something from Bloodborne the devs wanted to shoe-horn in.",1695828199,1701716386,False,3,0,0.491421967744827271,0,True,False,False

Similar to what came before, it punishes mistakes and rewards skill. If you played games like Sekiro, Jedi: Fallen order, Jedi: Survivor, or Bloodborne, Your skills will carry over. 
Similar to aforementioned games, parrying is king. While you can block, you lose health and stamina where parrying only results in lost stamina as well as build up of the invisible stagger meter, once full it will allow for a fatal blow if you land a charged heavy attack when the health bar is flashing white. 
I want to address movement complaints I've seen. This game is not focused on movement, you can dodge, however, the game is focused on perfect guarding not dodging.
If you do end up taking damage while blocking, it has a mechanic similar to Bloodborne's rally system. Rewarding a portion/all of your recently lost health back.

No, its none of these things. What it is is a super solid refinement of elements you most likely have already seen, mixed together in a pretty and interesting setting, with good voice acting, solid story and suburb presentation. This game is the manifestation of the idea of refining the wheel, and it does this super well. 

One notable standout is the focus on parrying in combat, and how it  can make almost any fight a hell of a lot more easy. While not as necessary in my experience as it is in Sekiro, its still a linchpin in most viable strategies, and it does shape many boss encounters, and that has its perks and drawbacks. This I think is will the biggest watershed if players will enjoy the game or not. For my part, I did, and I kept enjoying learning patterns of the many interesting bosses you fight in this game. 

Now for some critique, even if its minor: While this game refines many of the good features of other souls-titles, it suffers from similar problems: The camera can, and will screw you over against faster and bigger enemies, random death traps that get you ones are dotted around the game, adding nothing expect a sigh from you as you have to run and fetch your Ergo again and the armor system is very, very basic, with mostly just basic stat improvements at the expense of weight. For many players coming from DS3 or Elden Ring, they will also find the game much slower then those two, with longer regeneration on stamina and more limited dodge spamming. 

At the end of the day, I full and utterly recommend this game to people who love Souls-games, and are looking for another fix in this gene, and do not mind similar elements being refined and implemented in interesting ways. For those completely new to this kind of game, I would recommend Elden Ring first, as a solid introduction, but if the aesthetics, theme or weapon-system in this game seems more interesting, then this can serve as a solid introduction to this genre of gaming.

Lies of P takes a lot of cues from Bloodborne and some from Sekiro, and it's a great addition to its genre. Apparently some people say it's harder than Elden Ring, but I didn't find that to be the case. By building a character with strong health and armor for my first playthrough, I gave myself enough room for mistakes that I actually overcame many of its challenges in about 1 to 3 tries. But I don't consider that a bad thing; it felt intense in the moment all the same! In the few spots where I did need more tries than that, I was late enough in the game that I had lots of different weapons and other tools to try new approaches with.

It's true what you may have heard about the English translation being imperfect, but it's a minor thing, more on the level of ""that's not quite the right tone and diction for a history book"" than actually being difficult to understand. The voiced lines tend to sound more sensible than the written text, and the performances are solid!

The smallness of my nitpicks with Lies of P are a testament to how good it is. One is that the enemy variety and environmental detail are a little bit sparse compared to From Software's works, and I do mean only a little. Another is that the enemy attack animations are harder to read than I'm used to in Elden Ring and Sekiro, so it can be tricky to get perfect parries until you study the enemies for a while. Even so, I suspect it's intentional that perfectly blocking everything the first time you see it is hard, and I probably wasn't much better at it my first time through Sekiro.

The lore and story leave some things unsaid but aren't as shrouded in mystery as, say, Dark Souls. For me, it's just right!

Anyway, if you're a fan of the Souls-like genre, this one's definitely worth a try!

I have been telling all of my friends who enjoy souls-like games to play this.
It has told the most compelling souls-like story that I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. 

It’s three parts. 
They set you up with a good backstory.
Then you have the environment as you explore.
And the story unfolds as you interact with other characters, and defeat bosses.
The music is instrumental to the telling of the story, and the main characters growth.
Every element only further enhances, an already good narrative that you can keep up with.

40-50 hr play through
2-3 play through required for all achievements

The game also gives you multiple play styles. The weapons are pretty sick - the blade and the handle of every weapon you discover with the exception of specials/unique weapons you can switch out with others - altering them and it’ll change up how that particular weapon attacks. They are also upgradable. With unique technique skills like in Dark Souls / Elden Ring.

Then you have your Legion arm, which is basically a sick metal arm that you can use that has different abilities depending on which one you have equipped. As you upgrade them they unlock special abilities for each unique arm.

Rating it a 9.5/10 game overall because of a few small, small things. If you think you're interested, try it baby!! It's hard at first, but once you learn to 'dance' with each enemy a bit, everything clicks!",1701620174,1701620174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I tried the game on game pass and immediately fell in love with the combat mechanics, the soundtrack, and the story in general. I am over 35 hours in, third play through, and i would highly recommend this game. I did not buy on game pass due to steam having the better price at the time of purchase so it was an excellent buy. This game is punishing, so learning how to parry is awesome and rewarding. It is a lot to learn and a lot of deaths required to fully master a specific boss with specific weapons. For context: I am a motivity player (in all my runs) so i exclusively run the Mjolnir (unchanged) and the exploding pick axe handle along with the Black steel cutter head. I learned to parry enough to survive the boss encounter with at least 4 pulse cells remaining. If parrying is not possible due to the used up stamina, the Mjolnir has a clutch perfect parry fable which the Nameless one does not like lol. This game is my game of the year, it is fun and engaging.

I definitely strongly recommend this game for everyone passionate about and fond of the souls-like genre. Occasionally, there are some visually poor locations, but that's about it. The game boasts a fantastic, melancholic soundtrack that sets a great atmosphere. It offers flexible gameplay with numerous weapon combinations and secondary hand gadgets, along with challenging boss fights (especially in NG+ for hardcore players).

Most of the time, based on other Unreal Engine-built soul games I've played, I thought the engine sucked as hell when it came to the genre. Collision, movement, combat, optimization - everything seemed so damn scuffed and unrealistic (ha-ha) in games like jedi, vein, remnant. But this game literally proved me wrong. Game may still not be perfect at mass combat, but every 1v1 experience is neat, smooth, and satisfying - I freaking loved smashing and crushing things here! It just feels. And it feels great.
The story is decent, the difficulty is quite low, maybe 2 times easier than Sekiro even during NG+ where everything slaps you as mosquito, a lot of cool new mechanics including QoL, variety of gameplay and hard working developers with all these patches makes this game a real gem.

However, the downside for me is that the game is short and the locations are almost always the same. It's not that they are bad, no, the atmosphere is great, but not like in souls with a huge variety of biomes, more like Sekiro... but still smaller and generally without a shitty backtracking.

Totally recommend, enjoyable experience, hyperhyped for the sequel (for some red reason) and maan, fucking local Malenia's thighs.

And I do mean minor (ie. a 10-20% boost in walking & running speed would suffice)",1701531687,1701531687,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

But... I am so glad I got in on this game before they started patching it and making it ""easy"" for all the people who cry out there.  If you don't like games that hold your hand and make you feel amazing about yourself then don't play ""souls-like games"".  Souls-Like games should not have to change their ways just to make the weak feel good about themselves. 

Great game over all and the optimization for PC is absolutely amazing.  4k at 120 FPS without ever having frames drop once through my entire time of playing.  I can't begin to give enough praise for how well they optimized this game before release.  Day 1 this ran beyond butter smooth.  Absolutely a delight to partake in.

Good game but only a few ""tough bosses"" otherwise it is pretty much a breeze for a souls game.  Even the ""tough bosses"" are insanely easy once you figure out the move set.  The bosses actually are not randomized enough and you know they are either going to start with 1 or 2 type of move sets when you enter the arena and from there the moves patterns are easy to master and parry.   I instantly changed up my playstyle for NG+ to make it a harder run because of this. 

If they are taking the DLC where I think they are taking it it could be cool and if they do what is right and really expand on it they could make this an unbelievable experience with multi-DLCs and make it a huge ""Fairytale Souls Game"" that just keeps expanding out and out.  Hopefully they take this approach and make it a huge world with a ton of DLC that just keeps expanding upon itself.

Lies of P Pro:
Great Play, great fighting great fun.
Polished for optimization from the first day of release: Kudos for making sure it was flawless from the start.
Good graphics, art, animation, fighting.
The P-Organs were an awesome addition for a ""skill-tree"". Unique idea and love how it adds to it for NG+
Actually having additional items in NG+ was cool... could have definitely took this up a notch though and added more. 
Some open world ""mini boss"" fights.  Those were awesome.  You could drag the boss around the map and setup drop attacks. (This was really cool in some areas).  I wish they would incorporate that more.

Lies of P Cons:
Easy for a souls game.
Fighting is basic.  Heavy attack, light attack, parry. 
Are starting to bend toward the weak gamers and are coddeling them. 
No harsh punishments of hitting NPCS.  Can't kill NPCS and ruin story lines.
Leveling up is way to easy.

8.5/10.  Play it, it's fun.  Hopefully they expand crazy on the DLC.

If I had to describe [b] Lies of P [/b] with one word - it would definitely be [b] annoying [/b]. Every decision the devs made leads to a remarkably unpleasant experience. In all honesty, I can [b]not[/b] recommend this game either to the fans of soulslike genre or to the newcomers. If you want a game with deflects just play Sekiro, it's much better.

Here's a more comprehensive list of issues (and some good parts) about this game:

[h3] Pros: [/h3]
[b] + Graphics:[/b] The game looks quite good and can stand toe to toe with other 2023 releases in terms of graphical fidelity. Sure, it may not have pathtracing or some other bells and whistles of the recent titles, but that doesn't really take away from the style and atmosphere this game presents.

[b] + Performance:[/b] For how good this looks, the game performs very well and i've never had a CTD or a drop beyond 144 fps. Can't say how the performance scales on lower end machines, tho.

[b] + Art style consistency:[/b] You get what you've been promised. A re-imagined story of Pinocchio with a wicked twist on the familiar characters. While it's not my cup of tea, it's definitely inventive and deserves praise in terms of setting and atmosphere. 

[b] + Boss designs (art):[/b] Every boss fills like a part of the world and like they are exactly where they need to be. Also design-wise, each boss is varied and somehow looks like one of the best From Soft's bosses.

[b] + No heal reading:[/b] Bossed don't attack you just because you disengage and heal. That's good. 

[b] + Regaining last heal:[/b] You can regain one healing item if you run out by attacking enemies. That's also a great idea and helps in a pinch without affecting the tension of running low on heals.

[h3] Neutral: [/h3]
[b] = Story and storytelling:[/b] I personally couldn't care less about Pinocchio's story and the game haven't convinced me to care. The more traditional and 'in your face' style of storytelling didn't help either. I do recognize that some people crave a more digestible story in a soulslike and that game provides it, i guess. But i found the story quite boring and uninspiring. 

[b] = Weapon system:[/b] Cool idea of mixing and matching blades and handles. On paper. In the actual game you quickly find the one thing that you like and play with it for the rest of the game. Also the coolest weapons (boss weapons with cool and unique movesets) are exempt from the system and can't be mixed and matched. That only raises the chances of you not engaging with the system much.

[b] = Humanity mechanics:[/b] It's okay. Lying is fun sometimes, but it doesn't affect the game nearly enough for me to care. I also hate that you have to listen to the entire songs you find to get more humanity. I don't like the songs and I don't want to listen to them, period.

[b] = Enemy weapon breaking:[/b] Once again, cool idea on paper but severely underutilized. Enemies don't change their attacks or behaviour, you don't get some material\weapon reward for it. You just make an enemy a tiny little bit easier.

[h3] Cons: [/h3]
[b] - Parrying and defense mechanics:[/b] The game tries to be both Bloodborne and Sekiro and turns out to be the worst of both worlds. Let's start with the parries. Just like everyone else has already mentioned, the parry window is too tight. Especially for how erratically most enemies attack. ESPECIALLY for puppets. Their wind up animations are ludicrous and timing a perfect parry is extremely hard. Great choice for the first enemies in the game, the enemies on which players will be learning how to parry. Puppet bosses suffer from the same thing. Oh you want to parry? Let me delay my attack just enough so you'll get hit. You also can't fan the parry button like in Sekiro, so you either commit to a block or go for the perfect parry. With an extremely tight perfect parry window this results in you eating the attack most of the time and dying. 

Rallying mechanic (regaining health by attacking) is locked behind a block. Why? Instead of being able to regen any lost health, you can only regain chip damage you got while blocking. This creates a bigger gap between committing to a block or going for the parry. Because IF you get hit you won't get a chance to heal from attacking. 

Dodging is just pathetic. Very little distance and very few i-frames. Oh, and remember the red unblockable attacks bosses and mini bosses do? They ignore dodge i-frames and still hit you, have fun! 

So what we get is a play style that's not aggressive and relies on rote memorization of attacks to counter them. You never really set the pace for the fight, you just react to what the boss does (and hopefully you react perfectly, otherwise you either lose health or boss regains it) and you whittle the boss down in small windows they give for attacks.

[b] - Poise and staggers:[/b] You have no poise and can be hit out of basically everything. That makes some of the enemies and bosses extremely hard to stagger to deal a big attack. It's much worse with heavy weapons and handles on which heavy attacks do multiple hits. Since stagger only applies on the last hit. This leads to the situation where the boss is staggerable, and you find a window to fully charge a heavy attack, AND you hit them, but you only manage to hit them twice out of the 3 attacks you have in the animation - and the boss hits you out of it. No stagger for you and some lost health as a gift.

[b] - Boss mechanics:[/b] While boss art design is great, boss game design is awful. First issue has already been mentioned a million times: 2 phase bosses. They are not fun, especially when it's a completely different boss in the second phase. Sure, one or two surprise appearances spice up the game, but when basically every boss after the 3rd one is some variation of a 2 phase boss - it's just annoying. 

Bosses are too tanky. You never feel like you damage the boss, rather you just chip away at the giant health pool they have. Add to that the health regeneration and you get extremely annoying boss encounters. And you usually do it twice :)

[b] - Boss runbacks:[/b] Why do they exist in a post Elden Ring world? Why do I have to run to the bosses door each time I die? Just why? Your souls spawn outside the door, you basically get no punishment for dying besides spending your consumables. The only punishment is you have to slog through half a level holding the B button to fight the boss again. Sure, they are mostly not long, but they shouldn't be there at all. No one likes boss runbacks. 

[b] - Level designs:[/b] General level design is boring and too easy. This creates a giant difficulty spike between levels you play and bosses you defeat on those levels. The developers seem to think that everyone likes poison swamp, rolling boulders and status effects in soulslike. So you get a lot of extremely annoying places where you'll be poisoned and trapped. Again, this kind of thing can spice up a level or two, IF you don't expect it. In Lies of P basically every other item pick up or bridge is a trap, you become accustomed to it and just get annoyed when the fifth bridge in a row breaks under you. 

I also hope you like dealing with status effects, since there are a ton. And a ton of levels where status effect dealing enemies and props are a big obstacle.

[b] - Enemy designs:[/b] Annoying. That's it. Too many status effects and too tanky.

[b] - Item drop rates:[/b] Why do I have to buy items that would literally be abundant trash in other soulslike? You even have to buy pebbles (cogs in this case) to throw and get the enemy attention. 

[b] - Gemini:[/b] Shut up already, I don't want exposition thrown at me and listening to his snarky comments makes me sick. 

[b] - Enemy health regen:[/b] I don't care that I can remove this with the P-organ mods, this shouldn't have been in the game. This game doesn't encourage aggressive play and this mechanic showcases this problem.

However, I ultimatively refunded this game because the combat just feels really lacking and stiff to me. The stiffness I would assume is due to everything being mechnical puppets. It makes sense for the animations to feel more rugged and less organic.

I am not a huge fan of parrying mechanics so I knew ahead of time that there will be some periods during my playthrough where I am not enjoying it as much as I would like to. That said, the parrying feels really bad compared to other titles in the genre. 

Bosses especially, quickly turn into a slogfest. This is the only souls-like where I have experienced this much frustration and apathy during boss battles. I can die 30 times to any given boss in the Souls-series, Elden Ring or Nioh-series and still have a good time. In Lies of P however, this is not the case.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Parry-focused gameplay - the parry or 'perfect block' system requires very little windup, compared to prominent Soulslikes (like Elden Ring) - it's much closer to games like Jedi Fallen Order/Survivor and Thymesia. There have been comparisons made to Sekiro, but I haven't played that game. Mastering it also makes a lot of enemies much easier.
[*] Good enemy variety - a lot of enemy variety (common and bosses) with different movesets and strategies needed to counter them, especially for a game that isn't all that long.
[*] Innovative customizations - You can combine the handle of one weapon with the blade of another - creating bizarre but unique weapons e.g. a greatsword with a rapier handle will block a decent amount of damage, while also being a reasonably fast weapon. Further weapon modifications, variety of gear, and the skill tree combine to provide some build variety.
[*] Decent storyline - For once, a game in this genre actually has a fully manifested storyline, with twists and turns, characters having their own hidden agendas, and mysteries to be uncovered. It's a whole lot better than an outline masquerading as a full story like a certain other game - 'kill+loot demigods, burn tree, kill Gods.'
[*] Music - near the start of the game, you get a gramophone record from an old lady, as reward for a sidequest. This might sound like a meh reward, until you actually play it, and then replay it a dozen times in quick succession. The same goes for most of the soundtracks in the game. In a nice twist, actions like listening to music, lying, showing mercy etc. impacts your level of humanity, and affects how the game ends.
[*] Graphics - quite amazing graphics, especially for this genre. Good to see a game that doesn't look like some dated PS4 stuff.
[/list]

Cons:
A whole lot of questionable decisions have been made involving the combat system. While there is some variance, the core combat loop in boss battles is to parry the majority of the boss's attacks (possibly breaking his weapon), retaliating with charged heavy attacks after each combo. Eventually, this causes a stance break, allowing you to inflict massive damage. Rinse and repeat. Some throwable items and special attacks (legion arms, fable arts) can speed things up, but this is the basic loop.

[list]
[*] Parry timing is incredibly tight, much tighter than the Jedi games or Thymesia. Collective opinion seems to be that it's tighter than even Sekiro, which was considered the hardest game in the genre.
[*] You get no reward for parries - no instant stance break after a long series of perfect parrying. There is an upgrade in the skilltree that supposedly does this, but I've never been able to get it to work. Instead, you must land a charged heavy while the boss is vulnerable to it (health bar flashing white).
[*] Parrying can push you back, especially if you've parried a long combo. That leaves you often too far to close the distance and perform a charged heavy, before the boss can power up another combo.
[*] Fully charged heavies are *slow* - making it harder to connect before the boss retaliates. Later in the game, you get a throwable item called a shot put, that can stance break enemies when they're vulnerable, which helps a little - but it shouldn't have to compensate for a fundamental flaw in the combat system.
[*] In addition, you have no hyperarmor while using fully charged heavies - so even a quick jab from the boss will interrupt your attack. This makes entire classes of huge weapons very difficult to use.
[*] Some bosses make no sense, and have ridiculous designs. e.g. you meet a half-mad dude stuck alone in a puppet factory, and despite his condition, he somehow is able to continuously keep attacking (more stamina than the player who is a machine?). Parrying him is useless, even when his weapon breaks, he just keeps spamming attacks and interrupting your own. You end up having to dodge and backstab him repeatedly.
[*] The camera positioning is horrible, especially for large bosses - you cannot often see the attack coming because all of the screen is taken up by the boss's torso. In a game focused on parrying attacks, well....
God forbid that you end up with your back to a wall, and said boss right next to you, for then you're effectively blinded. It's 2023 guys, other games have solved or at least partly mitigated this camera problem.  This makes several boss fights unnecessarily difficult - Archbishop Andreus, Swamp Monster, Simon Manus etc.
[*] Not just the charged heavies, but even in almost every other aspect - the player is slow, extremely so. This is in stark contrast to many of the bosses, who blitz around the arena at speeds that make ER's Maliketh look tame.
[*] A couple of GOD-AWFUL boss gank fights. Tedious and tiring to say the least.
[/list]

PS: For those facing the issues above, going with a Technique build, starting off with a Rapier Handle+Greatsword of fate blade, and then eventually getting the Trident of the Covenant will help. Both these weapons have decent speed, blocking ability, damage and charged heavy movesets that have some range - it doesn't completely mitigate all the issues, but is better than nothing.",1701408025,1701410309,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Aside from that, this game features cool bosses and a fascinating lore.

I'm glad I played and defeated most of the bosses before the nerfs. Hopefully, the skills I've acquired from this game will carry over to other Souls-like games.",1695121090,1701408275,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Despite the fact that I'm no stranger to souls flavor combat, having finished the Dark Souls trilogy/Bloodborne/Elden Ring, [i]and[/i] that I'm playing the game after various patches and improvements for combat have been introduced, I still got my ass handed to me so many times during this game--almost all of which, I should add, are very much fair fights. Nearly every time I fall to a boss, I will know exactly what mistake I made, and why I failed. It's a tremendous task to make boss fights difficult but still fair, and Neowiz had done an absolutely phenomenal job with their designs. [spoiler]With the minor exception of the Black Rabbit fights. God I hate those guys.[/spoiler]

What I particularly enjoyed about the combat system is the sheer flexibility of it: from the weapon assembly system to general approach to encounters, this is truly following the Souls' spirit of ""use anything that will help you survive"", and perhaps even more effectively implemented to a degree, just by its obligatory melee style and the sheer enemy difficulty. As I got deeper into the game, I found myself actively seeking out different play styles and strategies, utilizing all my resources, trying out all the weapon arts and attacks, learning to rely on something other than dodges... Because my old tricks that carried me through all the Souls games no longer suffice. I'm once again presented with challenges above my current skills, and I have to work [i]hard[/i] to overcome these obstacles. Nearly all the endgame bosses got my heart racing like I'm facing the Fume Knight or Nameless King once again, and that. Is. AWESOME.

The level design is also fantastic. It's no DS1 (but let's face it, DS1 is going to be one of its kind for a long, long time), but the shortcuts placements, enemy allocations, and the developer's clear mindfulness of player attrition are outstanding. This is a game that has been tested and played extensively, and all the balancing efforts are very clear even to a lay person like me.

Oh, and did I mention the art direction? The costumes, the weapons, the art pieces, the general atmosphere--gorgeous. Just absolutely gorgeous. And the music... oh the music. Let me just tell you, that first time I listened to the record in Hotel Krat reminded me of my first encounter with Gwyn. I still get goosebumps just thinking about it. I also love how each record's description is a small story all onto itself--I got teary eyed many times just reading them.

I can go on for days just to pour out my absolute adoration for this game, but if you're a Souls like enthusiast, or just a fan of ARPGs in general, you should definitely give this game a shot. It will not disappoint.",1701399072,1701399211,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I streamed this game on Twitch and while the vods won't last because I'm choosing not to highlight them, these are my thoughts.

Story: 3.5 out of 5
Not covering the actual plot, what I will talk about is the power of choice should feel important. The choices you make, the lies and truths in this game, act more as moral dilemmas. They're not really asking Geppetto's puppet, but you the player. That's all well and good, I'm all for that, but not here. Now some choices do lead to how your puppet is affected in the game, but overall, it does little impact to the endings. In Dark Souls, your ""moral dilemmas"" were more defined by what you did physically, it felt more like you were making impact to the evolving story around you and the npc lives. Personally, I think Lies of P would have done better with a linear story, or limited choices, have more personality with your puppet, flesh him out more. I know the argument could be made that because he's a puppet, it should be ultimately up to you and his free-will is a blank canvas, and while we do see hints of his personality with some bosses and npcs, I want more. A puppet that can tell lies would be more interesting if he had a forming personality as well.

Gameplay: 5 out of 5
Combat for this game is where it shines the most. Fights feel fluid and bosses are hard, but have good forgivings and openings for those that give good attention. Weapons and their different assembles you can make are fantastic. From rapidfire poking enemies with a hot iron blade duck taped to a piston, to going completely unga bunga with a bargin bin thor's hammer attached to a police baton. You pick and choose and go nuts with it. Honestly, its a very nice mixture of dark souls and bloodborne.

Music and sound: 4 out of 5
Boss music is kind of forgettable, aside from a select few stand out pieces, standard crescendos and that one would normally find in a souls like are here. What makes this higher is the records you find in game, and the sounds of the world. These two together really immerse you in the game, make hits matter, and build upon your emotions.

Overall thoughts:
If you're looking for a good and true souls-like, this is honestly one of the best entry points you can start from. See for yourself and enjoy the city of Krat

[i]I don't consider myself as a soul veteran, but I completed almost every games by FromSoftware and other like Nioh 2 / Code Vein... So I had to try Lies Of P.[/i]

[h3]Welcome to Hotel Krat[/h3]
Lies Of P is soul-like genre inspired by Dark Souls , also some Sekiro and the world of Lies Of P reminds easily Bloodborne (which it's good is not it ?). The game set in 19th century Paris-like where puppets are a big part of the universe. Visuals are nice, environments are really detailed and OST is a big hit!
Boss fights are epic, and their animations are top-notch. And for players who struggle at boss, spectre NPC are really helpful (optional obviously).
The hole atmosphere is truly immersive and guess what ? Lies Op P is a day one optimized game! Quite rare nowadays.

[h3]At the house of Vegnini[/h3]
Parry window is way too tight and make every encounter slightly frustrating and most of the time, you have to be in the hub in order to level-up. I know it's supposed to be challenging, but the last levels are a bit annoying.
Some mobs won't lose aggro for ages, and they follow you for a long distance haha. Please leave me alone !

Well, except the parry window, there are just minors flaws.

A bit easier than From's games as well; I've died three times (again, so far), once to a boss and twice to clutter that wasn't breakable, and I'm past the third boss. So make of that what you will.

In terms of the new mechanics, I've not used them too much, but the ability to 'augment' (for lack of a better word) P with new abilities is nice, and looks like it has a lot of potential. I also like the addition of a 'shinobi prosthetic', to help diversify builds and play-styles.

One gripe I have (and this may change as I get deeper) is a general lack of enemy variety; most common enemies look very similar, and their attack patterns are almost identical, with some few exceptions. As annoying as ranged enemies might be, fighting the same enemy repeatedly is just boring. The bosses and minibosses are fine and all, but the stuff between them can be kinda meh. 

Again, I do recommend the game, but don't go in expecting it to be better than if it came out of FromSoftware. Easily, Lies of P is one of the best soulsborne games from another studio, but it does lack a bit of that Miyazaki flair.",1701377830,1701377830,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

It has a very common souls-like gameplay formula that you would expect from the series, with enough uniqueness to make it it's own thing. You get a mechanical arm that can be used as a weapon along with your myriad of other weapons. You can upgrade all your weapons and arm as well as create whole new weapons by combining hilts and weapon ends. So you could make something like a mace with a saber handle, and I have also seen melee weapons with pistol-like hilts that create some unique weapon effects. You can upgrade Pinnochio directly as well to enhance his stats and capabilities. There is a lot to love and do here.

Unlike Fromsoft games, Lies of P takes a more direct approach to story-telling and it benefits a lot from it, if you can get into the unique world-building. Essentially, the puppets have gone rogue and taken over Krat, and Pinnochio is on a one-puppet (man?) mission to end it.

The lie system is pretty cool. I am not 100% sure how it works, but I guess the more you lie the more ""human"" you become, which is an interesting mechanic. I believe it has different endings based on some of your choices as well. 

The game was not that difficult at the start, but the further you get into it the more relentless the enemies are. This is definitely not one I would recommend to a beginner of the genre, but there are plenty of tools and even help you can call upon to aid you in the most difficult challenges.

First, the game is very linear, like extremely linear. Personally, it's refreshing, but it can be a turn-off.

Second, the game is very hard. REALLY hard. Granted, this is my first soulslike, but the game really pushes you to read the animations effectively and parry as much of it as possible, while also repositioning constantly and keeping track of your stamina, all in a breakneck pace. Pinocchio definitely gets staggered like crazy by some attacks and enemies, but it creates tension and makes for an interesting puzzle, at least to me. But every boss and even some mini-bosses will take at least 5 tries to beat.  I love that as it means every boss has something unique and interesting to offer, something that tests both skill and strategy. But, that's not something might expect from a Pinocchio game. Also, for the love of God, stop playing Lies of P like Sekiro/BB/Dark Souls etc. expecting it to let to do a no-damage run your first playthrough. This is Lies of P and should be played like Lies of P, not Sekiro, nor Bloodborne, and that's what makes this game truly special, IMO. It didn't make me want to quit or play more FS games, it made me want to play Lies of P. And that's what's important, it isn't for everyone not just because it's a hard game, it isn't for everyone because of it's unique gameplay that demands the player to parry AND dodge situationally. Some people won't like it, and that's fine, but some of the hate this game received is unjustified, especially in regards to animations (especially when it comes to parrying, as players tap the guard button instead of holding it for half a second longer, which largely removes any problems with parrying) and ""sluggish feel"" which is largely a result of poor stamina management in part of the player. It made me terrified of giving it a try, but thanks to the demo, my fears were wiped clean and I'm so glad. I would've missed out on one of my favorite games this year. 

Last, the theme, story and artstyle. VERY unorthodox, but very unique if nothing else. It also amazes me how many grotesque/horrifying things can come from this kind of thing. Definitely not a kid's game if the soulslike category didn't make that obvious. Personally, I found it very captivating. But, like the linear level design, it can be a pretty big turn-off.

That said, for how much I love this game, it isn't perfect. In terms of personal cons, 

 One, camera sucks. There's this weird change of FoV and shift of perspective when locking on, the former affecting ""big"" boss/mini-boss battles, and the latter in the sections where you have to traverse across narrow beams very high from the ground. 

Second, attacks getting cancelled by the weapon getting stuck randomly on a wall, railing, pole, tree or whatever that an attack get caught in... is EASILY the worst part of this game. I can't believe for all the BS this game receives, something this annoying somehow gets no flak whatsoever. It's not even like all attacks get stuck. Some attacks, FROM THE SAME WEAPON, mind you, get stuck while others don't. For weapons with a thrust based moveset, this is largely a non-issue, but for slashing weapons... ooooh boyy, let me tell you. Out of all the things that made me want to break a controller it was EASILY the most infuriating.",1701354865,1701354865,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

Lies of P is the first true step-up in the FromSoftware formula, that does not come from FromSoftware.
Snappy combat, has its own learning curve, and stands on its own two legs.

- You get to mix any blade you want, with any move set and specials you want!
- Elemental builds are *super viable*! These come in the shape of 'dude with magic sword wielding X', and not spells.
- First game of its kind where blocking, rolling, Perfect Guard'ing, and poise are ALL viable, useful options. This game does NOT have parry as a core mechanic.
- Map design is on-point! A lot of shortcuts and a self-enclosing maps. A lot to discover, very little chance of getting stuck or lost.

Charming game with a lot of love put into it. Very linear even compared to Bloodborne. It's a fun game, but lacks difficulty balance. Puppets feel very hard to predict because they are constantly bobbling around like Hitler at the horse racing track. How can I predict movement when the enemies don't choreograph any movement? If you have poor reaction time and rely on learning movesets in Souls-like games, I genuinely don't believe this is going to be fun for you fighting many bosses. 

Difficulty: Easy until you fight bosses who are damage sponges and attack very unpredictably. Every puppet boss is going to make the game more challenging because of bouncing around and have little to no ""tells"" for upcoming attacks.

Story: The story is okay. I enjoyed a decent chunk of it, but sometimes the characters will talk for centuries about things the game doesn't share information beforehand to actually immerse you in it. I don't want to chat about something I have no stake in beforehand. Souls games generally keep the meat in the background and only give you little drips of water on the foreground. Not that this game isn't it's own entity, but it is basically Bloodborne-lite with puppets, so I think it's fair to compare.

Sound: Solid sound design, enjoyable ambience and pleasant soundtrack.

Now it might sound like there's a lot of complaining, so let's go into some of my favorite parts of this game. 

+Enjoyable combat, very fluid attacks and combos 
+Fast loading screens
+Great weapon diversity + balance for different playstyles
+Non-linear leveling and skill tree progression
+Very visually appealing
+Fluid movement 
+Fun story (Until it becomes convoluted towards the end)
+Unique boss designs both visually and in gameplay
+Solid Enemy placements on the map. Generally fair and the surprises can be predicted

Here's my largest qualms now 

-Poor difficulty scaling
-Too many throwables, which I think attempts to fill in for the difficulty curve
-Bobblehead enemies that you'll have trouble predicting
-Lacking in content for $60
-Hallway simulator
-Rambling nonsense NPC dialogue as you progress through the game
-Asking for Sekiro blocking without the visual cues that game offered


Overall I enjoyed this game. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I play other souls games before it? Also yes. It's one of the best outside of FROMSOFTWARE souls games, but I don't think it can stand with any of those titles in terms of balance. For a ""small"" studio, I am very impressed with the level of polish this game offers. I believe the story and difficulty loses it's stability and becomes a bit off the rails as the game progresses, but still everything feels complete. I personally didn't enjoy a lot of dialogue and boss challenge as time went on, but this is a very polished game. It is a complete game. I believe $40 would've been a better price-point. I would recommend getting it on sale or first watching someone else play.

Lies of P's concept sounds like a cool mashup of genres you would come up with for a game that won't ever be made. 

""Dude, imagine a souls game where you play as Pinocchio."" Except not only was this game actually made, but it is in my opinion the best game of 2023.

This game excels in everything. First off, its 2023 and this game worked at launch. No glitches, poor performance, or developer apology letters. It is a fully baked game with an extreme level of polish made in Unreal Engine 4, which is not old news despite developers marketing their 150GB unoptomized UE5 games as next gen and revolutionary.

The setting and story is the strongest aspect of this game. The twist on the old fairy tale of Pinocchio works so well as a darker, expanded story with aspects of the original cleverly utilized throughout the entire game. The levels are beautifully designed with Belle Epoque era themed architecture, enemy puppet designs, and VERY BLOODBORNE inspired sections as well.

Mechanic wise, other reviews have already explained much better than I, but what's important is that the familiar and addicting progression/gameplay loop of all good souls games is here, with a lot of unique and new things here. There is a lot more depth to progression than just your levels, which allows for multiple different gameplay styles. 

The combat is the bread and butter of the game, and it is perfect. This game draws from Bloodborne's primarily aggressive combat style. Lies of P pulls through where Bloodborne's awkward ""parrying"" mechanic lacks, however. Blocking with the incredibly tight parry window in order to build stagger is intense and incredibly rewarding, especially when you land the staggering heavy and fatal blow. These are heavy hitting, flashy, and satisfying.

You can tell that the developers saw this game as a work of art above all. They should be incredibly proud and deserve every penny. 

[h3] If this game is on sale, wait and buy it at full price. [/h3]

- The Gameplay is NOT satisfying, perfect guarding AND dodging? Huge variety of weapons and customization? HORRENDOUS.

The levels rewarded exploration and I never got stuck aimlessly wandering around.

Lies of P is the best Souls-like I've played that's not made by fromsoft and a fantastic love letter to Bloodborne. It's a little rough around the edges and sometimes it feels like a well-done mod (I don't know how else to describe it). The adaptation of Pinocchio mashed into a dark steampunk aesthetic gels nicely together.
 
It wears its inspiration on a huge billboard, right in your face. There's a poison ""swamp"" and Sen's fortress just to name a few. changing out weapon blades and hilts is a fascinating idea, leading to hundreds of combinations, however (probably my fault) I have no idea on what the effects of doing so are. There have been multiple times where the hit detection has been off, The guard or ""rally"" mechanic is a treat, making small mistakes recoverable.

Gameplay wise it's closer to Sekiro with the perfect blocking you can do, but you can also dodge too if that's more your style (except for red attacks, you can only perfect block those, unless you have a certain amulet), though the game encourages you to perfect block more than dodging.

Took me almost 30hs for the first playthrough and immediately started a new game + because of how good it is.

In fact, the last two bosses of this game were incredibly difficult. Very, very rewarding once beat. Simon Manus is easily in the conversation for top 5 toughest bosses in the souls-like genre.

Pros: Cool attires and weapons design, cool early stage map design, good story telling, every NPC has its own little cool story line. Best part is the normal weapon assemble system.

Cons: (1) Very janky enemy movements on a game that requires frequent parry to success. Although parry window is already very strict, there is no real benefit from landing a parry. (2) Every boss has 2 phases, but for many bosses, their 2 phases are completely distinct in appearances and movesets, making me wonder why don't split those and make 2 bosses for good?

the main issues with the game is that's that the difference between the normal health and medium health enemies is absolutely absurd, goes from 2-3 hits to a whole ass mini-boss; and that any enemy that is able to block will block you from hitting them, and will hold that until you hit them and get guard stunned or force them to and they either just swing at you or try a whole ass combo, other than that your sitting there staring at them with ZERO openings.
another is just how aggressive the bosses are where most have ZERO openings. best example is the Walker of Illusions. theres zero openings, and when there is theres almost a gaurentee that youll take damage too.

I'm a HUGE fan of souls like games. I've put thousands of hours across numerous titles (Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3, Elden Ring, Lords of the Fallen, Sekiro)

After reading reviews for Lies of P, it sounded right up my alley. I couldn't have been more mistaken. One thing I can NOT stand in these games is the in-ability to roll/dodge effectively. Lies of P demands you parry. You will not have much success otherwise, and this I absolutely despise. When it's my choice to parry as it's inline with my character build, then I am more than happy to do so. When I feel I am forced to parry as there is no other path to success I find it absolutely infuriating. 

I will say, the graphics are beautiful, the music is very atmospheric and suiting. I know this game will scratch an itch for many many gamers, but it is not a title that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the freedom to dodge/roll out of the way of attacks.",1701124242,1701124242,False,2,2,0.481081068515777588,0,True,False,False

Let me just start by saying that Lies of P is a beautiful game, the graphics are amazing and it is incredibly well optimised. It is refreshing when you take into account that most games released nowadays run like you'd expect an obese person to. From an artistic standpoint, Lies of P is the type of game that most other strive to be but fail to become. Everything from the world design, the music, the bosses the enemies and even the weapons are completely stunning. This game is appealing to the eye and it certainly helps when it comes to easing you into the endless deaths you'll have to endure if you wish to reach its ending.

[h3]The Gameplay[/h3]
When it comes to the gameplay of the game, you'll find that it's rather simple and direct. Combat consists of limited amount of healing, quick attacks, slash attacks and strong attacks (this varies depending on your weapons), blocks dodges and perfect blocks. Let me also add that it adds a fresh component with the arm mechanic. The arm is a powerful tool which you'll get to modify and choose to your liking. The arm can be a shield which deals damage in retaliation, a grapple to bring enemies to you or you to them and more. I personally did not feel the need to explore more of the arms since I personally found the puppet string arm to be the best one of the bunch. Overall, this simple yet responsive combat system keeps encounters fresh and fun. There are consumables in the game but ultimately, I found them rather useless and sold most of them except those which allow you to buff your weapon with elemental damage.

[h3]The Progression System[/h3]
The progression system is very well thought out. By fighting foes, you'll gain ergo which can be used to level up your attributes. Depending on the build you're going for, you'll be able to choose between 6 different area to assign these points. Ergo is dropped when you die but can be recovered by returning to where you died and picking it back up. Thankfully, the developers were smart enough to include a fail safe to protect your dropped ergo from being in zones which would risk killing you over and over again. As the game progresses you'll find Quartz and Components which will allow you to gain new skills from a skill tree, to upgrade your weapons and to upgrade your arm. What I particularity enjoyed with the Quartz system is that they tend to be dropped by mini-bosses, making fighting them worth the effort rather than a tedious worthless task. 

[h3]Making your own Weapons[/h3]
Finally, there's the craft system. As you progress in the game you'll find multiple weapons inside of chests. Don't get me wrong the loot is amazing and the combos you can create by assembling a handle and a blade is incredibly interesting. In a way, you get to forge your own tool of mass destruction to play the way you like it. However, by the time you reach the end of the game you'll most likely forget that feature due to the fact that you'll have committed to upgrading a single weapon. Once you're used to a certain play style, it becomes a bit uninteresting to change even if the game constantly throws new blades that are even more good looking from the prior ones you've found.

[h3]The Narrative[/h3]
I feel like Lies of P's story and side quests is one of the more interesting semi-linear story I've seen in a while. Although the world did not give me countless amounts of decisions to reforge it, it gave me the decisions which would reforge me and the way I saw it. You play Gepetto's puppet and you are essentially a robot. However, you are unlike the other puppets because you can lie. This ability can lead you to become something that is much more human. Without spoiling much of this aspect, it is difficult for me to tell you more. However, I can guarantee you that the story kept me more than engaged with the game and that it is a tale I'll remember for a long time.

[h3]The Bad[/h3]
Although I absolutely loved the game and I did not find it difficult but rather I found it just challenging enough to be fun, there are a few things which I feel were rather annoying. Let's start with the first thing: Disruption. In Lies of P, some enemies inflict debuffs upon your character. Although most debuffs are more than fine and completely balanced, disruption chose to be the black wolf of the bunch and opted to one shot kill you if your gauge fills up. One-hit kills are never a fun mechanic in any games. Disruption is not over used but in the short time span which it was, the encounters were much more frustrating than fun. Then, you've got the loot on the ground. Frankly, the loot in this game tends to be a bunch of worthless stuff which eventually makes you question why you're even picking it up. Consumables aren't interesting or required in a play-through and since the loot pool consists of mostly consumables, it makes the system falls flat a bit.

I've started a NG+ run and so far the whole thing seems alright to me. I'm somewhat disappointed that there aren't many changes to the enemies to create a bigger challenge but I suppose that 33 hours of content is already quite a bit for most games. Plus, I wouldn't be surprised if a few updates came along to make the end game more interesting, there's a lot of potential for it at the moment.

[h3]My Conclusion[/h3]
In conclusion, Lies of P is a FINISHED POLISHED game. Which means, you won't find yourself fighting against the game itself to have it run decently. The combat system is simple, easy to get the hang of and one of the most fun combat system I've seen in most games. The way progression is handled in Lies of P adds flavour to the overall gameplay and replayability to the eras you've already visited. In my opinion, if it wasn't for Baldur's Gate 3, Lies of P would be the game of the year of 2023, which it would 100% deserve. If you're scared of buying the game because it might be difficult, don't worry it's nothing you won't be able to handle. I had never played a Souls-Like and I managed perfectly fine. 

Lies of P is the game that got me into Souls-Like and it was phenomenal. Thanks to it, I plan on going for more than just a dip into the genre.",1701111526,1701114148,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

After almost 100 hours and after almost finishing my second playthrough, it still blows my mind how perfectly Neowiz seemed to have studied what made Souls games so captivating and rewarding for thousands of players. If you are a fan of this genre, this should be an absolute must-play and is well worth the price. 

However, if you are simply looking for an action game with a good story and some RPG elements, you might be turned off by this game. Not because this game doesn't have a a great and nuanced story with detailed worldbuilding and a polished combat system that encourages diversity (which it absolutely delivers); but because the difficulty curve is one of the highest I have experienced so far in games. Although this game does offer some opportunities to lower the difficulty of bosses and area traversal (e.g. overpowered throwing items, NPC summons for bosses, low levelling cost), Neowiz takes the same approach of player perseverance that linear games like Sekiro adopt. Particularly in the early-game, this can be frustrating and off-putting for players, as many enemy attacks are quite punishing. I admit that I was put off by the game's oddly small window for successful parries and a seemingly disproportionate level of risk for the amount of reward you get for these individual actions when I had played the demo. You could absolutely interpret this as a fault of the developers and I would be hard-pressed to defend these developmental choices, but nonetheless I still purchased the full game and persevered throughout the rest of the game. And you know what? It was genuinely really fricking fun! 

That's it, that's the end of the review lol. Though I could delve into more detail, it wouldn't really add to the overall message I'm trying to get across with this review.

its sad that this game's story is VERY interesting, but if you can handle how bad the dodging is then good luck cuz literally there are enemies everywhere and they attack faster than you and your attack animation takes forever to hit even with the balanced weapon, if your okay with dodging for 1~3 whole min and then hitting for 1 second then this is for you oh and lets not forget that the dodging is broken so yea good luck on that first boss, even the perfect dodge is broken and doesn't work, it will count as either a dodge or late dodge

a tip for dodging:
if you see the enemy is trying to trigger the attacking animation then dont hit and wait to dodge, thats the only way i could dodge tbh

would i buy the game again? only if it had a big discount or the combat was fixed other than that i would rather wait",1701108128,1701108128,False,0,1,0.459518581628799438,0,True,False,False

it's by no means difficult, it's just fun, you will have a hard time with it if you believe it to be Blodborne, or Sekiro, this is it's own thing, you need to make the call on when to block, when to dodge, when to exploit your perfect parry, do you summon the phantom ? it up to you, the game doesn't penalize you for it.

Lie, Don't lie, play the game whichever way you feel, just have fun, experiment with weapons, the developers made it very accessible to re - speck your character to the most minute detail, [attributes/  P-Organ/ Legion arm] just keep collecting those Golden coin fruits regularly.

They do a very good job at telling the story, although you do still need to read Item descriptions if you want to fully dive into the aspects of the city and its citizens, before the collapse of Krat.

Lots of sad stories to unveil, but that's up for the course when there are Two apocalyptic disasters happening in the same city At the SAME time, seemingly unrelated to one another...... or so one would think.

The city is Beautiful in its destruction, the streets, the architecture, enemy designs are top notch.

Only complain I had, My one Nick Pick, it's that the game lock you out off the reward of a side quest very early on your first play through, and you wont know until the very end of the game when you are missing an ""ITEM"" that you probably are not able to obtain at that point if you decided to be a TECH Build, but since the game is meant to be played at least twice to fully grasp the whole story ....I guess it's not to much of a problem since on your second go round you know you have to pick the rest of the ""ITEMS"" you didn't grab to complete your Collection wink-wink.

Give A try i Wasn't certain but end up buying on a whim due to the sale, and have being playing non stop, now I just need to get all the collectibles, unlike other games, this one is very manageable.

This game is very strong for a first-time effort from the devs, and plays like a love-letter to all of From's portfolio  -  taking elements from their entire back-catalogue, especially Bloodborne.

It is far more than a bargain-bin imitation though, ensuring it pushes forward with unique gameplay mechanics of its own + a unique setting/twist leaninng into the story of Pinocchio.

The developers took a formula that Fromsoft built and actually made their own twist on it. The Pinochio theme is really inspired, a fantastic way to build your own world based on a commonplace name. The game play is smoother than any other soulslike other than the OG, really felt good to play. My only complaint is that the different builds in the game dont feel particularly different. This also leads to no real way to ""Cheese"" a boss. In my opinion a very fun part of dark souls is discovering all the little tricks and secrets for beating each boss. There were no secrets to be found in the bosses of this game. The level design and boss design is inspired though, just not enough secrets and tricks for me.

Unique Features
You can mix and match weapon movesets and blades, with the fact you only need to upgrade the ""blade"" it makes it easy to test other handle and movesets.
Guarding enemy attacks causes chip damage that can be recovered by attacking(like bloodborne). Perfect blocking causes stagger damage.
A ""upgrade"" tree in addition to your stats, allowing you to modify your playstyle.(Such as dodge orientated or block focused), as well as the legion arm equipment, allowing for unique moves(Like a exploding shield or grabbing arm)

While the game is linear, the map itself uses clever shortcuts such that your starting position never change, bvut by unlocking doors you can take shortcuts. The maps on the other hand is disjointed, which I guess is to be expected when you need long corridors.

The durability system is well balanced, and the combat lost the weird floaty feeling pretty quickly. The characters are awesome, and i don’t just mean P and the fact I think he’s kinda hot.

Ever since the OG ""Demons Souls"" released on PS3 I've been ruthlessly addicted to the punishing genre. This was another wonderful entry into the small Souls/Borne category. Combat is reminiscent of the genre, meaning it's punishing but predictable. Learn your boss attack patterns and remember the five D's of dodgeball, dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge. The weapons are where the game separates itself from the competition. Have a sick fireaxe head and want to attach it to your dagger handle? Have at it! Most weapons come with the ability to be split into two components and swapped allowing for creation of some rather unique weapons. Scenery is standard for the genre and the morality system is very interesting. Should you lie your way to your humanity or tell the truth and remain prisoner, forever locked in your wooden cell? Regardless I suggest you grab the game if you're a fan of the genre at all. You won't be sorry.

An extraordinary game if we consider that it is the first truly important project of this Korean software house, NEOWIZ must be supported and financed, since they are a software house with great potential.",1701036100,1701036100,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're familiar with souls games, i recommend this game, but for other players i would say probably not due to this game being more difficult than the average video game. 
Combat is great! Blocking attacks will take away stamina and take away health but can be earned back by attacking (and blocking if you get the skill from the skill tree). So if you know you cant parry, just block then attack to get your health back. Parry times are easy (to me, others say its too hard to parry. Just get good scrub). Weapons have special abilities that require ""fate"" (aka mana) to use, which is gained by attacking (and other ways that are acquired through a skill tree). The weapon abilities are more meant for elites and bosses so when you do need them you should already have some mana saved up.
Health Vials are similar to Dark Souls except the max amount of vials is increased by killing certain bosses and through the skill tree.
After a while, the player is given a special arm that has a ability to pull small enemies to the player.  Most enemies are slow so having the ability to separate enemies from groups is amazing. Later on the player can get upgrades for the arm and new arms entirely, like a flamethrower, acid sprayer, missile launcher and a few others.
Blades and handles from weapons are swappable. So you can mix and match weapons. Have a dagger but dont like the short range? Just change the handle to something longer like a spear handle.
There are 3 stat builds the player can do:
-Motivity (strength)
-Technique (dexterity)
-Advanced (elemental)

My friend did strength and didnt struggle with the game at all. We started the game at the same time but he beat it first.
I did 1 playthrough with Technique and another playthrough with Advanced. Advanced felt more flexible with the weapon types and dealt way more damage. So if you can decide on a stat build, i would say Advanced but make sure to use a weapon element the enemy is weak to (use shock/electricity when fighting puppets)
Plently of different enemies, bosses, weapons, and loot.

I've played through this game twice. First run taking 35 hours and the second run taking 12 hours. On both runs i did the few NPC quests there are and explored everything. Main reason the second run was shorter was because i learned already was familiar with the bosses and locations. Bosses on my first run took about 5-15 attempts, meanwhile the second run i beat all bosses first try except for 3 (those 3 took 2-5 attempts).

They successfully synthesized a souls game from many elements that would not normally be straightforwardly cohesive for the genre. Leaning into the innate darkness of fairy tales with contemporary explorations of Robots and humanity (Nier, Pluto) to supplement the puppet filled narrative. They assembled a voice cast that is honestly leagues above the expectations I had, and they completely sold the drama.

The Exploration is fine. The areas are overall pretty linear but tightly wound around the spawn points with plenty of shortcuts. If anything it's a bit too forgiving with spawn points for most of the experience, leaving many shortcuts little used. Plenty of set-pieces and minibosses to challenge you.

Combat is probably the most contentious part of the experience. It's very demanding and will be infuriating unless you're willing to learn and enter the flow state, but nothing feels better than landing a flurry of parries on a boss. Weapon variety is pretty good, you can mix and match common blades and handles to suit your play, but the boss weapons completely outclass them with their gimmicks and play style. Common weapons are most useful for utilizing free elemental damage (if you're having trouble on a boss literally just make sure to use elemental damage and enemy type amulet buffs).

By far the most competent non-from souls game with its own set of particularities, aside from Team Ninja titles (Nioh and the ilk are wonderful to play but the random loot driven aspect of those experiences weigh them down). Very excited that this game ended up being a surprise success and looking forward to whatever fun Fairy tale exploration NEOWIZ follows up Lies of P with.

I can forgive all this considering the devs are extremely receptive to fan feedback and take fan requests and suggestions seriously.

What i dont like:
- Story is almost trash, no details about characters, very confusing and missing points. 
- Gameplay is extremely disappointing. feels like shit when deflecting
- Music is the worst choice

What i like:
some bosses got extremely hard after the patch.

Definitely not worth the price.

The atmosphere/sound design/aesthetic are top-notch and really evocative, worldbuilding is great albeit more focused on the audiovisuals rather than e.g. flavourtext (which is likely more appealing to most but I'm a sucker for lore in flavourtext too). Performance is great with a lot of PC options like various fps caps and DLSS/FSR etc.

The gameplay is probably my biggest criticism of the game; the at times hodgepodge feeling combination of dodging and parrying can feel weird and awkward to learn. Leaning towards one or the other ala bloodborne vs sekiro might serve the devs better in designing enemies/bosses, as well as reducing confusion in the player as to which system they should be trying to 'get good' at; this last bit is likely a big sticking point for many players when starting out with the game. Frankly I would place lies of P's gameplay as below e.g. Nioh/Wo Long (and certainly well below Sekiro) when it comes to tightly designed combat systems, but it is enjoyable enough and definitely passes the bar. As well, going into NG+ I expect to have to utilize more of the mechanics such as consumable combat items which should increase my appreciation of the gameplay.

Difficulty is challenging but reasonable, I'm a seasoned souls player and completed NG in ~22 hours, only dying to a couple of bosses. One particular boss did have my heart pounding at the end but otherwise I would describe most bosses as 'interesting/cool' rather than 'epic/amazing' in terms of gameplay. Most bosses are quite impressive in terms of their presentation and music though, with only a rare few blander fights.

Overall I'd highly recommend this game to anyone interested in (probably one of the best) soulslikes, or even just interested in the general aesthetic/vibe of the game; a gentle disclaimer to the latter group that they may have to get over some clunkiness/learning hurdles at the start, but I think the rest of the game more than makes up for it.",1701014116,1701014116,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

As you explore the world, you will have the choice of telling the truth or not, for example, if you find someone who says Xenoblade is a stupid horny anime game, NieR is a Hack and Slash and not a bullet hell in disguise and it didn´t need to replay the same events with new perspective, or worst, Undertale is a meaningless game for young kids, if you say yes to all of that questions, you will gain humanity, as lying is one of the most human behavior, if this sounds like a morality system to you, it doesn´t, because there´s like very little impacts in lying or not, but beside the philosophical aspect of it, there´s very cool surprises of lying that is worth to do a lie only as your first playthought.

Make a dex build because who plays strenght anyways, and use one of the coolest mechanics I ever seen in a Soulslike, making your own weapons, as you explore, you will find weapons like you would see in other souls games, but you can split them in two to fuse with other weapons you find, are you tired of playing all the time with your trustworty weapon? Just split it i two and put the blade in other handle to change their propierties, until you pass chapter VIII and got the katana, seriously that´s one if not the most fun weapon in a Souls game I ever played, as you parry, parry, dodge, and parry even more in the finest battle system ever made in the genre.

And if all of this sounds interesting to you, is even better that is sounds, because the art and sound desing is just exquisite, and feature the best QoL in this type of game, my only complain is about the skill tree, because to fully finish it you need to go for NG++, and it has very, very good upgrades, but isn´t too much because the game is really replayable.

[b][u]TL;DR: This game is fantastic. It's my game of the year for sure. There are tons of issues and problems that I'll dive into a bit deeper, but none of the problems are dealbreakers. Meanwhile the positives on this game are really strong[/b][/u]

I've just went through the ending of the game and while I've played most Dark Souls and some other Souls like games, this is the first one where I feel the need to go through NG+ and 100% this game. I don't have a game on 100% anywhere except for Super Mario which I played with my SO for years at this point.

Lets start with the bad sides of the game:

[b]CONS[/b]
While souls like games revolve around the combat, I think the combat is the weakest point of Lies of P. Regular enemies are good solid fun, they're predictable, not too cheesy, their locations were solid but as a souls like enjoyer also very predictable. The problems arise in more tougher opponents and especially later on in the game with the bosses. As the bosses get increasingly more mobility and ranged attacks. The reason why this is a bad thing has to do with how feast or famine the combat is in boss fights. It feels like the game is pushing you towards the boss so there's not a lot of strategical movement, there's for sure some. The main thing that's expected from you is that you're parrying or at least blocking attacks. This is where Dark Souls wins in my opinion, dodging to get out of attacks simply just feels way better than hoping you hit that parry. I still haven't found a souls like game that combines dodging and parrying on an equal level, while Lies of P came close to this, the execution just isn't there.
Adding onto the point above is the hitboxes, they're inconsistent. You get hit by stuff that wasn't even close, or you're not getting hit when a sword goes straight through you.
Adding onto both is the relianc on parrying when the enemy attacks feel RNGish. They feel like there's a window in which they CAN attack but sometimes do it faster or slower. I can't 100% confirm if this is true, I've read some stuff that this is true, but it's beyond the point. Timing a parry feels terrible. Hitting a parry is decently satisfying but doesn't always have the impact that you expect or hope that it has.
The animation locking is a mechanic I wish never excisted. It's my main gripe with the game that I absolutely hate. It makes the combat feel clunky at times but animation locking is also absolutely terrible outside of combat. Killing an enemy, having to wait 2 seconds, picking up an item, having to wait 2 seconds, then being able to hit again is just bad. It's not fun, it's super annoying and I don't see a reason why this is the case. Picking up your dropped ergo on death doesn't require an animation, why does picking up an item need one?

A con apart from all of this is more or less my personal preference that some or most of you might not agree with: I don't like leveling like Lies of P does it. I don't want to respec to put my points in another stat to make different weapons useable. I also don't like that putting points into technique also means the threshold for the next lvl up on capacity increases. I'd much rather have seen the ""utility"" stats have their seperate pool apart from the ""combat"" stats and honestly have all the combat stats be seperate so that we can level them all up and use all of the weapons. I know this would require an insane rebalancing of the game and they shouldn't do this, it's just a point of feedback for me personally.

[b]PROS[/b]
So my paragraphs above are big and most people won't read them in this 5 second tiktok attention span society, but I feel it's important to give as constructive feedback as possible for the developers. For the pros I won't dive as deep into WHY I think they're pros, they speak for themself:
Lies of P map design is very linear but it does such a great job at connecting each zones that it feels like you have more freedom than most open world games do.
The attention to detail on pretty much anything in the game is simply astounding.
The voice acting might be the best I've ever seen, anywhere.
The different weapons, especially the special weapons are so much fun to play with. Mixing and matching weapons was the greatest call in development that they could've made.
The story is solid. Could've been explained a bit more earlier on and put a little bit less of the heavy lifting in the later stages of the game. That said, I actually have no complaints.
The choices are just a great addition, you can barely go wrong with adding choices. The humanity(?) system adds some deeper layer to Pinocchio.

This has to be the best (and most difficult) non FromSoftware Souls-like. In my opinion, it even competes with some of the FromSoft titles.
[list]
[*] The visuals are amazing.
[*] The combat feels incredibly satisfying and well tuned.
[*] The enemies are diverse and 90+% of them are very well made and creative.
[*] The weapons and the combinations you can do feel cool to use and well balanced.
[*] Bossfights are cinematic, yet also well designed.
[*] This is probably the first Souls-like where consumable matter. They deal a significant amount of damage, and spending the skillpoints to make them better feels worth it.
[*] Speaking of: The skill tree is very well done in my opinion. It adds another piece of loot to the pool, that you are excited to find, because it unlocks cool new skills.
[*] I have a low-to mid range PC, and never had any performance issues while playing, which I did not expect from a game looking this good.
[/list]
Here's the issues I have with the game:
[list]
[*] Parrying feels a little [i]too[/i] difficult for how important it is to the games combat.
[*] In later areas, it is very common to find low level upgrade materials, which kind of feels like they are just there to fill up the areas with loot to pick up, but since by that point you can purchase them for cheap, they feel kind of worthless. Replacing them with consumables, Ergo items or slightly higher tier materials would help with that a lot.
[*] [spoiler]The final Area of the game feels a little too long.[/spoiler] [spoiler]I really enjoyed it for the first half or so, but after the Laxasia Bossfight, in my opinion, the final boss gauntlet should have started pretty much immediately. The area after that just feels a little dragged out.[/spoiler]
[*] [spoiler]After the Bishop boss, every main boss has a second healthbar, removing any sense of surprise at it happening. Just change it to be one larger healthbar and have the transition at 50%.[/spoiler]
[/list]
All those ""issues"" are really just nitpicks. I really enjoyed my time with the game, and I'm sure I will revisit it once I've played through all the other amazing games of 2023.

Aside from my poor skill, I was able to beat the game. Plus it just got a patch that should make it easier for anyone thinking about it. I think the story was interesting.

P is slow to roll (no I am not heavy rolling), he is slow to parry, even when you perfect the timing (I don't think anyone can get past black rabbit if they don't perfect parrying) and slow to use consumables (activating the wishstone takes precious seconds, using estus is slow idk). The world design isn't anything mind-blowing. Also, if you know one boss you know them all (there aren't really that many differences between one combat and another), just get in, smack, fall back, and repeat. P is too slow to maintain closeness and attack in between breaks and then roll through combos, you have to wait for the big breaks. All the ""stay in between the boss' legs"" and ""dodge to the right because to the left you get smacked"" strategies from other Souls games are useless, and the enemy attacks are very hard to read because they're not as telegraphed as in other souls games. Also, you have to invest in stamina because perfect parrying is one sure way to stun the boss quicker, and you almost always have to spam parry because even if it seems like the boss isn't rearing up to attack, you never know. 

Another thing, when Geppetto started talking about the ""P organ"" I almost laughed myself off the chair. This is absolutely the most absurd name for an ability tree I have ever seen. Most of the times I cannot bring myself to go to update my... 🙈 P organ using quartz because of how absurd it sounds.

I loved all souls games: DS, ER, Sekiro, God of war etc. They all had amazing combat mechanics, you didn't feel like the character was unresponsive to your keyboard as you feel in Lies of P.

All in all, the game is short, unsatisfactory in all areas (combat, graphic design, soundtrack, weapons) and just plain boring. Idk how to feel about paying so much for it because I fell for positive reviews.",1700988066,1700988066,False,0,0,0.467289716005325317,0,True,False,False

Lies of P offers a very unique blend of Bioshock, American Mcgee's Alice and Dark Souls all rolled into one with its stunning visuals, Gameplay and Story. Full of unique characters that feel familiar yet unique enough to stand on their own.

The gameplay is a sort of mix between Sekiro and other souls games, Although the parrying window is a bit wonky and takes some getting use to. Not to mention like other souls games there are some bullshit attacks and abilities that can be frustrating it doesn't take away from the quality or final score.

I highly recommend this game and from what I have seen DLC and Sequels are on the way which I am defiantly keeping a eye out for. Who knew that we needed a Souls-Like Brothers Grimm classical literature universe and I looking forward to Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland souls game.

It did take longer for this game to click for me than most. It wasn't until Chapter 5 that I started to get the hang of it and not sucking, but once I got into the rhythm of the game it quickly became one of my top favorite games ever, and apparently my first game on Steam I've gotten all 100% achievements. 

The atmosphere in this game is soo good! The art direction, the mood of the environments, the character designs, and the great music! Some bosses, sadly not many, have some stand out tracks, BUT the collectable vinyl records are really something else to listen to when you're back at the main central hub area. Soo many are just such a treat that I've listened to all of them repeatedly on playlist. And has a decent story mixed in as well.

The combat gives you more options than it appears on the surface with being able to make an arsenal of mix n' match weapon blades + weapon handles, or unique special weapons, and special ability prosthetic arms. That all on top of a customizable skill tree of sorts actually gives players quite a bit to play around with to find something that feels good and fun to them. The game is hard, and it feels early bosses definitely hit you extremely hard before your gear and health start to catch up, which can make the early game bosses feel like huge hurdles to overcome, but over all I felt the difficulty of this game hit a sweet spot for me and it definitely felt well tuned and thought out, and not just randomly thrown together bull for the sake of being difficult. 

Overall, if you're into harder action rpgs, or souls games, there's a high chance you'll probably enjoy this as well.",1700987218,1700987218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, overall, it's a good game that while not as good as DS1 or DS3 or Elden Ring, is better than DS2, and comparable SteelRising in overall quality. Each one has a few thing it does better, but both are still solid and overall enjoyable most of the time.

The upsides.
+ The core gameplay, it's pretty solid, I did find a few gameplay bugs butt just a few over 40 hours of play, so most times I failed it was, arguably, me that failed on a boss.
+ The art, it's pretty good. Looks nice, decent music, nice animations, some excelent animations honestly. Some of the bosses have amazing designs and amazing animations, and frankly I just love watching them or fighting them.
+Length, it's god some pretty decent length, not up there with a From souls game, given the limited replayability and stuff to search for or find, but the basic story and path is decently long.
+Weapons, you can modify weapons to better fit differnet builds, or swap handles and blades/heads for new interesting things on some weapon types. It's... not perfect and you often don't use it, but it does make it a bit easier to swap your build or try new weapons during a run more easily. Though when only one weapon or two can reliably be upgraded enough at any given time with limited resources, that really does limit how much you can try the different weapons sadly.

Downsides
-Samey and linear world. Most of the levels are brown, black, grey, and dark. While there is some variation in the exact locations they all have too similar of a feel so without a pallete cleanser at some point it just... meh... started to get tiring. Also there's very few of those ""wow"" areas where you just stop and stare as you enter a new amazing area. Most of this game is in enclosed city streets or narrow pathways, very little open areas, and when it is it's mostly just backdrops. The world is also linear, no options, real alternate paths or branches or anything, no hidden/breakable walls by the player, overall you don't really explore or engage with the world, it just feels ike any old games linear levels for the most part. So for a souls game, it's pretty bad honestly for how you interact with the world, it didn't keep my interest a lot, and not much is memorable unlike most souls games having tons of those unique or Wow areas, or interesting exploration surprises as you find something.
-Gameplay, while mostly good, it's also got some issues. The biggest is how the game relies on parrying so much, but it's got a delay, yet some bosses have rapid attacks you can barely keep up with so it's really pushing what you can do and relying way too much on a system that isn't up to the task to readily or fluidly be used I feel. Next, when you take a hit, you have recover times and it affects your ability to do things, timings on some animations, etc... this makes your character less responsive, and not feel like they listen to you right after any one hit. This often can result in one hit turning into a chain you can't do much against and then dying. Especially against a few enemies that have strong and fast chains. Losing control of your character because of any one mistake or miss timing is not fun, especially when the game is nearly forcing you to rely on parrying for many bosses, with again, rather bad and non intuitive feeling timing for the parry system. Camera and environment also play their role here, nothing like fighting an enemy the camera can't see their moves on as they are too big, yet right in your face so you can hit them back, or when you get stuck on random tables or chairs or things scattered around the boss level and die because of it. Some bosses you won't notice any of these issues on, good telegraphing, timings, nice open levels, nicely sized for visibility, some excellent fights... but some others do really bring out some of these issues badly, so it's a mixed bag.
-Story. While it's a nice idea... and there's some good story to be had here, some of it is also just... bad, or doesn't make sense if you think about it for more than a second, for even some major story elements, using the logic of the setting itself. So... I just can't get too invested in the lore or stuff overall, but still most characters are decent and there's enough story that's still good to enjoy, but it won't suck you in like a good soulsike can, so, it's good, but not great... I only put it here in negative because, again, the biggest issues with it are just that, big obvious issues they seemingly ignored and like an enemy with missing textures on his face, it kind of stands out when playing the game... a lot... Though, mostly end game and second play through when you can figure all the key details out finally.

Overall, it's got plenty of issues, but 70-80% of the time I was enjoying myself at least decently, and there are while some bad frustrating bosses or areas... also several excellent ones that really are fun and enjoyable to fight.  So I'd say it's worth getting, especially on sale if it is. And I do look forward to more from these devs in the future, as they clearly layed out the possibility for at the end. Hopefully next time they can refine a few of those issues better from experience, but for a first shot from most of the team at souls likes, great job!",1700985395,1700985395,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The weapon break mechanic is very cool albeit not very useful, most bosses require far too many parries in order to break their weapons, the only time a bossfight has a weapon break was a shield on their back, which didnt even fully break and still blocked back attacks.

But the game has plenty of positives, the weapon system with the variety of damage with the blades, and movesets of the handles is fantastic, and with the amount of upgrade materials you receive it allows you to use as many as you'd like, respecing stats is cheap, I really like how the choices have such short time limits as it forces you to choose instead of giving you the option of googling the best outcome, lying having such major consequences is fantastic. Combat is fluid, with a few exceptions it feels obvious when you should parry/dodge although sometimes it feels you're incentivized to block rather than ""perfect block"" as they push you away leaving you less time to punish, and the rally mechanic being attached to blocking rather than overall damage like in Bloodborne solidifies it being better in a good portion of cases.

Sometimes this fits with the plot, in other ways I think there could’ve been more creativity. Some of the combat could still be more fluid, like dodging.

Like, 9.9999999~/10 but I digress. The combat is fluid and yet rigid. The world is breathtaking and huge, yet linear for gameplay purposes. The upgrades and abilities are varied and thought out to where you can approach combat with several different mentalities. The graphics are stunning and the story may not be fully in your face but is huge when it hits. 

The combat system has been deemed too hard by some but I disagree. The game doesn't hold your hand, no doubts about that. However, it also doesn't just give you rewards on a silver platter. The parry window is tight but the attacks can be timed off of instinct 80-90% of the time. Parries are also rewarded with breaking enemies weapons which makes the encounter infinitely easier. The weapons are varied and unique allowing for mixing and matching to fit one's play style as they see fit. The arms add unique abilities from a flamethrower to landmines to a grappling hook with their own upgrades as well.

The world feels lived-in and dreary yet with hope stemming from those you save. The story of whether or not this autonomous puppet will chose to follow orders or embrace his inner humanity is one that is so thick and full of character. The changes to the character as you move throughout the game are little but very noticeable after taking the time to listen and look.

Overall, the game is about as perfect in my head as a game can get. A wonderfully packaged story bound together with exhilarating gameplay and a deep sense of accomplishment as you work your way through the ruined city of Krat. It's not Dark Souls.

The many good things:
- Outstanding realisation of the souls-like genre/formula. If you enjoy these games, you'll most likely enjoy this one. Think Bloodborne aesthetics, Sekiro combat, and general Dark Souls mechanics.
- Great story. That good mix of utterly obscure, deeply unsettling, and completely fascinating.
- Hub area is ""Hotel Krat"" and it's very charming. You slowly populate it with the survivors you find as you play, including your dad. He's totally OK and Definitely Not Crazy™.
- There's an in-game cat you can pet. If you can win its trust.
- The graphics aren't just beautiful, they're well optimised. You can enjoy this game's splendour without fretting too much about your framerate. There's also some technical hints and clues that suggest ray tracing will probably be added eventually.

Some downs:
- The combat is varied enough to be interesting but can be seen as rather ""one-note"" as it mostly revolves around mastering the /incredibly/ tight parry windows. No matter what build or playstyle you're rocking, you must eventually become Parry The Platypus if you want to finish the game.
- As with all RPGs and especially souls-likes, grinding will make the game easier. Too little and you'll be overwhelmed by simple enemies, too much and you'll breeze right through. 
- Ray tracing is not here yet, and we are all the poorer for it since this game has fantastic potential for it with already-excellent lighting, scenery, and visual direction.

I don't do numbers. No stars or ?/10s from me. It's a simple question of ""Is it good or not good?""

PROS:
- Amazing weapon and build variety 
- Unique story tailored towards your emotions
- Weapon Arts (Fable) Go brrrr
- Ability to make bosses much easier with an optional NPC Summon
- Satisfying Parry system (much less forgiving than Sekiro though)

CONS:
- Overused souls-tropes, (Enemies hiding behind walls next to items, Bridges breaking underneath you, etc.)
- Legion arms are terrible in most circumstances, its almost always better to just use your weapon or block normally
- Almost every boss has 2 phases with a massive health pool making the game feel more like a slog and I often didn't feel happy after finally beating a tough boss

The OST is second to none, the world design is fantastic, and the story is brilliant with a great cast of characters. Boss designs are fun and a nice challenge. If I had to say any con with the game it is the overuse of Decay in nearly every enemy in the late game and the reprisal of bosses who, aren't particularly fun at first, turning far more annoying than enjoyable when they make their return.

It's like a hybrid between Souls and the parrying mechanic of Sekiro, with Bloodborne-esque vibes in a Belle Epoque setting. Neowiz really set a new standard for their games with this installment and came out of nowhere with basically a AAA game title for their first breakthrough mainstream game. Lots of promise coming out of South Korea. DLC has been confirmed by developer as well as a sequel.

From the challenging visceral combat system, where precision and timing are crucial to the ominous atmosphere and grotesque enemy designs. However, despite the blatant similarities, Lies of P does manage to carve its own identity. 

The narrative, although shrouded in mystery, introduces unique lore and a captivating world leaving you hooked throughout. The incorporation of different environments and level designs paired with an extraordinary soundtrack showcases the developer's creativity and ambition. There is so much tactical acumen allowing for meticulous fine-tuning with tons of weapons options offering unique pairing options for each weapon head and handle in addition to a diverse and useful range of legion arm abilities. The weapon-grinding & weapon-break mechanic plays into an interesting dynamic, acting as a secondary battle to keep your weapon from breaking before the enemy's weapon. The grindstone also allows you to imbue your weapon with a variety of really useful effects. The bosses are magnificent, never failing to carry weight or momentum behind them paired with perfect music and entertaining fast paced move sets. The last boss of the game was truly incredible, a wonderful song of metal clashing metal with an astonishing zenith in the narrative to suit. One thing I would've wished is that your individual decisions had a greater impact on the story, it's rather the culmination of choices that has any significance. 
Overall I would thoroughly recommend this game if you're looking for a challenge and beautiful story.

Gameplay is tight. Perfect Guarding is fun. Enemy variety is good. Level design is very linear with usual branches for aditional loot and shortcuts. Running through the levels never felt tedious.

Weapon assembly system which allows you to mix handles and blades/blunts of all non-boss weapons. (some combinations are hilarious) Character progression system is great.

I love souls and souls like games and Lies of P is a very good game from that genre. I usually skip NG+ in other games but here the game was so good that I bothered to finish NG+ and well... it was fun unlike in Dark souls games.

Pros:
- Satisfactory game-play.  It is typical souls like schema. Doges, parries, braking stance etc. Sure it is nothing new but here it somehow clicks very well. I felt very good when I managed to almost perfectly deflect all attacks of one of the bosses that I had a problem with on my first play-through. Pure fun.
- Interesting game mechanics. Games offer some customisation in order to make the game a bit more fair for the player. You have Legion (mechanical arm) which nicely adds some options during the fights. You can also upgrade the main character with P-organs. Those give some bonuses (attacks, guard, etc) which allow you to make some builds that suit your style of playing this game.  
- Setting. Industrial era but with puppet revolution. Great idea and well presented. I wish I could see how that world could work more.
- World building. I really like how the game was presenting me with information that made me believe that the world presented in Lies of P can be real. Environmental storytelling (maps, item descriptions etc.), npcs, story progression really made me immersed into that world.
- Very good soundtrack. It fits well into that game.
- Npcs. I was really engaged in finding out about Npc quests. In comparison to souls games I really like that it is hard in this game to miss npc quests. When you teleport you can see if something is going on for places that you can teleport. In the end I could finish all the quests without feeling that I missed out something which happened a lot in other Souls games. Apart from that I think that English voice actors did a very good job, especially Venigni.  
- New game plus. It is nice that the game gives you some more upgrades in ng+. There are even some new upgrades available in ng++ which was really surprising. In other souls games in ng+ runs game changes into i-frames dodging game, here it is quite fun due to having something new to play with.
 
Cons:  
- Game is linear. You can only go in one direction. There is only one place in the game that you can go to instead of going through the main path. (one of the cryptic vessel quests). I wish we could have some options where we are going.

In general Lies of P is a great game. Using concepts from a well known story for kids, creating a world around it and encapsulating it into the game is a wonderful idea. I wish I could see more of that instead of gender swapping, race swapping and disrespecting original works that nowadays occurs in a lot of western movies (see The Little Mermaid 2023). You can see that the creators of Lies of P respect the work of Carlo Collodi and wanted to pay tribute to his timeless masterpiece.

I strongly recommend this game. For me it is the game of the year.",1700911200,1700911200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lies of P is an amazing take on the Souls genre which while may not diverge from the formula as compared to Nioh, does well in its own right. Unlike other games in the souls genre, Lies of P is completely linear from start to finish, there is no optional area or boss. The story is pretty straightforward going from one area to another, beating the bosses of that specific area. There are however, missable side stories that one can miss due to not exploring or choosing the right option.

Gameplay wise, the game encourages a playstyle like Sekiro where parry is king but leaves the usual run & gun option viable for players. The game also encourages new game+ runs where not only do you unlock new abilities (Up to new game+2 for P-Organ 7), better variation of equipment (+1 / +2 variants) and small lore tidbits for puppet boss fights.

As someone who has played the game through its different patches (on my last ending run as of this review), I am very happy to see Neowiz take charge of the criticisms and suggestions given by the players.
Overall Neowiz did a very good job on their first take on the genre and I look forward to the upcoming DLCs planned for the game.",1700908826,1700908826,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm changing because I felt that the game looses it's magic after the 3ish boss, without spoiling much but I was kinda disappointed to see that the Puppets Frenzy thing became a side line. the game shifted way to fast from a really unique setting to generic setting 565251 in a span of 1 area, they could've done so so much more with the premise of Puppets rebelling and keeping stuff somewhat grounded but no...
I lost all interest on this game, the shift in story / direction and the badly implemented combat made me just quit. Not happy with this, I wanted to love this work so much! but the disappointment is just to strong to keep playing. If they fix the problems with the combat I may return to at least finish the game...  

Maybe what I'm about to say is because I played 140ish hours of Elden ring before playing Lies of P and had so much muscle memory that conflicted with the mechanics here but still:

Every thing about Lies of P is great, the music, the voices, the graphics, the premise (until mid game....), animations, art direction, all top notch, BUT the most important part of this genre is one thing and one thing only, combat, and Lies of P is kinda weak on that, in fact, even with a mod to make the game less frustrating I'm still need to push myself to play it just because the combat never feels right. Fromsoftware games work because of 1 thing, combat fluidity, after a few minutes to a few hours your character in From games becomes a extension of yourself. in Lies of P, after some good hours I still fighting against my character more than my enemies.

Dodge feels janky, doesn't move you enough away and you can clearly see on the 2º roll that the animation and the distance of the roll doesn't match, P stops a bit before the animation finishes, feels super off. Perfect Blocking is so damn hard to use than I just stop trying, this is because of the system here, instead of copying something that works they wanted to reinvent the wheel and made a square out of it, it's not intuitive at all. And then it's the enemies attacks, the enemies wind up and release moves so fast you just can't react and then they chain together moves that you can't keep up. (I give some slack on the puppets enemies, because they need to spring up the movement to then release the stored energy into motion... it's thematically correct at least, but game play wise it's frustrating). Oh and you can't animation cancel to go from a swing to a block, you need to either commit to attack or block. 

Without the mod to make the game easier (read: less frustrating) I do not recommend, the difficulty is not because the game is a challenge but because the mechanics are way too off and feels like you're wrestling your character instead of fighting the enemies. 

With the mod I recommend on a sale and / or want to support the devs.

I really really wanted to love this game, but I can't just put up with how off the combat feels, it's like everything else is AAA quality and the combat is some Unreal Store assets quality.

The map is very linear and there is not much exploring to be had in most areas, because of this side quests are very easy to complete and dont feel that engaging or very worth your time.

The weapons are unique but most feel the same..... large weapons have similar animations and smaller weapons are more quicker and stabbier that being said there are a few weapons with unique quirks that stand out. Your left arm can work in interesting ways but its hard to synergise it with your normal attacks.

Many others have complained about a difficulty spike midway through the game. I havent felt any difference, however i sunk time in other souls-like games so im kinda used to the way these games play out, for a newbie i feel it would take sometime getting used to the mechanics especially against tankier opponents but for others you can expect gameplay similar to other souls games. The game allows you to parry like in sekiro and parry window is much more lenient than in DS but can still get away with dodging and poking the enemy.

Leveling up and  stats are what you would expect in any RPG.

All in all this game is highly polished and the animations are crisp. I'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes a challenge. The creativity really shows when it comes to enemy designs especially the bosses. I'd give it a 7/10",1700903441,1700903441,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Lies of P throws you into a phenomenally crafted world for you to become engulfed. It is set in a Belle-Époque-style era, a period in French history distinguished by the wealthy’s attempts to fall back into an artificially carefree, fairy-tale existence, while the dreadfulness of reality takes place just outside of their lavish ballrooms and red-carpeted opera houses. As a result, this class of people and the world around them were not prepared for the grim products of their own negligence. This is just at the surface of happenings you discover while going through Lies of P—The Puppet Frenzy, the Petrification Disease, and more complicated dynamics between puppets, alchemists, and those who seek power have their roots in places you would not expect. Seeing the effects of these ongoing tragedies and why they are happening in different parts of the world is very intriguing. 

The player learns things at the same rate as the protagonist Pinocchio, who has only recently awoken from a long state of dormancy during the climax of these events. In other words, the story never gets ahead of your thinking because you start off naturally oblivious, and rely rightfully on the world-building, from both the environment and a diverse set of characters, many of them deceptive, as the mysteries are received in pieces to a bigger puzzle. Additionally, unlike other puppets, you have the ability to lie, which makes for often difficult decisions in a world in which you ideally want to pave a pathway to betterment. With Lies of P having amazing art direction, collecting and linking these revelations in your head becomes an exciting motive while going through the story.

Finally, this makes the gameplay itself fun and rewarding because it simply makes sense for various types of enemies to be located in their respective environments as you go through the story – something I find inconsistent in a lot of other RPGs. The game definitely has great replayability for the first few times as it has different skills, weapon combinations, legion arms, and thus playstyles. My biggest complaint is that although the weapons are very cool, I think it is unfair to say that there are “over 100 weapon combinations” since many of them are just unviable or silly to craft. Also, I think the game is definitely on the harder side, more specifically because it has one of the tightest parry windows in any video game I’ve seen. At this point, however, a lot of this is simply preference, and I, being a non-seasoned Souls player, adapted just fine. Generally, the bosses are great and it feels intensely satisfying once I beat any of them. 

Lies of P is an inspired project taking from other great games and a popular fairy tale, yet it still manages to be beautifully unique on its own and that is something I really appreciate, especially during a time when gaming and other media has been lingering in sequel hell for quite some time. 9/10",1700869072,1700869072,True,14,0,0.659637391567230225,0,True,False,False

With all these versions played and beaten can def say the game got easier or fairer however you want to say it. I appreciate the balancing the devs did (still gotta tune enemy hit tracking imo) that the average souls like player now has a better chance against the horrors in Krat. Game is its not perfect by any means but liking 95% out of 5% is a great ratio. Not a huge fan of certain charge attacks on weapon his just don't having that poise to trade hits but its ok you can mitigate with certain fable arts. i just had to get good with when i can use my attacks based on openings.  Game isnt going to be easy the first time and there will be jank with some hit animations or bad camera angle vs bigger opponets who is face hugging up, body blocking at times, ambushes you may not like or mechanics that seem cheap or even enemies with a flurry of attacks you are not expecting and they just delete you, but trust its part of the journey. the more you play the more you you know to takle the upcoming obstacles. some bosses even mimic mob enemy attack patterns which sometimes make the bosses fights more engaging since you just know what to do once you figure out the rhythm.

the story holy smokes, it reminded me when i was intrigued with elden ring where i just wanted to look for more stuff to find out more about what the heck is going on. the more you progress the story unfolds.the emotion i felt ranging from hating this game due to the first skill check boss was messing me up, satisfaction of doing a certain stupid tuned boss fight near the end 1st try(waaaay manageable now), the truths before and after knowing the lies it was amazing. the story itself scratches that philosophical itch side of interpretations of why i play souls like what is this game trying to teach me?  What on the surface of being a common folk story where we know about a wooden puppet ""becoming a boy because dad"" made him yada yada, gemini is your ""consciousness"" yadada, getting eating by a ""whale"" yada yada, this game just straight up flips the script and puts in a nice huge pile of effed up stuff thats going on in typical ds fashion.  but through lying it shows your ""humanity"" since the puppets in this reality cannot tell a lie, the only distinction to know ""what is human"" and what isnt.  Brought to life to find where is your dad only to find a story with many twists and turns all with purpose, for the most part i think. the last game that got me this obsessed in a sp game like this was elden ring, i cannot stop recommending this piece of art, this is a worthy full priced from a 1st time studio showing developers how to make a good game with tight mechanics great optimization good story telling, challenging fights, sure some bs but which souls game don't have that?

I'll say a few words about this game. Since I am a fan of soul games, I liked this game. CRAZY. Nothing can be said about the beauty of the locations and combat mechanics. The combat mechanics are similar to those in the game Sekiro, which is not bad, because Sekiro was more difficult for me than this game.
Pros:
- An unusual plot twist in the game (there would be more of it in souls games)
- Beautiful heroine Sofia
- Changes to different types of weapons to suit your build/taste
- Interesting bosses
- Beautiful locations
- Side quests
Minuses:
- Few side quests
- Straightforward game
- In my opinion there is not enough loot
- Great weight of all modifications (well, seriously, if you want to be strong, you need to increase the weight, because you will not be able to carry, for example, 2 weapons and 2 arms of a legend, because all items have a lot of weight)
But the game is worthy even with such small disadvantages

Pros
- Story is interesting
- Some neat combat ideas

Cons
- The game itself isn't very difficult. It's just buggy combat
- Zero stagger resistance against any attacks. If you get touched while swinging, oh well. Yet basic enemies take multiple power attacks with a heavy weapon to stagger.
- Attacks not registering WAY TOO FREQUENTLY. Imagine a heavy swing at a boss at point blank range that swooshes through the air. Again, and again, and again, until you give up and write this review.
- Bosses will switch attacks mid-animation. Seems they can cancel any attack at any point, and switch to any other attack. Just a jumbled garble of random half swings.
- Seems every enemy has a small random chance to initiate a one-hit-kill instant out-of-nowhere attack if you're close range.
- I did a particular quest where I needed to talk to a particular person, but when I showed up they attacked me. I killed in self defense, but then I couldn't complete the quest. What?

Graphics are excellent, and performance on my PC (Ryzen 7 3600, 32GBram, 3070 @ 120fps 1440p) and steam deck (60fps) are nearly locked at those levels. Little to no bugs/glitches - and patches have kept coming to help with balancing and performance. 

aesthetic, setting and atmosphere are bloodborne inspired, but have a custom and unique take on the Gothic Victorian era architecture. Dark, foreboding and eerie, with no out of place elements or asset dumps distracting from a hand crafted world.

Level Design is not poor, but not innovative either. only one path to take, simple repeated tropes of the genera (floor breaks, hidden enemies around corers etc) but exploration is still rewarded, albeit in short bursts. 

However  the more simplistic level layout/design are appreciated as the enemies and game mechanics are the focus and can be very challenging. High reward for perfect parry, the strongest and most rewarded game mechanic right from the start. No amount of weapon upgrade, armor, level upgrade will out pace the parry skill.

Highly recommend for those who liked a similar sekiro/bloodborne faster pace aggressive/interactive defensive play style.",1700850931,1700850931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're a fan of the Soulsborne games, you'll definitely feel comfortable with this game. I've finished every Soulsborne game outside of Sekiro, so I think have a pretty good handle on how these types of games should feel although I'm no speedrunner or god tier gamer by any means.

The weapons seem to be pretty fun and varied, and the weapon crafting system really allows you to cater weapons to your play style. The enemies feel like they're just right on difficulty - combat is deadly, but it goes both ways. Most basic enemies will go down in 2-3 hits, but they can very easily get the the jump on you if you're not paying attention. The bosses, while difficult, don't have a billion HP, and the fights can be over very quickly one way or another. If you're struggling on a boss, the NPC summons put in a lot of work and can really turn the tide in your favor. 

The level design is pretty linear, although there are a few branching paths in each zone. You tend to be rewarded for exploring, even if the branches can be kind of short. I haven't really gotten lost in any zone yet - the paths tend to loop around with shortcuts, so you can explore a side area and end up right back on the main path without much hassle. 

I really don't have much bad to say about this game so far - I'm not super far in, I think less than halfway. The only real issue I've had is that your attack animations tend to kind of lock you in, so once you start a swing you'd better be prepared to take a hit if you didn't time it right. I think some of the enemies kind of attack too fast for this to really feel fair sometimes, but it means the game does tend to reward careful play over just spamming your attack button, which feels appropriate for a Soulslike. This could be down to weapon choice as well, but I'm not sure at this point in time. 

Overall I'd say it's like an 8/10 game, and definitely worth the money. Check it out if you're a fan of Soulslikes, and especially if you're a fan of Bloodborne.",1700832289,1700834748,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is my first ever souls-like and, without knowing the entirety of the other souls games (but obviously have heard of them and seen streamers play it, or seen reviews of those games), I feel this game mixes up the different mechanics pretty well.
You have the bloodborne health regain by dealing damage (but only if you block an attack!)
You have the sekiro parry, stance breaks, perfect guards to avoid damage entirely, and special prosthetics for damage or mobility.
And it's just a soulslike for the combat. Everything feels responsive, yet ""weighty"" because of animation locks.
The creepy puppets, along with some monsters, work incredibly well for a soulslike too. The puppets are uncanny and the way they move is perfect. I also find the boss design to be wayyy better than in other soulslikes from what I've seen, and that's because there's less flowy random details on the model. It's a puppet, robotic, very clear hitboxes and movements.

The story is loosely based on Pinocchio, that much is obvious, but it's darker, grittier, and I feel this is just one game out of several more to come to adapt fairy tales and other such stories into soulslikes. In this case it's like... the ""rogue AI"" trope, but with magic/mystical elements involved.

For my first soulslike, I am hearing different conflicting stories. One of them is that this is the hardest game yet to carry a ""soulslike"" title. It's not some cheap knockoff imitation. They learned from the best, shuffled the best of the mechanics around, made it even harder in the process. It plays its own way and stuff you learned in other games don't perfectly apply here. And I feel that might be somewhat true?

The biggest deviation and the unique mechanic of this game, is the weapon grinding. Friend of mine disagrees heavily with this addition. Eventually, it becomes trivial, but for plenty of players it is an extra ""healthbar"" to pay attention to, especially in NG+ it feels like every strike just damages your weapon more, and you can't just fight forever. Then have a specific enemy type that applies 'Decay' which also reduces your weapon durability really fast, and you have quite a difficult time with managing that 'chore' as well. In turn, I don't mind it, but that might be bias because like I said; this is my first soulslike and I got used to it. I imagine it might be annoying for people who are used to other soulslikes though. So my only tip is: use stagger windows to grind weapons, instead of going all out on the offensive. You also don't always need to grind your weapon to full.

In my own experience... I learned this game first now and I find it somewhat 'easy'? Never truly felt like I was stuck anywhere, and theres only 2 fights where I got a specter, and one where I finished the boss with a handful of throwables because that boss sucked to fight (damn you, green swamp monster)
And I've gotten good at it. People saying that a certain boss (thunderlady, not actual name) is harder than malenia of Elden Ring, and I beat thunderlady in no time at all, it felt like (and without cheesing it). It feels like the game allows for all kinds of playstyles too just to get you started, but you'll quickly realize that you need to employ all the tools given to you. If you are only dodging, you will struggle with quite a few bosses unless you learn how to block and parry. Similar if you come from Sekiro and only block/parry, there are bosses you kinda have to dodge because blocking still applies status, or they keep enough distance from you that you can not regain your health easily.

Of course, like with other souls games, this game can be ""cheesed"" too, in case you're just struggling. Throwables are insanely powerful, with the tradeoff that you will need to spend some time farming ergo (the currency for levelling and shops) to get a decent shot at beating a boss. There's summons, allowing you to get help of a specter that merely just draws aggro, allowing you to deal a lot of damage to bosses, and you can buff that specter too with wishstones. But those wishstones have to be purchased with a special currency that can not be farmed, only gained by spending time playing.
The game knows it is hard, and gives you plenty of tools to make it easier, without straight up compromising with a difficulty selection. The only limitation is what you yourself are okay with using as a strategy. And I would say... feel no shame in using all tools at your disposal. It's just a game after all.

Because the story is good as well and worth playing through the game just for that. It's not like other soulslikes where you get a few sparse hints as to what's going on. The game is pretty linear in its level design and storytelling, with plenty of secrets to find. But it's so worth it. And from the ending... more games like this might be coming. It hints to a larger world, and I hope that happens :D

All in all, would rate this an 8 out of 10. It's a seriously good game, even if you're new to soulslikes.",1700831465,1700831465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, being a video game you can force little lights of joy and good if only you reach out to change the tale.

Lies of P feels great, looks great and had me playing nonstop (barring sleep) till I finished the game. It's weakest parts are certain voices, and lip sync outside cutscenes, neither of which really detracted from my experience. I'm not versed in putting to words how the systems of the combat flow together to create a fun toolbox to use for crafting a combat style, but that's definitely here. What I will do instead is talk a bit about the public discourse I saw during release.

I think a very important thing about reviewing/discussing soulslikes is to estrablish one key thing: This is not Dark Souls, it's not Bloodborne, it's not Sekiro, and it isn't Elden Ring. This is not a FromSoft title.

Yes, the game takes heavy inspiration, it is a soulslike and I'd even agree it's the closest thing to a bloodborne on PC we're likely to get. But the point of this is, I feel that many people will call out a game's mechanics, or the skills it demands of you as bad / unfair because they aren't as prevalent or demanding in the genre standard setters from FromSoft.

This is a parry heavy game, it's what they want you to do and how it's been primarily designed. I saw a lot of discourse about this being a bad direction to take this game, and I vehemently disagree. It wants to force you into it's own rhytm, and you'll be punished for failing to do so.

The actual issues with the combat system fell a little through the cracks of the public facing discourse on parrying, but are being patched, big one being Rising Dodge from prone being baseline instead of a (technically missable) unlock in the P-Organ to make the combat feel more fluid from the get-go. 

Some of the bosses were rather hard, and took me a solid bit to get through, (theatre, bridge, top of tower p2 to be specific) but that was before the patches reducing their health and buffing certain weapons etc, they're much more in line with the rest of the game now.

This game is a gem that stands tall on its own two feet in a genre full of passion projects that either fall flat or lean to heavily into the more annoying or even infuriating aspects of soulslikes without giving you the tools needed to overcome them, and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone who likes souls games with the caveat that you should be prepared to parry. (if you did sekiro you'll be fine, it's a little stricter last I played but still)

TLDR: game good, parry good, stop treating every soulslike as if it's made by fromsoft and let them breathe as their own games with their own philosophies.",1700824601,1700824601,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Music, outside of a few tracks, is nothing to write home about.

it's easier than Elden Ring.

Bit of an edit:
This game is easily, easily, one of the better video games. That it isn't on most reviewer's GOTY is absurd. It's much better than just a GOTY.

The game is a great take on the souls-like genre while being its own game.  A classic case of a game that is greater than the sum of all its parts: the combat style is a mix of Sekiro/Bloodbourne, many quality of life features that make the experience more enjoyable (such as your vigor, the equivalent of souls in other games, dropping outside the boss room if you die, the Rally system feeling so rewarding even if you don't nail your Perfect Guards, the P-organ talent system making NG+ and your experience evolve over time, etc.), the story is an interesting take on a classic tale, the music is good enough to where you'll probably just sit and listen to it when taking a break, and the entire aesthetic is very appealing and immersive.  

Best part was that compared to many other games I play at launch, zero major bugs and almost no minor bugs (or at least they weren't distracting).  You can tell the love and care that went into making this game, and it really shows in the final product.  

Is it the hardest souls-like game?  No.  Is it the most technically complex?  No.  Is it the most sprawling an expansive level design?  No.  However, it doesn't need to be since everything together meshes well, where other games tend to specialize in one aspect while failing in others, compounded by tons of issues at launch.  It's not often we get games that are great day 1 and provide such a quality experience.  Cannot recommend this game enough!",1700800431,1700800431,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

El juego en sí, tiene muy buenos gráficos y tiene muy buena historia. El mundo creado para esto, lo considero fantástico.
En cuanto a dificultad, deja un poco que desear, pero al mismo tiempo se siente desafiante a ratos.
Considero que el juego está bastante pulido, pero lo que más me ha disgustado es que el sistema de ""timing"" o ""ticks"" se siente extraño.

Deeply engaging storytelling, interesting environments, and a twist on the tale of Pinocchio mixed with (to me) is the subversion of Isaac Asimov's writings. I felt deep empathy with the game, and more than once would spend hours focused on the game at hand.

While LoP's boss fights are exciting bouts of showmanship, it also shows an assessment and understanding of  patterns and move-sets. Bosses have unique attacks and animations, often with long wind ups (these are very helpful, thank you!) that require full attention to the enemy. While I still never managed to perfect guarding during combat, the game was fairly forgiving and always felt I had the room to breathe and improve.

While initially concerned by the scale of the customization (weapon movesets, legion arms, consumables, and even just what costumes to wear), I found myself charmed by how fluidly the character moved and performed during gameplay. Maybe someone else will have better luck decoding all the hidden details, because I'm sure there's a full well to explore here.

Exploration itself is fairly linear, which can literally be described as my only complaint with the game. I was begging for another secret passage or alternate route while playing the game, just something to indulge myself with just a bit more time in the game. Besides that, I want to give a major shout out to whoever included images when new dialogue was accessible with NPCs. You are a hero, and everyone should praise your willingness to throw the players a bone.

I can't wait to see what else is in store. Also, while I haven't started NG+ as of writing, this 100% is a game you would get a kick out of a second round just to improve your build and feel the fresh spray of blood in combat. Cheers!",1700785914,1700785914,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is annoying how much this game follows the souls-like formula. They even replicated the stupid SPACEBAR control mapping, which allows you to roll, dodge, sprint, and jump with SPACEBAR. I hated that in Dark Souls and I hate it here. If you didn't tell me that Neowiz had made this game, I would have thought this was the latest installment from FromSoft.

This game is great and I will highlight some things that were extremely enjoyable for me:

 • The art in this game is superb; it's a welcome change of pace in this industry following the western uglification trend.

 • I think the spin on Collodi's story is fantastic, and I'm so happy they stuck to the original text and added a few hidden easter eggs that the general public wouldn't know about. The story draws you in and the dialogue is well-written.

 • One of the most enjoyable gameplay features that sets this game apart from FromSoft's games is weapon combination.

 • Legion arms are similar to Sekiro in that they are highly situational and that you will frequently swap them out, but they are fun.

 • Lack of wokeness is always a plus.

Since none of the games are perfect, this one isn't either. The following is a list of things I felt could have been done better in this game:

 • My biggest complaint about this game is that you can summon a spectre to trivialize every boss by keeping them at aggro and using the spectre as passive damage. This became clear to me after the [spoiler]Archbishop[/spoiler] fight, and for every boss after that it took me an average of five attempts without a spectre to figure out the boss's initial phase, after which I could summon a spectre and easily defeat the boss.

 • The boss phases are not proportionally difficult, there is a huge jump in difficulty on phase two with most bosses. Having beat Sekiro and Elden Ring, I can't recall it being that way there.

 • Even if you've mastered the boss's five-hit combo, perfect parrying accomplishes nothing. There is no reward for completing such a difficult feat, boss doesn't get staggered. It doesn't make sense why would you even try it, since you can just roll to avoid damage.

 • Humanity mechanic is not clear to me. Some choices seemed more humane to me than the lies you were supposed to tell to gain humanity. For example, I thought it was more humane to inform [spoiler]Eugenie that Alidoro was actually her brother[/spoiler] rather than the generic lie [spoiler]that he was a stalker, but lying makes you human.[/spoiler]

 • Some lies don't even makes sense. For example, [spoiler]we lie to Julian about his deceased wife puppet and tell him she loved him - even though there a writing on the wall saying she did. However, later on, when you speak with Polendina, he asks you: „Can a puppet and a human fall in love, have you ever met a puppet who loves a human?“ The truth in this game is: „Show the wedding ring“ which in this scenario would actually be a lie because since first thing was a lie.[/spoiler]

And finally I have some nitpicks that are not necessarily specific for this game:

 • I hate it when games create ""joke"" weapons; if a game is serious, it should create serious weapons, or at the very least, 50/50. After all, who enjoys using an [b]enormous toilet seat[/b] as a weapon?

 • The same is true for the clothes. Make the outfits decent; I don't like rags. The only outfit I like is the promo coat from the trailer.

In summary, this game is enjoyable and nearly a perfect replica of FromSoft's games, despite its flaws. All in all, you wouldn't be wasting your money on this game.",1700759429,1700778888,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Game plays like a derivative of Sekiro and Bloodborne with inferior combat quality. Enemies have animations that feel clunky and unfair, and sometimes lack important tells/cues. Enemies will successively attack you if you parry them, and the game wants you to break their weapons a la a poise break from Sekiro, but it just feels deeply unsatisfying. 
- VO is weirdly localized and sounds like it was written by someone who needed more oversight.
+ Graphics are beautiful and really where the game shines. Runs fantastic. 
+ Has real stylistic coherence. I don't like the sort of cutesy-robot Nier Automata art nouveaux thing, but it's aesthetically pleasing nonetheless and deserves credit. 
+ The hit switching is a cool mechanic that allows a lot of player creativity.
+ P is cute.

Atmosphere is really good and I really like the setting they have put this game into. Combat has a lot of depth and mixes almost all good elements from the souls games and adds some neat little tricks of its own (you can take off the hilt from weapons for an example and you can mix and match you favorite blade with different hilt and vice versa). Music of the game is great and completing npc quests you get LP records as a reward that you can play in the main hub of the game (super cool idea and the songs in there are top notch). Characters are interesting and they tell you pieces of story in newspaper and articles you find in the world to give you some hints what has happened in the world. Boss and enemy designs are really good and all of the boss fights have been real treats and the enemy variety has been quite impressive so far (I played about 30 hours with game pass). And the best part is that the game runs extreme well considering this is a modern game and I don't have the most powerful PC anymore which is super rare these times (I don't have to name any examples here but yeah this game does not need modders to fix it :P). Small summary this is my GOTY for this year easily and I see myself 100% this one for sure and playing multiple playthroughs. Easy recommendation from me to souls fans and if the setting interest you give it a try just keep it in mind that the game is quite challenging at times.

Edit after completing the game:

I've played so many souls likes and every FromSoft souls like game, and if I this game was dropped on to my lap with no forewarning I'd say that FromSoft made this game themselves. It is just a great combination of Bloodborne and Sekiro.
I can't say it's for everyone, there are some difficulty curves that can't be overcome with some of the cheesier ways that the Souls games or Elden Ring allows: you HAVE to learn the mechanics and integrate them into your play. 
But in short, if you love souls games and souls-likes this is probably the pinnacle of taking what makes those games great and transforming them into a new experience. I'd highly recommend it, and I can't wait to get through NG+ and see some other endings.

In a way, almost harder than souls if you play like I do (preferring to dodge rather than block or parry). The I-frames and parry timing is EXTREMELY unforgiving. 

As many other people have mentioned, it feels very Bloodborne., both the feel of the graphics and the feel of the gameplay. It tends to reward being aggressive rather than defensive (more akin to Bloodborne or Sekiro in my opinion). Also, the locations of shortcuts and save points feels VERY similar to any Fromsoft game, to the point of turning a corner and expecting to find said save point... and it being there. But why fix what isn't broken? It's nice pacing and didn't ever feel too far or too near. 

I think my only complaint is how the enemies attack. The timings on their hits can be judged after a LONG time of observing them, but starting out, the attacks are unpredictable and difficult to read. The mobs also track the player far too well, making it near impossible to dodge or get out of the way, unless you time it correctly. Even as the attack is happening, the enemy will sometimes continue to rotate and track the player. Not a bad feature in and of itself, but it can be frustrating.",1700761584,1700761584,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visually and stylistically the game gives you that Bloodborne feeling with its own setting taking place in a dystopian version of Pinocchio.

Gameplay wise, Lies of P feels like a mashup of Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Bloodborne with its mechanics with some unique aspects thrown in as well. It has the interconnected areas of Dark Souls, the parrying emphasis and prosthetic arm of Sekiro, and the health regain system of Bloodborne. For its own twist, Lies of P introduces weapon creation where you can swap the blades and handles of your weapons to alter their moveset and skills.

The game is challenging and you will want to learn the mechanics well, but it feels very rewarding when you do. However, it is also doable to get through the entire game without parrying at all if you struggle with it. Blocking is a viable strategy because you can regain health lost if you counterattack before you're hit directly. 

The game feels smaller in scale than Bloodborne and the Souls series, but what's within those areas works well and doesn't feel bloated.

I was actually very invested in the mystery of the puppet frenzy within this alternate world of Pinocchio, and I very much enjoyed how they went about it.

Overall, this is probably my favourite game purchase of the year. I would 100% recommend this to Souls fans and I'm excited to see the sequel from this studio.

It may be cliche and done to death by now but I absolutely adore this grim and gritty rendition of a classic fairy tale and I feel it fits right in amongst the soulsborne genre.
The pacing and flow of the game feels quite natural in terms of events and exploration; whilst there's a lot to see and discover, you never get too lost or too constricted.
Combat takes some getting used to yet after a time feels familiar and intuitive. 
A nice feature of being able to mix and match different blades to handles means you can form the perfect weapons with the right damage types and move-sets for your play style, and there are a great many weapons to find and unlock (with this game having possibly one of the greatest and just straight up fun DEX weapon movesets in all soulsbornes, and I say that as a STR player at heart).
In regards to design, I feel that everything fits quite well.
Don't even get me started on the music. I thoroughly enjoyed all the tracks in this game, especially the records, just an absolute delight.
Visually, characters and locations are both beautiful and mysterious, enemies are equal parts cool and horrifying, I very much adore the old, Victorian AND eldritch horror style.
Attack timings can seem a little weird at first but they're nothing the average gamer can't get used to, just like with all games of this type you simply, observe, adapt, and overcome, or in other words, git gud.
One thing I could complain about is that when you talk to someone they lose their dynamic audio and sound like they're coming from the centre of the screen, even if they might be way off, at the same time you can't move your camera at all during dialogue so after certain cutscenes you're staring directly at the back of P's head and can't see the person you're talking to. It's not a great, big problem but it is a little annoying at times when I'm just out here trying to appreciate the visuals and the scenarios of the game.
But that's all I can think of at the moment.

A phenomenal experience of a game and just a lot of fun in general.

[h2] Base game [/h2]
If you miss Bloodborne love the Elden Ring bosses and love Sekiro. Love level design that folds in on itself giving shot-cut progression type levels this is most definitely the game for you.

[h2] Update 1.2.0.0 [/h2]
This is the same as the base game BUT, it will have more of an Assassin's Creed vibe when it comes to difficulty on hard. And it takes away the hard earned feeling of achievement when finally defeating a boss or level.

[h1] In depth review [/h1]

[h2] Base game [/h2]
Well where to start.
[h3] The Story [/h3] I loved the idea of a Soulslike Pinocchio. In the end I gotta admit they did so much to respect the source material and make it their own. It's an insanely well-done fresh take on it. But it never fails to stay close enough to it not to alienate you from the get-go or to divert so much from it it is unrecognisable. That said, as with all stories you either like it or don't. I'm really glad I can count myself among the people who likes it.
The world building, references and history of stuff'n'thangs found in item descriptions and collectables really ads to it like a FromSoftware game proper does. It really gives that feeling. They clearly Took inspiration from them and did it quite well. More on that later. All and all the game really gave me a story that felt fresh and new. I went in and thought I'd try to skip the story and descriptions. And ended up soaking it all in from the start till the end.
[h3] The gameplay [/h3]  As stated in short review the game most clearly took a lot of inspiration from FromSoftware games. And let's be clear, I know what I'm saying. Inspiration. Saying this is a copy of those games is certainly selling it short. There are things they did take from those games. But they added on so much fresh feeling stuff new stuff I haven't seen in other games to make it feel like its own thing. And not a copy at all. The enemies, weapons, fable arts, bosses and abilities really have their own identity.
The game is hard. Don't get me wrong I loved the difficulty and really felt a sense of achievement when I beaten a certain boss. That is why we play and love these games. No compensation and no quarter given. Just pure skill and getting good at it. Feel the dread of failing and getting better. And getting a rush of pride when you finally pull through and do what felt impossible.
But not everything is positive though. 
To be fair to the game I won't compare it to the gameplay of Sekiro or Bloodborne. Those are games by an experienced studio that knows their fan base and what makes a Soulslike a Soulslike. Hell they are the originals how could they not. But I with refer to them not to compare but to illustrate why it doesn't work in Lies of P. The biggest problem I found with the gameplay was the fact that deflecting and blocking are the same thing in the game. Your block deflects/perfect blocks within a certain set of frames. this is all fun and dandy but it doesn't work well cause when an enemy does a flurry attack the game doesn't always register what you are doing. And it has become a guessing game if it will work. There are instances you have you spam deflect so many times but your character just looks like it's blocking. In Sekiro this works cause it has and starts it's own animation every time. So you have a visual cue of what is happening. In Lies of P you just don't know if you're safe or in danger till it is too late or you feel like you just got lucky. 
When it comes to specifically bosses I have experienced something I didn't know existed. Boss fatigue. There aren't that many bosses not more than necessary. But there are quite a few of them that have a bull$hlt second phase that is just a complete other bossfight altogether. Not at all building of the moveset of the first phase. Just another bossfight. In FromSoftware games this works cause it has a story related purpose and feels logical and necessary. In this game it's just practically half the main bosses who do that. It doesn't feel good or fair. It just feels like you got cheated out of your progression in the fight and development. The first boss who does this felt great and new and was well done and well placed. The ones after felt like the game cheating the player cause it happened too much. On top of that when you stagger a boss you have to do a charged heavy and the last hit of that attack leaves you with half stamina at best. That is if you even get a window to do it. That is great and feels rewarding when you take the risk. But the game out of nowhere decides at a certain point that bosses must do a bull$hlt attack you're defenceless against if you don't level stamina through the roof. And worse than that there are bosses who do a flurry attack before they stagger, an AOE or both. It feels unfair and as if you're cheated out of your hard-earned visceral attack on the boss. Just for a cheap win for the boss.
The bosses are well designed and have cool attacks. But nearly all boss feels like an Elden Ring boss. Not a copy but just a big enemy that has stupid delayed attacks. So that you're just guessing the seconds it takes to land the hit rather than react to it. What makes games like Bloodborne and Sekiro so great is the continues aggression and pressure you feel. The quick reactions and skills you need. Elden Ring and Lies of P are more like learn to count to 3 or 5 and block and you will perfectly deflect absent skill.
Lastly between 1 and 3 more frames for a perfect deflect would make the game less punishing and more fun for people who don't have the time to spend hours in bossfights perfecting them or simply don't have that reaction.
[h3] Patch 1.2.0.0 [/h3]
I went from weight limit 59% to weight limit 51% over night, bosses were made easier, levelling was made easier cause you got more Ergo/Experience. This all results that this self advertised Soulslike is all of a sudden an Assassin's Creedlike. It's not what we want or payed for. I get the insecurity from the studio. But FromSoftware shows they don't need to be. Now given this cakewalk to the community there is no way back. We were promised a Soulslike we got it. And days later it was taken back from us. Such a shame.
I highly recommend playing it without updates if you can for the proper experience.
If the game stays like this I hope there won't be DLC. Cause I like the game at 100% and don't fancy a cakewalk part 2. If this was overcompensating and in future patches we get a middle ground I will give it a second chance. Until then I'm out.

Now, some will say this is an interesting mixture of Bloodborne and BioShock but as a newbie to this genre, I can’t really connect all the dots together.
I can, however, say that what surprised me and got me hooked was how much I became mesmerized by the first video showing the game’s background and how P came to be. It felt like a really good Grimm Brothers film was about to begin. :) 

The graphics of the game are amazing (once in a while, try looking up and enjoy the view guys) and I was amazed at how much detail they put into the sound effects. But on a side note, I also kind of found the sound of the weapons clinking a little too high-pitched for my ears. Oh, and lastly, I loved the simplicity of the game as it helped me focus solely on the story and the game itself.

All in all, it looks like P and I will be spending many more hours together this fall.

The story is good enough to carry through the game, but nothing exceptional.

the most  meaningful changes to combat are the improved version of Bloodborne's Rally mechanic, where all blocked damage can be recovered by dealing damage to foes, and the ""blocked health"" dissapears entirely if you take unguarded damage. additionally, unlike the majority of souls likes, throwables remain a very useful tool even into the late game, and the ability to restore 1 single charge to your ""estus"" when it is drained by damaging enemies ensures that healing is still limited, but even in a boss fight can be regained by skilled play.  additionally the ability to break enemy weapons with perfect blocks to lower their attack is a great feature and should also be extended to the bosses.

Art Design(9/10): the world of krat is beautiful&memorable, also cool enemy design.

Gameplay(8/10): 
Boss battle: Majority of the boss in this game feels fair, while some can be really unfun with weird looking attack lol
Customization: Feels sad that a cool looking weapon, have worse moveset? no problem! because in Lies of P you can just attach that blade to another handle! for me the joy of custom made your weapon is the most fun aspect of this game. 

Conclusion 8,5/10 
It's just run really well& play really well for an action-rpg games.

The developers of this game did a good job capturing the feeling of Bloodborne with the relatively small seeming world, the interconnectedness of it, and the story of the game. Throughout my play I noticed several points, which I have listed below:
Pros:
The game is very aware of minor shortcuts that players would want, even if not consciously. Take for instance the hotel hub; the room on the upper floor that you'll be returning to throughout the game has a convenient break in the railing right outside, allowing you to immediately get back to the stargazer to leave. The game is full of small little shortcuts like this that save maybe a few seconds at a time.
The placement of stargazers is well spread out. This includes shortcuts as well, they always feel like you've earned them, and they are relatively frequent.
The weapon system is incredibly cool, though I did end up using a boss transmute weapon for the rest of the game once I got it as well as subsequent plays.
The story of the game as well as the optional quests are well written and build very nice characters.
The game tells you if you have any quest actions that can be taken in a given area when you go to teleport there. They don't tell you where to go, just a reminder that there is something you can do.
It used to be the case that bosses had way too much health and effectively encouraged you to use consumable items on them, though this has been adjusted in the most recent balance patch, making them much more reasonable.
The fact that the choices you make during the game have a tangible impact on how the ending plays out. Thankfully there's no umbilical cords you need to collect though.
The scaling into NG+ seems about right, I will update the review as I progress into later NG cycles.

Cons:
The quests could use a little additional work to make them harder to mess up. Specifically in the later chapters of the game, there are a couple quests that lock you out of the ""good"" ending if you do things in the wrong order with the reasoning being flimsy. To provide a specific example: [spoiler]The quest involving Alidoro's cryptic vessel requires you to decipher it before talking to another NPC otherwise you cannot complete it. This doesn't make much sense because the character could easily just go back to the NPC and say ""In addition to what I told you earlier, here's more information."" [/spoiler] 
The fact that once you beat the final boss, there is new postgame content (an achievement) that you can easily miss if you choose to go straight into NG+ from the cutscene. This one is relatively minor and most people would probably think to check, but because I missed it I have to redo one of the harder endings again.

Overall I would consider the game very good and a worthwhile play for any FromSoft fans.",1700711714,1700714047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wonderful music, satisfying combat, top notch graphics. Bosses are harder then DarkSouls and Elden Ring bosses and i find them pretty challenging and fun. Combat is parry and stance focused like sekiro but the parry timing is so little, you can figure that way harder then Sekiro. Only bad thing is there are few types of enemies, its not like DarkSouls that there is 30 types of enemys, they need to increase that number. Most enjoyable thing is that you can brake your enemys weapons by parrying them, i find it super cool and there is another mechanic that let you combine different blade's handle to a different blade/axe, handles really changing movesets of the blade entirely.

Additionally the music is fantastic, especially the records you are able to obtain throughout the game.

So far the difficulty has been less than Bloodborne overall for me. I have cleared up through the Archbishop at the moment. Even though it has been a bit easier that is not to say I have not been challenged. I suspect the difficulty will be ramping up shortly for me.

I'm also appreciating the single player nature of the game. It definitely adds to the atmosphere and allows items to be solely balanced for PVE. I really think they made the right choice forgoing multiplayer in this one. Although, PVP with these mechanics would probably be quite fun. 

There is a lot going on here with depth of mechanics and build variety. I have barely scratched the surface of what I can do and I'm loving every minute of it.

There is honestly not much to complain about, this game is a complete package and most importantly - working, running well and looking great even on PC, something that's more and more rare. Also, bug free experience, the game is just polished at every point.

A lot of people compare this to bloodborne, and on a first glance that is one Fromsoft game, Lies of P shares the most with. Although, in my experience, I would compare the general combat closer to Sekiro rather than Bloodborne. Combat is mostly dance of blocking, taking your chances and trying to stance break the enemy for a critical hit. If you have played souls games, you will feel right at home with the mechanics, as this game borrows most of them, but there are little twists to make things interesting, mostly for good. 

I only wish some levels (mostly found in the first 60ish % of the game) were perhaps more creative and bit more difficult. The difficulty in the zones mostly comes from fighting ""mini boss"" types of enemies, with their own movesets, withstanding about 5-10x the damage regular enemies do. In early levels, there is usually just one guy like this, which imo makes the rest of the level feel easy, unimportant. I also think the game would benefit greatly from maybe some smarter enemy placement and less ""corridor"" types of levels. 

Bosses on the other hand can definitely be quite a challenge, and I would argue most of them are pretty decent and fun to fight. There are some forgettable ones, but none that I would call straight up bad.

Overall, very solid souls-like that I would personally put above DS2 and Demon Souls. Definite success and for me personally perhaps the biggest gaming surprise of 2023.",1700696470,1700696470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lies of P very well balances the line between “I had to spend the entire day in every boss fight” and “I’m too lazy to learn this game and will just spam attacks.” By entering the boss’s room two or three times, you begin to understand what to do, and you don’t have to do any crazy maneuvers. The riddles in the game are not very complicated and if you carefully examine the locations, you can find all the hidden and secret corners without any problems. In terms of the speed of gameplay and map construction, the game is closer to Bloodborne: shortcuts are everywhere, and you don’t have shields to 100% block the damage you receive.

To my regret, armor in the game does not do anything other than change the appearance, but on the other hand, you can wear whatever you want in your heart and not think about the characteristics.

It had been showing promise in almost all categories but the ones that stuck out to me the most were the music and visual style. When I actually bought the game I expected it to be good, but nowhere near the bar that FromSoftware had set for this genre. After a few hours the game absolutely blew me away, the graphical style of being in a ruined city that actually shows details of how it used to be thriving was so cool for me. The ability to take weapons I had been finding throughout my journey and combine with other ones to make a combo that really fit my playstyle was a very welcome addition. The bosses in this game are fantastic, probably the best roster I've seen in a Non-Fromsoft game. While there may be one or two bosses I really didn't enjoy, the ones I liked more than made up for it. Accompanying these bosses was some of the best fight themes I've ever heard in a game, and the records you can find also make this an unforgettable soundtrack. The combat in this game is dynamic in a way that allows to choose the route of parrying your enemies or dodging their attacks, you'll need to master both of them however because some bosses may make one strategy better than the other.

Now with all the good stuff I've said, you'd expect me to rate this a 10/10, however there were a few things I did not like. The first of which was the balancing of the player compared to the enemies, the developers have been releasing some updates to manage the health and damage of some bosses and bring up the player's strength slightly as well. My first playthrough was before these changes and I can definitely say they were needed. For example, having recovery dodge locked behind a perk you had to activate was a very bad decision and I'm glad they made it base-kit. The balancing could use a slight bit more work, mainly revolving the scaling of NG+ but other than that, the developers have been good on fixing this issue. The only other problem I had with this game was how some of the hitboxes were absurd, this issue wasn't prominent throughout the whole game but when it was an issue, it was impossible to ignore. There were attacks from some bosses that were miles high above my head or that I clearly dodged through, but would still find a way to hit me. Like I said, this wasn't an issue that many bosses had, only a few, but I believed this warranted being brought up.

In conclusion, I loved playing through this game, enough to go through getting all the achievements which meant playing through the game three times. The issues this game had were made up for and then some by all the positives that it had. The soundtrack, visuals, and story were all fantastic with all the other aspects being far above average as well.

Os personagens em si estão perfeitos, não tenho o que reclamar, O Pinóquio está simplesmente perfeito e um charme, muito cativante, O Geppetto, Gemini e o Vignini estão ótimos, tanto na personalidade quanto na desenvoltura dos personagens, Sophia simplesmente belíssima e uma graça e tem a moça de óculos que arruma nossas armas, lindíssima.

A ambientação está sublime, todos os locais até agora explorados por mim estão com esse ar de fim de mundo e agonizante, com morte, doença e praga para todo o lado, a cidade de Krat está realmente morrendo, e cabe a nós salvá-la ou tentar.
As roupas do P são tão bonitas e charmosas, deixa ele mais gato do que já é.

Espero que gane como jogo do ano, pois merece e MUITO!

Enfim, considerações finais.

Every unique system and design element that sets it apart from other Souls-likes are fully realized and executed to an extremely high caliber of quality. Nothing feels tacked on and nothing feels like a wasted mechanic. The level design is well thought out, and the enemy/boss design is absurdly good. Almost every new enemy and boss got a big reaction from me and those who watched me fight them, either because they looked cool, freaky, terrifying, or just plain interesting.

If you had shown me this game maybe a couple years ago, without any context or information, I would have told you with extreme confidence ""yep, this is made by Fromsoftware"".
It's a feeling that goes beyond simply stuff like the combat and core mechanics. The atmosphere, the graphics, the animations, the NPC interactions and sidequests, the lore, the level and enemy design, even the music. Literally everything screams ""Fromsoftware"", it was clearly made by people who like that specific style and understands what makes those games great. This is, in my eyes, the only ""souls-like"" worthy of the name.

And still, this isn't just a 1:1 copy, or a Dark Souls mod with a pretty reskin, it somehow manages to take a bunch of stuff from Souls, Bloodborne and even Sekiro, blend them together and give them its own spin.

The combat in particular is something I can only describe as the love child of the games mentioned above. You have the standard light-strong attack movesets like in Dark Souls; your dodge roll that turns into a dash like in Bloodborne, and just like in BB you have no shields but you can still block a portion of damage with your weapon, damage that you can heal back up by hitting enemies; your left arm is instead dedicated to a mechanical arm with various special abilities like in Sekiro, and any hit can be perfectly blocked negating all damage just like in Sekiro. Enemies can be put in a staggerable state simply by chaining perfect blocks (Sekiro again) and subsequently staggered by landing a strong attack (BB again). Your arsenal is all made up of unique weapons with their own unique moveset like in BB.

Now for something that is unique to this game: almost every weapon is made by a blade part and a handle part that can be separated so you can mix and match them however you want, with some pretty silly results as you might imagine. Wanna put a greathammer head on a dagger handle? Nothing's stopping you. This will change how the weapon handles but it's not the only reason to do it, as each blade and handle have their own special combat skills so you have more of a reason to try it out on top of just ""lmao greatsword with tiny dagger blade""
The leveling system is mostly what you'd expect but with an added skill tree that requires a specific item found by exploring and/or defeating sometimes optional strong miniboss-type enemies, rewarding you for essentially being good at the game.
There is a lie and truth system as well as a ""humanity"" system that influence NPC interactions as well as the game's ending, but I won't elaborate more since it's spoilers and better experienced for yourself.

Overall it's a solid 10/10 for me and I can totally see myself replaying the game over and over with different builds to get all endings and master all bosses, just like I did with Souls.
And yes, in the end, aside a few original mechanics and the Pinocchio inspiration, it's really nothing you haven't seen before if you're Fromsoft fanboys, to the point I can see how some might even call it ""soulslop"" and even agree with them.

But brother let me tell you... this is some mighty fine soulslop.",1696601424,1700678152,True,70,1,0.760615766048431396,4,True,False,False

The game shines in every aspect, from visuals to story, level design, voice acting, and music. The soundtrack, especially the songs, is superb and a pleasure to listen to. 

The game follows the typical souls-like formula but with some variations, which don't make it stand out; however, it works as intended. The combat is genuinely the best part of the game, in my opinion. It builds on the mechanics of Bloodborne and Sekiro but also introduces some innovative new ideas that make it feel fresh and exciting. The ability to swap weapon handles and create crazy weapon combinations is particularly impressive. The enemies in the game are brutal and require strategic thinking to overcome, and the variety of enemies keeps the gameplay fresh. The boss designs are insane, and these encounters are some of the most amazing ones I've ever experienced in a game.

The writing department has done an excellent job. The dialogues are well written, and they effectively convey the story. There are also a lot of clever references throughout the game that will make you nod and smirk if you catch them. There was even a moment where I felt like the game became self-conscious and started telling me, through an NPC, how it felt about being a souls-like game. That could be just my interpretation, but the game made me think, which is a big plus.

I enjoyed playing Lies of P very much and highly recommend it to anyone who loves challenging games with excellent combat, stunning visuals, a great story, and an incredible soundtrack.

Copycat of Sekiro and Bloodborne in the setting of Pinocchio. And it's good!
In the absence of new Fromsoft games, this is the best substitute so far.
It plagiarized:
- bonfires
- homebase hub
- rolling/blocking
- estus flask
- leveling-up waifu
- souls
- poison swamp
- sad voice creepy NPCs
- boss fights epic orchestra music
- enemies and bosses from a dream of a delirious drunk
- VIG/STA/VIT/STR/DEX/INT attributes
- level design with shortcuts and annoying mobs placement
and lots and lots of stuff, copy-pasted from SoulsBornes.

Some fresh ideas also present:
- weapon assembly
- reimagined world of Carlo Collodi
- nice visual design
In general, it is very enjoyable. Not so hard, though. If you hear lies about game being hard - it's a lie, it is super easy for a Souls afficionados if you pay attention to mechanic nuances, all lies probably come from puppets, trying to be humans.
Story, characters, bosses and setting truly worth some time.

So, install your Legion Arm, pick up huge smacking tool, say hello to your hub-girl and go, kill and lie, to clarify whether you are a puppet, or a real boy.

NÄYTTELIJÄ Aleksi Holkko tekee Kom-teatterissa järisyttävän hienon roolityön Henrik Ibsenin näytelmän Nukkekoti (Et Dukkehjem, 1879) suuressa pääosassa.

Ensin isänsä ja sitten aviomiehensä tahtoa kaikessa myötäillyt Nora on nyt Aron.

Näppärää, mutta täysin konstailematonta.

Esityksen käsiohjelmassa seisoo: Ibsenin näytelmän pohjalta vapaasti kääntäen sovittanut Mikko Roiha.

Kääntäminen tarkoittanee tässä yhteydessä nimenomaan suomentamista, ja linjakkaasti Roiha onkin siirtänyt suuren norjalaisen dramaatikon kansainvälisen läpimurtoteoksen tämän päivän kieliasuun ja vieläpä pitkälti pohjalaismurteille.

Erityisesti Holkolta pohjalaiset sananparret lohkeilevat luontevan terävinä iskoksina.

PÄÄHENKILÖN nimen ympäri kääntämisen lisäksi en havainnut Ibsenin alkuperäisteoksen kohdanneen tai edes kaivanneen mitään suurempia kiepsautuksia.

Ihminen on pohjimmiltaan sama kuin puolitoista vuosisataa sitten. Häpeä ja ylpeys toimivat edelleen keskeisinä liikkeellepanevina voimina, Pohjanmaalla ehkä näyttävämmin kuin muualla.

Eikä sukupuolella ole tässä mielessä mitään merkitystä.


Aleksi Holkko tekee upean roolityön, Tiina Weckströmin roolit ovat jalostuneet kohtalokkuuden asteelle.
Aleksi Holkko tekee upean roolityön, Tiina Weckströmin roolit ovat jalostuneet kohtalokkuuden asteelle. KUVA: NOORA GEAGEA / KOM

Tiina Weckströmin näyttelemää asianajajaa voisi pitää esimerkkinä ”sukupuolisokeasta” roolittamisesta. Kiristäjäksi ajautuvan loukatun hahmon voi samalla ajatella edustavan mitä tahansa sukupuolta, mikäli määrittelyn edes kokee tarpeelliseksi.

ROIHA on ohjaajana saanut huomiota erityisesti tavastaan antaa näyttelijöiden rikkoa rajojaan. Epätyypilliset näyttelijävalinnat ovat samalla luoneet uutta särmää esimerkiksi vahvojen suomalaisten naisdramaatikkojen teoksiin.

Kom-teatterin Nukkekodin ihmiskuvasta voi löytää jännittäviä heijastuksia vaikkapa Maria Jotunin näytelmien henkilöistä.

Roihan ohjauksessa yhteiskunnalliset lainalaisuudet määräävät ihmisten toimia välillä hyvinkin tarkkaviivaisesti kuvattuina.

Holkko suorastaan viilettää viivana pitkin näyttämötilaa ilmentäessään Aronin selviytymistaistelua.

Niko Saarela piirtää aviomiehenä osuvan kuvan suuresta periaatteen ihmisestä, joka omasta mielestään on aina oikeassa, vaikka hänen ratkaisunsa ovat johtaneet useampaankin umpikujaan.

Markus Riutun esittämä pariskunnan ystävä on oman järkeilynsä halvaannuttama surullisen hahmon ritari, joka avautuessaankin tuntuu vain törmäävän tuulimyllyihin.

Vilma Melasniemi tekee uutta elämää aloittelevana Aronin ystävättärenä esityksen tarkimman piirroksen siitä, minkälaista kaupankäyntiä elämä pohjimmiltaan on, ja miten siinä ei turha hötkyily auta.

Tiina Weckströmin roolit ilmeettömänä asianajajana ja kävelykeppinsä kanssa vaeltavana mykkänä ovat jalostuneet kohtalokkuuden asteelle.

ROIHAN tyylikkään tehokkaasti visualisoiman esityksen linjakkaisiin ratkaisuihin kuuluvat myös musiikkivalinnat. Erityisesti Bernard Herrmannin sävellykset Alfred Hitchcockin elokuvaan Vertigo.

Vertigon ääniraidan viipyilevistä jousista muodostuu eräänlainen teema näytelmän aviomiehelle ja tämän jännitteiselle elämälle harhakuvien keskellä. Samasta lähteestä löytyy myös painajaismainen säestys Aronin tanssimaan villiin tarantellaan, jolla on aivan keskeinen asema draaman kaaressa.

This game brings a lot to the table of Souls Likes.

There is a robust perk system that is smartly implemented. The Legion arm is also a fun part, but I did not use it that much. And lastly, the weapon crafting is so fun to play with, all the combinations <3 

Also, the story is interesting and told in a way that you can really understand and care about. 

But some problems made me downgrade this from 10/10 like the animations lock.  

Over all this is the best Souls i played since DS3.

I've beaten the whole thing in under 20 hours and I feel like I took my time, meanwhile it took me 70+ hours to beat Elden Ring my first time through.

Lies of P is definitely harder than Elden Ring however, the game doesn't seem to have any comically overpowered options available to abuse and is less forgiving than games like Bloodborne or Sekiro when it comes to dodging and parrying/deflecting. To be clear, this game doesn't actually have a proper parry, it has a ""perfect guard"" mechanic which does feel a bit different from what I'm used to.

I like this game as about as much as I do something like Nioh 2, I would probably take most of Fromsoft's output over this, but it's an extremely strong first showing and I'm more excited to see what these developers do next.

I do have a couple complaints though:
- boss runs are dumb, there's a reason Fromsoft has been moving away from them
- it feels like in most souls-likes I can eyeball a lot of attacks when it comes to parrying, I could not do this with perfect guard; I have to get beaten down and just learn the patterns and timings
- it took a long time to get a weapon I liked
- there is a specific side objective you can lock yourself out of because you don't opt to make a boss weapon much earlier in the run, just why?
- most of the areas are arguably too short, but the final area is comically long and well outstays it's welcome while simultaneously being the most visually uninteresting overall
- the game has a lot of ambushes to the point where I felt a little fatigued, but it's probably not actually more than what's typical in the genre and just exacerbated by a lot of areas being short
- there are roided dudes bursting through brick walls, but the rooms they were in had no doors or any way to get in; who the hell is just sealing these guys in walls and why are they okay with it?",1700661650,1700661650,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It has everything you need: dodging, parrying, blocking, and items that you actually use, avoiding the issue of them sitting in your inventory forever. I never felt stuck on a boss or a game segment because I was doing something wrong. I always had the option to try something different.

Yes, learning attack patterns can be frustrating, and the game is far from easy, but it's no less satisfying to finally beat the challenge by using your entire arsenal.

Has my favourite combat system out of any Souls game ""including"" the OG games. having to use a mix of defensive options rather then just spamming the ""best"" one and actually using my weapons full move-set gives a sense of engagement and satisfaction I've never personally felt with any other souls-like game. So combat wise this is my favourite game in the genre.
Level design isn't as open as i personally prefer although the levels themselves are excellently made, with lots of shortcuts and inter-connectivity within the individual levels.
It just lacks the openness and freedom that i personally prefer. If they ever make that sequel they hinted at i'm hoping for a more Dark souls one style map then Lies of P's more DS3 style map. though if they don't I'd still play it.
Slow heavy weapons are a little under powered and need something to help them out since hyper armour is weirdly spread out amongst the various move sets and generally under powered. Id say if a weapon has a slow swing speed then they need guaranteed hyper armour for the actual attack frames but i'm open to the devs fixing slow weapons in other ways if they can find some. Faster weapons are in a fine place though and don't need much if any adjustment.
Boss design is incredible. Just remember when fighting the bosses to not get to attached to blocking, dodging or parrying to the point your only doing one exclusively. 9 times out of 10 if I was struggling with a boss it was because I was just doing one and ignoring the others.
As long as someone comes into the game understanding that this game is a soul-LIKE and not an actual souls game they should have an excellent time.
Just don't try to Unga bunga with the heaviest weapon you find it probably wont work.

I have looked at the criticism and almost feel that the ""souls-like"" tag has hurt the player experience of the game.  That, however, is really not the developers fault.  This game iterates on the souls-like combat pretty heavily similar to games like Sekiro or Nioh.  I am disappointed to see people try to fit it into a Dark Souls box and then decry it for not encouraging Dark Souls playstyles.

This game is hard and expects a lot of you.  The game is made significantly easier for the player who experiments and tries to use all different tools to fight.  For instance, the game encourages you to use dodges and perfect blocks together, not just one or the other.  The combat paradigm is excellent and the bosses always feel fair while also feeling like they are actually trying to kill you.  The balance between those priorities is something that Dark Souls and souls-like games have always struggled with.  There are definitely things to fine-tune and the developers have done a good amount of work to do that.  Points of pain that the developers have been working on are good health pools on enemies (on this count I hope the developers don't nerf enemies too much), the weight of different equipment, and the scarcity of upgrade materials for weapons.

The story is extremely intriguing and incredibly unique.  I appreciate the passion that went into adapting the Pinocchio story.  This story, for me, far surpasses any souls-like story that comes to mind (I am almost certainly forgetting one).  Bloodborne is close perhaps.  The attention to detail and love put into the levels is quite enjoyable.  This is not an open world game, this is a linear story-driven souls experience with minimal backtracking so don't go in expecting the common souls-like open world.

Overall, the game is not perfect but the passion put into the story and the clear work put into the tools and bosses, making the combat feel complete, makes this a good recommend to anyone looking for a very difficult, heavily story-driven, souls-like game.  But please don't go into this game expecting to be good at it because you are good at dark souls or for it to play like dark souls.  Good job developers.

Just technically the game looks great while also running amazingly well, almost never dropping any frames during all of my time playing the game. A constant and stable 144fps even on the highest possible graphic options. Which is something we will probably never see happen in a FromSoft game.

Aesthetically it's obviously inspired from Bloodborne, however the combat is more of a combination of Sekiro and Dark Souls 3, allowing decently fast movement and doging, along with a deflection mechanic that is similar to the parrying you can do in Sekiro. However the difference is that Lies of P deflection is much more precise and punishing, with a window so small, you basically have to press the block button a milisecond before the enemy's attack land on you. At first this will probably frustrate you quite a bit, but if you take the time to learn the timing of the attacks, the deflection system will become increadibly rewarding and leave you feeling like a god when you successfully pull them off.  
A small tip is that you can basically deflect anything in the game, including projectiles, the only exception being grab attacks. But if you are unsure whether you can deflect something, just try it and see what happens, you might get pleasantly surprised. 

Here are a few pros and cons with the game.
Pros:
- Good amount of enemy variety, all the way up to the end of the game. 
- Almost all of the bosses have amazing designs, while also being increadibly fun fights thanks to well animated and telegraphed attacks with a good variety of them.
- A weapon assembly system that gives huge amounts of customizability.
- Tons of QoL imporvements, such as allowing you to teleport from and to any stargazer you've found, right from the start of the game. Or showing you a red circle to indicate where to stand when performing a fatal attack on a staggered boss or enemy, avoiding the jankyness that can often be found in a FromSoft Souls title. 
- The music is fantastic. Especially the musical records that you can find troughout the game. 

Cons:
- The game is extremely linear. If you live for the exploration in FromSoft's games, you will unfortunately find very litte of that in this game. With there basically only being one substantial optional area that you can find and explore. Probably my biggest gripe with the game.
- The translation and voice acting isn't the best. There are a bunch of lines that have weird grammar or just straight up spelling mistakes. And the voice acting from certain characters absolutely lack proper direction, leading to awkward or stiff voice work. 
- The Lie system isn't the most fleshed out. It's nice that you can get different endings depending on your choices, but it would've been better with more direct consequences and more interesting dialogue. 

To round it all off. Lies of P is not only a great Souls-like, but also just a fantastic game in general that I implore you to check out if you've ever had any interest in these types of games. These developers certainly did their homework and should be supported.",1697386057,1700644536,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The bosses are really good, the way that the design of some bosses has a lot of visual story-telling and lore information is really cool.
The fighting is fun and have great music as well as a uniqueness to every boss (that I've fought thus far) to make the combat shine.

Granted there are some things that I wouldn't consider perfect.... 
There are some VERY minor graphical errors (such as: when holding the starter greatsword, the blade clips through the character models head after finishing a block animation,
 like the whole blade noclips through all the cogs and gears in P's head). There has only been one audio clip missing of a massive safe smashing through the floor which was dead quiet in the game.

The fact they do NOT explain very well that using certain crystals for extra ""souls"" for leveling that drop from bosses will lock you out from being able to get their boss weapons is a JOKE.  You literally don't meet the guy that sells you their weapons until after the 4th or 5th boss and as all of us who play Souls games know by default IN souls games you use the dropped gems for leveling points.  But not in this stupidly designed game.  Nope.  When you kill a boss a gem drops that has nothing that distinguishes it at all from the other ones.  So you use it for extra souls and guess what?  You then don't have the gem to buy the damn weapon.  Patch this crap out.  The boss gems SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE USED TO LEVELING POINTS.  

Seriously, this is a joke.  And guess what?  You can't play the bosses again.  That's right.  You have to either restart the entire game or you have to finish and get them in New Game+.

Take your negative review for that.

Knockdown.  STOP PUTTING THIS IN GAMES JUST TO FRUSTRATE THE PLAYER.  You will spend half the game getting knocked down.  The absolute best thing in the world is getting ""stun-knocked"" when an enemy does 4 knockdowns in a row and you literally cannot recover because you are locked into the stupid getting off the ground animation.  That is bad game design.  That is designed only to frustrate.  Bloodborne didn't have ANY of that crap.  It was about pure skill.

As for the game, it's OKAY.  It's not great and it should NEVER be mentioned in the same breath as Bloodborne.  Ever.  EVER.  It's not even close.  It has a dark gothic atmosphere.  That's it.

The enemy attacks are laughably unpredictable and my god the bosses.  The attacks are utterly ABSURD with unlimited stamina and attacks that can't be parried just spammed over and over.  

They rely HEAVILY on parry in this game.  That's not good because the parry system is TRASH.  The timing for it is utterly terrible.  It's just not fun to use this mechanic and before any idiot tells me to git gud - I have completed almost every souls game along with a Platinum in Bloodborne.  I'm not new to this.

Technically it's perfect.  ZERO crashes, ZERO issues.  Runs flawlessly.  This was a breath of fresh air.

While there isn't anything directly woke shoved down your throat the male protagonist who literally has a female face is enough to put this in the weird and completely unnecessary category.  Grow up devs.

Poor positioning leading to getting mobbed, for example, would not be saved by having a few extra iframes on the dodge or a wider parry window. So I had to see for myself if it was as broken as they claimed.

Having played through it entirely twice and partially a third time, and racking up 100% achievement completion in around 40 hours, I really don't understand why anyone made such a fuss about this game's difficulty. It just...feels like a good Soulsborne game. An excellent one, in fact.

(With only a couple of exceptions. Looking at you, Jester Bot.)

The only explanation I can think of is too many people kept trying to play it ""wrong."" Trying to perfect guard everything like it's Sekiro is possible, but it's doing things the hard way. Trying to do Souls-style hit and run is fine, but makes things take a lot longer and is hard to do safely for the most part, so that's also doing things the hard way.

Lies of P definitely has its own rhythm, and if you try to play it like it's a different game, you're probably going to have a Bad Time. But that's to be expected. Playing Sekiro like it's Bloodborne will get you killed, and vice versa. Try not to carry preconceived notions of how the game ""should"" play going into it and approach it on its own terms.

That said: it's still very much a game for the Soulsborne crowd. If you haven't enjoyed those kinds of games before, this one isn't going to change your mind.",1700627866,1700627866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the best souls-like game I have ever played; it has a very satisfying combat system and amazing bosses that you really need to learn in order to beat. Lots of great ideas in there too, such as the ability to combine weapon hilts and blades in order to make the perfect weapon for your play-style. Another great idea is with the healing item: as soon as you run out, it will begin to recharge by doing damage. This way, it never feels like you're out of the fight just because you healed one too many times, there is always room for a comeback.",1700624710,1700624710,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False
