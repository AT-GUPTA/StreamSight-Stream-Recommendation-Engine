I gotta be honest. For an EA title, the sheer amount of data that is poured over your head is intimidating. But if that kind of challenge is your thing, you can't skip on this one. Its amazing how every thing is already explained in the game. 

UI controls are a bit unintuitive at times , but all in all it suits the hybrid realtime-events + turn-based-mission gameloop.  can't wait to see what more this game has to offer, i don't doubt it's gonna be a lot more of this good stuff.

Review:

After spending a considerable 283.4 hours in the world of ""Terra Invicta,"" starting from its early release phase, I feel well-positioned to share my thoughts on this intricate and ambitious strategy game. This review is aimed at those who are on the fence about delving into its complex systems and vast universe.

First and foremost, ""Terra Invicta"" is not a game that holds your hand. From the get-go, players are thrown into a deeply strategic environment where every decision counts. The learning curve can be steep, and it's worth noting that patience and persistence are key to unlocking the rich tapestry of gameplay mechanics and interstellar diplomacy that this game offers.

The game's premise revolves around the Earth's response to an impending alien threat, with various factions vying for control, influence, and the direction of humanity's defense or expansion into the solar system. The depth of strategic options available, from geopolitical maneuvering on Earth to the vast operations in space, is staggering. Players must manage resources, research advancements, engage in diplomacy, or espionage, and ultimately lead their chosen faction to dominance.

What sets ""Terra Invicta"" apart is its commitment to a realistic simulation of space exploration and combat. The game painstakingly models orbital mechanics, requiring players to think critically about the movements of celestial bodies and the logistics of moving fleets through space. This aspect alone provides a unique challenge that strategy enthusiasts will appreciate, albeit with a significant investment in learning the ropes.

The early access phase of the game was an interesting journey, with regular updates and improvements based on community feedback. This process has helped shape ""Terra Invicta"" into a more accessible experience, though it remains a game targeted at a niche audience who relish complexity and detail.

Graphically, the game may not compete with blockbuster titles, but it compensates with its functional aesthetic and a UI that, while dense, becomes manageable with experience. The soundtrack and sound design complement the game's atmosphere, enhancing the immersion of leading humanity's foray into the unknown.

In conclusion, ""Terra Invicta"" is a gem for those who love a challenging, intricate strategy game that demands attention to detail and strategic planning on a grand scale. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to invest the time to overcome its steep learning curve, the rewards are immense. The game offers hundreds of hours of gameplay, a testament to its depth and the compelling nature of its premise. If you're looking for a game that challenges your strategic thinking and offers a rewarding experience, ""Terra Invicta"" is well worth your consideration.",1708386889,1708386889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
1176470,158689565,76561197962535059,0,11,19384,7858,14570,1709021769,"Do you like the Expanse? The Three-Body Problem series? Then you might want to check out Terra Invicta, the most unique and realistic space strategy game ever made!

After COVID and climate change, does anybody still believe we'd automatically unite against an alien menace?

When aliens arrive in the solar system, humanity fractures. The Resistance and Humanity First want to fight them. The Academy wants negotiate peace and friendship. The Protectorate and the Servants want to surrender to them. Project Exodus wants to flee the solar system. The Initiative wants to get rich off the crisis. You take command of one of these factions and compete with the others in intrigue, geopolitics, and war in order to save humanity, your way. And then the aliens actually invade.

Half of the game is the contest to dominate Earth. What's most unique is how you rule from the shadows. Your faction is a global movement. Human nations exist separately. They can and do change hands. You'll spend half of a game sharing a superpower with your hated enemies! In the tradition of grand strategy games, holding territory is just as hard as getting it in the first place -- which you can make the aliens find out the hard way! You will unify today's nations into tomorrow's superpowers and divide enemy superpowers until separatists revolt.

At regular intervals, you send your ""councilors"" on spy missions to control human nations, fight the other factions, and hunt down alien infiltrators. As things escalate, these agents instigate coups, recruit double agents, and assassinate each other. You grow to love these characters as you slowly level them up into international puppetmasters -- which makes it all the more devastating when they die! Each mission has RNG, and it's up to you to stack the odds in your favor. Sometimes an entire game can hinge on 61% chance roll -- which you have to take during a narrow window of opportunity. Often you have too many fires to put out and not enough councilors. With assassins lurking in the shadows, the stakes are very high: do you risk the life of somebody who's being tailed, but has a good security detail? Or do you send them into hiding, keeping them safe, and risk losing control of a country? I've never seen gameplay like it. Councilor missions are the most common activity you will be doing in Terra Invicta, so you have to enjoy or at least tolerate it to get into this game.

Once everybody gets their hands on armies -- and nukes -- you have to navigate international alliances and fanatics seeking to impose their will by force. And then the aliens land their war machines. If you thought Crusader Kings was abstract, Terra Invicta is pure strategy. Armies have a single stat -- strength -- but knowing how to buff that, bring more of them, abuse terrain, and avoid getting nuked are keys to success. I've never played a game where you had to tiptoe around nuclear powers -- it's a pretty interesting experience. Nothing makes your heart swell with human pride like dragging down high tech alien war machines with hordes of tanks!

The other half of the game is in space. You race against the other factions to colonize every planet, moon, and asteroid in the solar system, then build a fleet and go to war.

The space strategy is highly realistic and very unique. Everybody uses rockets -- even the aliens! -- but theirs are very advanced. There's a fun and meaningful ship design game: you have to balance the weight of armor, the maneuverability needed to catch enemy fleets and win battles, and the range to go anywhere useful. Necessity will force you to make different ship classes -- disposable missile ships, interceptors fast enough to catch alien destroyers but too inefficient to leave the Earth, long-range colonization ships that can refuel at gas giants, beefy capital ships to attack alien motherships, and of course, transports for your space marines. Likewise, you have to balance your weapons loadout for fast targets, armored targets, point defense, and piercing the atmosphere to bombard surface targets -- including armies on Earth! It's a very entertaining Rocket Science 101 course that teaches you about delta V, exhaust velocity, and how deceptively heavy radiators and power supplies are. (You might want to check out Kerbal Space Program if you enjoy that part.)

When you finally get into space battles, it's like the Expanse: the Game, or Homeworld with the realism turned all the way up. Your ships follow Newtonian physics, so they build up speed and then can pivot in place as they coast. You have to decide which way to point your ships and when to fire your rockets -- which matters a lot, because ships have weak armor on the sides, so turning sideways to burn leaves you vulnerable. You can play the boring meta of a wall of slow, armored ships. Personally though, I love maneuvering to hit my enemies in the sides and sneaking nukes past their point defense. Since I first played, the devs have improved the UI and enemy AI, so I expect the space combat will get even better.

Terra Invicta isn't for everybody, but if you can get into it, it's a completely unique experience. Your decisions really matter. You have to have a tolerance for setbacks against impossible-seeming odds. But victory is slow and methodical. Just don't expect to finish a game in one setting. If you are a patient, strategic thinker, or you really love realistic space battles, I would give Terra Invicta a try!",1708313823,1708313823,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I am not a hardcore player but just like to play normal hardness and figure out a strategy. (You know, the fun stuff). What interested me into the game was the concept of several AI's. Some closely aligning with me to against me. So I figured some would be helping a little and others to hinder me a little, but remain after their own goals. I thought the AI's would have the same outcomes as I had with the exception for special small advantages in different areas for the roll they and I was playing. I guess i shouldn't assume anything any more. Logic is not in this game.

  Expectation of the game. You can expect hours of rinse and repeat just to be taken from you in one turn. I have spent hours to influence a nation at 2-7% per turn. Get it up to 70%, ready to take the nation over, then next turn loose 50% of the 70% that I spent hours to get. And that's before the AI gets help from the aliens. And that influence can be taken from any faction, even one that would not even have a interest in the area or one that would be more aligned with my faction. I have also had my nation or nations all set up and happy. I would start going after a faction that is not aligned with my faction just to be attack by other factions that are at war with the faction I am attacking and more aligned with my faction. Causation: More hours of rinse and repeat, to keep the nation or nations. There is a lot more examples I could give in other areas of the game but this reaction is getting too long as it is.

  My personal opinion of this game is it is not logical or fair to the common player. AI's are against the human player no matter the closeness of alignment to yours. The AI's have more bang for their buck than the player. These problems make the game not fun or interesting at all. I have to assume the youtuber was paid for his evaluation of the game and given a easier game or the combination to complete it. I will never trust this youtuber on another game, ever. I believe i have given the game a fair chance for the hours i have spent on it. I have spent more hours watching the youtube guy, trying to figure out some of the aspects of the game. And to be fair, I am not the brightest penny in the drawer. Hope this is useful to anyone thinking of getting this game. If you like rinse and repeat and frustration. Get the game.

Imagine getting irreversibly destroyed 20 to 30 hours into a playthrough due to enemy luck. No recovery. Just completely destroyed. The AI in this game is so mindlessly aggressive. You can't negotiate with them. They will just steal your shit nonstop and because there are so many of them, they'll eventually succeed in taking your habs, countries, etc. Then you'll spend years in game trying to get it back. Only to have it randomly happen again years later. Oh and research is random! You can have a game ruined by not having access to good research options. I just can't stand it anymore.

Strikes a fantastic balance in depth, variety, challenge - And you can claw your way back to relevance even after seemingly catastrophic losses.   Modding scene is limited, but I have high hopes for Terra Invicta's replayability in the future.  The gushing aside: 

You're probably going to be overwhelmed by all the systems on offer, and while the current state of the game does include a tutorial and codex entries that explain everything, you're going to be putting out fires almost from the start.  It's hard to focus on the finer points of control-point priority synergy (That 4% boost to all other investments if you put *something* into things vital to a country's basic functioning) when you're locked in a bare-knuckle brawl with Humanity First and the Servants over Japan, and as the temperature rises, both metaphorically and literally, you can forget essential details that can potentially cripple your endeavors.

Maintaining space assets was probably the biggest one for me, as resource needs will consume Boost in the place of water/volatiles/metal/etc, and Boost is your universal resource for accomplishing anything outside of Earth's gravity well, which can quickly lead to a death spiral ending in mass defection or decommissioning to reach equilibrium.

The problem is that those reviews were made by people who barely played 100 hours. This is not a casual game where you get to play a couple of hours a week. If you don't like challenging games, don't like to read, don't have patience to understand the mechanics and don't want to bother viewing tutorials on youtube, then this is not the game for you. But that doesn't make it a bad game.

I didn't manage to finish a play-through yet as I botched my first attempt and had to restart the game, so I don't know if the endgame is satisfying. But i really enjoyed the complexity and the need to approach things methodically and plan ahead. If you make bad decisions in the first 5 years of the game, you will have a handicap going forward which may increase and it will take a long time to recover. However, if you have a good plan from the start and manage to dictate the global research progress, then you will be able to control the direction and speed the enemy factions will develop.

I am not usually fond of games which require me to watch hours of tutorials in order to understand the basics, but if you put the time in it, it will be very satisfying when you get to paint the whole world with your faction's color. My next step at the moment is to learn the space combat part and kick some alien behind.

Quite simply, the space combat is where Terra Invicta falls apart. You are given intricate control over every aspect of your spaceships, which makes sense - Terra Invicta is realistic everywhere else, so why cut corners here? The problem is, the dev's blend of simulation and RTS hasn't overcome the fundamental conflict of combining the two - that it is [b]spectacularly unfun[/b] to necessitate players maintain granular control of spaceships while also asking players to handle [b]an entire fleet of ships[/b] in real-time. 

The game uses a waypoints system that lets you plan ship movements up to 6 waypoints away. After reaching a waypoint, another one is automatically created that copies the trajectory and angle of the last waypoint in the sequence. This leads to a frustrating system where you have to keep track of ~15-30 ships while also planning their 6 waypoints and trying to tell when your ships are no longer using your planned waypoints. Now add the need for weapons management, tracking damage, swapping fire modes, predicting opponent's fleet movements, keeping tabs on your ship's velocities (yes, this game is faithful down to the Newtonian physics!), and constantly spawning reinforcements from both sides. 

What you're left with is a frustrating, unmanageable mess, that players only have a few options at their disposal to handle. If you have no life and love pain, you can spend the hours required to excruciatingly choreograph a single space combat to achieve victory ...in a game where you will have hundreds of battles. You can also just give control of your ships to the AI, which will promptly have them perform complicated and completely useless maneuvers while not focusing fire or attempting to close the distance with the longer-ranged alien ships. Don't even think of trying auto resolve. Once you've found out none of these approaches work, you'll be left with your only option - never engaging in combat unless you have overwhelming superiority, and flying your ships in a uniform formation.

Speaking of hundreds, you'll see a lot of people have put 100+ hours into this game. You might wonder then, why have so many people kept playing if combat is this bad? That's because space combat doesn't become practical until the mid-lategame. The human AI is so averse to confrontation, you are so hopelessly outmatched by Alien ships, and experience such devastating consequences from drawing their anger by attacking, that you probably won't experience space combat until easily a hundred hours into what is otherwise by all accounts a fun game. 

I want to close my review by saying two things. Look up a quick tutorial of space combat and see if you don't mind skipping it - you CAN still play this game without touching it directly; it  becomes much harder, but the other aspects of Terra Invicta might still make it worth picking up. It also has a few things going for it: it's still early access, the devs are ambitious, and there's mod support as well. But the devs and/or modders MUST address space combat's problems for this game to become a cohesive and competent gameplay experience.",1707788686,1707869951,False,47,1,0.819608926773071289,2,True,False,True

Had a ton of fun after reading some guides and essentially dominated the early game by controlling China, the US and Kazachstan. Then the servants and aliens decided to just take 2 of my control points in the US per round (all defended) forever. I had no ability to counter this, just trying my best to recapture (but needed to crackdown first so it would take me two rounds to get the points back with *all* my council members working on it). When they got control of the government for one round they would obviously destroy all diplomatic relations etc. 
If there is any actual counterplay to this (at the time you cannot destroy alien fleets yet and aren't able to research anti Enthrall tech), I haven't found it. Essentially ended my playthrough because I at some point just ran out of influence to regain my lost points (the other factions of course didn't care what was happening and didn't bother to attack the undefended servant control points elsewhere).

Seems like it was made for me personally uniting a couple of topics I am interested (Politics, environment, hard scifi and Three Body Problem) in a genuinely novel way. Terra Invicta is a grand strategy game in which you take over one of a number of factions reacting to an alien invasion in different ways. You can take charge of the defense of Earth, exploit the invasion to cement existing power structures or even help them take control from earth over the other human factions. Each faction has genuinely interesting perspectives as they unravel the mystery of the aliens, there is also voiced technology quotes like Alpha Centauri which really makes the leaders of each faction come to life.

The game has a fairly intense simulation under this, when thinking about it I was like ""theres no way it simulates this"" but then it does, the developers clearly love hard scifi like I do and I genuinely learned a lot playing this game about our solar system. I am extremely thankful that the devs made this instead of directly copying XCOM or their ""Long War"" mod for it as I genuinely do not think anyone else could have made this game. 

While I still feel like a novice the game is not too difficult once you get your head around some of the key mechanics it is very satisfying to build up from a economy based mainly around earth nations to a massive space empire that rivals even the extremely advanced aliens near the end of a campaign. Beating the game both because of how long campaigns are (although the devs added a short campaign if you need!) and the sheer amount of decisions you made up to that point makes TI insanely satisfying when it all comes together. 

There is definately criticisms I can make about this game, the alien hate mechanic needs to be much more heavily tied to actions you are doing in the game. There is a notification in the top right but considering how campaign ending it can be it really should be a more ""in your face"" thing. I find myself fighting with the UI for large potions of the game as well, a ""build default hab"" template or some more hotkeys for example would definately be nice to save my poor hand when im colonising Titan. Finally while I DEFINATELY appreciate the choice in the tech tree some of the more niche drives for example really should be bound together into similar tech as it is just too easy for a new player to research a drive only to find out it really doesnt fit their needs. Maybe have a single ""tier"" tech in each chain with a number of drive options to help avoid this? The devs have been fixing these problems over time so definitely do not let them stop you picking this one up if anything I said interests you. If you are stuck learning the game at all there is a healthy community on the discord and reddit with a lot of helpful advice.",1707579809,1707579809,True,1,0,0.509090900421142578,0,True,False,True

And it's not just some ""The Expanse"" vibes, which many of you will find familiar. It's much more.

Starting from the tech tree, where 90% of techs come from real world concepts. Minimum hand-waving. And then everything is accounted for with such high level of details. E.g the projectile damage is not just an abstract number, but is calculated via kinetic energy that it has. Which then accounts for the ship's armor vaporization during the impact. Or that laser beam propagation is accounted using the actual quantum theory for lasers...

I strongly recommend watching PerunGamingAU's videos before getting started because, to be completely honest, this game isn't for everyone, and there's definitely a learning curve to figure out what the hell's going on.

There's basically several different game loops occuring simultaneously with each other, and without prior knowledge, it can be difficult to figure out how they each work and interact with each other. The tech tree can also be confusing to figure out, and there's several technological dead-ends and tech that seems great but actually severely underperforms.

Now, despite the complexity, the game actually tends to be fairly forgiving. It's hard to screw up badly enough that you lock yourself out of a path to victory, especially if you're playing on normal.

All that said, I LOVE this game. I love the setting, I love the battle for influence on Earth, and I love staying under the radar of the Aliens' wrath till you're ready to duke it out in space. I also love the accurate modeling of orbital mechanics. 

However, it can be tedious to play whack-a-mole when the aliens keep sending single ships or small fleets all the time, because the auto resolve (unless it's been updated since my last playthrough) tends to suck.

I applaud the devs for taking risks and swinging for the moon (or perhaps more accurately the Oort Cloud). There is a sort of scale to things that eventually hits you when you have ships way out in the deep dark of the asteroid belts spending weeks moving to another base you need. You almost feel lonely for those marines out there.

There is a complex system covering nations and actually being the ""Illuminati"" types behind controlling them. There are agents to train and improve, and protect. There are multiple ways to achieve objectives including rampant murder sprees (I admit to re-naming my top assassin Secunit). There is an incredibly complex tech tree with waaaay more factors than just 5 levels of drive with a +20% speed increase. At times that is admittedly a bit much, and my goodness the learning curve on some of the stuff is next level. There is also base building and resource management also tied to that tech tree. There really is some real physics in here. Much closer to Expanse than it is to Star Trek.

Now you look at the reviews and see people really disliking it. In many ways their comments are correct. The game is still early access, and they continue to make pretty significant changes to the underlying systems. Given the overall complexity of these multiple, interlocking systems that underly it, and the need for extreme long term planning and strategy, the AI struggles to keep up. The UI and lack of feedback in some areas makes some of these systems really opaque, so combined with the complexity it is easy to see how frustrating this can be to someone trying to learn the game, so understandable to see that some people just give up.

While I am recommending the game, I admit my recommendation is conditional. Right now it is not for everyone. You really must enjoy digging into systems and slowly learning them. There will be spreadsheets (not as many because they finally improved the base building UI), and there will be Reddit to figure out wtf is going on. For reference I have almost 4,000 hours of Stellaris which I've played  for 7 years. I have 1,400 hours in this one in a bit over 1 year or so. I remember it taking me weeks to finish a game. That's down to days now. Some is improvements, but mostly that is actually knowing a bit more about what I am doing and planning things more efficiently. But that gives you some idea about the learning curve.

Point is, the game is hard. But more than that, it's [i]complex.[/i] Like, so complex that I haven't gotten to the late game in 230 hours of playtime complex. 

So, bit of backstory. This game is designed to be a 'grand strategy' game set in the modern day, where you play one of seven secretive shadow organizations bent on using an alien invasion to further your agenda. Objectives range from serving the aliens, fighting the aliens, forming a peaceful alliance with the aliens, even leaving the solar system on an arcship or just profiting off of the conflict. The first half of the game is spent fighting amongst the other human factions for earthbound resources and space superiority around the inner planets. The second half of the game is where you take the fight to the aliens, and start to actually win the war. The game takes mechanical inspiration from paradox's grand strategy games, as well as featuring a moderately complex 3D space combat engine, all in a blended pseudo turn based but simultaneously real time strategy layer. The game takes thematic inspiration from games such as XCOM and Alpha Centauri. It's the absolute best 'hard sci-fi' game I've [i]ever[/i] played, with most of the technologies in the game (almost all of them other than the alien stuff) being theoretically possible, given how we think science works today.

The game features a complex geopolitical simulation, global research, private research, the aforementioned global and interplanetary strategic layer, 3D space combat, and probably a few things I'm forgetting about. Similar to paradox games, you'll be restarting this one a few times before it really clicks, and even then you might not understand all the mechanics for a long time. 

So, it's big, it's complex, and it's got a lot going on. There's a lot of good, and a fair amount of bad. I'll mention the good first, then get to the bad.

The good: The game is rewarding. Shooting down your first alien ship feels like a ridiculous accomplishment, capturing and/or killing enemy operatives is tense, difficult, and you feel great when it goes right. The space layer is a really fun economic game, and managing your space infrastructure while also trying to hold onto your stuff on earth is fun. There's a ton of fluff and flavor in the various events and technologies, and every single global technology comes with a voiced quote, akin to Alpha Centauri. Each faction gets a different part of the story, so you have a big reason to keep coming back to the game to play each different actor.

So, there's a lot of good, but what about the bad? Well, if you've read the reviews for this, you already know part of it. The game is very, [i]very,[/i] complex, and you'll get absolutely curbstomped by the aliens your first few games. Or several, depending on how much you use the available resources such as guides and asking fellow players. The game also slows down to a grind near the end of the game, where actually achieving your endgame goal can take a long time, even once you've assured your victory. The game also hits you with some really bad RNG sometimes, so you'll either be playing to the tune of RNJesus, or you'll be reloading some annoying events sometimes. The absolute worst part of the game is also its best part, which is the sheer learning curve you'll face your first couple hundred hours.

So, let's talk about the learning curve, the complexity, and the game dragging on later on. The game is hard to figure out. There's not a well-maintained wiki like there is for any paradox game, the tooltips in the game are often vague or not very helpful, sometimes intentionally, and the tech tree is so massive you won't know where to start until you've played it a few times. However, the subreddit and official discord for the game are both very active, and every question I've ever had about the game, I was able to get answered within about 5 minutes at most, and oftentimes I didn't have to wait for more than a minute. If you do get this game, I cannot recommend enough that you ask questions on the discord, because people over there are willing to help. As for the late-game slog, the devs are actively working on it. Councilor automation recently got added, allowing you to bypass the turn-based earth layer once it's stable enough that you can ignore it. Space supremacy late game can be annoying, but most of the focus from the devs up until this point has been on the early game, which has already improved immensely. 

Overall, this is probably my favorite game of 2022 [i]and[/i] 2023, and the currently planned updates mean that it'll likely be my favorite game of 2024, too.

While this transition can feel a bit cumbersome at times, players will find themselves adeptly navigating these mechanics with a bit of practice, adding a satisfying layer of depth to the gameplay.

One of the standout aspects of Terra Invicta is its intricate economy system. Stabilizing nations within the game is no small feat, requiring a keen understanding of complex mechanics and a significant investment of time and resources. This might sound daunting at first, but the process of mastering the intricacies of nation-building and optimizing resources for interstellar conflict becomes a rewarding experience that strategy enthusiasts will relish.

Terra Invicta sets itself apart with its covert operations and espionage, imbuing the game with a thrilling, spy-like ambiance. Players navigate the murky waters of secret organizations, each with their own political agendas and ethical ambiguities. The game poses intriguing moral dilemmas: Will you defend humanity against the alien threat, seek a peaceful coexistence, exploit the situation for personal gain, or pursue short-term glory at the expense of the planet's future? This rich narrative backdrop allows for a diverse range of role-playing opportunities, letting players truly immerse themselves in their chosen faction's strategy and ethos.

The early stages of the game are particularly engaging, offering the satisfying challenge of expanding your influence across the globe. However, the game's combat system presents a steep learning curve, with a breadth of technologies that may still require balancing and refinement for a more streamlined experience.

One area ripe for improvement is habitat management, which, in its current state, can sometimes devolve into a tedious affair. Streamlining these aspects could greatly enhance the overall pacing and enjoyment of the game.

Terra Invicta is a captivating addition to the strategy genre, offering a complex and nuanced experience that will appeal to players who relish the challenge of mastering intricate game mechanics and delving into the strategic intricacies of interstellar conflict and diplomacy.

Hard both in regard to the fact that is firmly grounded in realism, and in the fact that even on normal the game is sometimes unforgiving. I have looked at other reviews before writing this, and to everyone complaining about ""game hard""/""needs spreadsheets""/""couldn't grok"". You are right. The game is hard. It does need spreadsheets. It has a learning cliff akin to a Paradox game. It has a bunch of newbie traps. There are some dev design decisions I do not agree with (and I mod the game accordingly).  

That said, this is a game for which I create spreadsheets, and for which I write mods. It is fantastic. It has everything I want from the grand strategy. Just like ogres, this game has layers and distinct phases. It goes from a scramble for Earth which is modeled accurately for the state it was on February 2022, complete with Russia losing in Ukraine. 

Most every country is represented (some minor countries are joined into mini-unions, e.g. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are represented as ""Baltic States"" unitary), with what I consider accurate and factual information on their internal states, including general levels of freedom, population, upheaval and PPP GDP. C'mon, the game uses PPP GDP per capita! The scramble is fun; reminds me a little of Hearts of Iron - not in mechanics, but in the feel. The world is a cutthroat place. It is not fair and not even. If you are not a great power (there are, I would argue, 3: USA, China and combined EU, with India being an honorable mention. Sorry, Russia, despite the nukes you are a local wannabe hegemon at best)... If you are not a great power, well, sucks to be you. If you aim to uplift a random African country to be a bastion of spaceflight in 2022... good luck! You are welcome to try it as a challenge. 

Still, your (and others) shadowy organisations behind world's governments don't have enough control capacity at first to, between all ya'll, control the whole world, so there will always be space to rebound and recover. At first. As your capacity grows, the world becomes progressively smaller place. And then you zoom out, and realize that holy crap, there is whole Solar System, and it's a BIG place! 

As the Earth politics shift into background (don't get me wrong, they never truly go away - Earth is you cradle and you WILL fight for it), you engage in a bonafide space race to Luna -> Mars (and, soon after, Mercury + Asteroids). Whichever faction first establishes an extraterrestrial economy will have a leg up. Still, just like there is plenty of space on Earth (at first), there is plenty of space in the Belt. Even if you lose the race, you have potential to recover. At first the space up to the Belt is enormous... but as you develop better and better technology it ""shrinks"". 

And then you realize that hey, you might have spent a better part of a decade kicking other human factions, but this is a game where aliens invade. Because that's when 2030s ""happen"", and you start to stretch out your space presence and aliens don't like that, and they will slap you down, and there won't be absolutely anything you'd be able to do about it. Resistance is futile, and you will lose your nascent infrastructure, and your ships, and your stations, and eventually they might even land actual invasion armies so, you know, more Hearts of Iron. With aliens. 

But eventually you develop sufficient technological edge to be able to stand up to alien threat in space. Suicide runs with missile frigates at first. Single ship engagements. Larger and larger group. With the focus firmly in space, you will fight a complex mobile campaign first over the Inner orbits, slowly shifting over to the outer Solar System (in a real time space combats using fully customizable, Newtonian-physics, realistic ships reminiscent of Expanse's Rocinante), to Jupiter and Saturn, always developing your manufacturing and technological base and meeting aliens on more and more even terms, all the while researching them and figuring out what it is they want. 

And eventually you will stand up to their doomstacks, and you will make them take notice. You will flip the proverbial table, and after trials and tribulations you will figure out what it is you need to do to kick them out of your system. Or, you know, submit to them and make them Humanity's overlords, if you are playing as Servants, you monster. 'Cause that's totally an option. 

Appropriately from the creators of the X-Com's Long War, this is a long war, stretching anywhere from 20 to 40 (or more...) in-game years, with some definitive ups and down. Just as you think you ""got it"", the game tells you that LOL no, you do not, over and over again. It expands on itself, adding strategic layers and options. You wage a war against overwhelming, unknown and unfair odds, but it is a war you can win, if you are good enough. This is the quintessential ""one more turn"" / ""one more technology"" title. It consumes you. 

Are there some rough edges? Yes, this is Early Access. Is this THE BEST Early Access I've seen? It is, the game is feature complete. Devs are working on issues, and they are responsive. Terra Invicta is very clearly a labor of love to them. This game is fantastic. It's a gift that keep on giving. If you finished reading this novel, good on you. I love this game, warts and all. Top marks all around. Highest recommendation.",1706597007,1706597330,True,103,0,0.885679066181182861,3,True,False,True

Unfortunately, the other 80% of the game is a super-slog of incredibly unfun win conditions, usually chasing down vast numbers of alien ships to achieve a win condition. Either you'll achieve a rather unsatisfying win or the game's slow performance will grind you down first and it'll take like 50-100 hours to find out which.  

Some of the game design is a bit baffling. Like... instead of manually clicking through each of 30+ space stations or bases to upgrade my hab from level 1 to level 2, or from level 2 to level 3, maybe give players an option to automatically upgrade habs as soon as it's available? Also mines. Also point defense arrays. Also solar cells. And also research campuses. Okay, just get used to spending a SHIT TON of time clicking through 30+ bases looking for stuff to upgrade. This is not good base management. 

The game is incredibly long and repetitive, with hugely diminishing returns on player actions. In your first few hours, you can win over the EU and US and India and China to your side. And then a few more hours for Russia and Indonesia, and then the next like 50 hours of Earth-based play are going to add maybe 10-20% of the benefit for vastly more work than it took to win over the major powers. Do not even TRY to go after South America or Africa unless you want to bounce around stabilization counselors to prevent these countries from CONSTANTLY launching into civil wars or coups until you can put in a tremendous amount of mindless clicks to form a continent-wide African Union or South American Union which come so late that whatever (very little) money or research they could produce for you, is already completely overwhelmed by off-world mining and research at that point anyway. In the base game, like half of the countries on Earth have such a high starting unrest and inequality that AIs can push them into like 3+ coups a year if they are feeling dickish enough to prevent you from attaining the resources of a Lesotho or Nicaragua. I think it takes more player actions to take and hold a random third-world country than a United States or China which are 100x more impactful in every conceivable way. The AI factions will almost never steal a US control point and don't fight very hard in Europe or China either, but BY GOD they are not giving up Lesotho without like six coups even AFTER you've spent like 12 actions trying to stabilize whatever goons you're passing off as a government there this week. Maybe attempts to stabilize a government might have a larger effect the country is small in economy/population?

The game is not very good on the fleet management side either, and the performance on the game absolutely blows in a way I haven't seen on any other game in the last ten years. Even on the very minimum settings, with only half of factions included, by late-game each turn takes several minutes to figure out what it will do with the aliens' unending suicide waves of low-impact junk ships. Can I recommend taking a look at Stellaris instead? It's way better than this, in almost every way, but especially on the performance side. 

(Also, if we could get very exotic, maybe adding any good automation plans for councilors? Probably not too hard to work out basic Crackdown/Purge combinations, I'd guess? Or Protect Interests/Advise combinations once the entire world is under your control? Right now, the only thing that Automate seems to do is prioritize Protect Interests everywhere, which is like 1% of what councilors do for your team).",1704867881,1706538669,False,70,6,0.738546848297119141,0,True,False,True

So, I'd recommend you to give it a try.

My original review comment:
Game is deep and interesting, but .... WAAAAYYYYY too slow.
Paradox is famous (infamous) for its grand strategies that are also slow. But they progress faster: every 1-2-3 hours of the game play you can have some reasonable progress and in 2-3 weeks you can finish the game. And even that is quite a bit.
TI ... for the same time span (""2-3""-ish weeks).. you can play... 30%?

You can try out many factions with their own way how to solve the problem. There are tons of game mechanics, but tough learning curve.

Somebody who loves space and strategies such as Stellaris with more challenging mechanics will love this game.

Still, I hope devs will never forget, that the game is a game. Players don't want to suffer or collide with reality directly :)
- Flipping CP by servants / aliens of your nations where you spent over 20 hours to grow is extremely painful.
- Random events sometimes are extremely unfair. Like having -3 boosts twice for the same year at start of the game or by being in defence wars getting several atrocities by literally doing nothing.
- In my last game, servants got popularity in all countries by 20-50% every 3 months and all my councilors were busy with public opinion missions all the time. That ruined my game since I controlled China until it was not finally overwhelmed by flipping CP and servants public opinion.

Yes, I know that players could bring their skills and overcome most of problems, but not all players have so much patience and experience. I will not write what can be improved and how, that's up to developers.

Thank you for a good game.

There is a lot coming together in this game, as has been said elsewhere, it brings some genre diverse systems  together, 4x-ish, space combat, base-building, politics, agent/character development, resource management... I my opinion it does it well, although I have to admit I have not finished a play-through yet.  One nice twist is that you play an ideology, and your opponents are ideologies, so you can't really wipe them out in the 4x sense of exterminating them, rather it is a matter of understanding their methods, out-playing them and weakening them while achieving your aims. Expect games to be long. 

This is one of those EA titles that is more late beta than early alpha, it feels like an almost feature complete premium title that just needs polish, QOL love and some good documentation.
Because of this, it is difficult to get into. The first few games will probably be learning by failing, which is driving people to YouTube videos on ""how to play"". This is a shame because this game is a really complex in-depth game whose biggest strength is how many, many, ways it can be approached and enjoyed, but it is so, so easy to learn to play the game of an experienced youtuber and entirely miss out on all the fun you could have learning to play your own game and discover through the challenges presented, your own strengths and weaknesses.

I recommend this game. I am enjoying it hugely, and I am discovering through lots of mistakes and losses how I would play my part in a secret organisations struggle to guide humanity through contact with an alien threat. 

If you feel as if frustration with an un-documented interface and not very helpful tutorial would drive you to YouTube then maybe give it a miss until those aspects are more fleshed-out. This is an ambitious game. I love it.
*Edit a year later.
This early access game has been actively developed and bugfixed and is remaining true to it's original concept, which as has been said is hugely ambitious. 
I really haven't been playing it as much as I thought I would, this isn't because it is bad it is because playing the game gives me an experience that at some point this ambitious vision will come together into a fun long-term experience. It hasn't yet, so I sometimes try it out and then go back to waiting. tl;dr, Terra Invicta is a lot of fun to play, but for me still unrewarding at this stage, looking forward to checking out the improvements as it progresses through early access.

In Terra Invicta you play as one of seven transnational factions that have very different ideologies of how to respond to the proof that alien life exists. These factions can broadly be dived up into those who will try to contest the aliens attempt at a conquest of the earth, and the ones who will work for the aliens in their conquest. 
There are only two real play styles, pro or anti alien. No matter what every faction is out for themselves. Hilariously so with the Protectorate faction, as the aliens only support the Servants (the other pro alien faction) in their subversive actions, meaning the Protectorate is incentivized to kill off alien counselors! 
What distinguishing elements between the factions that are there are really cool. The Academy (Those who want a mutually beneficial, and peaceful relationship with the aliens) will have an early game advantage in world opinion as most of humanity favours such an outcome. But when it is proven that the aliens don't come in peace, they will go through a crisis losing support worldwide, and their methods of control becoming extra vulnerable to being seized by other factions, reflecting that more radical options are becoming more popular, now that peace seems to be foreclosed upon. The game needs more events like that.
Right now the factions do have some small variance (A couple different event options/ some faction techs), but lack anything that truly changes up the generic play style of your stance on aliens. Ultimately as well everything will come down to a contest in the space war. Due to the different objectives for a human victory all concluding with a strong human presence in space, and vice versa with an alien supporter victory. 
Ideally things would have that alpha centauri level of immersion where every faction feels super different. Having more options individually available to each faction would be amazing, for example Humanity first could basically ride the resistance acting as the more covert extremist wing of the fight against the alien menace, getting by through stealing, and sabotaging, using the criminal underworld explicitly, or other underhanded methods including deniable acts of terrorism. Now almost everything I mentioned is potentially in the game, but it's so much fluff easily indistinguishable from options available to other factions, or not an actual viable strategy for victory. 
The differences in ideology are a core part of the premise, I really hope they expand upon what is already there into vastly different experiences for each faction.

There is a bit of a learning curve, and you can end up in an unwinnable situation. But that early game rush is the most fun time in the game you'll have. As it's when things become calcified into established blocs, and power bases, with the focus shifting to space things start to slow down, and feel more like busywork due to the lengthy travel/ build times in space.

I have come to resent this game in recent days in an attempt to complete it. I essentially completed this game many hours ago into my playthrough, Earth was essentially safe from the alient threat and I had become stronger than the aliens but the game required me to complete a series of tedious tasks such that I could complete the game on its poorly defined terms. It was no longer fun, it was simply a case of pressing space every minute and waiting for my ships to traverse the vast distances of the universe such that I could destroy the aliens and win. If you think you want to play this, I would simply recommend you go and watch a variety of YouTube videos of playthroughs and vicariously play the game through them, because in reality you'll get to experience most of this game and you can speed up the watch speed to ""complete"" it in a reasonable time frame. 

Sadly, the early portion of this game is quite engaging when you're trying to build your influence on Earth and defend Earth against overwhelming odds. But once you've overcome this initial difficulty and got to a position where you can fight back, it really just becomes a case of grinding out a victory. I struggle to understand many of the decision that the development team have chosen to make. In many aspects of the game, they have chose realism over fun and I can understand the desire to produce a realistic game, but they have sacrificed so much to achieve that. Yes, the solar system is massive and it takes a long time to traverse with near future technology but its not fun watching ships slowly travel between planets, the enemy running away without any opportunity to catch them and then having to wait years for your ships to repair after a battle which you won decisively but took undeterminable damage to some of your ships disabling their drives so they can't travel anymore. On top of that, the late game slowdown modelling the entire universe really causes the late game to drag.

Yes, this game is still in early access but I've had this game for a year and really all that has changed is some minor balance alterations and some bug fixes, I just don't see them taking feedback from the community and making wholescale changes to the game loop and pacing to make this a good game. I'm aware there's 7 factions but having looked at what most of their win conditions are, the factions for me really don't have enough to differentiate them from one another except for the pro vs anti alien factions and I don't see that ever being enough to want to come back and experience something different.",1703115075,1705451241,False,60,6,0.783086895942687988,0,True,False,True

I suppose if I spent another 1 or 2 hundred on this I may get to the point of winning space battles but it is just so much time to put into a grind.

2: Manage a wide array of nations and play politics with them, encourage economic development of key areas

3: Manage a growing interplanetary space programme, with customisable base layouts and mining yields

4: Construct and design a fleet of nuclear-powered (or whatever engine you please) spacecraft, and deck it out with near-future weapons and modules.

The UI is so clunky as to be unpleasant to use, and the performance is horrible for the bad graphics that are offered. 90% of the game is sending around your councillors on the same kind of missions over and over and over again. Every time you do so there's hefty amounts of RNG involved, so a playthrough is largely determined by luck. Imagine in X-Com if you didn't have the tactical battles where you could use your wits to win but instead only rolled dice for the success rate of the missions. The amount of strategic options you have is rather thin for a geopolitical sim, and the whole flow of the game feels choppy when every few in-game weeks you are interrupted with having to assign your councillors to new missions. It's an ""ugh, not again"" moment every time, and a game shouldn't have those as a central mechanic. Something needs to be redesigned then. Thankfully, even the game realizes it's tedious and spaces the assignment phases out more and more as the game progresses, but that whole mechanic should be revamped. 

I got to Mars before I realized that it's just going to be more of the same throughout the rest of the campaign and couldn't be bothered to continue on any more. The game is in need of a massive overhaul in gameplay, balance, graphics, performance, UI and space combat, as well as a serving of additional content and events. If it got all that, it could be an amazing game, but as of now it's just a shallow, unpolished husk of what it could be..

Make the wrong tech choices, reload from past save and play again.  
 
A major part of the issue with this game is an unnecessarily huge tech tree with parts of it not useful. 
 
Another major issue is the game plays way to slow.  26 turns in 1 year and the game lasts 30+ years.  
 
The faction interaction needs a lot of work.  You can't knock a faction out of the game and even if you've made ""allies"" that doesn't stop them from interfering with you.  Over time, it becomes tedious trying to manage the other factions and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the game.  

The UI is simply bad.  Too many clicks required for a game that's hundreds of turns.  

Alien hate is simply bad design.  Aliens drops randomly.  But if they land in your country you have to kill them to prevent massive damage.  Kill 2 aliens, they go to orange.  Kill 3, they go to red and wipe out your space assets.  Get 3 unlucky drops and it's restart the game.  Bad design.

I thought the game was interesting so I watched several vids before buying last year but after watching one from someone I hadn't seen before and then a series from one of my favs, Potato and seeing him having such a hard time (bet he had more than a few shots of his McWhiskey) was on the fence. then saw a set from another fav Perun decided to buy it and use his approach.  Unfortunately numerous changes to the game since his vids caused the game to be  something I cannot recommend. 
After several attempts trying to get close to his start finally got one where i was only 7 months behind his start but the game was going good. I took a break from mid Dec to mid Jan and when i came back the Jan 9 update completely ruined the play and turned it into a boring slog. spent over 150 hours getting nowhere in the game putting me at 300 hours. so I stopped playing. I decided to see if the newer updates helped and they l did .... somewhat still a lot of bs just trying to get to engage the alien fleets. 
Some of the major issues still 
the worst generated die rolls I have ever seen. ur counselers get 2 turns a month to do actions on earth. 6 ppl = 12 missions in a month. In one month I had the following chances to complete 59% 67%, 75%, 83%, 88%, 91%, 92% , 95%, 95%, 96%, 97% and 98% the only one that worked was the 67%. saved the game and checked the loyalty all were over 20 with 2 being at 25. Even now after several updates this is a major issue. I would estimate at least 40-45 percent of the rolls generated since I started playing again were rolls of 75 or higher. If I wasn't generating attempt % of high 88 to 99 on each missions  I would have failed a lot of missions (even failed a couple at a 99% rate to complete). This is VERY FRUSTRATING!
The updates have significantly nerfed numerous items that make/contribute to making the game a slog. Some were needed but all together way too much. First science production has been drastically reduced .... even using same countries as Perun not even half the science generated with same countries and same governing approach but after a game 15+ years longer than his dont even have half his science output ... need some sort of balance here. second the off world resources have been reduced so takes longer to get what you need to fight the aliens. Finally the trade has been completely nerfed. I will be the first to agree that when Perun was able to run his economy off of trade of resources it was a bit much but they have gone way to far to the opposite end of the spectrum and at this point trade for credits is basically worthless. 
Fleet battle is also haves several issues, First after the Jan update last year it takes 20 to 40 intercept attempts for your inferior speed fleets to be able to force a battle. In almost none of the battles could I get the fleets to change altitudes so finally gave up and let Ai take over.

Real-time (With turn base twist) Strategy game of Earth during first Alien interactions (In all cases will be invasion at certain point, but when it happen depends on endless factors) and tactical game of early technology space battles. Perfect balance of realism and gameplay packed in long duree struggle, accent is on realism.

8 Factions with different goals from those Resisting Alien influences (and invasion in the end) to those who want to placate Aliens, those who want to evacuate earth, those who want to get stronger from alien technology and interactions...etc etc) and different methods of attaining it. Currently most detailed is one of ""Resistence"" where you do not want to wipe out aliens but will do everything in your power to resist them and keep our independence and freedom.

Game has 4 elements:
- Counselors management + every 2-4 week you give orders to 1-6 counselors - your main capability what to can do. (Initially focused on Earth) 
- Realtime interaction: Move armies and wage war, create/build/move/intercept spaceships which CAN commence space battles
- If manually taken over Space battles are 100% realtime every second is counted and missed in strategy world.
- Manage research/technology (You slowly evolve collectively together with all factions and individually using your capacity)

I think pros are very obvious

Cons at this point are:
- Councillor stuff can get repetitive in mid-late game where focus and action is outside Earth while intensity of Councillor actions should be equally maintained. (Devs have this in work, most probably you will give actions every 4 weeks then)
- Technology tree is unique yes but not very user friendly to understand and it feels underwhelming when you do get different technologies, all descriptions are there yes, but whole interaction seems very shallow even if it is very deep, more effort here would improve it big way.
- Regular early access game imbalance (normally expected at this point) that leads to some strategies while overshadowing other.

I am not a save-and-reload kind of guy, unless I am studying game mechanics, but when the best I can do is 3% assassination attempt with 25 inspection and 25 espionage,  that becomes the only option.  When the alien keeps establishing and expanding an administration in China without building the supposedly prerequisite building, its the only option.  When he splits up an established federation and steals three countries in one turn, its the only option.

Again, its not a question of searching the internet for the secret, hidden, underlying logic of what is happening.  Its the fact it isn't fun to spend more time on Reddit than playing.  Discovering a new way to lose after 250 hours is very definitely not fun.

You'll spend (dozens of) hours just doing shadow politics on Earth before even getting a significant space presence. Then you'll stare at the giant tech tree (or web?) to figure out how to even get all the components to assemble a basic ship, then you'll keep staring some more to figure out which of the hundreds of reactors and drives you're gonna need and how they fit together.
Then you'll be planning multi-year transfers, trying to get optimal launch windows, and coordinate rendezvous.

It is one of those games with incredible potential, but failing to meet that potential. I mean, truly incredible... it could become the greatest space game of all time... if... if if if.

What I like:
This is easily the most realistic space game I've ever played. You progress from crappy ships that can't leave orbit, to ships that can zip across the solar system, all with conceivable technology and realistic trade-offs between delta-v and thrust. All of the technology appears to be well researched and based on real life ideas. 

What I don't like:
- mid and late game are a boring slog. You are just building up a fleet big enough to attack alien stations, and it takes forever and there's not much else to do while at that stage. 
- aliens turtle up at their stations and simply add to their huge fleets that just sit there, waiting for you to attack
- space stations are uninteresting and unbalanced. Wildly unbalanced... and ugly. And irrational. 
- ship classes/sizes have grandiose names but are underwhelming. Titan is not titanic at all. Destroyer doesn't really destroy things any better than a Monitor, and doesn't fit into a niche that would justify developing a different class of ship for what it does. Same story for all the classes. 
- unrealistic resource management in space. All of your space resources are available anywhere in space. 
- too demanding of my computer's resources - you're using all my RAM and CPU and my fan goes full blast when the game opens - it doesn't seem like you've bothered to optimize game performance at all. 

Suggestions:
- the biggest thing to fix and add dynamism to the mid and late game is space resource management. Resources should exist somewhere and be vulnerable to attack or interception. I recommend space depots serving a real function as warehouses, and when you use resources you tell the game which depot to pull them from, which entails different transit times based on distance, and the depots should have to link to a ""mass driver"" (currently a useless spaceship drive - its an electromagnetic sling) to launch resource packets to where they will be used. Those resource packets could then be intercepted by rivals who can divert them to their own depots, which eventually necessitates defending resource packets with fleets. THAT would be a dynamic space game. And it would be easy to implement in this game. 

- space stations are ugly and uninteresting. Supposedly there's a population living there... Better art would go a long way to fixing that, but also the people living there should have needs. The hard 3 leveled station system doesn't make sense. If more living space is required, you wouldn't wait for a magically higher level ""core"" (whatever that's supposed to be) to upgrade, and you wouldn't say ""oh bummer, there's no more space left to build... out here in space..."" - you would just build the new facilities. How to fix? You need some trade-off system other than level and slots - I suggest 'visibility' and 'bandwidth' - a more visible station would be discovered more easily. Just get rid of these absurd and immersion breaking restrictions. 

- You could add a lot more dynamism by having each faction develop a space body into their main HQ or power base, shifting away from Earth. It's way too easy to dominate the other factions on Earth and render them irrelevant. Eventually, power should move to space, as well as population and research. Imagine Project Exodus turning a metallic asteroid into a beehive of activity and slowly transforming it into an arc that leaves for the Sirius system with 100 million people living on it? And while it builds into that, a stream of resources are coming into orbit to build orbital defense arrays (a separate kind of station) and sky farms (a separate kind of station) and shipyards (a separate kind of station). 

- a titan class ship should be so huge that a station can't build it - it should be as big as a station or bigger. Probably same for Dreadnoughts. The crew for ships with such names should be in the thousands. 

- all ships and stations should have a stock of food. You could replenish the food with space farms, or you could have some stations specialize in food production and shipping food to other stations and the fleet. Similarly, poop is a useful fertilizer, so if you can ship it back to the farms, great ; if you choose not to at least expel waste from a ship, then disease could kill the crew and less crew = utility modules working less effectively.

- need a way to generate boost in space, if all the money making modules require boost. At least let colonies of sufficient population generate boost. 

Now ask yourself : do you want to make the greatest strategy of all time? Currently this game is not worth recommending. Great potential, though.",1702172174,1703442888,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You'll be told you need a major country to get more than a trickle of boost, but you'll never get more than a tiny percentage chance of boosting your popularity in those countries and the more you spend to boost your effectiveness the more the dice roller will screw you over.

Want to build anywhere else other than orbit? tough shit, you don't have enough boost, and the game won't let you have more, see above about major countries.
You're in a popularity contest, except agents for the aliens are invincible and so you can't stop them and THEY HAVE MIND CONTROL!
Also remember, this is all dice rolls. You often can't influence these rolls other than shovelling resources or slowly incrementally improving your agents.

At the moment it's very... very... very (did I say very?) slow. Like I mean I've played a few restarts and I can play for hours and feel like I've accomplished nothing. Now this could well be because I don't know what I'm doing, as the game does a frankly really poor job of explaining what you should *actually be doing*. 
I feel like I have a rough handle on things but still there's an unholy amount of click, wait, click, wait etc with little actual feedback unless it's an instant councillor decision. It feels very hard to get a sense of feedback from some of your decisions and some things seem arbitrarily difficult while others seem much easier than they should be.

Have a look at some gameplay footage, but unless you're a fan of the team (as I was) and/or a fan of the type of game it could theoretically become, I would probably hold off until the game has developed some more.

*edit* - I ended up playing about 70 hours of this in total, looked at it on and off over time but sadly the appeal faded very quickly. The game was just really quite dull to me. The majority of the gameplay revolving around moving your agents (pandemic board game style) to perform tasks is not interesting. The tech tree wasn't fun or particularly deep. The space combat was awful and required significant investment (in time or watching tons of videos) to figure out effectively.

I cannot recommend this game, especially not to anyone who enjoys XCOM style games (it is absolutely nothing like them).",1664539261,1703021079,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,True

There's also like 4 games in one here layered on top of each other:  a globetrotting spy strategy game that plays like a board game, a geopolitical grand strategy sim, a space colonization game that takes inspiration from the board game High Frontier, and real time hard physics space combat game with a ship design system that is less kerbal and more like Hearts of Iron vehicle designers with every hypothetical space technology you can find on the Atomic Rockets website.

Overall it needs balance work and tweaking but that's what early access is for.  There's a fully playable game here.  If it feels slow there's plenty of new settings to make a faster or more intense game and future plans to have later starts.  More settings to possibly speed up some geopolitical actions would be welcome if they could be balanced properly.

There's also a framework for a competitive space colonization/warfare game here that could discard the alien invasion for those that want a more laid back game.  It could easily take advantage of the robust systems already developed.

The idea of controlling a guiding force towards an agenda in the event of an alien invasion is a great idea, but the mechanics of the game of it in Terra Invicta are a bit dreary.

You select a few individuals as a team then micromanage this team through bi-monthly missions - not the fun kind from Xcom, but the boring kind - drop down boxes and waiting for a success/fail result based on RNG,
And that's pretty much it - waiting...waiting... waiting. It feels like these Xcom modders picked the most boring bit of Xcom to turn into a game - the world map - without the fun mission part ; literally the worst part of the gameplay loop.

The space combat is supposed to represent the fun in this game, but its so badly balanced and swamped in the bloated tech tree that ships are either too weak or completely OP.
The AI is also so poor it ruins the game by making you feel like you're fighting one stupid AI, and not 6 disparate factions plus aliens with their own agendas...
You can never really ally with other factions because they are all part of that one AI trying to beat you the player in as shamelessly obvious way as possible. The AI is the worst part of the game for me, worse even than the boring bi-monthly click-fest of mission spamming - it just removes fun from the game.

So to sum up, its not a terrible game, but not a fun one either and certainly not worth it at full price.

I think mission control needs to be easier to obtain, Having just a few settlements and habitats can effectively prevent you from expanding further out into space due to the strain on your MC, especially given that every ship you build also contributes to your MC total. I think a decent way to remedy this would be to make it so that operations centers built on settlements and habs generate more MC than they currently do (one), so that it's easier to build a self-sustaining presence in space. 
Second, I think the tutorial could probably do with a bit of reworking. I only found out that I could directly change a nation's investment into a certain field by clicking on a certain part of the menu a few hours into the game, which may or may not just have been me being an idiot, but still, it would nice to have a tutorial that goes over what the player can do, rather than what the player *should* do. 
Third, I think it would be nice to have more of the earth to play around with. Not just with more detailed borderlines and regions, but also with antarctica, an entire continent that goes completely unused as far as I can tell. I feel like the various nations of the world would probably be more willing to try and take the antarctic territory for themselves once the alien arrival starts throwing things into chaos. 
Fourth, I'd like to be able to colonize venus and the gas giant planets with floating colonies or something like that. As it stands, venus and the gas giants don't really have much going on, except for the gas giants' moons, which actually can be colonized. I know the various gassy planets don't have much of a surface to colonize, but the ability to build floating cities or something would still be nice. I imagine these colonies wouldn't be able to extract solid resources, but would probably be able to extract a high amount of water and volatiles as a trade off. That's just how I imagine something like that working.
Fifth, I would absolutely love to see the option to customize the solar system and planets. I know you can choose different versions of the normal solar system with different numbers of celestial bodies, but it would be amazing to have completely different solar systems entirely. Like, imagine being able to play in the solar system of ""The many frontiers"", an alternate solar system made by u/nip_dip on r/imaginarymaps on reddit! Having multiple different habitable planets, and way more celestial bodies to explore would be awesome. Alternatively, being able to customize the borders of the nations of earth would be pretty cool too. Being able to customize the state of the world to resemble something like ""The New Order: Last Days of Europe"", or ""For Want of a Nail: If Burgoyne Had Won at Saratoga"" would honestly be a dream come true. I know anything like that would a long ways off, if it's even feasible, but generally speaking, more customization over the earth and surrounding solar system would go a long way towards making this game even better than it already is.

Im not even halfway through it and its a LOT to take in and somewhat complex, but so rewarding when you make progress. My first three space combatants just took out the first alien ship (just a surveillance vessel) in Earth Orbit for the first time in history, while losing one escort craft.

The ""Conspiracy Game"" on Earth, the Space 4x and the space combat really blend in well with each other.

Edit: Im now over 200h and still the first playthough, seems to be nearing its end since the Alien fleets are now easily defeated and i can take down their Stations and Bases.

Now my only criticisms: Tech Tree is a bit bloated, feels like you could scratch half the Techs in there without losing anything meaningful. Figuring out which drives to research and use is a bit tedious and half of them could easily be removed. Also short descriptions what drives are good and bad at in the Tech Tree would be helpful.

And lastly its a bit long - 200 hours for a single playthrough is pushing it..., its epic and all but could easily be made a little less epic and it would still be epic. IMO they went a bit overboard with the scale.

Best description I can give is it's a great game but in a very obvious stage of early access. Don't agree with the comments made about the AI but the game play really does need looking at; it's too much and the layout is just a confusing mess.

Genuinely great graphics, but the game doesn't warrant it. A lot of work went into customisability  (not a word but should be) and graphics that should've gone into interface design. It's just a wall of information that really slows down an already very slow paced game. Full speed takes forever, there's no need for this game to have minute by minute progression, it makes no sense.

Tutorial needs work, a lot of work. I've played less than an hour and restarted the game twice having gotten myself into an unplayable position twice.... in the tutorial. The walk through hints and tips basically pile on too much info and the general gist of the game is lost and it's difficult to determine what the next step is. It's even more confusing when you have multiple hints, tips and objectives with no clear relationship popping up every turn. Your basically playing about 4 different tutorials from the get go, rather than a lead progressive process.

Having said that, you do get the grips of the game by ignoring the really annoying voice over tutorial, and just following the text tutorial at the top of the window.

The mid game starts slowing down very hard to the point of being almost comically excessive. The late game, if you ever get to it, is a constant bug hunt of flinging fleets to hunt down aliens and shooting your councilors around Earth to quell uprisings caused by other factions. It may be slightly better if the devs switch the turn based system fully to a real time system rather than the turn based system punctuated by real time events for the sake of speed and constantly breaking the players flow of game play. It may also be a good addition if in the mid game you can either make peace with certain factions and have them join you if they have a good enough opinion of you or if you can find the faction leader, kill them, and have the faction dissolve and therefore removed from play. Councillors also need a serious rework, towards the shift from the early to mid game I often find myself having little to nothing to do with them and having them on permanent rebel suppression or nation building. Moving the councilors to a more abstract role where they are based out of the country you hire them from and giving a bonus to actions and influence there within might be better. Additionally, instead of having the councilors conducting actions directly have them be more akin to what they would be in a real world scenario, someone who pushes the resources of the organization to achieve a goal rather than them doing the actions directly. This could allow for the organization in a real time system to commit its actions in terms of resources available rather than a set number of actions per turn tied to number of councilors.",1701210197,1701210197,False,6,0,0.57113957405090332,0,True,False,True

My primary criticisms with the game are:

-Caliphate should get a claim on New Delhi
-Should also consider giving Pan Asia and European Union conceivable pathways to claims on New Delhi
-And Vise/Versa to a lesser degree give India more options to claims across Arabia, Asia, Europe, and Africa but in a way so the entire Eastern world can't come under one flag   
-There should be a late game ""United America"" unity movement that encompasses the entire Western world
-There should also be an even later game unity movement that focuses around building a ""4th tier"" space station that can only be built around Earth and functions as a global capital and has a claim on all territories for the ultimate united Earth  unity movement
-Potentially consider adding a xcom or xenonauts combat layer to the game where you can send in aircraft to shoot down UFOs and send in a group of special ops soldiers that level 

Overall the game is great as it is and worth purchasing. It defiantly has the potential to be a gaming icon if the developers continue working on the game.

I will list the pro's and con's.
Pro's
-Fun system, using councilors for controlling nations and building up your economy for the fight.
-A long involved tech tree with lots to discover.
-The opportunity to colonize the solar system and take the fight to the enemy.
-Ship design and building.
-Realistic physics regarding space combat.

Con's
-The game takes too long to win imo. Building up the necessary tech, economy and fleet to really fight back takes many turns to accomplish. I've heard others say you can finish a playthrough in 100hrs, but I'm not seeing it (might be because I am not that good...)
-The tech tree has many dead ends and useless tech. Some of the engines you research are practically useless and it takes a bit to figure you what's useful. Same with many other techs.
-The game can be very punishing in random ways. For example, if an alien invasion comes in the ""wrong"" place geographically, you are pretty much forced to use nuclear weapons to stop them, guaranteeing a much tougher campaign.
-The higher levels of difficultly feel nearly impossible early in the game. It supposed to be hard, but maybe not quite that hard....

Regardless, the pro's outweigh the con's and if you like a strategy game where you face off against an alien invasion, it's pretty cool.",1701119862,1701119862,True,2,0,0.502923965454101563,0,True,False,True

It is early access, and many parts of the interface are repetitive, requiring massive click storms that should be a series of checkboxes and a simple 'OK'

The graphics are good, particularly considering that the engine smoothly scales from the entire Sol system down to a zoomed-in fraction of a planet or asteroid.

The OST is solid, if a bit repetitive, but then again it's rare to find a strategy game that doesn't cycle a small selection of tracks in the background.

So, if it's not the UI, or the graphics, or the sound, then it has to be the gameplay, no?  Yes indeed, and what gameplay there is.

Is it X-Com?  Yes, mostly, kinda?
Is it Hearts of Iron?  A bit, yeah.
Is it SimCity?  A little.
Is it Homeworld?  It would be if homeworld paid attention to some old guy named Newton and those pesky laws of motion when handling its big, beautiful space battles.
Is it KSP? Name me another game that lets you tune an orbital transfer between planetary systems based on actual physics.  

Terra Invicta even rolls in some spy thriller mechanics which are outside the bounds of my personal Steam library.

Ok, so it has pieces of a bunch of the greats all pasted together.  Frankly, lots of games do that.  Why, then, should you care?

Because it's difficult but not unbeatable.
Because it's complicated without being unintelligible.
Because it has enough story to get you going but almost immediately explodes into a vast sandbox of possibilities.
Because it rewards patience and long-term planning, but still lets you succeed if you'd rather slash and burn your way through.

Spoilers follow, since it includes details of the story, mechanics, and endgame.
[spoiler]
Pick from seven different ideologies, each with different ideas of what ""victory"" means and with increasingly different methods available to them.

You have to manage some or all of the nations of Earth in the face of a quadruple threat of crises, a single one of which would be sufficient as the core of a grand strategy game.

Earth is being invaded by hostile Aliens from another solar system.  Ok, well-traversed territory, this.

Also, Earth and its denizens are being manipulated by seven different ideologies/factions that are fighting both a shadow war against each others' operatives as well as more openly contesting each others' control politically, economically, and militarily.

Furthermore, it's 2022, most of the nations of the world are broken right now, but they just aren't ready to admit it.  Or to make the kinds of changes that would be necessary to stem the tide of unrest and revolution that comes from a ruling class that ignores the needs and desires of everyone else.

And then there's this pesky thing called Climate Change, with every deregulated power plant, every burn pile turning forest into cow pasture, and the inexorable desire for humans to have children and increase their consumption of... well... everything, frankly.  Dragging you down, hurting your economic potential, increasing the frequency and devastation of all sorts of weather and demographic patterns.

Did I mention you have to solve all four of those simultaneously?  With limited resources, limited actions, and screwing up means that either your species goes extinct, your species goes extinct, or possibly even your species goes extinct?

Start with modern-day technologies and capabilities.  Which are, not surprisingly, insufficient for any of the tasks ahead.  Figure out how to balance increasing your research potential with all of the other demands on your time and resources.  Oh, did I forget to mention that half of the research consists of shared ""global"" projects that can receive investment from all seven factions?  And only the faction that contributes the most to a project gets to decide what the next one is...  But I needed to research Fusion reactors, why the *@&$ are we looking into better ways to disassemble a major nation-state?  Hooray, advanced laser weapons here we come... oh, never mind... we're coming up with a way to send rich people to space so they can bounce-around in zero-gee ball pits instead.

Alright.  We've secured a solid base of Earth's nations and bound them together politically and economically into a power bloc that we can use as a base for development in space.  What's that?  How many rockets do I have to launch to get a single, small mining base at one location on the moon?  Why are almost all of the world's launchpads way up in the northern hemisphere, even though you get much better return on your delta-V if you can launch from the equator?  Ecuador doesn't even HAVE A SPACE PROGRAM?

Wait, you mean I also have to build/expand a Deep Space Network so that I can actually COMMUNICATE with all the ships, stations, and colonies?

Ok, now we're cooking.  We've got mining bases up, we've got a couple of orbital stations with shipyard capabilities, we've even built a couple of warships with hydrolox engines and modified naval artillery.  And now the Aliens are bombing my mining colonies into dust with high-energy lasers, railguns, and plasma weapons...

Whew, we won a battle against the aliens' ships and can finally start to pull apart some of their technology.  Wow, turns out things built by an extrasolar intelligence are different in some pretty substantial ways.  This is going to take a lot of time and research investment that'll have to be diverted from other areas.  Without any immediate return but ignoring which will doom us to defeat.

We've secured an entire planetary system, got all the surface sites humming with mines, useful support from orbital stations, and even a defense fleet that can defeat the raiders that periodically come down from the Kuiper belt to make trouble.  Why am I getting alerts from Earth about extraterrestrial armies invading our nation-states with technology that is centuries beyond anything we've got?  Welp, looks like we get the fantastic choice between sacrificing our entire armed forces in doomed wave attacks or launching nuclear weapons AT OURSELVES and hope that they also get the bad guys.

We blew up an alien base!  Killed all their pretty little ships and then demolished the entire station!  Take that purple evil-doers!  Oh, what's this alert?  That looks suspiciously like a fleet that is more powerful than every single ship we've ever built combined, and it's heading right for our most productive bases or critical space infrastructure?  Wait, how fast are they getting there?  You mean I need something faster than a chemical rocket with almost no delta-V or an ion drive whose thrust is comparable to the weight of a piece of paper?

But eventually, all of you long-game strategy fans will have your turning point.  You can beat them, sometimes at even odds.  Your weapons and armor are actually comparable to theirs.  You can even build some particularly nasty ships that outgun the invaders, even if they have to be larger or less maneuverable in order to do so.  All that careful management you've been doing of both your power bloc Earthside as well as your mining bases and utility stations has finally converted that snowball of investment into an avalanche of resources and capacity.  You'll start winning, and then you'll start winning big and often.  You'll smile every time you fight an incredibly one-sided battle, except this time it's not you who are being battered.

Your reward is this last bit of the endgame, where you get to make use of all the planning, all the potential, all the development you've been doing for so long.

First play through: Humanity First.  
I attempted to usurp influence from vulnerable Eastern European countries with a plan to generate experience and penetrate Russia following the outcome of the war in UKR. Slow and steady with some additional Caucus leverage, I managed to enter the control points of RUS in an attempt to circle Kazakhstan and exploit its geometry – specifically its position on the globe to harness its orbital lift facility. I need to kill aliens right? Endless Coup’s and typical European mayhem distracted me from the real aliens that just entered low earth orbit. Speaking to my Scientists – I have neglected their folly as Aliens influence surrounding countries and airspace. I backed into Southern Europe in a hasty retreat towards the Mediterranean. It's proximity to the equator and seaside eased the diplomatic noise distracting me. However, with the Balkans came poverty – and a happy population did little to drive the economic and engineering feats I need to kill aliens. The enemy launched their third satellite whilst I was onto my first. Only to enter a wrong orbit making it useless for anything other than tourism. I quit.  

Second Play through:  The Resistance.
This time I surrounded the USA by easily dominating the archipelago flanking America’s south. Easy to Topple and with surprising economies and populations found in Cuba and Mexico. I spent immediate attention to the Scientists and their comfort. Sow public influence with activists and then spark a coup with special forces - works every time. Canada was easily vulnerable to public campaigns, influencing all realms of Government early. Surrounding America, It was easy to exploit Government and Media orgs to keep the population happy, and producing lots of capital Lift for my space shit. Orbital command from the USA alone allowed me to withdraw from every treaty and focus on Colonising the Moon, Mars and push to a comfortable missile carrier built in extremely large orbit’s ; efficiently reaching my limited inter-galactic saturn-earth trade routes. This time my satellites worked, and their laboratories completely owned all research output by humans. Missile technology evened the playing field in contact with the enemy, as I now turn to my ageing diplomats and fixers; wondering how to recruit a new generation of resistance.  The rest of the world ate themselves, barely reaching Mars as I mine it's surrounding asteroids. I use psychological operations to soften the motions of earth into subservience. I assassinate worthy opponents early. I spend most of my time designing and resourcing various forms of spacecraft barely coping in combat. I am just sitting on my nuclear bomb's in the USA with the largest Army on Earth, whilst I attempt to direct every ounce of human capital into research output to chance survival of the species.

-gameplay that can be a little repetitive but rewards long-term planning + short-term adaptation

yea terra invicta is pretty good. if you dont want to do 1 or 2, i dont think i'd recommend this game to you. 3 is harder to say.

i was willing to put up with all of that and terra invicta is definitely fun to play. i've seen some reviews about how the tech tree is bloated or whatever - its a good representation of how humanity progresses from really crappy drives to ones that can make the aliens wet themselves at the sight of. so long as you're ok consulting some form of a third party resource (subreddit, youtube, developer's discord) to kind of guide your playthrough, i think you'd enjoy the game. a lot of my frustrations were resolved after constantly consulting the discord - the one point that i won't fight the negative reviews on are the UI, and how much the game kinda hides from you. why does the game not tell you the difference between various types of PD between particle + laser? why does the game not do a great job explaining diplomatic cooldowns between nations in order to unify/federate them? the government score says it impacts many things, like unrest, cohesion, research, and others, but doesn't actually say in-game what the exact values it adds/subtracts to for those three things. you'd have to pull the terra invicta wiki to know exactly what - are you ok with that?

the devs are aware of these pain points and have shown that they can and will fix them in due time. as with any game but especially a game like terra invicta in which playthroughs can easily be 200+ hours, id highly recommend watching both the earth + space gameplay for like, at least a couple of minutes to see if you like it or not. this game is not everyone's cuppa, and that's ok! but if you want a really well-researched illuminati/politics simulator + space warfare simulator that doesn't make every ship look like a fanfiction writer's wet dream, this is probably the only game out there right now that mixes both the politics + warfare element to such a deep level in the space strategy genre.",1700684844,1700684844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

RANT INCOMING
READER DISCRETION IS ADVISED

Can't recommend the game as it is rn. I believe the tech tree is bloated and should be stripped down a bit. Group techs together, make the different offensive techs actually viable. The whole tech tree is overwhelming and because of the alien threat, you will always go for certain techs when you know what you're doing. And for the people that don't know, they get trapped with cool sounding tech or the whole tree seems too daunting.
The ai also is too agressive and seems to have no regard for their actual faction's goals. They will always target the player and they feel like they do too well sometimes, even if they have a worse collection of nations than the player.
I'd feel like the humanity first faction would focus on targetting the servants rather than me. Especially since I've focused a lot on combatting the aliens. They also seem to not target the aliens much at all...
The enemy councilors are also very annoying. They often times have traits that make it hard to turn or eliminate. 
It also feels like, often times, even if you have high percentages you fail just as often as if you had lower ones. I've found that only 97%+ percentages actually give decent to great successes. 
Once, I had this councilor with an abismal persuasion score but that had control nation. Turned out if I had him take over each nation's first control point, it would always succeed, only failing if the percentage is under 5. Then, even if I had good chances, that councilor would always fail the second time.

I really enjoy this game. But So far I've been unable to get far enough to actually have a presence in space beyond a lot of bases on the moon. And that was only when I had only 3 factions (me, the servants and the aliens). It is highly frustrating to compete for choosing the right techs. It is frustrating that when I research a global tech, the other factions get it too. 
I also do not understand how the ai gets so much boost. Even when I am dominating on earth... I always find the ai making bases on the moon and mars before me.
And the army control is abysmall. Lost a war and had to restart because, in my great wisdom, forgot there was a button to move all armies. And so I moved only one... and that made it impossible to win.
The ai, too, when they have a nuclear nation and you are winning, they use nukes. And kill all your stuff... and worse, their stuff survives somehow????
and then, if you retaliate with you own nuke, they send nukes towards you. And then you both nuuke each other out of existance. They will nuke, on their own population... and somehow they still are popular in that country...
sometimes, when I campaign to make my faction more popular, I get low percentages or nothing, while the other faction/factions don't budge at all, despite the mission screen sayng that support moved away.

The councilor pool and the starting councilors are often bad as well. They often get missions for perks that are simply useless on them. 

The companies are also absurd at game start and early game. influence is so important to gaining nations at the start of the game.  Yet companies are so influence expensive... There are so many low cost low gain companies, why are those not more common at the start of the game???

I see the company pool and the operatives pool as the faction browsing trough the available companies and operatives... Why would the faction not take into account their ccurrent and potential future capabilities when they 'select' companies and operatives. As well as what the faction needs. I often find myself having a good ammount of funds or influence that I cannot spend on companies or operatives because there are either companies that I cannot take because I am missing some trait or operatives that I either don't need, have better versions of or the ones I want are just nowhere.

For example I often find myself in need of a dedicated company hoarder (usually a tycoon). The ones available are either not available or are bad. Funny enough, it is when I am short on funds or on influence that the good stuuff, that I want, are available in the pool. Then, when I work towards geting those things... the pool resets.

Just... add an option to hold companies and operatives. Or freeze the pool or something.",1699810846,1699810846,False,19,0,0.59542548656463623,0,True,False,True

They include the Illuminati, a bunch of racist dickheads, science nerds, religious nut jobs, people looking for Earth 2.0.  I personally recommend The Resistance as this is currently the only faction that has the tutorial built in to it, and you'll need it.

This is one of the reasons for the negative reviews, the tutorial is very basic and the learning curve is very steep.  The pace of the game also changes quite quickly once you're about 20-40 hours in (varies depending on the choices you make, your tech, who you're attacking) and the Aliens will utterly destroy you - this is part of the game.  

You are not going to be technologically equal with the Aliens until the latter 1/3 and the mid part of the game is all about staying hidden, cold war esq behaviour, cat and mouse etc etc.  This puts a lot of players off because there is no warning that this is coming, there is a small bar to indicate your threat level to the Aliens - once this is red you're a bit screwed unless your ships tech has at least has some missiles and your military is at level 5, and even then it's still quite challenging, the Aliens are still probably going to wipe the floor with you.

Each faction starts more or less the same, you have 2-3 councillors, their job initially will be to take over countries, get them to join your cause.  From here it's all about building your rep, getting cash/influence and investing in Boost - arguably the most important resource in the game - without this, no space travel, no ships, no bases.  The tutorial unfortunately does not break these different resources down into much detail, there aren't for example, annual reviews of how much you brought in vs last month/year, would be very helpful to have a summary of what you're making, what you've built, what's outstanding - easy UI fixes.  

The same UI fixes are needed once you expand to space, early game is essentially a space race to the Moon and to Mars, there are a lot of little moons and rocky bodies to explore, a lot a lot, and the UI at present is not designed in a way that makes it easy to keep track of everything, for example, there is no mass upgrade section for your bases, even selecting between them is a little fiddly when it needn't be.

You'll also need ships to protect these bases and to destroy the aliens (or the other factions), the tutorial here is pretty useless, you can build preset ships based on your tech but there is no explanation on the different types of engines, the armour (both will effect your ships ability to travel in space and to leave planetary bodies that have gravity).  The myriad of different weapons/types, the Devs need to add more here, you shouldn't need to look on youtube or reddit to get what I personally see as basic info.

Another area of the game which I feel has been overlooked is your relationships with the other factions, currently you're able to review their incomes, tech to some degree, what countries are backing them - you can also reach out to them but it's pretty basic, trade this tech or that or buy their peace.  This area could be vastly improved upon, you're generally going it alone but it shouldn't be unreasonable for multiple factions to form temporary alliances or pool resources at certain stages, you could even create specific events surrounding this - there is a lot of scope here that the Devs can explore but it currently feels very neglected.

Despite all this, I do love this game and I can't recommend it enough, easily one of the best strategy games out there, the devs have clearly put a lot of passion and thought into making it.  But as I've said, there are still a lot of UI and quality of life fixes that are required, the game also isn't balanced at the start in terms of the councillors you're given or the pool you've got to choose from - this lack of balance can give certain factions a huge head start whilst crippling others - so I won't judge you if you restart the game 5 times just to get a councillor with the most basic of abilities.  But, if you're into sci strategy games, space battles and heavy micro managing, give this a go, you won't be disappointed.",1699609445,1699609445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Essentially there's always been a problem with powercurve and while recent updates make AI competitive and competent at least at difficulties above normal to a degree,  it's also hamstrung the players a bit in that methods that used to work that made the game great are now less effective or just no longer a viable strategy anymore and given that the AI are much more competitive now? They can outpace you even if you own powerful nations and orgs when they should have no right to unless they themselves own very specific nations or orgs themselves (which at least for the orgs you can thankfully still steal easily enough) in the early to mid game. Which get's into the next problem, you used to be able to keep the AI in check by either being able to turn or assassinate their Councillors but that has been nerfed quite hard in that it's impossible to turn them if they have high loyalty (used to be able to detain them and gain a bonus to turning them which is no longer a feature) which is the only method of getting rid of them now because killing their councillors incur's significant public opinion drop for you and raise for the faction that you are targeting. 

(Update, they also somehow know after a few turns that they have a spy in their midst even if you don't get overly aggressive with missions targeting them or having they spy fail missions on purpose and will get rid of them without investigating the compromised councillor or using missions like inspire on them they just fire them out of the blue). 

I wouldn't complain about this issue if you could lower their loyalty by doing enough turn councillor missions and chipping away at them till they crack but as far as i'm aware there is no such feature or ability to lower their loyalty stat.

So that leaves assassinate which as you might have guessed has taken a hit itself in that your not allowed to use assassinate to get rid of powerful enemy councillors that cannot be turned to your side with the dev's removing an avenue for players to really manage the other factions and punishing you if the enemy councillor has certain perks that can really hurt your own councillors if they are detected by an enemy one which ends up requiring significant stat investment in espionage and security to otherwise mitigate. I wouldn't be complaining about this if these sorts of perks were actually very rare however nearly all enemy councillors own these traits which ends up hurting you as much as it does them when you do wind up having to inevitably killing them.

(Update 2: There is also the issue with RNG in that having high percentages for success usually still meets often then not with failure. Even if your councillor has particularly high stats and you've invested resources into the mission. I've had so many missions that have had approximately 90% success or over fail in comical succession that it's not funny and for those who might suspect, no my councillors were not turned and made to fail i'm just screwed over by RNG over and over again and again.)

Hell it seems odd that everyone know's who killed who when the point of assassination is to kill someone without it directly pointing at who in fact did it which i can see happening if the attempt fails but not so much when you succeed other than some suspicion but largely shouldn't affect public opinion so significantly especially if they are already sided with different factions already.

Also the AI pretty much has it out for you from the very start in that if you are doing far too well they will focus you rather than the aliens and results in just everyone being your enemy regardless of if you have similar goals/objectives or not having conflicting interests. in the end? it just doesn't matter. This means there's really no point to playing nice with any of the factions, they will hate you for existing and are no help in the fight against the aliens either way and your better off neutering them so they don't get in your way when dealing with the more pressing threat.

There's also the issue with the tech tree which other than a few technologies has a hell of a lot of bloat and stuff that is pretty much a trap for people and winds up being tech that is not worth researching when there are much more powerful and better options for you to use.

Don't get me wrong i like options but when you know there are certain techs that are just too good to pass up your always going to go with the option that works rather than something that is either a sidegrade or a downgrade to what is actually useful. 

(Update: take Railguns for instance, you would think they would be a viable weapon but they are very slow and do not hit their targets often then not combined with long ass reload compared to coilguns which are just better overall. Making early technologies still viable throughout a play through would be a improvement if they could make these weapons actually useful in niches like making snipers or artillery ships that are accurate and powerful but that justifies the long reload times as well as adding other cons such as significant power drain when firing for example with ships like those being best used as siege weapons or used in a fleet to extend it's overall effective combat range). 

All in all, your not allowed to have fun and play how you want with this game, with multiple fun avenues closed to you or not really optimal which is the gaming equivalent of back seat driving aka back seat gaming with the game and it's various mechanics seemingly punishing you at any time either for your choices or when your doing too damn well or about to be, which can derail you and potentially lead to a doom spiral that ends your game if you get too many bad event chains with there being very rare events that actually help you in any significant way.

Early space exploration and mining is interesting and fun as well, again, human faction AI still do a great job here. 

Then you get to the mid-game and boy does it grind the game to a halt. The Aliens start with a big tech lead on you so you can't piss them off or they'll destroy all your stuff. What this means is that you have to deliberately bottleneck yourself until you're ready to go all in on total war. What it actually means is waiting 3-4 hours of clicking go next to do anything interesting. Even when you use custom games to speed up research the game is just a slog. Aliens spread everywhere like ticks in dog fur. And much like ticks they are annoying and tedious to remove. Space combat being what it is makes it especially awful to play. It's an attempt at 3D chess but the tedium and annoyance of slow drag-out fights where the optimal strategy is always to clump your ships and fly them in a straight line is booooooooring. When I'm attacking alien space stations with a fleet around them I usually go get something to eat, I do not pause the fight, it's that slow. 

Has some interesting bones but very little flesh. The attention to physics is admirable but it comes at the cost of having a good game that can be enjoyed without dozens and dozens of hours of playing. The developers are really responsive on discord and the community there is helpful but I rarely have to hang out in a discord just to figure out how to play a game. It's so so much for so little payoff. Honestly if they removed the alien part and made this essentially a board game about space mining and subterfuge it'd probably be really really good.

Update Oct 23

Tried to play the game again, and almost nothing has changed in the past year. The game still takes over 100 hours for one campaign. Normally this wouldnt be a big deal, as many games I play have very long campaigns. However, this games just isnt fun the first 80% of the game, it should be called ""agent manager sim"" because this boring part of the game is 90% of what you spend time doing. Only in the late game do you actually start having space battles and doing the fun shit.

I would say this game is more of a negative review than it was last year. The dev's update the game at a glacial pace, and hardly anything on the road map has been accomplished in the 15 months the game has been out. At this point dont expect much to ever change in this game or get better, it is what it is at this point.

What should have been one of the best games on steam is just to much of a burden to play, and unless you are trying to sink 120 hours into something to feel very little return, i'd say pick almost any other strategy game up.",1667788566,1699072106,False,2,0,0.503111422061920166,0,True,False,True

The learning curve is extremely frustrating and confusing, and there's a lot of stupid fussy, finicky mechanics, and the UI is downright HOSTILE, but once you figure these things out and start playing in earnest, what's beneath that is an incredible alien invasion simulator that doesn't pull its punches. However, the game is ultimately let down by the absolute misery that is the mid-game space combat system.

The story and the setting of the game are its strongest points; This game is OVERFLOWING with lore and it's really well written; The developers are really invested in the story and writing of this game and it SHOWS. Every technology researched comes with several paragraphs regarding the impact of this technology not just on your gameplay, but also how it affects the lives of Humanity. Each of the factions have a personality beyond their stated goals, personified by their particular batshit insane faction leader. It's an extremely well fleshed out world that lends a lot to immersion. The setting takes a high-realism Sci-Fi approach to match its tone, and the cool thing is that even the aliens play by the same high-realism rules as the players. The space warfare component of it is also really thematically cool, and the devs have done a good job of making the realistic-ish space setting combat actually really interesting, and not too confusing and technical to comprehend. 

On with the gameplay: There are a lot of spinning plates in this game that aren't particularly well explained. The problem is that each playthrough of this game is potentially over 100 hours long, and mismanagement of your various plate spinning early game will cause a snowball catastrophe situation 50 hours of gameplay later. It's frustrating, and takes a lot of time. However, the upside is that after you play a failed playthrough or two, you understand these mechanics, and it's suddenly not a problem anymore. It isn't that the mechanics aren't broken or unfair, it's just that the game just doesn't do a fantastic job of explaining how you're intended to actually deal with them.

One such spinning plate is the research progression in this game. Let's start with the good: I really love how there's two tiers of tech - Global and Faction Project. It's very cool. I like that you have to invest in global research in order to get a say on what gets researched. I also love the descriptions of the technology, like I said before. However... Research is REALLY confusing; The tech tree is labyrinthine with HUNDREDS of techs that do all sorts of things, but it's hard to tell what's actually important or genuinely useful. It's a giant information nuke on the senses between the 300 different reactor types, 100 drive technologies, the hundreds of random overpriced ""country unification"" technologies, obsolete weapons, and small statbuffs. While the game DOES technically tell you what each individual tech unlocks, it's not always clear what the unlocks actually do or, importantly, whether it's worth the opportunity cost to get. Your research points early game are very valuable, so this is where some early runs will fail, because a mismanaged tech progression will put you so far behind that you can't recover. However, after your second or third playthrough attempt you'll know which techs are critical, and which ones are best left to later; This is an issue that comes up a lot with Terra Invicta; Nothing makes sense the first time you encounter it, but then after a while of dealing with it you understand it, and you can apply that knowledge on your next save game. The problem with that being that your next save game is going to take 30 hours to get to space. There is also the issue of hidden technologies; There are several technologies in the game which you NEED to stand a chance of beating the game, however they're hidden behind pre-requisite technologies that usually you'd never think to research normally. This kinda sucks, and it's another one of those foreknowledge things I've been talking about. There is also some techs which have a % chance to actually unlock for you even if you have the global technology -- you're supposed to steal these techs from other factions, but it' still very confusing, and does NOT AT ALL help the issue of missing critical or good techs due to not even realising that they exist. 

The next thing is alien hate, which dictates how the Aliens respond to your activities: You're told that interfering with the Aliens' operatives, or their pet factions, and attacking their ships increases hate. However, what the game doesn't explain well enough is that every single thing you build in space (measured by your Mission Control) directly increases your minimum level of hate. So you'll get 50 hours into the game, and suddenly, inexplicably, the entire alien war-machine will turn around and utterly annihilate everything you've built, because you passed an arbitrary, invisible line in the sand that the game doesn't tell you about. This is made worse by the fact that the little indicator that informs you of what level of hate you're at doesn't update unless you anger the aliens enough to attack you. This problem is again, one of those things that make much more sense on your third playthrough, but will absolutely ruin your first two runs. On your third playthrough you know to leave enough Mission Control to found a defence fleet before you annoy the aliens the first time, so that they don't wipe you to the regolith.

The space combat.... I kind of love it, and I kind of hate it. I love the hyper-realism take of space combat, but I despise how finicky and obnoxious it is to intercept alien fleets and generally move your fleets around. This is largely a issue with the previously described hostile UI, but there are some things about how engagement mechanics work and such that also make early game defence an unnecessary chore. I find myself daydreaming at work about all the cool space combat stuff I'm going to do when I get home, and the ships and doctrines I'm going to use, but then when it comes to actually play the game I remember the nightmare that surrounds actually getting into a combat. A lot of the time the aliens will transfer to your orbit, and then immediately re-direct themselves to a random station to attack, which causes your intercepting fleets to be unable intercept the target, and unable to redirect to protect your assets. To be honest, this is what broke the camel's back for me; Intercepting alien fleets and dealing with the finicky process of transferring around to protect your assets is just too frustrating to justify wasting any more time on the game.

So yeah, I both love and hate this game. There's so many stupid fussy bullshit things that I've encountered, but so much interesting and cool things to make up for it. It needs to hold your hand a LOT more in the early game to ensure that you understand the mechanics, It needs to grab you by the ears and explain the hate calculation, and probably fix the hate meter so that it updates periodically, and they NEED polish up space UI and interface and mechanics so it's MUCH MUCH MUCH less obnoxious.

The devs are cooking, and I respect that. It's not done yet, but definitely keep going.

There has been so much thought poured into it and the result is a grand strategy game that is beyond anything I have ever played.

Humanity discovers alien ships heading towards earth. You control a faction of humanity with a specific purpose (are the aliens our saviours, our enemies, our equals?) and manage world nations as they grapple with the realisation that humanity is not alone. There will be wars, unification of states, subterfuge and more. Once you advance technology enough you will set up a space economy amongst the planets and asteroids of the solar system capable of building entire fleets of spaceships that will battle for control.

It reminds me a bit of the series The Expanse. 

There are some rough edges (at time of writing the game is still in early release) but it is fully playable and only needs some minor balancing.

The only negatives for me are that it has a steep learning curve and it requires a decent amount of time to complete a campaign (it took me about 50 hours. There are now options to change reduce game length though).",1698767558,1698767558,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Lots of the negative reviews centre around two things - the UI and the alien hate mechanic. Both are understandable criticisms. 

The hate mechanic, if not properly managed, will end your campaign 50 hours in and leave the player confused and frustrated. This is because TI is not a typical 4x game. In one of those you are basically always expanding to the limits of your resources, reach a point in the midgame where you have eclipsed the AI and are trying to meet your victory conditions. This is not how TI works. You will not surpass the Aliens until basically the very end of the game, and if you try and snowball too early they will get angry and rip you apart.

The midgame here is supposed to be a delicate game of cat and mouse, in which you carefully husband your resources and develop the technologies you will need to face the Aliens head on. It requires a lot of patience and knowledge on the part of the player to achieve, and comes at a point where you will feel that you are finally starting to understand the game.

A lot of people fall off here because they have come a long way, and restarting is incredibly unpalatable, especially if you don’t really understand what you did wrong to suddenly invite massive retaliation.

The main failing on the game’s part is giving the player that understanding - there is a small, vague and easily missed message on the side of the screen that warns you about alien hate, but my feeling is that players will often not notice that, or disregard it because it isn’t made out to be that important. 

I would change that to be an actual news/event popup that pauses the game and makes the player read and click through the warning message, and maybe include a little detail as to what is causing the rise in danger. This would be a relatively easy change to make and not impact the overall difficulty of the game, but would massively improve understanding of the mechanic and its consequences.

A lot of players use words like “random” or “inexplicable” when describing the sudden change in the behaviour of the AI, but mechanically this change is neither. It does however require a fairly deep understanding of the hate mechanic to not feel random, and I don’t think the developers should rely on the player to figure this out through trial and error, especially when just playing a campaign to the point where it matters takes between 20 and 40 hours for the average player.

That being said this game is easily one of the best strategy games I’ve ever played. Even once you understand all the systems at play it is extremely challenging, and beating that challenge is one of the most satisfying experiences I’ve ever had in any game. The odds feel so insurmountable at the beginning and in the middle of a campaign that overcoming them gives a sense of achievement that’s unmatched in the genre.

This game is easily a 9/10. It would be a 10  if the UI were just a little better. I understand that a game this complex is always going to have a lot going on and to keep track of, but it can sometimes be difficult/tedious to do what you want to do even if you know exactly what that is and how to do it. Some way to mass-upgrade ships and stations would be good for example, and the tech tree can be difficult to navigate since it’s very busy - it would be good to be able to filter out certain techs or tech-types to make it easier to find what you’re looking for in there. But there have already been huge improvements made there - I first played on release and have returned a full year later to find the game a lot more playable than it was a year ago, and I expect this trend will continue.

I really like it but I think it suffers from things taking far too much time and goals being much more convoluted and difficult to achieve. By the 50 hour mark in a new strategy game say, Stellaris or Civ I would already have a good baseline on how to start early game, get my stuff set up and eventually actually get a victory. On my first save file I chose Resistance and even though it's 80 hours through I don't think I will ever have the mental fortitude to complete it. The Alien menace has bases everywhere in my solar system and new ones pop up all the time. And travelling to them takes months to a year which equates to hours in real life. Then when I try to start a new save file I feel like a chicken without a head and still have no idea what I'm doing or how I'm supposed to set things up to actually win.

BUT, that's not to say I didn't have fun with it. I think the extremely complex and very methodical nature of the game lends itself to very interesting scenarios and to you as the player having to make a lot of thought about your past, present, and future every turn.

I think the best way to improve the game is to significantly decrease the number of popups that waste your time, consolidate techs that do not need to be separate (mostly ship tech), and reduce time in between turns.

Some improvements to be made for sure, but ultimately the game has insane depth, all of which can be made relevant in your strategy. Space battles and ship customisation feel great. And while frustrating at times, you'll appreciate the need to think several years ahead once you get the hang of it.

Stick with it and it becomes incredibly rewarding. It was only on my 3rd attempted play-through that I had that eureka moment where things clicked.

My main gripe is that you're kinda discouraged from engaging in too much space combat early on. While that was fine for my first campaign win, as I had so much else to keep me engaged, the second time around I kinda wanted a bit more of the excellent space combat. It would be cool to have another scenario where space combat plays a bigger role from early on. Yet another scenario without aliens, where human factions simply fight to control space would also be kinda cool. But these are all me nitpicking to be honest, I only came to feel this way after spending a good 150+ hours on the game as it is, absolutely loving it. I expect the modding community will help to fulfil some of these dreams anyway.

Other gripes include a few quality of life things, e.g. imo, if the game is paused I should be allowed to undo all build orders at no cost. But again, not enough to truly detract from an ambitious game that has you micro-managing individual countries, waging wars on earth, diplomacy elsewhere, engaging in multiple strands of research, espionage with various factions, designing ships and colonising distant planets - and it all interlinks in a way that everything feels relevant and consequential.

Really, there's nothing else like this. It is THE grand strategy game you've not heard of yet.

[h1]TLDR:[/h1]
  - Nightmare level micromanagement
  - Retardedly poor, near random AI (the game relies on this for you to win)
  - Nightmare level of time requirement (120+ hours in my first full campaign)
  - Tech tree is poorly optimized. They wanted to look geeky but it's a mess that could be simplified a lot more.

---------------
[h3]Your time:[/h3]
This game will take you an insulting amount of time to play. There are so many micromanaging issues, mostly on earth with enemy factions just wanting to annoy you rather than follow a set strategy. Also everything is very slow, and requires lots of repeated button pressing and menu browsing to do. It took me so long to beat it, that instead of feeling rewarding to having learned all the ridiculously cryptic and barely explained mechanics, I really feel like an idiot for wasting this much time.

[h3]Tech tree:[/h3]
There are about 75 different ship engines, and each has their [b]unique[/b] name and powerplant requirements (and their names don't even match so you need to figure it out).
Instead of making so many unique drives, they could have made 3 types of drives: Long distance, agile, and balanced. Then progressively adding Mk1, Mk2, Mk3... etc. But no, they just wanted to sound smart.
Besides, most drives are useless since the enemy (aliens) have the top tier tech, and you wouldn't waste precious resources in making crappy ships that lose all the time. Only final tech ships worked for me.
There are just so many technologies that are useless, but you end up researching because they're very poorly explained. You end up wasting loads of research in things you never use.

[h3]Space logistics:[/h3]
The AV (Delta V) should be called FUEL, cos that's what it is. Would have saved me quite some wasted time.
Enemy Aliens seem to target randomly. Which was good cos otherwise I would have lost. Sometimes it wouldnt attack at all. Also base bombardment is bugged, and will make you lose your 30k fleet in a literal second with zero casualties on the other side. You can only take endgame bases by attacking with a councilor, which takes immense amounts of time and logistics.",1697151065,1698520192,False,23,2,0.551521182060241699,0,True,False,True

If you're a fan of hard sci-fi, this game is a must. It's too good to pass up. You slowly build a global movement from the ground-up, shifting borders and manipulating populaces to catapult humanity into space and resist alien invasion, or alternatively, to keep them from reaching unity by any necessary. It's the total gamification of a narrative that's so far only been written about. I can't recommend it enough.

That said, the issues are obvious. The UI begins to collapse in on its own weight somewhere in the midgame. The in-game tutorials are terrible, and they leave a great deal unexplained. The minimized tech tree doesn't have tooltips for future components you're unlocking, and the full tree is so large it's genuinely hard to navigate. That means that unless you're way ahead of the curve on science or you know what you're gunning for, you'll be stuck research stuff you'll probably never use. You won't get much help building ships either, so you'll have to figure out what weaknesses the aliens have using either real-world knowledge, trial and error, or a guide.

The game excels in several areas - the story, atmosphere, replayability, and graphics are all fantastic. Its immersive quality is undeniable. The well-crafted story and unique faction dynamics make it a compelling experience. Early and mid-game activities like nation-building and space economy management are immensely enjoyable.

What's Lacking:
However, there are a couple of significant drawbacks. Firstly, the UI/UX can be incredibly frustrating. For instance, selecting a spacecraft drive in the ship designer involves sorting through identical-looking icons and deciphering lots of stats with the help of guides on reddit. Navigating the extensive and unlabeled tech tree to find specific research items is a cumbersome process. Even worse, some tech descriptions are vague, leaving players in the dark about their importance.

The most frustrating aspect is the game's arbitrariness. Unexpected events, such as two countries engaging in a war plunching the world into a devestating nuclear winter, aliens unexpectently destroying all my Mars bases, not knowing what techs lead to the secret techs that [spoiler]protect you against alien pherocytes[/spoiler]...

I want it to be a perfect alien invasion game, and it genuinely feels like it's on that edge - But as pretty much every negative review has already said, it's simply not there. I wish the devs would actually get engaged with what the negative reviews are saying, honestly, because I agree with it all.

 I was gonna write a long review talking about exactly why I don't like the game, but it's all been said before, and it's 12:08 AM, so I'll summarize:
The AI targets the player, even when logically speaking that would be a bad strategic choice
The game seems to punish success
The game requires a lot of micromanaging
The game's research tree is confusing
It feels like the devs are forcing you to play their way

I could go on, but the point of it is, the game just feels like an unhatched egg. It feels like a griffin or a phoenix or some other mystical flying creature, trapped in the world's ugliest, poorest smelling, most disgusting egg, and it's very sad that I can only catch glimpses of that beautiful creature within through the crap exterior. The plot's great, the tension is awesome, the voice actors are excellent, everything EXCEPT the game-play has me jumping for joy, and even the game-play, if it had been executed better, would've been perfect for a game like this.

Through Terra Invicta, you live out the history of humanity's first contact with a potentially hostile alien species.  The game begins in 2022 with the crashing of an alien spaceship on Earth. You play as one of seven ideological factions, each of which has a different opinion of how to respond to the alien arrival and lead humanity forward.

At the beginning, your faction consists of a handful of councilors who can undertake missions to improve your faction's standing in the world, or sabotage other factions. At the beginning, you'll primarily be trying to increase support for your faction in different countries, the eventually infiltrating those countries' governments until you can gain executive control. When you control part or all of a country, you can influence that country's development, focusing their attention towards, knowledge, economy, military, social well-being, or space programs, in a complex socioeconomic simulation. You can also cause countries to make or break alliances and rivalries, or go to war against each other, commanding some or all of their armies, navies, and nuclear arsenal. Eventually, once you have built up the infrastructure, you will expand into space, where you can suvey, mine, and colonize not only every planet and moon in the solar system, but also hundreds of asteroids.  Once you've acquired enough resources, you can start building military vessels and take the fight to the aliens. In my 38 hours of playtime, I've only just built my very first space ship, so I don't know where it goes from here.

The game is very reminiscent of the Enderverse books that tell what Ender's former companions do on Earth after Ender takes off.  It is very different from other strategy games in many ways. One is that you can't really lose or defeat your enemies completely. You can assassinate an enemy's councilor, but they can recruit a new one. Your best nation can be taken over, but you can always take it back. If you are trying to influence too many big nations, you won't be able to hold them all for long. Science is divided into two categories: One is big world-wide technological advance, where every faction contributes, and the other is individual engineering projects, which are unlocked by the world-wide tech advances, but only benefit the faction who researches them. So you can get a technological edge on your opponent's but not a huge one.  

Another very interesting aspect of the game is dealing with the struggle of trying to become the most powerful human faction, while also dealing with the looming and ever-increasing external alien threat. You have to balance the advancement of humanity as a whole against your position within it, and deal with the all-too-familiar realization that even when faced with an existential crisis, humanity is incapable of coming together to face it as one, with a significant portion of the population choosing to side with the crisis against humanity.",1697563020,1697563020,True,8,0,0.574827313423156738,0,True,False,True

The devs see player having fun with their game so they add in mechanics that choke the gameplay flow with add on difficulty. How you ask ? They make it so the AIs focus on player instead of the Alien. The AIs will focus dking the player instead of fighting the Alien invasion that drop down 4 turn ago. The Alien AI instantly know when they gonna get kill off so the turn you make that choice they go invis now you need to be lucky to spot it again.

The tech tree is full of stuffs to be just there to slow you progress or trap option so if the game don't have a dedicated community good luck knowing what good to go for when there like 30 research with about the same stats weapon but each behave differently but all equally useless beside a few edge case. This is without the devs dking your save when they decide to neft your main weapon while give the Alien better weapons. Each update is a dice rolls on how the devs gonna dk you around.

The devs don't want you to play your way but their way. Want to turtle ? Well the AIs will try to mass agent your holding if you don't kill them regularly. Want to be ultra aggressive ? There a hate mechanic that work even when your agent is undetectable to the Alien agent. When you ready to have everything square away sudden invasion with 2 doom stack out of no where and if you can take those out the ultra cancer agent go from local threat to be able to travel everywhere since for some reason AIs won't attack Alien agent even where their holding is currently being burn by Alien armies.

Very in depth and a long game. The shipbuilding and space fighting is a ton of fun and very well designed.

I don't mind a slower, longer game.  But at the moment in my current play through I'm just sitting around waiting for research and will be for a long time.   Even though I've taken full control of the US, Mexico, and Canada, I can't really do much else with them that's fun or interesting because of the way influence works in the game - with this much control I have no ability to influence them to say, annex South America which would be fun to do while I wait for research.  Having big lulls in the game where there's literally nothing to do doesn't improve the game.  It just makes it dull.    

Also, the game is very abstracted in a way that makes it feel ""gamey"" as opposed to more of a simulation.  The aforementioned influence points are a great representation of this.  You control countries by having your councilors win you ""control points"" over them and they spend ""influence points"" to try to do this; it's as boring and simple as that.  When you investigate alien crash sites, you get a small bonus to your alien research and that's it.  No interesting tech to discover like in X-com.  No clashes with opposing factions over the downed ship.  Just an easy action for your councilor with a small 1% bonus to your xenology research branch.  What could be a cool, fun event is made boring by the degree of abstraction and lack of reward.  Same deal for gaining control of countries:  have one councilor work on approval for your faction and have another work on taking over a control point.  Repeat until you control the country.  Abstract and boring!     

Additionally, disappointingly, in spite of its roots, there does not seem to be a way to form a special commando unit to take on X-com type missions (no I'm not looking for the tactical battles, just the unit existing in the game world to use on a strategic level).  You can control the CIA or military special forces, but that's more like an item in an RPG that your councilors ""wear"" to give them bonuses instead of something represented in the game world.  If you could build, arm, and fund small tactical units to do certain missions instead of councilors using abstract ""military points"" it would be far more interesting.            

And why are they called councilors not agents?!?  

That said, I do see lots of potential with this game.  I think if some of the pacing issues could be dealt with and give you access to some more interesting mission types for the councilors, the early game could be much improved.",1697290615,1697290615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Lots of system and interfaces to learn. Tutorial is meh, the best way to learn is to play and experiment. Only issue with that approach is that your experiments will take a long time to see what they did and tricky to fix.

1.) Way too much RNG. If you thought paradox RNG was excessive, then this game is the physical manifestation of getting punched in the balls. Lose stations, lose valuable resources with pathetic chances of saving them, even if you stack the deck. Have the aliens land in your nation early on and kick you out without any chance of fighting back. Lose control points to the AI on 5% chance rolls. This game makes loss way too frequent.

2.) Faction competency. The Aliens and Pro-alien factions will rock your shit 9/10. Every game I have played, the servants own several major nations, with no one willing to contest them except me. If they lose nations, the aliens will descend and mind control another nation for them. On the other hand, the anti-alien factions are incompetent as all hell. They never contest alien presence on the planet, and they often undercut you as you try to handle the aliens, making for a very frustrating experience. As a small note, other factions cannot be destroyed, you can control the world, and they will constantly try and coup your nations.

3.) UI. The games UI does not scale with the experience. Early on, the UI is manageable, but by late game the UI becomes unbearable, and makes the experience tedious. The station list is just that, a list, that you have to sort through. Often dozens of stations long, looking for individual stations. While logos, such as ""under construction"" are shown, they do not show you what is under construction in them, making you click on the station then hover over every module under construction to figure out what is being built. You cannot set auto-templates for construction. Applying templates is tedious and involves you first making sure you built the correct hab size for your template, then applying it. This makes the process to apply one template, a three-step process. Again, when you are managing dozens of stations, this gets very, very tedious. 

There is a lot more that is wrong with the game, this is just scratching the surface. Ultimately, I recognize the ambition of the game, and the sheer scope, but that is no excuse for so many issues that make the game so frustrating. Especially after several updates.

Frustrating really is the way to describe this game. It is frustrating to lose constantly to RNG. It is frustrating to manage counselors constantly. It is frustrating to have to carry the weight of the world where factions that should nominally be your allies are instead undermining you at every turn. It is frustrating to manage dozens of stations, where even applying a template is a multi-step process. This game is frustrating. And that, in and of itself is so very frustrating because I want to like this game.

There are many in my opinion absolutely deranged design choices by the devs (random tech is awful, I'm sorry) and the UI'/UX at this point needs an entirely separate dev team of its own. Yet TI manages to do what really no other game has done. If you're an XCOM player THIS is the game you wanted for a long time, created by the Long War modders. The story is shockingly interesting, and the different factions are interesting. I'm very impressed, I don't usually play 4X games for an interesting story, but this game is an exception. 

I'm currently in the middle of a new game (as of writing this, I might not be when you're reading this) and the last time I played this was about a year ago, at launch. I have to say, I'm sorely disappointed by the lack of progress made by the devs. I understand they're a small indie team, and changes take time. However, many of the changes I believe are of importance are UI and UX, which aren't massive sweeping changes across the game. For example, the information pipeline to the player is just a mess.

The game is constantly throwing junk notifications to you and it's hard to know which are even worth looking at. On the left side there's a whole host of random notifications, and on the top, same thing. To be honest, both of these can go. No one is going to go through and check an entire column of random notifications. The notifications at the top can probably stay, as they're actually tailored to things that are important, like habs finishing construction. Yet neither of these have been improved upon, after a year. The most they've added is the ability to toggle what notifications show up and where, but going through this is extremely tedious. There are dozens of notifications to change, the game should just have sane defaults instead of me having to customize every notification popup.

But ok, those are two specific UI changes. Lets look at something more objectively bad. In TI sometimes you get a little popup on the top right, usually some dialog from a councilor who just got of prison being like ""I'm out commander, they didn't get anything outta me,"" The problem is say for example you have the tech tree open. If you have the tech tree open and that popup appears, it PERFECTLY blocks the X to close the window. This seems like a simple, obvious fix. Either move the popup, or move the tech window. 

At this point I'm getting worried TI will never leave EA. ""Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
'Terra Invicta will be in Early Access for at least several months, but possibly longer depending on how the design develops with player feedback.'"" Several months seems vague at best, and in about a week it'll be TI's first anniversary. Pavonis has a ""roadmap"" on their website, but it isn't really specific on what will be delivered, and when. With the progress being made, I'm worried TI will never leave EA. It could be that they're working on bigger updates behind closed doors, but if so they haven't really communicated that. 

So do I still recommend this game? Yes, but like I said, with a lot of trepidation. But here's one important thing about TI. While it's in EA, and while I'm worried about it coming out of EA, unlike [b]SO[/b] many EA games, TI is a [b]FULL GAME[/b] . You can play it from start to finish, all the content is there. Is it rough around the edges? Absolutely. But in spite of ALL that I've said, it's still worth a buy. The ship combat is very expanse inspired, the story and factions are interesting, and once you get off earth, things start getting interesting.

A councilor with a high relevant stat doing an easy action will almost always succeed, but for more difficult actions you will be focused on leveling up your councilors, creating advantageous situations, and gaining resources to try for extra rolls. 

During the early game you will be using your councilors to grab up control points in countries. If you want to stand a chance against the aliens you're going to need at least a decent amount of earth's resources. Terra Invicta's early game is very fun. My favourite part of any game by far is scrambling for good control points. If clandestinely grabbing up control points doesn't quite do it for you, you can always take control of a world power and send them off on a war for your benefit. 

Once you have control points you can passively invest into them over time based on what your faction needs, or you can directly invest huge amounts of money for a quick boost. But you're going to need boost, mission control, and science. Boost is a resource that represents your capacity to get things off earth and into space. Mission control is how many bases and ships and the like you can manage, and science is how you research new tech and bonuses. 

But lugging resources up from earth every time you want to build anything in space is going to get unbelievably costly and time-consuming. Luckily, you can build habs and stations with construction modules, laboratories, mines, military, shipyards, and everything you need to keep civilisation running without needing to rely on earth resources. 

Once you start building up space, the aliens will take notice. If you build up too much or go too far away from earth the aliens will cut you down to size. So build up cautiously, research more powerful weaponry and tactics, and once you're ready, take down their ships and ransack their technology for any advantage you can find. 

Space combat in this game is extremely intricate and I still don't quite understand how it works. But just remember your Delta V from kerbal space program, and make sure that your drive is actually fast enough to reach your target within a human lifetime, and you'll probably be fine. 

With your new alien technology, you'll finally be able to pose a real threat to the aliens. Flush them out of the solar system (or don't if you're playing a bad faction) and fulfill your end-game condition to win!
___________________________________

If I had to put a number to it I'd say I really like maybe 70% of terra invicta. It's got a strong early game, lot's of fun flavour and story, a boatload of interesting little mechanics to keep you occupied, and an incredibly steep gameplay curve where victory will feel hopeless for decades only for things to finally start snowballing into your fleets effortlessly vaporising the xenos. But a lot of Terra Invicta really does feel unpolished? for lack of a better word.

End game is pretty bad. Chances are you will spend 5-10 real life hours just doing mindless busywork to make number go up so that you can fulfill your win condition. Often by this point in the game you are more than powerful enough and it just becomes a question of playing whack-a-mole until you win. This is made worse by the game pausing twice a month to reassign councilors. There is already an 'automate councilor' option but frankly it still isn't enough.  Terra Invicta campaigns really do feel like they last 5 hours more than they should. What makes it even more egregious is that this part of the games often comes right after a snowball of you gaining technological and military superiority. I really wish the endgame felt more like keeping that snowball going instead of just hitting a wall. 

Your fellow A.I factions are incredibly stupid. How are the violently anti-xeno Humanity First doing such a bad job at keeping the xenoflora away? I'd love to be able to interact with, fight with, or rely on the other A.I factions more than being mildly annoyed at them. 

A lot of people say they found the UI difficult to understand, but I feel like I understood it pretty well after my first few hours. It is however fairly different from any of the Paradox games or Stellaris, so if that's what you're used to it'll take some adjustment. 

Finally, and it's just a little thing,  but all the global techs have voiced quotes and flavour text attached. I really wish the personal techs had the same amount of love. I get that voice acting them all is probably a huge workload, but even just the quotes with no voice-acting would be appreciated. 

I really do like this game. It's too flawed for me to earnestly say that I think it's a 4X masterpiece or whatever, but this one of the most novel feeling 4X games I've ever played and the bones of this game are fantastic. I can't wait to see what they do with it. If ""4x game where you have to conquer the solar system and fight off aliens against impossible odds"" seems appealing to you, then I can strongly recommend Terra Invicta.",1692798906,1694435053,True,11,0,0.653121232986450195,0,True,False,True

The game's biggest flaw is it's information window size. If this part won't be a concern for you then read beyond and consider purchasing.  Due to the nature of the game, there is a lot of information to be looking over all the time. This information has been housed in tiny windows with small font (and I mean small font at 1920x1080).

(It can now be adjusted a little located in game settings).

-------------------------------------------
Considering many of the small windows pop up in the middle of the screen as well as stop the game there is no reason they couldn't have used the full screen.  They just didn't.  It would have even made sense considering how often one has to dive deeper into another window after the first to get all the info you are looking for.  Almost no windows take up the whole screen.  Those that come close don't use the space they have available.  This is poor design for a game that very much needs to use all the space it can.

If it isn't an issue for you then congratulations, you have great eyes!  If you don't have great eyes then it turns what would be a great time into a question mark. Watch game play videos before purchasing.

(Some people also use the Windows magnifying glass).

------------------------------------------------

For those unfettered by accessibility issues this is an amazing game!

--IT IS A TURN BASED GAME WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY--

Despite appearing to be a real time game it has regularly paced stopping points...turns.  The ""time flow"" is merely for immersion. Time will stop every two weeks for you to give your agents new orders.  This is when most of your decisions will take place. Anything else that one needs to react to also stops the time. The majority of the rest of the current events are listed on the side of the screen, to be perused when you hit the turn stop point. That is the only time you can make new decisions that will affect those events anyway.  Essentially a lot of new information is presented to you each two weeks (one turn).  Rather than just pop it all on the screen at once the game gives you a sense of time flow while it's happening.  The default game speed is almost at a stop.  You will normally speed it up as fast as possible between turns unless you are dealing with ground combats or micromanaging research at the time.

Space combat is the one exception. It IS actually real time...with pause. When it takes place regular time stops with a pop up that takes you to a screen outside the normal game flow so no worries on missing these events.

It does seem to throw many people off that the game appears to be real time. It's just not.  That would have been a terrible choice considering the amount of information one has to be aware of to play well.  It's a lot more than most Paradox games.  Those that complain that nothing happens for long stretches aren't paying attention to all the information available to them, or they have limited their own choices too much.  The game CAN be played while not fully paying attention...""ostrich style.""  Most of the early streamers did it that way...choosing strategies while ignoring information to keep things moving at streamer entertainment speed.  They have different priorities than most that would play a game like this.  Those that were hoping for a real time speed game won't be happy with the stops, or the calamity that comes with ignoring too much of what is taking place.


--DECISIONS--

The format is elegant here.  Low micromanagement despite the scope of the game.  The turn based decisions are made through your agents.  You never have more than a half dozen agents so while your choices are very open, you can only do so much in a given turn.  It keeps a massive game manageable and moving.  Agents will determine your faction's degree of power on Earth and ultimately your ability to steer the course of history in the direction your faction desires.  The interplay between the agents of various factions makes up half of the game. Your agents don't operate in a void. This is a game about seven factions trying to come out on top while facing a mutual threat.  It still baffles me that many players are bothered by opposing factions doing to them what they are doing to those factions.  If this will bother you then this isn't the game for you.

NOTE: Small glitch that can cause a lot of frustration. When an agent's orders are confirmed the country box doesn't clear for the next agent. ALWAYS clear the country box manually when switching agents. Hopefully they fix this.

There is an added level of depth to the agents in that they are all different.  You choose and develop them uniquely.  Whether they have the options available that you want to employ is a question of whether you planned well strategically.  Those that prefer to play ""seat of their pants"" reaction RTS's will struggle with this aspect.  If you are such a person consider skipping this game.

There are some other decisions outside of what agents do.
--Armies may rarely be used but when they are these will be important decisions.
--You won't be in space combats all the time but they will take place.
--Building bases and space stations are also big decisions.  They will be the basis of your solar economy and military infrastructure.
--Designing space ships!
--Research choices-- This is perhaps the most important non agent activity.  The two level design of research, with shared research world wide but competing for the direction new research heads in while working on one's own engineering projects that become available through what has been researched at the world level will make or break you.

The tech tree is massive.  The sheer amount of directions things can go makes it very interesting.  They won't all be researched and you are only one of seven factions dictating the directions that will be taken.  What undermines it is that it is multiple screens of cumbersome, slow to switch between screens, and tiny UI to make it more difficult.  The research choices are awesome!  If they cleaned up the research format it would be a big plus to the game.  A great deal of your strategic options will come down to what direction research goes in as well as the choices you make between world research and faction projects. Are you in control or just a minor faction?


--REPLAYABILITY--

While certain knowledge about the aliens will be known after one play through, the seven factions with seven agendas, the variance in starting popular support in each country in different world seeds, and the differences in what techs end up being researched gives the game a strong level of replayability.

So what is the game? Aliens are invading the earth. You play the role of an ideology, and the organization that supports it. Your task is to spread your influence, capitalize on the hysteria, gather information, and formulate a plan for dealing with the aliens. Will you submit to them? Resist them? Learn from them? Destroy them? Profit from them? After choosing your ideology at the start of the game, you'll compete with other ideologies to shape the populations of the world to your way of thinking, eventually becoming a powerful international shadow-government. Using that influence, you strike out into space, colonizing it and extracting the planets and asteroids until you can finally, eventually, stand on (semi) equal ground with the aliens.

Well, either the game changed or I did, because I've been giving it another try recently and having a very good deal of fun. It's still got the same problem of pacing being a bit slow from time to time, but the devs have added in a bunch of features that make this less of a problem, or occasionally not really noticeable at all, especially councilor automation (an absolute godsend).
This is a map-game first and foremost, and coming from that angle it does the formula extremely well. Space comes much later, and once you're at the point where you [i]should[/i] be engaging with space, it nearly eclipses the gameplay on the earth, while not completely obsoleting it, which feels great from a progression standpoint as well as keeping systems learned earlier relevant.

To avoid meeting the doom of a 40-hour-long waitfest, though, be proactive! The game shouldn't be playing itself. Global research, for example, is a major point of strategy. Even if you have nothing to go towards, and you think you should just let the AI take care of it, maybe you have something you want to take [i]away[/i]. Regardless of whether or not you have the research to fill it, if you put 20k science worth of research cheese-wheel on the board to eat up progress it's gonna be a long time before anything else replaces it. Not enough boost to launch probes? Steer global research away from things that lead to ""Mission To"" researches, and you'll have plenty of time to remedy that problem. The game gives you a lot of agency, it's just up to you to use it, and this alone is what made my first run or two so underwhelming.

But to be more specific...
WHAT I LIKE:
-The idea that tribalistic infighting over [i]how[/i] to address an alien invasion being as much of a problem as the aliens themselves is SO clever, and the tension feels real and earned.
-The music is appropriately atmospheric.
-Issues with the progression aside (more on that in a bit), there IS a constant feeling of both vertical and horizontal progression that's pretty satisfying.
-Some of the voice actors (The standouts to me are Hanse Castillo, Khalid al-Ashgar, and Judith Howell) are phenomenal.
-The Initiative is so moustache-twirlingly evil that I absolutely love to hate the guys.
-The simulation is detailed and thorough and almost nothing feels like it's bad because of laziness or lack of care. If the eccentricities of this game seem like your jam, it does well at scratching those very eccentric itches.

WHAT I DON'T LIKE: THE GENERAL:
-The game has four separate event notification systems. None of them individually work well, and all of them together are less than the sum of their parts.
-The UI is kind of a mess, and a 4X/Grand Strategy game [i]is[/i] its UI.
-It doesn't teach or explain its systems well, and some of these systems don't even [i]start[/i] to unlock until dozens of hours into the game. I love learning by experimenting, and this very much feels like a game where wiki deep-dives and watching videos of other people playing are the ways to learn it. For me, personally, that feels counter to why I want to play games like this in the first place.

WHAT I DON'T LIKE: THE MORE SPECIFIC:
-Managing councilors feels a little bit tedious when it's the main game mechanic, and a LOT tedious once you start managing later-game systems.
-It's detailed and thorough in ways that actively harm it. For example, though you're constantly unlocking warship technology from almost the start of the game, you have to wade through piles of tech that are first wildly uneconomical,  then so weak as to be useless, before you get to something even baseline practical that I don't understand why they didn't just push shipyards back and cut out all those earlier techs.
-Your faction determines the entire course of your objectives in the campaign, but you're not given enough info up front to make an informed decision about which one you want. For example, I get that the Servants are zealots and the Protectorate are good ol' fashioned cowards, but without getting 30 hours deep into each of their campaigns I don't think I could tell you why their goals are even a little incompatible. Likewise, at a glance, Humanity First just feels like a grumpier Resistance with a red coat of paint.

WHAT I DON'T LIKE: THE EXTREMELY PETTY:
-Fiona Ayoade, the advisor for the Resistance, the only faction that makes [i]any[/i] effort to teach you how the game works. I find her deeply, viscerally unpleasant in a way that none of the other advisors come close to. The worst I can say about my next-least-favorite advisor (Kiran) is that he just kinda seems like a boring muppet.

I REALLY want to like this game, and I know it's going to pull me back in at some point. Maybe I'll suddenly find that I love it when that happens! But right now, all I see is promise buried under mountains of tedium and an almost malicious disregard for the player's time that I would caution almost anyone from even starting it.",1694051278,1694053873,False,109,3,0.839018404483795166,0,True,False,True

Competition against the AI-controlled human factions feels good. The game does a good job at driving you to take action against the AI, and that in turn drives the AI to take action against you. I feel there's still some issues with the difficulty of righting the ship when a faction gets too far ahead, and where the AI will consistently succeed in ever-increasingly-unlikely actions that border on scripted.

Technology can be a very frustrating battlefield. If factions gain control of some high science producing countries, they can gain control of one of the three tech slots. If two gain control, they'll eventually come to a point where they ignore the other's control of that slot which can result in several years of wasted tech effort on stupid or meaningless techs. That in turn can cripple entire games, and your only recourse is to attack the AI's control of powerful counties. That in turn draws their eternal ire, and you'll quickly be buried under insurmountable opposition.

But the biggest issue I have is the space battles. While the controls have improved *slightly* in the year since EA, the biggest problem is simply the Alien's tech disparity. ET's ships move like a fidget spinner ODing on Adderall, and have weapons that outclass anything you will be able to field for years. The fights feel laughably one-sided; the ships will demonstrate early on that they are perfectly capable of doing donuts well outside your maximum range and snipe you to death. When you do manage a win, even some damage, it feels very clearly like you encountered a random bug in the AI and not that you had any tactical sense; there's no legitimate reason the enemy ship, having spent the last 200 hours of combat performing Swan Lake centered between your railgun rounds, would randomly decide to fly in a straight line for several kilometers until dead. And while you can stack up several braindead victories, the Aliens will eventually demonstrate they've just been sandbagging the entire time when they show up with a fleet stronger than the combined forces of all human fleets at three different locations simultaneously before dropping a ground invasion that you either have to nuke out of existence or pray land near your armies and somewhere your troops can actually get to. And that you've maxed out your miltech and have an overwhelming ground force for some reason, since armies are incredibly expensive to maintain. Never mind the impossibility of attacking their mining outposts, which conveniently never take damage and instant-kill fleets orders of magnitude more powerful. Or of defending your own mining stations, which will of course suffer the ignoble death at the hands of a pair of corvettes no matter how many battlestations are around.

I'm all for the game having you go up against a much stronger opponent. Those can be fun. But this isn't what that is; you're not Luke piloting an X-Wing to blow up the Death Star, you're Jar Jar flying a trashcan against an infinite fleet of TIE fighters.

pros:
i love this game to bits, it has everything a sci-fi hardcore space lover could want! the game is intricate in a good way which means you are never bored or have nothing to do - once you get the hang of it it is allot less confusing. I was honestly on the edge of my seat constantly throughout the middle of the game. Another awesome part of this game is the building of colonies and mining outposts throughout the solar system; if this doesnt capture your imagination i dont know what will. currently i am at year 2046 in the middle of the game and am upgrading to teir 3 stations however...

cons:
i am playing on cinematic mode (easiest difficulty) because this is my first play though, however, i cannot seem to make any progress against the aliens! they have 500 ships and a massive space presence which sit around in orbit, thwarting my efforts to do anything not on the ground - since the update, ground bases seem to be nerfed and they are bombarding the hell out of my strongholds(tier three bases with full layered defence arrays and fusion powerplants - battlestations are so expensive and take so long to build if i built them the base would have no defence for at least a year). Furthermore, alien ships are so much faster and it would take years to develop a new generation of ships to combat the old gen of alien ones.

things i think would improve the game:
ship designer in skirmish mode
-design and test prototypes
faster tech tree to better engines
reducing the cost and time to build tier 3 modules",1677529705,1693842861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, as it stands now, it is not a game I would recommend to many people. The game can be frustrating, monotonous, overwhelming and buggy, and until many of my grievances are addressed in future updates, it is unlikely I will start another campaign. Despite these short comings, there is nothing else like it. For fans of hard science fiction that are interested in space conflict as it could plausibly exist given the limitations of Newtonian physics, there are few games for us on the market. Terra Invicta has no equal in the scale of the simulation. 

In the first dozen or so hours, your faction vies to control and influence the many nations and corporations of Earth, investing in infrastructure and contributing to both global and local research projects. This could be a game of its own, and I have found myself glued to my computer and unable to stop after ""just one more turn"" much like Civ or any other grand strategy titles. Terra Invicta is even grander, soon you will establish a small foothold in space, colonizing the moon, building your first warship are long and taxing ventures, but become more accessible throughout the campaign due to research and expansion.
 Space travel in this game, especially with early chemical and electrical propulsion systems, is measured in months, or even years. Even with late game fusion and antimatter drives, much of the time spent in this game is waiting for the next action as your probes and fleets inch across the vastness of the solar system. Mass, acceleration, delta V, gravity and orbital positions must all be factored when considering design and use of space craft, in addition to combat capabilities and other utilities you can equip. There is a significant learning curve here, both in terms of game play mechanics that are not immediately obvious, and in terms of intuitive understanding of micro g physics. This, paired with the sense of helplessness in the face of an overpowering alien force, can lead many to abandon the game in frustration. 
The progression is most comparable to xcom, or any Firaxis game for that matter. The early game you are weak and vulnerable, but making rapid advancement to meet a stronger foe. The mid game will have you engaged in ""tit for tat"" raids and combat, being able to finally make meaningful defenses and offensive operations against the aliens. And much like a Firaxis title, the concluding hours are the weakest, as you have to wait for the simulation to play out your final maneuvers against a nearly defeated enemy. This part of the game is a chore, as it took me in game decades to amass and position a fleet able to penetrate the alien stronghold in the furthest reaches of the Kuiper Belt. 
There is much room for improvement, but I am confident those improvements will arrive, just as they had throughout the early access period so far. The devs are very invested and active in the community, soliciting feedback and troubleshooting player issues. The game has at this point been in early access for nearly a year, and has certainly come a long way. At launch, I do not think I would recommend this game due to bugs and missing quality of life features that now would have made my experience far less painful. It continues to improve, and the road map promises exciting new features and ways to play.",1693696243,1693696243,True,6,0,0.587214112281799316,0,True,False,True

The political mechanics seem simple enough, until you realize that everything is connected to everything else, and that your counsellors' home nationality and personality traits actually matter.  (Except when they don't, because it's like that.)

And then eventually you come to terms with the difference between the 'public tech tree' and the 'private tech tree', and how they interact with each other, and you start to work out how to do tech tree strategy.

Of course, there's also the fact that every country you take over has its own economic policy settings, which probably should be set differently in the USA vs Bolivia vs Russia.  And then there's the fact that if you do anything in this game really successfully, the anti-snowball mechanics will punish you for your success, and so you have to take everything gently (but not so gently that your competitors beat you, but not so aggressively that their jealousy becomes a problem).

And then you finally make it into space, where somehow the action makes 2001: A Space Oddyssey seem like a fast-paced action thriller.  But just because you're in space doesn't mean you can afford to ignore the political and economic side of things, because otherwise you run the risk of your mission control facility being taken over by another faction.

Not to mention that you can actually move armies around the map, and 'politics by other means' can become a serious matter.

And then you finally work out how to get a space industry happening, and then you finally work out how to get space warships happening, and then an opposing faction infiltrates a warship that you'd marked as 'obsolete' and runs off with it.  So you chase it down with the rest of your fleet, and you decide that you're never going to underestimate the value of point defenses again, because it turns out that they're decisive.  (Unless you have laser weapons, in which case they're irrelevant. Unless...)

And somehow all of these layers are playing out at the same time, and you find yourself really questioning your early choices.  And maybe (after you've sunk 20 hours into a playthrough) you'll actually find out what your victory conditions are.  (Less than 10% of players make it far enough through the game to earn the achievement for finding out your victory conditions.)

And there's a trick to THOSE too.  One of the rarest achievements is ""Win as the Resistance after the Servants have won.""  So it's good that someone else winning doesn't automatically mean that you lose, but.... ARGH!

So yeah, if you like the experience of being 40 hours in and finally at that point thinking that you're starting to understand the difference between one drive system technology and another, then this is the game for you.  And it seems to be the game for me.  If nothing else, it gives me something to complain about.",1680082826,1693558105,True,3,0,0.536571085453033447,0,True,False,True

It's a genre filled with a mixture of fantasy scenarios and yet scientific accuracy, where making something good becomes difficult due to the arduous task of fulfilling the wishes of a fandom that likes two conflicting concepts as fantasy and realism mixed together. Some decide to lean more on the fantasy side, with lightsabers or a black alien that pops from inside your stomach, while others aim for the pseudo-realism of a more legitimate scientific conversation.

If the latter is your cup of tea, then Terra Invicta has a lot of tea for you. At game start, the world is just like we know it, and the first Alien ship has arrived. Science will advance faster than it had done before, because of both terrestrial alliances and the influence of these new beings, but many things will work in the ways that we know they do today. Espionage to sabotage projects, diplomacy to fight a common foe, cultural battles to establish influence over a country's population, we all know how these thing work, and at first, you'll be mostly focused on this, and I'd say the majority of the time in the game is about these interactions.

Then of course, if Aliens come from space, then we have to go to space too. Sending probes, establishing orbiting stations and mining platforms to generate resources independently from Earth's nations is a slow but necessary task. And there'll come a time where you need spaceships to defend those stations, both from your neighbours and the not-so-friendly visitors. The design tool to create these spaceships is insanely flexible and fun to use, although it takes a lot of trial and error to land your first actually useful ships.

Grand Strategy games are usually long and require lots of reading, and Terra Invicta is no exception. The journey so far has been absolutely worth it for me, and I know I've only begun to scratch the surface of the game.

This is, undeniably, an improvement. If you are interested in the game, and are familiar with this sort of game, consider buying it and trying it yourself. I really do think this concept is quite good and I am hopeful that, given time, this game will be something quite special. In its current state I still cannot recommend this game to the average Paradox grand strategy player, but for the sort of people who love simulation-heavy games or spreadsheets (guilty,) I think there is already the promise of a good game here.

I would love to recommend this game, but it currently has too many issues in its design.
As many other reviewers have pointed out, even for a grand strategy game, the pacing of this game is abysmal.
The early game fight over control points is somewhat interesting, but mostly just praying for the right dice rolls. Not very engaging but I found it interesting to think about the different strategies you might employ as each of the factions in this stage.
After that, you've got a long period of stagnation, which (sort of) ends when a faction gains control over the nations that are near impossible to get a point in at the start (China, USA, with a little bit of India consolidation).
And then... nothing. You'll launch a satellite or two, try to get a mining base on the Moon and then Mars, then asteroids.
But you won't be able to launch a single useful ship until you spend another 6-10 hours waiting on research. Which means that, as the recommended starting faction, The Resistance, you're just sitting on your hands for an incredibly long span of game play.
My latest save has about 20 hours in it, and despite it being my most successful play through thus far, I can't justify putting more time into this game in its current state.

I think the most glaringly annoying design choice at present is this: there is no reason you should not be able to pick your own councilors at game start instead of having to restart a game every time you don't get your preferred combination, or if they simply just have terrible stats at start. Especially since it takes a good amount of time to generate and load into a new game, it's just a waste of our time as players to not give us this freedom of choice.

The biggest problem this game faces is that despite the overwhelming number of choices in the game, the amount of information given to the player about those choices is pretty awful, and when it comes to the gargantuan, sprawling tech tree, most of those options aren't very interesting. That's not to say they're useless, but they often offer such minuscule improvements that it becomes a chore to play very quickly. And navigating the tech tree is abysmal. Despite dozens(?) of variants of engines, there's only a few that matter, even of the same tier.
Want to find an asteroid to mine? Good luck, the best ones are probably already inhabited by your faction's competitors, since the AI has no difficulty finding the best asteroids to mine at the lowest Boost cost, while you, the player, has to find them to begin with. The game does not provide any tools for players to find their next ideal expansion, despite the hundreds of orbital bodies in the game.

As for the engine types themselves, the different options seem to mostly be in the game as a rule-of-cool design choice. They're all based off of theoretical designs that people who love to think about space, space engineering and science fiction have probably heard of. And while I don't have a good grounding in engineering to be able to wrap my head around the various specifications of each engine, it is actually cool that these designs are all represented. The problem is that, practically, if you don't choose from the few best designs, you're shooting yourself in the foot. In effect, this means that the game would benefit from stripping your choices down to a few categories of engine use cases. You'll want one kind of engine for ships that aren't meant to engage in combat and travel long distances while using minimal fuel, and you'll want another for ships that are meant to outpace your competitors or to engage in combat. There is still some nuance in there, and you could argue for a few more engine categories being meaningfully better in certain applications, but you could still pare down the engines you'll actually want to use in a game to about half of the engines available to choose from at this time and you wouldn't be missing too much.

I hope that this game develops tools to make the game itself more digestible, at minimum. I'm saying this as someone who loves complex systems in video games, and I've put hundreds of hours in other grand strategy games, as far back as Crusader Kings 1 and Europa Universalis III. I do see the promise of an interesting game here, but I think it will come with many overhauls to existing systems and various QoL changes and additions.",1692203323,1693344629,False,22,0,0.639243900775909424,2,True,False,True

I am still very much learning this game and it's rules and tactics. It is a very detailed, in depth strategy game that very much does not hold your hand- and very much like I imagine humanity would need to operate should the xeno scum ever arrive unannounced at their doorstep (asking for handouts in the form of a plasma cannon aimed squarely at their head), you really do learn as you go through successful planning or dreadful mistakes and your playthrough and story can be dramatically different and change in strange ways each time.

Strategic Micro and macro managing that sees you involved in world shaping decisions while at the same time determining the fates of the smallest nations down to the last minute detail that leaves you engaged and wanting to keep going. 8-10 hours of gameplay equated to mid 2023-2024 in game, and I felt engaged making decisions, planning out nation priorities, strategically planning coups in countries to save me time kicking out the enemy one by one, investing my time and efforts in researching newer and better ways to eradicate the undeserving xeno from the glory that is Terra. And based on things I've watched online, I am still years away from meeting the alien scum in glorious combat among the stars. And that is part of what makes it so much fun- watching how your guiding hand can, over time, shape and change a reactive world around you on a global and galaxy wide scale, and how that hand--for better or worse- can lead humanity to prosperity or utter nuclear ruin.

Not really. It seems there were a bunch of new players who appear to not have understood what they were buying and, unfortunately for them, put too much time into it to get a refund. Well I'm here to save you from that fate - by telling you exactly what Terra Invicta is!

The game is an acquired taste. Like scotch. And, just like scotch, it will burn going down at first... until it gets sweet when you really get into it... until eventually it just poisons you altogether and you swear you'll never touch the stuff again.... and then, a week or month or year later, you start it up again.

Terra Invicta is an extremely nerdy game. Not nerdy like ""I like to play videogames"" nerdy. Terra Invicta is the best attempt ever made to create a scientifically-accurate alien invasion simulator.

And, if that wasn't ambitious enough, it's basically three different games in one: a space combat sim, a space war 4x and a deep-state-conspiracy strategy game.

Surprisingly - these three games actually interact pretty well most of the time... especially after some recent QOL improvements.

The most annoying thing is - when you've got one or two of the three down pat - they become tedious chores while you try to focus on the other one. So the conspiracy on Earth game gets boring once you've already conquered most/all of the world... and space combat can get tedious when you've got an unbeatable fleet... which just leaves the 4x logistics of getting your little metal airpockets of death several Astronomical Units away from Earth to the endgame.

[b]What's going on[/b]
They're an unimaginably-advanced civilization that can break laws of physics we don't even know exist. You're a naked monkey who just split the atom and can't stop arguing over bananas with all the other monkeys. Oh yeah and they can do mind control.

Even on normal difficulty, you are near-hopelessly outmatched. Your one saving grace is the aliens have a limited throughput with their invasion pipeline and a limited population, so you can use home ground advantage to hopefully survive long enough to do enough research you need so you can fight back with tech they'll take seriously.

[b]Space Combat[/b]
And that tech will (mostly) follow the laws of physics. Meaning that, like actual theoretical space drives proposed IRL, most of them will suck and be of little-to-no use in combat. And combat will also follow the laws of physics, so be prepared to watch in horror as your basic-fission-drive monkey ships get rekt because the enemy can literally dodge bullets with fusion drives, acrobatically flying circles around your fleet. If you want to survive the initial invasion, you need to outnumber the hell out of the enemy and overwhelm their point-defense with clouds of missiles.

Once you get dreadnoughts with (EDIT: BETTER ADVICE) good fusion drives, 66 units of armor at the front, a spinal coilgun, 2x large coils and medium UV phaser batteries... the aliens are basically toast. I just fought outnumbered 10 to one and the only thing that killed me was the game crashing (probably because RAM and crappy laptop).

[b]The 4x strategy[/b]
As Sseth once said, 4x stands for: eXplore, eXpand and eXterminate all Xenos.

If the aliens could bring whole ships to the Sol system, you'd be screwed. But, as it stands, they have to build their invasion fleet using local materials... which gives you an opportunity to learn from them and respond in kind.

But that requires a LOT of raw materials. Colonizing Mars is just the start... in order to succeed, you'll need to grab valuable real estate in Sol's asteroid belt (Ceres is always popular).

Like I said, the drives (mostly) follow the laws of physics, so they WILL SUCK. The best drives in the early game require way too much Volatiles (jet fuel) or fissiles (nuke sauce) to be practical.

Several of the negative reviews mentioned this facet of the game... but, if you're a giant nerd like me, this is a positive. Think less Star Trek and more The Expanse. Most of the best drives are fusion-based and run on hydrogen.

The best drive in the game runs on antimatter, which comes with a breathtakingly-obscene logistics profile... as in, in order to make the stuff, you have to dedicate the resource equivalent of the total production of several colonies to produce anything more than - I shit you not - ""femtograms"" of antimatter. But, if you got it, then you've pretty much won the logistics war and it's all over but the alien crying.

The worst part about the 4x game is that the human-faction AI is totally incompetent at it. You can expect to suffer the brunt of the invasion yourself because, despite improvements since I last played, the AI is still totally hopeless at it.

[b]The world conspiracy sim[/b]
So there are 8 different factions in-game and all of them, with one exception, have pretty solid backstories + raisons d'etre. You don't play as a country. You play as a secret conspiracy of unelected Deep State bureaucrats who wear countries like skinsuits and play politicians like sock puppets.

It does get a little boring once you've beaten it, but the ground game is easily the best part of Terra Invicta AND recent QOL features include an ""automatic mission"" button so you don't have to babysit your conspiracy council when the time comes. And this part of the game is, unfortunately, the most realistic part of Terra Invicta.

To give you the best idea of what that part of the game is like, here's what my recent Academy playthrough was like:

Academy wants to make peace with the aliens, which involves first studying them, then communicating with them and then threatening them with xenocide so they come to the negotiating table. But, in order for that to work, you need to get the vast majority of the human race under your thumb so you can credibly claim to speak for the whole species.

So I set about creating a world government by first starting in France, then making the EU into a super-state that totally crushed Brexit and dominated the UK... then I crushed Russia and dragged them in too... then allying with China, who proceeded to conquer everything east of India into the Pan-Asian Combine (democracy score= ZERO)... I then took India and Pakistan over and made them go to war with each other, so I could make an Indian super-state without the risk of starting a nuclear war (because I CONTROLLED BOTH SIDES).

I grabbed the US, then used it to conquer Canada and Mexico... then with my 4 massive super-states proceeded to crush every independent nation in Latin America and Africa into the South American Union and the African Union, respectively. Everything else ended up in the Sunni Calphate... (oof! Sorry, Israel! Hope they're treating you OK!). In the end, every nation on the planet was part of the European Union's federation.

But I still couldn't hold on to enough of these states to get the win condition because my management capacity wasn't high enough.

And then I realized what my problem was: the population was too high and GDP was too high - so the people were too free and prosperous to be controlled. I needed to sabotage the global economy to crush the will of recalcitrant western capitalists and destroy the nuclear family, or I'd never be able to exert enough control to dominate the world. So I intentionally tanked every Western economy, while turning the Welfare dial up to max everywhere. The standard of living cratered and so did the population, as the wilting flower of liberty took more lives from suicide, drug abuse and hopelessness than the aliens ever would have.

And, with that, I was finally able to bring Earth under the benevolent rule of a conspiracy of 6 billionaire socialists in order to make peace and end the alien threat.

Like other critical reviews have mentioned it is a slog in the beginning and offers little explanation to what is and what would be the best actions to take for your faction.

After hours of time sunk into this game and reading their wiki, I barely feel like I still understand the full mechanics. I ended up getting to 2033 to fight one alien ship and then have most of my habs and settlements repossessed by the other factions. Probably because of tax evasion xD. I really enjoyed the dog piling, it didn't make me a bit tired of having to deal with psycho AI that like to add a difficulty tweak to your already paper thin space industry.

I like the art of the game more than the game itself. The animations between ground forces is dull, the councilors have token board portraits, and the ships are more or less prefabbed with slight variations. The space battles even aren't really all that entertaining. It feels like a turn based board game to me with added options in the middle to tweak like dials on a midi controller or a soundboard.

Mechanics are detailed but simple to learn. It is not a complicated game, but there are many factors and variables, but no ""right"" or ""wrong"" action (also depending on difficulty level of course), so there is a great replayability.

1. An extremly in depth multi-layered strategy and ressource management game, one of the best i would even say.
2. The AI does not cheat, like getting units or ressources out of thin air because balancing is hard and or devs are lazy. The AI here has to deal with the same problems as the player and does so very well as far as I can tell, and yes you can break a faction with precision strikes against the backbone of their economy, sending them into a death spiral. If you accomplish that it is well deserved.
3. The soundtrack, voicelines and graphics are not triple A but at no point do they look or sound cheap. It is apparent that enough time was spend on making them good enough but more time was spend on the things that are really important - game mechanics.
4. The amount of min-maxing and theorycrafting you can do is mindblowing.
5. The story and background is fascinating and well done.

The negatives (still early access plz remember):

1. The game doesn't hold your hand even if it should. There are numerous decisions made in ui-design that are completely unnecassary, which result in numerous travels to reddit to ask for help where you can find information crucial to the gameplay. The ui is unelegant, countless times have I thought that this or that must be automated, that there is no way the game expects me to handhold certain mechanics every single instance. Once you start building spacestations in mass the overview of what you have, what it does, what it needs and a few ""what its"" more is a complete and utter desaster. Nothing is transparent everything is cryptic or extremly clunky. The same for ship design. As absolutely amazing as the amount of possibilities are, as unintuitive and sparse in giving you an idea what the ""stats"" of a ship mean, it becomes at the same time.
2. The game is inflated with unnessecary stuff. For example: surly 30% of weapons, or engines or drives, could be removed from the game and we wouldnt notice a single difference in options and opportunities. We would notice a sever increase in accessabiltiy and better overview though.
3. Having savefiles getting corrupted in a 6+ hour playthrough, to the point that they close the game if you load them, isn't helping either.
4. I don't know man there has to be a better solution to the assassination and space assets take over, then simply have the ai win a % die roll. Loosing and agent in an advanced game is kind of unrecoverable. Even safescumming isn't a solution, since you are reloading all the time. Having your agent go into cover all the time is a bad game feeling too. 

This is a small developer with gold on their hands, I want these guys to succed so much but they must fix the accessability to the game. This game is almost as cryptic with 100 hours of playtime as just starting europa universalis 4 for the first time is.

Read a lot of reviews to see if this is your kind of taste, but if it is you won't get any game that scratches it as well as Terra Invicta does

This is very much at least 2 games in one: 1) a geopolitics spreadsheet strategy, and 2) a space 4X combat sim. The first is very good, if a little frustrating at times (spending a year in game preparing to unify two countries, then having someone coup one of them and lose all that progress). I got a lot of satisfaction out of unifying countries into mega-nations (African Union, European Union, North American States) and making them ultra powerful. The depth of simulation into different parts of society, climate change (including nuclear winter) and international politics is fantastic. Makes for a good challenge and lots of freedom. The second game is also... good, but has room for improvements. Still, it's fun making colonies and outposts across the real life solar system in real scale

The game is not perfect by any stretch, and has a lot of ground to improve as it continues through early access. In case the devs read this review, my biggest gripes in no particular order were:
- Solar system UI. I went for a large number of objects (not max) and it was a mess. If I ever play another campaign I'm going to use the minimum, and probably a mod to reduce this further. There's no way for everything to be colonised and run out of space, so a lot of it is unnecessary filler
- I know it's a design decision to not let this happen, but PLEASE let us eliminate factions. If they have no control points, resources, influence left then sure their idea might stay alive but as a functional faction I should be able to shut them down. Having the Servants coup a random country and [spoiler] spawn the Alien Administration [/spoiler] for the 5th time in a game is no longer fun, it's a pain. Maybe have the opportunity for them to come back if popular support grows enough (based on in game events? - I loved those, definitely add more I beg), and maybe have eliminating them take special councillor missions/projects?
- Pacing is an issue. In space combat the two forces are rarely evenly matched in combat power/manoeuvrability, so it's almost always a case of ""one side will win/flee"". Fighting against other factions depends on who is ahead in research; fighting against the aliens pretty much depends on having reached the endgame tech in every category. For me this meant basically conquering Earth until the tech tree was done, farming resources across the solar system while doing this, and then switching to fighting the invasion in space - at that point there was lots of waiting for ships to move across the vast distances of space
- Direct space combat needs a lot of work. Manoeuvring ships is such a pain and micromanage-y nightmare that I resorted to a wall of battleships that don't change direction, in every fight. The manoeuvre nodes just don't really work - I would recommend a control panel in the UI to set desired speed and orientation, rather than have these be set by a handful of very limiting options. Also, for Skirmish mode, please add a ship designer so you can test your own designs rather than the pre-made ones
- General space combat needs some additions and improvements as well; right now a ship whose drive or power plant is damaged, is dead. It can be repaired at a dock but can't get there, so the only option is to scuttle it. Support ships, able to repair other ships (either to a limited extent, or repair a certain amount before needing to resupply) would be fantastic. Also, manoeuvres are buggy as hell - I got the ""can't work out any manoeuvres"" error too many times to count.
- This was the biggest pain; not being able to cancel ship actions. I should be able to stop repairing a fleet if the enemy has arrived, rather than saying ""sorry this will take another 30 in game weeks, so no can do"" (though you can split the fleet to have most of it leave early to get around this, but it's a pain). Or changing direction mid-trip - it should be delta-V dependant, sure, but it shouldn't be permanently committed to the same destination

I've listed a lot of gripes but despite all these it's a very good game that I've really enjoyed playing.

If you can think how Crusader Kings 2, Stellaris and 90s X-com are smashed together and like what you imagine, you get pretty good idea if this game is for you.

Pros:
Gameplay keeps interesting since the game is not just a sandbox ""conquer it all and role play a faction"" -type game, like Crusader Kings 2. 

Aliens and other factions keep building up pressure and tension to keep you pushing forward. Game mechanics become more complex steadily due to player achieving new milestones on your mission to deal with the aliens. You start with 4 faction agents with whom you assasinate, subterfuge and backstab other factions and their nations on your way to global domination. Eventually you will leave the lowly Earth by building space port capacity, orbital habs etc.

If you have imagination and tendency to enjoy slow paced tension building, high stakes and of course deterring those damn aliens, this game is for you.

The way this game is structured just tests aforementioned patience.
From tooltips - which are tedious walls of text among which critical information is hidden without proper highlighting...
To inability to completely defeat a faction (you kill all it's councilors, they buy a bunch of a new ones right at the next turn).
I had to abandon a few runs because stuff got too tedious and annoying. And I started over - now with knowledge how to avoid THAT particular set of annoyances.

Also, tech tree - filled with absolutely useless stuff, like modules that are just worse than your starting ones. And there are tons of them, clogging your not-so-friendly interface. And later techs cost RIDICULOUS amounts of research points - I literally had to sit there for in-game years just waiting for tech to develop.

I think, I'll wait until a full release. Hope at that point they will balance game a bit and remove at least some of useless stuff.

UPD: Okay, this is ridiculous, but I sunk another hundred or so hours and almost finished the game. Decreasing faction count is the way to go - it makes stuff WAY less annoying. Last sequence (building insane amounts of ships and steamrolling aliens) is still way beyond my patience, though.

But that automate feature doesn't offer the ability to actually prioritize which actions to take in any way. And if the best solution to improve gameplay is to automate half of it, why have it in there at all?

The councilor management needs to be streamlined so that it still gives the player choice, but is less tedious to manage. It is also odd that different actions all take 1 turn, and there is no time difference between an action on a massive country, and a tiny one. Perhaps being able to queue orders, or give the automate feature priorities for certain actions would help. Differentiating between big and small tasks would be another good improvement.

Without doubt, it's an amazing game that straddles the line between 4X and Grand Strategy, and I doubt anyone interested in either genre's heavier entries (Paradox grand strats that aren't Europa Universalis, 4x's that aren't civilization) or anyone who's played more than 30 minutes of Shadow Empire will regret their purchase.

[strike]it isn't smooth[/strike], it isn't easy to understand, it isn't forthcoming with information... you get the idea. But it also isn't released - you're buying into an Early Access product that's more engaging than many completed titles, but lacks polish and the final steps to being great to play, so let's dig into that.

First - it isn't complete. While you can get to every victory screen with every faction, The games is missing scenarios and mechanics that will doubtlessly change the game. [strike]For example, the lack of refueling tankers makes plenty of designs noob traps when they'd be fully functional with tankers in the game.[/strike] The lack of interplanetary polities (and its associated scenario) means that no matter how long your war against the aliens drags on, you'll never feel the majesty of The Expanse. All these are coming, but other things are decisions that may never be changed. Most notably, the lack of food inhibits interesting complexity like turning Ceres into a giant farm to feed your space habs elsewhere, and while there are things you can do with a bad planetary base, there's not enough, and the game probably wouldn't suffer from removing it entirely, when interplanetary polities are ready. But we have three other things to talk about, so let's move on.

It isn't smooth - this one will fade quickly from the posting of my review, but it's got lots of little annoyances in its UX that just make it rougher to play - extra clicks,[strike]reversed ordering for the same thing in different menus, inverted camera in space combat you can't change, and worst of all, continually increasing clutter from projects you'll never research, with no way to hide them.[/strike] That sort of that thing really starts to drag.

It isn't easy to understand - it's great breadth and depth makes it extremely difficult to comprehend, as simply gaining the game knowledge required to do well will take a long time! This is unlikely to change, but Pavonis has been chipping away the problem with tweaks in other areas.

Finally, it isn't forthcoming with its information. This is improving and on the roadmap, but issues like not knowing why a number in your nation is going up and down despite your attempts to make it go the opposite way is problematic, and as of August 2023, has been only partially addressed. Usually, whatever you're looking at will explain to you how it might change, but not why it did, so you're left to determine, for example, if you GDP went down due to climate change, conflict, or something else.

None of these issues are fatal, nor does it lead to death by a thousand cuts, but it's certainly something to consider. Early access may not be for you, but if you've read this far the game almost certainly is.",1665621208,1691156683,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It feels like the AI factions are actually trying to win and stop you from gaining an advantage as opposed to simply being an obstacle to be run over. Which can be seen when they try and take my stuff(but I don't let them).

Nothing in the game really feels like BS once you figure out why it happened. Like for example, in my earlier hours in the game, some of my control points randomly flipped to the servants despite being defended w/ popularity on my side.

Today, I come before you to share my thoughts on a captivating and ambitious game, ""Terra Invicta."" This grand strategy endeavor, developed by the talented team at Pavonis Interactive, has captured my imagination and ignited a flame of excitement for the potential it holds.

At its core, ""Terra Invicta"" embodies the very essence of diplomacy and strategic prowess, much like the challenges I faced during my tenure as a statesman and a leader. The game allows players to assume the role of global defenders, facing the imminent threat of an alien invasion. The weight of the world rests on your shoulders, and the decisions you make will shape the destiny of humanity itself.

The depth and complexity of the gameplay mirror the intricacies of international relations and geopolitics. It is a test of leadership, demanding resource management, tactical acumen, and alliances formed through mutual respect and shared goals. Just as I sought to build trust among nations during my presidency, ""Terra Invicta"" requires players to navigate through treacherous waters to unite the world against a common enemy.

The game's emphasis on scientific research and technological advancement is a testament to the importance of innovation in forging a path to victory. It reminds me of my staunch belief in progress and the need to embrace new ideas and technologies for the betterment of our nation. In ""Terra Invicta,"" as in real life, knowledge is a powerful weapon that must be wielded responsibly.

Moreover, I must commend Pavonis Interactive for their commitment to realism and attention to historical detail. Just as I treasured historical accuracy, ""Terra Invicta"" draws upon the past to inform its fictional narrative, lending it a sense of authenticity that immerses players in its captivating world.

However, let me stress that while ""Terra Invicta"" shows great promise, it remains a work in progress. As the game continues its development, I eagerly anticipate further refinements and enhancements that will elevate it to even greater heights. The road to success is paved with dedication and perseverance, and I have every confidence in the developers' ability to create an extraordinary gaming experience.

""Terra Invicta"" is a testament to the brilliance of human ingenuity and creativity, a reminder that we are at our best when we face challenges together. As you embark on your own journey to defend humanity from extraterrestrial threats, may you be inspired by the virtues of diplomacy, innovation, and unity.

With unwavering hope for the triumph of humanity,

Terra Invicta is a turn-based strategy set throughout the solar system. We play here as one of the few factions created for the newly appearing aliens. Each of these factions follow different rules and ideas for the future, so each campaign has the potential to be interesting.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Even though I have 12 hours on this game, I've barely really gotten into it, but I have enough knowledge to rate it. Starting from the gameplay on Terra, managing our agents is quite simple, but this leads to very extensive mechanics of managing nations under our rule, conducting advanced research, and diplomacy with other factions. There is a lot to do here, and we can spend dozens of hours on the planet itself. Moving on to the gameplay in space, the complexity and breadth of the mechanics enter a whole new level. We get the opportunity to expand our own fleet and space stations, and while this process is very slow, we feel great satisfaction as part of improving our presence in space. It is also worth mentioning the possibility of expanding outposts on other planets, moons and asteroids, which gives really big bonuses. All this culminates in a clash with the aliens, and with the achievement of our faction's goal. However, despite all this, this game has some big problems. Speaking of the biggest ones, the game does not pull us by the hand at all. But that's good, right? Well, in theory, at least at first. The problem is that, one campaign can take tens of hours, and in the end we can fail because of a stupid mistake at the very beginning. Since the game doesn't tell us what we're doing wrong, we learn to play through trial and error, which makes the game suck a huge amount of free time out of us, for potentially disastrous campaigns. I like high difficulty in games, but it's so unintuitive that it's starting to feel a little unfair. And let's end with the worst, i.e. the UI. Due to the vastness of this game, we have a gigantic freedom of choice here. Each choice is broken down into categories, and those categories into other branches, but it's all ruined by an awful UI that's too small, chaotic, and barely legible, making gameplay a pain-inducing for the eyes and brain.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
Graphically it's pretty good, it's quite a familiar graphic style from other strategy games on the world map, but this style is so nice and full of details that I don't have problems with it. Moving on to stability, it's not bad, the game didn't crash to desktop, but I noticed problems with FPS, on larger maps of the solar system, the game stutters noticeably. And ending with the music, it's nothing special, typical sci-fi strategy music.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
A good game with a lot of potential. However, this game is developing far too slowly, and the existing problems are so tiresome that before buying it, it is worth thinking about whether you have the time and strength to deal with all this.

It's got a great premise and some of the ideas are really cool, but it really struggles on pacing and forces menial micromanagement. The UI also needs work - the game is too complicated and grand in scale to have poorly organized menus. The game also involves a lot of waiting - I would estimate that maybe 1/3 of my time in the game is waiting (even at the fastest speed). I also had a variety of performance issues and it crashed more frequently than it should. I'm willing to excuse some of that for it being in early access but it was jarring and made the game feel even more disjointed.

In it's current state, the game just isn't fun. Many of the core systems and concepts of the game need serious reevaluation by the devs.

I was interested in the global political thing with the councilors working from the shadows etc but its not enough.
You send an army to kill a rival controlled country and just see health bars move on the units a bit like in EU IV only its all driven byu the miltech level of the army not by a general, shock, morale etc. I didnt get to build a spaceship but i did build some habs and a base on mars but its just a top down image you can add other images too.

Part of the charm of xcom is in the fights around structures you've built - and that you get combat you control.. its a huge part of the game that this in its current state just doesnt cover off.

since i didnt build a spaceship in the main game i did a skirmish, but its needlessly complex and difficult to control your ships in 3d so in an even match up the ai beat my ships and frankly i just couldnt care.

Back in the main game I'm basically waiting for the councilors to come back off cooldown so i can send them out again, which you do can do every month. But unless you have research finish you wont really do much else.

I find myself constantly wondering why this is a new, modern, resource hungry game and not a browser game from back in the early 2000s. Everything except the globe is a new window that opens and on the globe is basically just a few buttons at the bottom of the screen.

Its a pain to select the right country / control point with the right misson as you may be looking at one country but still have another selected.
its not intuitive at all on the councilors, different missions use different stats some councilors may have a high stat but no mission that uses it or vice versa, using orgs can offset this as they can give both missions and stats to councilors. 
Its never obvious why you cant do something, dont seem able to build an extra on your hab, or cant see why your councilor with ""steal project"" wont even think of stealing it from that councilor this time (its probably because that councilor is in a country your councilor wont work in btw, but good luck trying to remember all of that).
Allocating resource points in countries is nice but my god does it take a long time to matter. I've out a further 88 hours in and now have my own fleet of 3 ships... woo

Unfortunately, that was a naive view of how shallow and annoying this game is to play. The AI cheats to provide a challenge; the Aliens toggle between literally not doing anything, and massacring every single human ship/station/country in the solar system; everything takes decades to happen, and while that wouldn't be a problem with speeding up time, the timescale in this game isn't nearly fast enough to not be boring.

Stellaris (nevermind the DLC scam) is a good example of a good sci-fi strategy game. The timescale is fast, so actions that take in-game generations only take a few real-world hours to complete. The AI still cheats, but it's not nearly as bad as the AI in this game, especially if you consider the Aliens.

Finally, there's modding support, or the lack of it. I'm the developer of what's currently the third most popular mod in the workshop, and this game is absolute dogshit to mod. Editing code requires third-party programs, and most of the game has hardcoded values, so the ""Template"" modding mechanic touted in the store page is pretty useless. There is absolutely zero official documentation, so it's pretty much guesswork to find out how to do certain things. For context, it took me *days* to figure out how to spawn a single pop-up event in the game, a task that would have taken me minutes in Stellaris, as that game has a full documentation on the wiki for modders.

It's frankly shameful that this game did so well in the kickstarter, and failed to deliver in everything they promised. I wouldn't be surprised if the unfinished, unmoddable game is overmarketed and released early, and the features promised for backers be released as paid DLC.",1670308922,1690903593,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[b][i]However...[/i][/b]

The inital launch was a promising start with a good foundation and quite impressive for what started out as a mod team.
But it was a lot of ""cool ideas"" that they clearly had just gotten all together to test in unison for the first time, the features didn't synergize and weren't balanced, neither in gameplay, time or effort and just didn't really fit together to improve eachother.
The game clearly needed a lot of reconsideration and tweaks to how  things worked, so I thought I'd wait and try again later.

Now almost a year later I gave the game another couple of playthroughs, but I'm sad to see it's for all intents and purposes the exact same and still have the exact same issues. 

Disappointingly the development never really went anywhere after the early access release and all the devs are doing are polising, bugfixing and tweaking tiny things about what they already have, without ever touching, replacing, adding or removing anything fundamental, even if the game is really in a state where all the polish they're putting in may be a waste on features and ideas that should be subject to completely change. 

They seem unwilling or scared to make any bigger changes or decisions that would shake up and improve the core gameplay that the game sorely needs and instead treat it as nearly finished.
It would appear they are hoping that their mismatching features will somehow just ""click"" together eventually, if they keep tweaking and adjusting them without any clear goals in mind, despite having fundamental differences and issues.

Unless the devs somehow get a bit of a kick to change gears and take a look at the drawing board again, I really don't see this game going anywhere and just fade out in early access like so many others.",1690636035,1690815294,False,249,3,0.845871984958648682,0,True,False,True

There are 2 things I would like the developers to focus on:
1. Micromanaging your agents is fun only at the beginning when you set everything up. After some time, when you get to focus on space the micromanagement part of the game really kills the rythm and becomes very repetitive. You can become paranoid to forget to apply the ""consolidate"" action on one of your core countries while it's been 20 years that your organization is there so honestly it should be pretty well consolidated by default.
A possible solution could be to have a progress bar / value increasing over time once you have most of the control points of a country, a little bit like waiting the 160 days before being able to do certain policy actions, but in the form of a progress bar that increases very slowly and basically makes the place more and more secure. Eventually you can really forget about protecting your countries unless you make a real big mistake or very rare random events to shake stuff a bit, like a major popular trend that calls for change on a whole region of the world for example, something that makes you lose consolidation in your home countries but also weakens the others in the region, giving some opportunities to reshuffle.

2. Outcomes are not actually random and every time it happens it pulls you completely out of the immersion and it feels like the game won't allow you to be creative or get lucky. If you control too many control points, you will suddenly lose some no matter what, so that you don't get ahead of everyone else. Sometimes you try to crackdown or purge some point but you roll 1% off, and that happens when you have too many points or the other has too little. This feels terribly wrong for a game like this, there is already a mechanism in the game to block overexpansion as it costs you influence, and in my opinion that's a perfectly good logic that doesn't need to manipulate the rolls to make sure the story goes like the scenario wants it to go, I would watch a movie if I wanted that, a game is defined by rules that nobody can cheat with otherwise there is no game. AoE dies the moment you write woodstock and coinage right - at least it was your own decision.
If influence alone isn't enough I think it could bind well with the solution I presented for point 1, you could invest influence points every turn at a global level to increase your consolidation value in all your countries, the more influence spent every turn the faster it will increase, with a minimum fee to just keep it level. Then if you can't spend enough influence because you control too many points and/or your influence assets were taken down by others then your consolidation decays. Maybe the decay could be much faster than building it up, which would call for good decision making on the player's part.

Then it would be nice to be able to assign your agents to continent or global tasks. Like increase popularity, focusing one country is efficient sure, but why not focus world wide efforts on social media or whatever, it would be very very slow but at least I can forget about the guy for a while and come back to him when I need to focus on something more specific. Same with continents, or group of countries selected one by one by holding shift..
What's important is that as your organization grows more and more global, your agents can be tasked to do more and more global things, I'd argue that at some point agents shouldn't be really useful anymore, they should just be managing 20 orgs and investigating/assassinating anything that moves within your territory and that's it.

I spoke about the problems but like I said the game has incredible potential and it doesn't need much to become a masterpiece, just need to pin point what exactly has to change, and what exactly mustn't change.",1665810404,1690755792,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

That said, it is obviously still in early (and very active) development, which might put some people off. The developers are also doing a superb job with outreach however, documenting development and publishing new builds on the forums, huge kudos to them for that, and stink-eye to the Uboat developers.

If you are the kind of person that wants a polished AAA title with (lol) has no bugs on release (as if that *ever* happens) you might want to wait, but if you are like me, someone who has yearned for a strategy-alien-invasion title, this will scratch that exact itch, even now. 
Double so if it is your firm belief that we should not suffer the filthy xenos to live.

The gameplay progresses through multiple phases, from covertly controlling nations on earth to gain access to resources and influence, through your first steps into space and run-ins with the alien menace, to full scale expanse-esque colonisation of the solar system (except for poor venus, no love for venus). Now the game will not hold your hand through your expansion, and decisions will have far reaching consequences, which means that you inevitably will fail again and again, having to chalk the run down to learning experience and then restarting. This might, for example, happen when you start expanding into space. Without the proper preparations you might end in a state where your whole economy fails and you are forced to start over, preparations that you might have had to start years in advance. In that sense the game is unforgiving, but ultimately, if and when you succeed, very rewarding. The tech tree can be equally confusing at first, there is no ""ultimate tech X"" that will solve all your problems, all weapons and all stardrives for example, come with benefits and problems, meaning that you need to understand when to research a certain tech, and what it should be used for.

There are a number of factions to play, ranging from the true saviors of earth and noble heroes who would like nothing more than to righteously level all xenos bases using fire and the sword as well as their hesitant and dimwitted cousins in the ""resistance"", to the filthy, treasonous surrender monkey scum who would like nothing more than sell out humanity. 
Oh there are a couple of others too: yellow bellied cowards who wants to run away, naive stargazers and money grubbing corporate overlords. All of these can be lumped into the ""useful-meat-shield"" category for the coming glorious purification of the solar system.

The first, which you have to play for the first few hours of any campaign, is an agent driven pseudo political strategy game. You play a secret agency/Illuminati type secret society to take control of nations, direct their spending and diplomacy, while upgrading your agents to protect the nations you control and trying to seize the other factions' nations. You can also investigate and try to kidnap/assassinate the other factions' agents.

That's one game, on its own that functions almost entirely independently from the other game. 

The other game is a near future space combat sim, a la Children of a Dead Earth, albeit simplified (in some regards, not in others). You construct slower than light spacecraft and manage Delta V (fuel basically), Speed, armaments, and defenses in order to maintain control over your productive assets in the solar system. These assets are bases, either orbital for ship production, supply, and research bonuses, or surface bases for mining (and also some other bonuses). Control of these assets is essential to support your space fleet.

Oh yeah and theres aliens, but they kind of ignore you until you're strong enough to face them for some reason? It's not really clear why, except that maybe they're really dumb. 

This game is weird, and its kind of frustrating that you are forced to play the spy/strategy game to get to the space strategy game. At a certain point once you've gotten control of the countries you need to support your space operations (USA, China, Russia, or Europe, ignore everything else) you can just set your agents to continuous missions or automatic missions and ignore them more or less. Alternatively if you like the agent focused game play, it is frustrating that you have to do Children of a Dead Earth Lite in order to progress the story and stay competitive. 

This game has a lot of cool stuff, but it isn't quite sure what it's trying to be and it clearly suffers for it. It is immediately apparent that they had several different ideas for what this game should be, and instead of picking one, they just threw in everything and the kitchen sink. One of the frustrating things is you can play for several hours and not really ever get into the space combat aspect in that time, so trying it out within the refund window isn't viable. That being said, if you are here for the space combat, just go play Children of a Dead Earth, it does that much better (and without weird frustratingly slow battles). If you are here for the Illuminati strategy game though, then you can try it out within the refund window and you'll know whether you like it or not.

I've played two campaigns. I did get bored and cheat through the last 3rd or so of both, but I guess I had some fun, so maybe it was worth it for me? Definitely don't buy at full price though.

I could go into looong looong descriptions for why this massive strategy game is great and what it lacks (because it does lack). And now  just like the game's scope being grandiose, here are a few words in a nutshell:

As stated, it does lack, it is not perfect but still being improved (large UI, AI, etc. patch released just this month). It is a huge project that will require your time. It can be confusing. It can be repetitive. It can feel pointless. If you don't want to spend the time, you'll feel extra frustrated. Buy if you spend the time, e.g. read the carefully and greatly composed tech unlock texts, the voice acting in them, willing to delve into spacewarfare next to managing countries with complex characteristics, you do wonder about the depth of reality of long-term country management, you might just grow fond of TerraInvixta :) And of course, this is far from mentioning all gameplay aspects e.g. solar system 4X with aliens around.

Many negative and one-sided comments I read describe only the issues without mentioning the greatness of Terra Invicta. Frustrated people complaining this is nothing like KSP or orher 4X titles. You are right, that is one of the best points. It is something new. 

Turn based-4X hybrid already being eye-catching! TerraInvicta is something new out there. A game that is slow, just like real life, as it is a massive real life simulation. What happens to Earth and humanity if aliens would crashland today? When the story starts, you get a snapshot of Earth. E.g. Russian forces invading Ukraine: what do you do about it? Take control over Russia and win, take control over Ukraine and defend, seek internstional help or bail out? Do something else or ignore? And what about global climate change? Up to you!

If you decide to try this game, know that it is long and can feel slow even. Just like in real life, there isn't a magical event every day (but here there still quite a few here). It is not a continuius adrenalin hook-up, it will not fulfil that addiction. Check Youtube, decide for yourself. If you are looking for a new experience, a grandiose journey which is more similar to life than you'd expect, go for it. Otherwise, you can always have KSP, CIV, HotS, Stellaris, which are also great titles but deliver a different experience. Or play Evil Genius 2 for a sassy experience. Terra Invicta is a different experience that well worths the money they ask for it.

It's definitely the only game out there with this level of granularity involving the concept of an alien invasion. There's a steep learning curve and the tutorial is insufficient to truly grasp what you're doing.

Pros:
- Music is good, need more of it though
- Voices are great, sound in general really well done
- UI is mostly adequate. Few things are not intuitive, such as switching between councilors with the investigate action selected or something. I think there's still some room for improvement.
- Narrative immersion is top-notch. I really feel like a shadow government defending earth from invasion.
- Little to no lag when switching between earth and space
- nukes are simple and effective
- priority system is intimidating but deceptively simple. Probably could use some more direct info on each category and it's actual purpose. For example, it's not clear what exactly Spoils is doing when you prioritize it (corrupt siphoning funds) and too many default priorities use Spoils. Room to improve.

Cons:
- Numbers need adjusting. For example: Sometimes alien councilors are too hard to kill, way too high security for what's appropriate. You just have to know you're going to need an assassin with nearly maxed out espionage to have a chance, and work on this early. More ways to reduce the threshold with your support network would be nice, similar to gathering intel. Nearby armies give a bonus but the councilors move too much to utilize them effectively. Good idea but not working well at the moment.
- Tech tree. It's really cool how many options is available to the player, but it needs some sort of tutorial advisor recommending actually useful techs and reasoning why. Fast track me to building a mining outpost or a xeno research orbital. There's no reason a new player needs a dozen different thruster or weapon techs; recommend one or two. It's too many options and not enough tools to understand what you're deciding on.
- Long campaign. Inevitably you're going to fail some major decisions while learning the game and the only real option is restarting entirely. I actually like the grand strategy timeline but it's tough to recover from huge mistakes. I'd propose some sort of smarter autosaves for big milestones: The moment you take a major power entirely, or the moment your first mining outpost became operational, or your first ship is produced; you get a checkpoint you can load like a normal save game. That way if I'm making good time on any of those major developments, I can go back to that instead of restarting entirely.
- The ship building is terrible. Needs prebuilds, not autobuild. Give me basic orbital defense units plz
- Councilors need more options to attaining missions they don't have. Orgs are great and fun but require admin. Sometimes I just wanna buy the mission I need with xp instead, or maybe they could meet milestones and grow new missions you choose between.",1690399478,1690399779,True,58,1,0.847250938415527344,0,True,False,True

But the worst part is the fatigue. There are so many details, many not interesting, and fatigue and complacency creeps in. The AI can examine and process every single detail every single turn, but eventually a human just gets tired of doing the same thing for the hundredth time. 

I can see how some people could really enjoy this, but to me it's a dull drag with a lot of interesting concepts implemented in the most boring way possible. I didn't have fun playing the game, and that's why I can't recommend it. 

If you want XCom, just play XCom. If you want realistic space combat, play Children of a Dead Earth. Slow espionage? Waiting for the Raven. More dramatic space combat? Nebulous. Nation-building? Alpha Centauri or one of the Civs. Or combine a few and get Endless Space 2.

I could - and have - gushed about this game for hours. You make your spaceships like Stellaris almost, needing to balance your modules to have the range, mobility, armor, and weapons that can fulfill their purpose. You start on earth with nothing and work your way up to fight off the aliens, fending off the other factions at the same time. Humanity fighting each other over both survival and ideological beliefs for the future is similar to Alpha Centauri. It's Grand Strategy Xcom.

Things I want:
Air forces have no representation in the game. An earlier game option to defend yourself using air power vs surface to orbit weapons would be nice. Gimme some spaceplanes.

Knowing what the subtechs do before you research the main technologies would be really good, especially for newer players. It took me a lot of runs until I figured out the techs I like to get earlier because I had to figure out the actual subtechs that benefited me.

More factions. Better inter-faction diplomacy. Some unique faction mechanics would be interesting too. There are a number of factions that can work together and not be a situation where you are picking the lesser evil. And having factions with other goals, such as having an opposite to The Initiative, or someone similar to project Exodus. A lot of discussion about this game is just about the ideologies, and I would love this game to go further with that.

More state modifiers. I love how Core Economic Regions for example effect things. Resource Regions increase inequality and pollution production in a nation but also boost it's economic growth similar to a Core Economic Region. Or how India has a unique control point that give extra faction support to its owners when you invest in Unity. I've seen some people complain about how similar the game is no matter where you start and that is true to an extent.

If you like grand strategy and a game with a lot of depth to it, this is a great game. Realistically it's easy to get started but hard to master.

As a fan of EU4, CK3, Aurora 4x I have found this title as perfect fit. Campaigns do take quite some long time and once the space conquest and battles against alien ships kick off it requires you to constantly keep an eye on the incoming fleets that are en route attacking your assets, if by this point you did not obtain supremacy over the planet by assassinating all the good hostile agents and keep positive relation to rest of factions then you'll have some real headaches due to the micromanagement required. 
I see lot of people with negative reviews complain about ""being boring to continuously reduce unrest"" - problem here I think it's misunderstood that games asks you to reduce unrest with councillors since that should be a last resort action while meanwhile you fix the reason of unrest.
In early stages develop countries while they are not in unions since their economy can build infrastructure ( MC, Military etc ) and later join countries in unions to boost research. Create huge unions and control the entire planet while systematically depriving your opposition of resources. Keep relations neutral or friendly with other factions or they will start assaulting you, as always if you start a  fight with another faction they will sabotage and disrupt your operations especially if they have good councillors they can cause real damage.
In late stages the Earth is not that relevant anymore since you will build lots of orbitals that do research in space, Earth relevance will be MC and money to support the T3 habs.
The tech race is real to keep alien invasions off.

If you are a completionist like I am, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I am a long-time paradox player, having played pretty much every type of those games out there. compared to those, this is a monster. One playthrough will take at least 100 hours (100 hours took me into 2065, and from my understanding some people consider the late game to start at 2070 or so), but could take as much as 200 hours. One playthrough. Once I start something, I feel compelled to finish it, and this screwed me hard. 

They have three gameplay loops - spy stuff with councilors, managing nations, and doing space stuff. This is in order of how much time each will take you, and also least to most fun. You'll spend hours ordering councilors to do the same tasks for hours on end, which inexplicably follows a turn system while the rest of the game is 4X. Really basically its ordering them to reduce unrest in various countries without end. Nation management is basically drawing sliders around, and ordering armies to fight wars with other factions or aliens. Incredibly boring implementation that offers no value to the game. 

Space stuff is pretty fun - the entire space system is based on real principles, and figuring out how to beat the aliens can be fun. However, you must min-max in order to do this, there are maybe two ways you can pull it off - 1) coilguns or 2) plasma. you gotta build big ships with heavy armor and slap one of those guns on it with some point defence. Use anything else and you will die. Also, defeating the initial invasion is extremely difficult, which can cause you to lose irrecoverably and destroy a 100 hour run, even on easy difficulty. You will spend maybe 10-20% of your time doing ship combat, building ships, or building bases though.

Resist the Aliens (The Resistance), Destroy the Aliens (Humanity First), Submit to the Aliens (The Servants), Appease the Aliens (The Protectorate), Cooperate with the Aliens (The Academy), Escape the Aliens (Project Exodus), or Exploit their arrival (The Initiative). You control one of these factions and fight for influence over the planet and nations and eventually space over the long timeline of this game. 

When I say this game is long, it is LONG. I've seen pro-alien games end as quick as the 2030s, and I've done anti-alien games which end in the late 2060s. God bless you if you decide to play an anti-alien faction. When you eventually piss off the Aliens they can and will wipe half your off-earth presence. Most of the gameplay is sitting staring at the Earth while stuff happens between 'turns'. I will tell you now it is very very very boring once you have a majority hold over Earth, as once you do, the other factions are game-ruined as they more than likely dont have enough of a space presence to handle themselves without Earth effectively, and thus go into a death spiral and be effectively out of the game.

So thats the early-midgame, what about the mid-lategame? Bad. The game barely changes. Eventually you are able to somewhat put up a fight with the Aliens in small numbers, and can start taking their precious ""Exotics"" which you can then put on your own ships for better performance. This is pretty much the gameplay loop once you've reached a point of ""Total War"" with the Aliens. If they come in force though? You're screwed. You effectively need to play like a twitchy homeless crack addict looking for the next person to rob to get the money for their fix. If luck wills it, you'll eventually start being able to field larger and larger fleets to where the Alien fleets stop being less of an issue and more of a nuisance. At this point you've entered the Endgame. The Endgame for anti-alien factions (also academy and initiative) is a mindnumbing few years of just sending your fleets at alien stuff until you finally get them under the threshold for you to do your final mission at their home base in one of the outer asteroids, and finally end the game.

So now after a hundred hours or more, you finally beat the aliens and secured humanity's future, if you for whatever reason want to play again and maybe have a different or better experience, you'd think ""Oh! This game was made by devs of one of the biggest mods of XCOM, Long War! The modding community in this game must be amazing!"" You'd be completely dead wrong. The modding community barely exists. The modding features of this game barely exist. Half time time mods dont even show up in the mods screen.

This review was written at like 2:30 am and im very tired but i wanted to write this so I missed a lot of stuff in here, from all the bugs and crashes, to the performance and UI, to the 20 gazillion drives that have absolutely no use besides a small handful of them. 

The game has so so so much promise, but fails to deliver on a lot of it. The only cool and fun feature I've had, is developing and consolidating Earth, which fun fact: You cannot unify the planet unless you do some very very cheesy way with the way claims and unifcation works, but even then I dont believe you can unify everything. My main fun in this game was just dividing the planet into about 8 nations for each of the continents and Oceania/Southeast Asia. The international politics are very fun in the game, albeit basic in a lot of areas.

Long story short though, if you want to buy this game, I dont recommend it. I wasted 432 hours of my life on this, don't fall for the trap that I've fallen for multiple times, and been sucked back in even more. If they actually somehow pull out this game with all the issues fixed, I will turn back around and update this review praising their work. While they have fixed some issues, there are still large core gameplay flaws that need to be addressed.

Very tentative recommend on this one. The paradox-style secret government 4x part of the game where you fight against 6 other factions with occasional alien interference over control of Earth, rocked. I loved it. I was absolutely enthralled for the first 50 hours of my campaign. If you're looking at this game for this part of it, pick this up. It's great, it will absolute satisfy you.

The problem is that that is only half of the game. The other half is an extremely detailed and unbelievably complicated space combat simulation. I can certainly applaud the devs for making such a scientifically accurate simulation rooted in real life physics and it's seriously impressive what they managed to develop here. The problem is that it is not explained at all, and is just not fun to play. Everything about the space part of the game is just completely unapproachable, there's little to no guidance for anything from building your ships, which you have to put together yourself and then find out you built completely wrong every single time, to actually fighting with them, where the most effective strategy is legitimately to just build a heavily armored wall of death that slowly advances against the enemy and just walk away from your computer until it resolves, because actually trying to control your ships when you don't know what you're doing (and you won't unless you look it up and follow videos and guides because this game explains NOTHING) you will just lose and die and generally have no fun.

I feel like this game is mostly feature complete at this point, I think there are certainly some areas that could use some QOL improvements and a few sections that feel strangely under-baked, like climate change and colonization of other worlds, but for the most part this is a finished game. And since this game is pretty much finished, this ridiculously complicated and completely unapproachable space simulation is just what the devs are going with, and unless you are just really into the  literal rocket science in play you will not understand what is going on or how to play so I would heavily caution you against picking this up if that's the part of the game you're curious about. The devs need to implement a DETAILED and THOROUGH explanation and tutorial for this section of the game, from building ships to fighting with them, because as it stands this is just half the game that is utterly anti-player.

It got to the point that I barely had anything to do on Earth but I still had to spend hours just clicking a button every 2 in game weeks.

I spent so much time in it that I felt like I should try to finish but the ultimate insult was the space combat. It is absolutely non-functional. It seemed like the whole game was building up to it and then it is just broken and agonizing. I would lose against smaller fleets as my ships would just go around and barely shoot or do anything.

The first 15 minutes is an exciting rush for world domination, but after you hit the control cap the game slows to a crawl. You must slowly colonise the solar system while avoiding the 'alien hate' mechanic, which in short means that trying to engage the aliens before you have the weapons at the very end of the tech tree will cause unbeatable reprisals. So you just don't engage them. You can snipe individual ships with suicide missile boats (in the case of assault carriers, you have to) but the overwhelming majority of the midgame is sitting and watching research meters fill up for 40 real life hours.

Once you get to the late game, if you didn't minmax your research properly you lose and start again. If you did minmax, it's fun like the early game again with a brief and exciting jolt of firework show space combat, but when winning a couple of decisive battles doesn't end the game you realise to your horror that you're expected to hunt down every loose corvette in the entire solar system.

so i went from patch 0.3.59 for one week to 0.3.99 in the other, i will be speaking mostly from the 0.3.99 patch since it fixes a lot of bugs and UI/gameplay problems.

i really enjoy the game, the politics, the space race, the fight over public opinion and managing resources/econemy. 
however it all feels like a paradox game in the making, bare bones with the minimum to make it enjoyable but once the updates/dlc come out it's going to be amazing game.
i know it's unfair to equivalate a group of modders to a large company, i was just using it as a metaphor. 

>pros:
-the concept for this game is really amazing, the space race while maintaining an good economy/diplomatic relations to build up to your faction goals.

-the space battles are awesome, the feel of having a bunch of missile ships trying to take out an alien destroyer, hoping to overload their point defence and destroy it.

-building up your economy and people is fun for those who like seeing numbers go up, like i do. nothing like making china a full democratic nation while watching usa turn into a totalitarian nation.

>cons:
-aliens do not feel threatening, sure when you kill one of their operatives they get revenge by attacking a hub/base, even on green threat, but that's really it. once i got to red threat, they attacked my habs/bases but kept running cause their defences. i just felt like once i had control over earth/luna space, the aliens just didn't do much. i was expecting some HUGE alien fleet to try and reclaim control but it never came.

-auto resolve favours the player, i tested this out, i had a fleet with twice the power and numbers of the alien fleet, in battle i commanded i lost without destroying any alien ships (did the battle 4 times and all same results), auto it and i win without any damage. so most the time after i found this out i just avoided auto resolve.

-while they did fix a lot of the UI problems, it stills has a lot more it needs to fix, it would be nice to know what techs do before you have to research them, that can be fixed quite easy if you hover over it and it tells you what they do in a pop up box.

-AI of other factions feel useless, while the 0.3.99 update made them better and smarter, they still attack nations with 1 army and watch them die, they never really felt threatening (except for the first year or two), plus how they build their nations always end up in major strife and low cohesion making them produce little to nothing.

-they are trigger happy with nukes, it blows my mind that they nuke india capital, their own land too, because i was defending myself from their war, while i had more armies ready to attack and to my shock they nuked it again leaving their main source of income in fallout and pop/econ dying off. you sure showed me ai, now enjoy your declining gpd.

>recommendations:
-a ways to see what tech do, like i said before would be nice to hover over them and see what they do before researching them.

-let us build building on earth that can help us with tech%/nation%/resources, or even a faction HQ so we can build on our main nation and it can bring buffs to that nation only. 

-more random popups in general, cause it feels like all i see is bush fires and hurricane/typhoon, maybe have more event chains that help specialise your faction or just more random pop ups. just make the world feel more alive, it's an alien invasion after all, people are ganna do dumb stuff.

-more aggressive aliens, make it so any base/hab outside of mars ring gets hunted down so we're forced to focus on the inner planets more and limited resources. 

while i have more pros/cons/recommendations these are my main points.
i really do enjoy this game and i believed if worked on, can be an amazing game but like most games these days, you gotta wait years before it reaches that point.

This is a sprawling hard sci-fi, geopolitics, 4X, espionage, space combat game which layers three distinct stages of play on top of each other, building toward an observable end state. Its scope and detail is so absurd, it never would have been given the greenlight by a major studio. It's a game that can take 20+ hours to even really get a handle on all the mechanics. It's a game that just screams ""labor of love"". It's like the dev team sat down to brainstorm and wrote out a huge list of ""you know what would be really cool"" ideas and then managed to fit 90% of them in there. Meaning you can zoom out to a minor space station built in orbit of an ice asteroid beyond Jupiter, rendered in a live simulation of the entire solar system, but you can also secretly co-opt the Swedish Life Regiment Hussars to give your secret agent a little extra punch when he launches an assault on an alien safe house in Caracas. Why? Because that's really cool.

There is literally hundreds of hours of replayability here, if you want. Not only are there tons of divergent strategies to pursue, especially early game, but the factions are not just the same team with different skins and buffs. Each faction has a totally different ultimate end goal. So a play through on the Humanity First and the Servants factions will be completely different. Devising new combinations of nations to attempt to co-opt, or resource priorities to chase after, or tech routes to follow, or ship types to build, is tons of fun. 

All in all, this game is not easy. There's a real learning curve. There are tweaks to the mechanics that still need to be made. Some people have reported issues with crashes (I've had maybe three).

They will focus on missions that protect your interests on Earth."" This fixes one of my biggest issues so thanks to the dev's. Will update shortly. ***

There are 2-3 interesting games the devs have made here but you are forced to play them all at once and it kills Terra Invicta. 

There is a counselor-based espionage simulator where you have a turn every week or 2 weeks later. Then there is a beautiful real time strategy space combat and expansion simulator.  And there is an earthside game to stop the alien spread.

In Terra Invicta your goal is to fight combat on a solar system level, leveraging industrial, military, and technological might. This is great until you are forced to stop and babysit your counselor's every two weeks. By  15 years in you have maxed your counselors, you have consolidated global empires. But you are still forced to manage 3-6 counselors doing misc tasks every two weeks. 

Every. Two. Weeks. For context that is ~300 turns by 10 years in, and in 20 years you have taken more turns than the standard 500 turn Civ 6 game. But these turns aren't managing essential functions, they are telling your counselors to continue defending CP's for the 50th time, or continue investigating aliens for the 50th time, or similar routine tasks.  

Until the devs add a way to automate counselors in the late game, Terra Invicta is not a real time strategy game, it is a slow, unfinished turn-based strategy game, and the speed gauge in the top right is a myth.

Some features I feel have great promise:
- Full simulated solar system which you can and do fight over and colonize
- A huge number of techs and options for ship building
- You can work to build up all the nations on the planet to defend against invasions while you also have to contend with several other human factions through intrigue or INCREDIBLE VIOLENCE!
- Full 3d space battles with realistic physics

However, as I pointed out many of the aspects of the game have promise, but many need a good deal of refining to really be good:
- First of all, the game barely explains many key systems like how to construct bases and ships, but this may just be due to this being early access with many mechanics subject to change
- Tied for first is the intrigue for controlling nations. I've heard plenty of people complain about this and it really is an issue; Every month is split into two mission assignment phases where you can assign your councilors to do tasks like increasing popularity of your faction, controlling nations, assassinations, purges, etc. But that means twice a month your game forces and pause and you have to assign your councilors to tasks. This ends up just being running the same few operations twice every month (though you can have assignments auto-repeat). Once you are focusing a lot on space, having to go back to earth constantly to assign some minor tasks gets frustrating. I like having a group of special leaders who can be assigned to varying tasks, but even though they can go into space most of them will be stuck on earth on public campaigns with a forced pause twice a month. Perhaps removing mission phases and/or reworking the role of councilors could address this.
-  The techs!!! There is so much potential, you have techs like global ambition, interplanetary polities, climate change mitigation which sound cool on paper and there could be so much done with them, but all global ambition does is give some control points, climate change mitigation just decrease pollution, interplanetary polities gives the independent habs project but all that does is lower your ping. I dream of unifying earth, creating new nations on other planets (and terraforming??), and reversing climate change, but many techs which could be associated with huge projects just give some uninteresting bonuses.
- The space part of the game can be frustrating: I get that we start with very limited and worse tech than the aliens, but we're so limited in what we can do for most of the game because of deltaV limitations - which can't be overcome until nearly endgame drives. I love the idea of trying to build stations around other planets to build a heavily fortified position to get around not being able to move fleets anywhere to defend places, but the aliens will usually just send a big enough fleet to win a given fight and you can't move fast enough to stop them from demanding you pay extra for using too much bandwidth. The good news is we can at least move ships in directions besides forward in space combat now. 

I can see how this game could turn into an incredible grand strategy game where the player slowly unifies parts of earth while preventing the aliens for gaining/keeping a foothold on the planet and expanding through space to eventually build whole new nations in the void that can fight each other while factions fight over them. Sadly, currently the game is more of a tech rush until you can be able to anything while you repeat the same few missions for 100 hours.

It takes dozens of hours to achieve baseline competence and then hundreds of hours to achieve actual success. I strongly recommend it, but I am going to begin by discussing the Cons.

Cons:

- Save Scrumming: Because a large portion of this game is resolved by percentile chances AND you often have mediocre odds (40-60%) AND these events can have massive long term impacts, it strongly lends itself to save scrumming (saving/reloading over and over). This is particularly true in the early game where every single action has a major long term impact. In fact, I wrote the majority of this review in bits and pieces waiting for save games to load in early 2022 as I raised my support and locked down the control points in the USA with a low-medium chance of success.

- Large Feedback Time Scale: Because this game plays out over very long periods of time, it is possible to have made a mistake that you don't realize was a mistake for several hours of real time. I had to make occasional benchmark saves for major decisions and then go back to those save files later, throwing hours and hours of gameplay in the toilet because of a mistake. That happens less and less as I get more skilled, but this is a huge time cost to a new player.

- Dense Mechanical Transparency: You often have all the data to make a decision, but no real ability to understand the data yet. While learning the game, you make a huge number of choices BLIND because you can't possibly know the importance of what you are doing yet. For example, it is extremely difficult for a new player to evaluate the relative benefits/drawbacks of different spaceship components. Even 200 hours in, I often struggle to choose. Is this engine a better choice than that engine? Or is this weapon better than that weapon? I don't know. It often takes actual USE of something to evaluate its strengths/weaknesses. And that requires paying the price of HOURS and HOURS of gameplay.

- Major Luck Impact: Luck ends up playing a huge role in the game. Often in unforeseen ways when you are unskilled and at points of multiple confluence. You can find yourself stuck without a vital councilor skill and an inability to get it over a long period of time. The wrong faction taking over India or China can throw massive chaos into a game that you have put a lot of time into developing. Random events can often damage a hab that you put several years worth of boost into putting in place. This bad luck can be managed better by a veteran player, but it is seriously harmful to a new player.

- Weak Reminders: You might get a pop-up when it happens the first time, but several important things only show up as passive reminders in the left-hand event scroll. This is easily overlooked and leads to many instances of ""damn, I wish I had noticed that 30 minutes ago"". I wish I could set my own manual reminders, such as remind me about this on a particular date or give me a pop-up every time someone puts a hab in orbit around Earth. Instead, I have to often force myself to regularly check for certain conditions manually.

- Low Difference Between Factions: The Servants are very different from the other factions, but otherwise most factions are identical mechanically. The only variation appears to be starting position (ex. Academy high starting popularity), events (both unique events and event options only open to some factions), and story/objectives. I would like to see more variation, but I guess that can be changed long term via modding and scenario design.


Pros:

- Diffuse Decision-making: The wide range of choice in strategy, varied options for national priorities, diverse mix of councilor actions/potential, random refreshing Org pool, and crossroads of 7 AI factions + the Aliens = a very rich landscape for player choice. I have spent a lot of time just thinking about what I could/should do in a particular situation. 

- Strong Customization: You can customize a large part of the game to meet your needs. 
You can customize your councilors; beyond appearance/voice with a unique mix of Orgs and capabilities. You can customize how you want each nation to develop. You can build a truly unique mix of habs and colonies around the solar system. Some of this requires being diligent and digging into the UI. For example, one thing I just realized recently after 200 hours of play was that you can set the default Priorities template when you acquire a new control point.

- Long Term Planning: This game rewards players who like to build up a long term strategy over many hours and then reap large rewards for doing so. For example, being well positioned to grab critical mining locations on Mars or Ceres can bring massive benefits. I have seen players posting their strategies online. I personally like to open Canada -> USA -> Unifying the EU. You can approach the same problem from many different angles.

- Self-Imposed Handicapping: Players can make voluntary decisions that raise the difficulty of the game without actually giving the AI a technical advantage. For example, the player could choose to limit their efforts to Latin America or Africa early on. This is much harder than opening with USA, EU, or Russia. This leads to a lot of fun player choice beyond just giving the AI advantages over humans.

- Unique Playthroughs: Because of all of the above (particularly luck), each playthrough feels like a unique experience. Sometimes achieving a particular goal is easy, sometimes it is difficult. Sometimes it is impossible and you have to find another way to solve the problem. Sometimes you get a random Org in 2022 that ends up having a massive long term impact on the game. Sometimes the AI makes a decision that really shapes the situation. This is very good and improves replayability quite a bit.


Conclusion:

Overall, I really like this game. However, there are some things that could be improved to make it easier on new players (mostly UI changes and providing more explanatory text in the tech tree).",1688492096,1688492096,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I would say that it takes time to learn & master similar to Paradox grand strategy games, learn from mistakes and failures.  The game has so many options and factors going on that it definitely doesn't feel linear in any way, forcing you to set long term goals and then having to understand when to change your short term goals and priorities as the situation dictates.

I recommend watching YouTube tutorial videos to get a better feel as to how it plays out.  If you get the game, then it may be easier to play three factions instead of the full set.  Only because it allows you to understand how  the AI (Human faction and Alien faction) act.  Just makes it a little easier to keep track of the factions and learn how to counter factions and focus a bit more in my opinion.

Dont get the game if you dont enjoy pulling up game guides of looking up concepts.  This game has so much more content than the vast majority of early access games, but for that trial and error learning you will need to google a few things (e.g. how to federate countries, how to diplomatically annex other countries, how to form the EU, etc....).  Overtime you will actually need to learn where a lot of the pertinent information is for influencing nation state politics, but then you will learn from experience.  In my case those lessons where #1 learnt to form the EU too late, which makes it easier to defend a huge economy, and that making the EU declare war on Russia will just result in Paris getting nuked.  In the process doing a lot of damage to the EU at large, and causing two of my operatives to die in the nuclear attack.  Lesson #2, if you want to lock down Europe ASAP (which really isnt hard) and then you start wondering why you cant unify EU nations even after you have developed executive control and consolidated power in EU nations, its because there is a cool-down timer at the start of the game, similar to the one which occurs after you federate two nations before you can unify them.  Lesson #3, operatives can be assigned organisations which either boost the operatives stats, your faction wide stats, or both.  The cost of them vary, but playing with combining different orgs to different operatives lets you minmax them to your play style.  If you are like me and enjoy assassinating any enemy operative of organisations which go against your vision then this is how you can make one super assassin by stacking an operative with the correct background to boost his/her stats in espionage (and intelligence).  Anytime I see an unknown enemy operative in the game, I know that they wont last long.

As long as you don't mind (or in my case enjoy) playing very intelligently made games that force you to ask why and then find out for yourself (there isnt any hand holding, which to me is a positive) then this game is for you.  The options and freedom to execute your main objectives makes me think that this one will definitely rack up playtime in the hundreds of hours in no time.  Excited to see how the devs support this game until full release.

It gives an expectation of realism but tends to break those illusions by making things that should be realistic not so and vice versa.

The game is played in real time but in turns every month, making it a very awkward experience. People can fly anywhere instantly when the turn is over instead of the real time mechanic being utilized sensibly so that flying to the other side of the globe would actually take some time. Rather than assign your people to stabilize a continent you have to reassign them every month to whichever country happens to need them the most. This frequently also leads to dumb situations where a turn is wasted because an enemy you detected flees somewhere else and an entire month is spent doing the wrong thing, whereas ""in reality"" you could probably tell your investigator do something else instead. IRL investigating a person might take a week, it might take more, stabilizing a country might take a year, or something might resolve the situation really quickly, yet they are both crammed into this weird one-month-turn based system, which would make more sense if you weren't looking at a clock that shows the seconds passing. I get that it's an abstraction of preparing for the next mission, but it still sort of seems unrealistic because of real time being a thing in the game. Additionally, instead of assigning your people who lead multiple massive organizations to keep defending interests in a set of countries, they have to be micromanaged like a bunch of fools. Imagine deciding that Central America should be stabilized and then having to tell your people which individual country they should visit that month. Imagine leading multiple countries and then losing power in one of them because you forgot to send the monthly bribe to the oligarchs. I realize it's a game, but it just seems like it panders to past turn based titles at the expense of itself. It sets up this expectation of realism in regards to time but then fails to deliver on that. You should be able to set large scale goals, decide which of your people will be doing what and then let your people take care of things, letting the game run at max speed. Over time there might pop up some events and choices like ""investigating this person is becoming very difficult, maybe we should abort"" or ""during the peace talks it became evident that the parties involved could be bribed with this much money"".

The tech tree is just horribly confusing, laggy, and big for no real reason. There must be something like 10 different propulsion technologies, at least as many armor variants and really no way to distinguish what's good from what's bad and you kind of feel like you'll never settle on any particular technology because what if something else is better. It might be realistic in some sense, but it's one of the aspects I feel shouldn't be. You should be telling your scientists ""make rockets faster"" or ""make rockets have more range, even at the expense of speed"", not entangling yourself in the interesting but pointless minutiae of propulsion tech. And I say that as somebody who loves KSP. Essentially it's complex and obscure rather than being about difficult choices like in other games. Instead of choosing ""rocket 20% faster"", ""20% more range"", or ""doesn't use fuel"", you have to essentially parse the specific impulse or w/e of each engine (which might be in a completely different column of technologies) and then maybe make a comparison, if you manage to find the tech you were looking at in the beginning. Kind of as if your scientists wouldn't be capable of doing that busywork for you. Size itself doesn't produce quality, interesting choices do, and making those choices becomes unnecessarily difficult when the options can't be found in the same place. Putting everything into categories might help here, because the search function is so slow.

There are lots of problems with keeping track of your space assets and planning new stations and colonies. Trying to find an asteroid with lots of some specific resource becomes almost impossible because there seems to be no way to sort by resources, for instance, so you end up having to click through all asteroids in the hopes of finding something worth sending a probe to.

I quit playing before anything really exciting even happened. I just can't be bothered anymore. Which is a shame because I had such high hopes for this in the beginning. It feels really good in the beginning, the scope of the game seems fantastic. Playing it the first time is somewhat interesting because you think anything must be possible, but the game kind of crumbles under its own unnecessary complexity and lack of cohesion. I don't even think it would be that difficult to fix the worst aspects of it, just make things simpler rather than convoluted. Having written all that, I might take another look at the game in the future, but right now I wouldn't spend my time or money on this title.",1688215631,1688215907,False,72,4,0.704581916332244873,8,True,False,True

This is a game about making good long term decisions. You will have momentary setbacks which will seem dire, but if your long term plan is good, you'll recover.

The good:
1. The political game of public support, unrest, nation priorities, and allocating your counselors to goals is excellent
2. The way the aliens gradually play out is fun. It was 20 hours before my faction ever even saw an alien.
3. The mechanics of sabotaging your opponents are fun.
4. Managing construction on your off world outposts is fun. It works a lot like building in the Avenger did in X-Com.
5. The research system of public research + faction projects is unique and interesting. You can railroad humanity towards a particular technological goal and share some of the benefits with everyone, you can let others choose the destination and focus your attention on concrete benefits that only you receive, or you can split the difference.

The bad:
1. The game can be obtuse
2. It's hard to learn space battles. You get ships very late and it seems like a waste to build them and blow them up early when your technology is garbage. When I wanted to seize other factions assets it was much easier to just send a counselor into space.
3. Interface oddities like you can search in the tech tree view but not in the very long list of things you can actually research now.
4. Sometimes you can end up in a holding pattern where you're waiting on research to finish and political timers to tick down. It's fine that it happens, but it's a shame the max game speed can't go higher when you get into these situations.

The problem is, in its current state the game is just not much fun... 
I reaIly, really want to like this game and gave it 155 hours of my time spread over two campaigns to see if still becomes fun at some point.

Imo, the main problem is that it is just an endless, boring grind to assign advisors to keep your controlled nations in line, stacking bonuses to grind down the tech tree and doing a hand full of (seemingly inconsequential) assigned faction goals. Besides a  few (mostly repetetive) text boxes nothing interesting, or engaging ever happens. 

Another huge problem is that failure is not really attached to any risk, besides having to grind even longer (I guess that is some form of punishment, though). If you really want something, like take over a tough control point, you can just keep throwing 10% rolls at it without any consequence. 
To draw a comparison to the excellent Long War mods of XCOM (by the same dev team and the reason why I bought this game), where you just repeating rolls was too much risk and time was an incredibly important ressource because there is a game over deadline.

The game gives you a sense that something must be brewing below the surface but after tens of hours and 10+ ingame years it gets just so boring. There is just too little consequntial interaction with the aliens to keep you enganged. Other factions are not really a threat to you either and engagement with them is minimal anyway (besides robbing the best orgs from them, which they don't seem to mind much). Everyone seems to just mostly be doing their thing.

The game apparently includes an incredible mechanic for space battles as far as I can tell from Peruns YT guides, but I never got there. And you are also not really supposed to attack aliens until midgame (tens of hours more) anyway and keep grinding until you can match them, which is tantamount to saying that using the fun part of the game is prohibited until the very late game?

To say something positive: The very early game is quite interesting where nation control is still in a flux (Before everything becomes almost static). Then at some point you are supposed to abduct an alien and it is seems more or less hard coded that aliens shoot down some of my habs, which sparked at least some interest to keep grinding. There should be way more such events and much earlier though.

And something constructive: The early, mid game part of taking over nations and bulding the council should be shortened, it becmoes boring very fast. Assigning counellors is also extermely repetitive and boring, attaching some risk to it might help thinking harder which actions to take (like XCOM LW) making it a real struggle between factions. And space battles should play a role much earlier.

HOWEVER. The initial game phase in which you gain control points over nations is, fundamentally, paper thin. You can have complete control over a nation and then a week (in game time) later you'll have been kicked out and have nothing with an almost 0% chance of getting back in. The learning curve is steep, and the game could make it a little easier to help you through that with a more in depth tutorial section. 

But basically you get trapped in a loop of TAKE CONTROL POINT, FORTIFY CONTROL POINT, HAVE YOUR CONTROL POINT ATTACKED, CONTROL POINT LOST, EXECUTIVE LOST, 0% CHANCE OF SUCCESS even with a new or very improved council member. 

The technology tree is vast but doesn't seem to have a day to day impact on your game-play. Investments are hard to afford and then can only be done every year. So it maintains a slowness that after the beautiful graphics, great ideas, eventually falls flat. 

Summary is that you spend too much time messing about with other agents than building nations, tech and ships.

The good: 
Surprisingly good democratic systems
good economy
fun space building
Cool modding community

the bad:
Did the game, really need all these screens, with no option to hide some of them?
terrible federation and unification system
countries dont actually help eachother like in rl
AI factions are awful, their motives are supposed to be super straight forward like ""kill the aliens"" or ""escape the planet"" then for somereason they invade you, the guy whos just trying to resist them. 
Nukes are unbalanced
Space combat is cool, in the off chance you can actually fly your ship there. (more on this later)
Irritating counselors, they spam you so much, and there isnt even an idle task for them. it might not seem that bad with 2, but in late game when you have 4+ its so annoying to tell them to do all their tasks again every 2 weeks,

The worst: the game is so fucking slow, its not even fun. Stellaris is faster. Ships take a ""realistic"" time to move, This is a video game, i didn't come here for ""wait 5 hours to do one thing"". 

Heres an example, made my first fleet, was feeling super confident so i sent it after an alien fleet. it was predicted it would take over 3 ingame years just to intercept over the earth. On Fast speed that takes literal hours. 

second playthrough, got fed up with slow speeds, downloaded a cheat mod so i could increase my ship speed by over 2000%. it still took over a year to get there.

Do I like it? Sure I played of lot of it because I enjoy it? Do I recommend it? No. Let me explain why.

#1 the driving force being this review is the constant crashing. I can play 10 hours without a crash and then I'll crash 4 times in the same hour. Some events with habs seem to be extremely prone to crashing.

#2 The saves loading time is ridiculous, maybe i got a potato PC but I've never seen this before in the last 2 decades, 5 mins loading is a casual estimate for me, coupled with the crashing it's extremely irritating.

#3 Althought you could say I played a lot, i haven't achieved much, maybe that's me but this game's pace is slow, glacially and not Stellaris crawled down to 1/10 speed past mid-game slow, the actual flow of the game is. It takes forever to get anywhere tech wise or space wise. 

#4 The concept is great, but the reality of it makes little sense. The Aliens for the first 20 years can smash you to bits, yet they don't. They punish and then step back. The Aliens should be weaker and grow or they should win day 1.

Now I'm unsure where this game will go, I like it, I want to like it but unless something is done about the crashes and how the Alien threat grows alongside you instead of just playing with 3-5 hands tied being it's back, I'm unsure how much fun I can still get out of this.",1686555250,1686555250,False,98,4,0.73485642671585083,0,True,False,True

Good:
1. The game's nerdiness is unmatched in the amount of detail.
2. The unique concept of playing as elites with their own agendas, rather than nations, is cool and much more plausible in real life. Nobody is ever going to unite against an existential threat, as seen in WW2.
3. Space physics is cool, game taught me (kind of) what delta-v is.

Not yet good:
1. Factions need polishing and more uniqueness. So far, gameplay is somewhat similar for all eight of them.
2. Advisor management is too repetitive. Perhaps more automation options could help.
3. Corps are just stats and resources now; they can definitely bring more to the game.
4. Space combat is not balanced; coils are just so much better than everything else. Also, I want drones, the ability to fix ships with broken drives, and better optimization.
5. Land combat could be a tad more interesting, and fleets are weird.
6. Diplomacy is almost nonexistent; you play 1x7 all the time.
7. Spoiler for mid-game [spoiler] Alien landing is a horrible mechanic. I solved it by just nuking them to dust, and they never ever tried to settle on Earth again. [/spoiler]

But because there is no way to eradicate other factions, I am constantly having ships and orbitals mutiny for no reason other than gamification. I've completely nullified the ability of the other factions to even launch into space and yet I am losing a half dozen things every mission cycle.

The option must exist to eradicate other factions or build up some kind of bonus against betrayal. Micromanaging hundreds of control points when there's only six available agents per turn is ludicrous.

I was going to post something similar about the micromanagement aspect of the game months ago, but I decided to set it aside and give it six months or so since it's early access. The six months has done some things, but it hasn't really improved the gameplay loop.

Unfortunatelly, the game has very, very, very important flaws.

I would repeat what others said, but I would point most important aspects to me:

Game is extremally unforgiving, and because (obviously) game is not reality, you need to know rules, to plan ahead, but unfortunately, you don't until you play first - you made some reasonable decisions and these seem very releavant to current situation, but at the end these are your grave (for example making a bit to much colonies, which turns aliens into devastating rage against player),

Trying to simulate real world behaviour (Earth politics), but there are actually no wars - there hasn't been a single year without war on Earth for the last 2000 years (!), so, such simulation is very far from realism,

No Earth politics what'so'ever... except, ally/enemy,

Daunting task of infinite, and repetitive actions of ones councilors - there could be much, much better implementation on that, but currently, even player has some large ""country"" (whole EU unified) for already long years... it is enough for enemy to send councilor once and you loose Control Point of that country - totally awful, unrealistic, irritating and joy breaking - I don't mind if that would happen few times in a whole game, but this is part of main focus of that game, and after few hours it is already boring and irritating,

Space ships trying to be realistic but failing to actually be realistic in full extent - bigger ships should actually have much more space - between corvette and titan, shouldn't be just few times the difference. In reality, let's take a corvette (500-1.000 t) and supercarrier (100.000 t) <- it is clearly totally different scale (1.000x), and at the same time, game tries to be very accurate with trajectory phisics, space movement, and so on (which is actually good, and I must say, probably the first time in space 4X genre that I can recall),

Some crappy constraint with Command Points - it is very unrealistic (the way it is), and it is more reasonable for such unrealistic games as Stellaris (in case of space phisics and trying to be a simulation),

Logistics!!! it doesn't exist... the military is mostly logistics, not just amount of army and its technology level - you should learn from Hearts of Iron III how for example supply troughtput was implemented there - not bad, not bad

Terrible UI for technology tree - it is really terrible - actually I had to write down what I need and want, as browsing it each time would be far to tiresome,

Organizations... come on, guys... do you really thing that Councilor who has attached Delta Force or GROM SF unit, would be of ANY real danger from kind of mediocere assasin? Ok, if it was James Bond or Jason Bourne... (let's say councilor with skill at max for assasination), I could potentially agree, but still, how you have implemented organizations usefullness is beyond any reason.

And of course UI, and reports! - when it comes to browsing whole set of countries or planets/space objects, that would be nice to have some reasonable filters, to use, define, and so on. Not even mentioning that UI itself, should use some real polish, to make it more user friendly.

This game, for the first few hours is very exciting, but to complete game you need tens or even hundred+ hours of play, and due to forementioned issues it is far from being fun, it is comparably to work (you force yourself to do stuff even you are already bored with it, just to get to the finish).",1685512737,1685547279,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

X-Com 2 with the Long War Mod (along with another 500 mods I added) is one of my favorite games of all time. Its elegant, strategic, and tactical, with plans that take weeks, months, or years to play out. Sometimes I would stop playing the game because I was in the mood to play the strategic layer but I was forced into a tactical battle. This game has an auto-resolve button if you wish to only play the strategic layer (which is amazing). But don't do that often, at least to start, because the tactical combat is beautifully and satisfyingly complicated yet clear enough that you tend to know why you lost and what tactical change and/or new equipment is needed next time. If only humanity could get its shit together and present a united front. It may be possible, but don't bet humanities survival on it...

Also, don't give up. Humanity may be panicking and squabbling over resources, the environment collapsing from global warming and nuclear exchanges, and alien ships orbiting our planet for what are increasingly clear, and ominous, reasons; but you are trying to gather the best of the best and organize the powers of the world enough to show these aliens the heights of human creativity, ingenuity, and potential. Or maybe we will just collapse and nuke ourselves into the stone age into a future so bleak that to imagine it evokes a fear in us so strong that the impulse is to make sure YOUR the one with all the nukes and you will damn well use them to protect the world from all those other CRAZY people. Or perhaps it drives you to launch yourself into the void of space, full of uncountable and horrible ways to die, and that's not factoring in the aliens...

And honestly, that's just the early game...

TLDR version: The game has numerous elements that are a lot of fun and at first glance appear very cool. It has much promise. It does not meet that promise and at this point it seems unlikely it ever will. I would not recommend purchase.
----

NON-INTUITIVE PLAY
This game is not easy to learn. It's highly complex and the in game help and guides help very little. In fact at times they create more confusion rather than assist in learning to play. Many people recommend watching the YouTube tutorials that have been put out. And many of those ARE helpful and informative. It totally addresses the issue ... if you don't mind watching literal hours of tutorial vids to learn to play this game. And I meant literal literally - actual hours of game instruction are needed to play this.


GRINDING
At first, once you eventually get some idea of what you are doing, the game is a lot of fun. It feels like a good mix of X-Com/Risk/Civ V. After a while though it becomes a repetitive slog. You send your agents in to perform identical actions over and over. So while that part of the game is very enjoyable at first, they've drawn it out WAY too long. It gets very boring and mindless intermixed with events that make the player feel like they just made a huge advancement, but then it turns out .... usually not really a big change or advance at all.


TWO GAMES THAT DON'T MESH
To quote another reviewer, there are 2 games.""they are separate experiences, they just run in parallel. It's like playing two games at the same time, and each one falls short of its promise for a different reason. -Driekan"".

The beginning of the game is about controlling a multi-national faction on Earth to compete for influence and control over countries on Earth. You use that control to develop tech (more on that in a minute) and get resources to get into space. That's when the second game starts. You get more significant quantities of resources in space that eventually allow you to build a fleet (and space bases) that can both, beat the alien fleets, and then have the ability to travel to where you need to fill your victory condition.

The space development game is against a backdrop of confusing and complex space combat against the aliens who have far better tech and far greater numbers. If you do too well it is an intended design for the aliens to come in and wipe you out with those superior forces. You are intended to 'play smart' and slip under the radar until it's too late for them. The game does not really explain this well. it just wipes you out and you have to start over (or go back to a MUCH earlier save).

Once you are in space the game play is totally different and mostly unrelated to anything happening on the Earth game. You can't just forget about Earth and focus on the space game either. You have to play both. You may enjoy Civ 5 and Call of Duty but it's unlikely you would want to play them simultaneously. 

By the way, the space game is as, or more, complex than the Earth game. Even with the tutorials there will be much that for most will never make sense. Space combat many just put on auto because it's too hard to figure out. And that's only one thing of many that have troubled/confusing implementation.


RESEARCH IS A HOT MESS
The main tie in between the two games is research. There's public and private research. The public research unlocks the private research. If you have enough influence, you control what research the Earth as a whole collaboratively pursues and eventually discovers. This public research unlocks what your faction can research privately - drives, weapons, agent capability advances, etc. You have to control the Earth so you can mostly or totally control one or all 3 of the public research efforts. To be clear there's a couple more things you need on Earth as well but research is the main one.

The research tracks are massive, confusing, and not well explained. Often you think you understand things and then later discover that what you spent a ton of time, influence, and resources researching was a massive waste. It's either of minimal use or no use at all. Engines tech is a big example of this. The game does not really make clear that there are tracks to follow - or even what those tracks are. There's chemical, fission, fusion, anti-matter, and more. Each of those have supporting tech that are either a requirement or enhancement. But it's often not clear which techs are needed, obsolete, or irrelevant to what you want to do. Even with that there are choices to fine tune what you have but it's not entirely clear what the impacts are. Weapons have this same problem.


STORY TELLING
There are rich and interesting story lines in this game but they too are not well implemented. Too much of it is lengthy tomes to slog through. If I want to read a book, I will sit down and read a book. I don't want to read a book at the same time as playing a game. Many games combine the story telling with the game and make it into a cohesive and compelling whole. They usually miss the mark on that for this game. Even though it's a good story and I want to hear it, they do it in a way I found interrupting of game play rather than enhancing it. Sort of like someone trying to tell you a good, complex story while you are trying to play a complicated game of chess.


IN CONCLUSION
I want to like this game. It has a lot of elements that are really cool! But it misses the mark entirely on combining all those elements into an enjoyable whole. It makes the game more of an exercise in frustration than something fun to play. It's still technically Early Access so theoretically this can all be fixed. It would require a massive overhaul to accomplish though so I find it unlikely and have not seen any signs of it happening. I would not recommend purchase of this game in it's current or similar state.

This is a grand strategy with some awesome hard-sci-fi timescales and challenges with aliens thrown in for good measure. This is a great mix of real-time mechanics and 'turns' for your councilors to act every few weeks. The 'turns' are all a gamble, and it's awesome when some long bets pay off and painful when a 'sure thing' fails miserably. 

This is a game where you can expect to fail in your first play-through. Don't stress over that, just embrace it and learn from your mistakes, the next time you'll have a better grasp of the complexity of the game. And absolutely do the tutorial the first time, it will help you pick up the game.

Unifying supernations is challenging and a long-term goal to balance along with expanding technology and our footprint in the solar system. 

Meaningful choices in strategy: Launch windows matter, the tech tree is complex and, unlike most games, not everything is relevant to your goals.

This is a game for a very specific subset of people. People in those groups will LOVE this game with a few polishing touches. People not in those groups are liable to bounce off. Hard.

PROs:
*Deep and engaging ""deep state"" system of spies and counterspies, directing nations and organizations from behind the scenes.
*Extensive and impactful technology tree and ship construction.
*Realistic Newtonian-based space combat (with all of the technical depth that entails).

CONs:
*The ""spy game"" requires a lot of micromanagement, and produces constant interruptions.
*The ""space game"" is (realistically) slow and requires a lot of micromanagement, and is constantly interrupted by the ""spy game.""

WARNINGS:
*This game is fairly deep. Be prepared for a deep dive. Not quite as bad as Kerbal Space Program, but you get the idea. This isn't a quick and easy 4X where you get your hand held all the way and trounce the AI without rubbing two brain cells together.

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
*Provide a toggle-able player-directed AI for the Councillors with priorities for their actions. The spy game is great, but sometimes you just want to focus on the space game and not hold your Councillor's hands. Let them shift for themselves now and again.
*Thruster technology. I can go from Chemical rockets to Antimatter drives, but I'm stuck the same basic b***h thrusters for ALL ships and ALL technology levels? This cannot stand.
*Management tools. This game needs management tools so, so bad. Combine all. Copy/paste station/base design. Refit all. Automatically return ships to their battle group (assuming it hasn't moved) after refit. Fleet templates and auto-construction. Drag and drop windows, customize window locations, or AT LEAST make them so they don't overlap.
*Tighter UI. Some parts of the UI are ridiculously huge and unwieldy (I'm looking at you ship construction).",1683675794,1683935160,True,6,0,0.55093914270401001,0,True,False,True

Basically aliens crash land on earth and then suddenly 8 undercover organizations take control of earth - why they didn't already do that before the alien crashed, I don't know, since they could obviously do so at ease.

WHY should I take over a bunch of nations WHY should I build bases in space WHY should I start ridicously amounts of research. There are no aliens and no threat to earth far as I can see.

In fact, as far as I know there are no other games quite like it. Just know that this is more of a 'scenario'-type game rather than an infinitely replayable sandbox. Once you figure out the path to victory for your faction, deviating from that path doesn't feel very rewarding. It can take quite a while before you reach that point though. 
There is a ton of content here, and while playing I never felt like any gameplay features were missing, aside from maybe some quality of life improvements. Terra Invicta plays like a finished game already, and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys playing strategy games.

This is however one of those games that seems inspired by the Dwarf Fortress ideology of disrespecting the player's time as much as possible. For instance, once you have access to the first tier of missiles, you will unlock the possibility to research about ten different types of missile, before being able to build them on your spaceships. The problem is that, especially as a new player, you really have no idea what missile you should get. The description for a particular missile type shows you a whole bunch of metrics, but it's unclear how these affect performance. In the beginning, you don't know how the developers tuned the gameplay, so you can't know how your ships perform until you see combat. It can easily take half an hour of playtime to build some ships(excluding the time it takes to get to the ability to build ships). Then they get blown up, and you wonder if you used the wrong missiles, or maybe you should use a different propulsion drive, or radiator, or power plant, etc. And you won't know for sure until you try your next design, in another 30 minutes. Then you figure out which type of missile you want and ignore all the others in any future playthroughs. 

A large part of the game is figuring out what parts of the game are irrelevant. There is also quite a bit of micromanaging going on simply due to the complexity of ruling half the solar system, but I expect that will be improved as the game goes through Early Access. If you don't mind those things, Terra Invicta offers an experience no other game comes close to, and I'm having a great time with it.",1683581580,1683581580,True,2,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,True

The early game is focused on Earth and has you playing as a shadowy organization subverting governments around the world. The concept is very exciting, and early on it is exhilirating, as you get to feel like some puppeteer pushing humanity and Earth itself into new and weird directions. Sadly, that element of the game is somewhat contradicted because  the degree of change and control that is possible is extremely limited. Several times over the course of the game you will research technologies whose impact should be as world-changing as heavier-than-air flight; containerization; or the internet. Yet they don't have that sort of impact. Actually, those status-quo-shattering technologies have no effect whatsoever. Your ability to shape Earth is also strictly limited in very arbitrary ways, and very quickly the impulse to create a different world becomes a slog of enduring turn after turn after turn of vigilance against actors who aren't really able to act against you, only to make a number tick up in a way that doesn't much change anything.

The second arc of the game has you set up space colonies, and from those make fleets of warships with which to engage in interplanetary war. This element of the game is contradicted because it makes some motions towards a degree of realism (you must calculate transfer trajectories and Delta-V costs for moving ships and fleets around, and you have to design ships with a fair degree of scientific accuracy) but then undermines that by almost completely abstracting out crucial elements such as command & control, transport, trade, supply lines and independent volition and interests of off-Earth colonies. It yields a situation that is the worst of both worlds, because it is overly complex in one hand (and a nice kind of complex, I like the science) but also overly simplistic in the other, so that presumably no one is happy with the outcome.

Those two halves of the game don't match up too well. They are completely different experiences and to a large degree they are separate experiences, they just run in parallel. It's like playing two games at the same time, and each one falls short of its promise for a different reason.

The final element is storytelling and worldbuilding. This is often front-and-center, this is a very text-heavy game and seems to model itself in Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in the way that it has sharply defined factions with very quotable leaders. This element is in contradiction because it makes all kinds of gestures towards scientific accuracy, but then completely abandons those once final information is discovered about what is happening and why. The whiplash of going from a fairly strict science-y game to going to what is essentially space fantasy is likely to break your emotional spinal cord.

Terra Invicta has, or had, a lot of potential. It comes tantalizingly close to being brilliant in multiple ways. Other reviewers have described how its UI is limited, how interactions become repetitive or pointless, how the mid and late game turns into soul-crushing slogs. None of those are irreconcilable issues, they can all be fixed, and given current trajectories, I expect they will be before the game has its final release. But these fundamental flaws seem to be baked too deep into the game's bones, such that I don't think they can or will ever be fixed. Because of those, I cannot recommend this game.

It doesn't matter who you are, this is likely to frustrate you.",1683514297,1683514297,False,163,3,0.845278382301330566,0,True,False,True

I would say that this game does not seem like a full game at first when you are just starting and that is because it is not the full game yet, this is because at first you can`t do much.
But as you take over the planet and research new technology the game opens up and then even feels like a whole different game as you move into space. 
Space combat does need some work. the UI is not good and best bet is to just give the AI control and enjoy the show.
I do hope at some point is gets a over haul.

There is merit in what some of the critical reviews say, about it being obtuse or hard to intuit or complicated to manage. This is a game for a very small niche of people who want realistic, challenging, relentless, simulationist kind of game and if you go into it expecting that, it is very very good.

The entry curve is steep as all hell, but if you're familiar with any Paradox grand strategy games it will take the edge off - I have several hundred hours across CKII, CKIII, and EUIV and although there was a jump to Terra Invicta, it meant I had a base to start from - I can imagine it might be incredibly tough to grasp for someone without that.

If you're coming from Long War, it will feel familiar in narrative and in some of the ways - which are unusual for game devs these days - that it absolutely does not care about how prepared you are or generally try to pull any punches. But if you like XCOM for the tactical battle-map combat then I'd have a second thought - you might love TI, but if you know you don't like grand strategies (or if you don't know whether or not you do) then perhaps not.

The visitors are hunted down on earth and in the sky, the glimmering trails of massive missile barrages shine bright in low earth orbit as the unknown ships are overwhelmed by sheer weight of metal before they can complete their mission, whatever that may have been.

As people on earth cheer and celebrate, the first visitor warship enters orbit. For a moment the ships and the shipyard of the Resistance fleet shine as bright as new stars, before being forever extinguished.

Interesting interconnected systems, there are incentives for both co-operating and competing with different factions depending on your factions’ goals.

The main reason is it doesn't hold your hand and throws you into the action with very little information about game machanics, so the only way to get better is either watching someone play it online or learning form your own mistakes (I had to scrap my first 2 campaigns due to mistakes I commited at the beggining.). The fact that you have to click around with little to no information of what you're doing can be often frustrating and discouraging.
   But when you get a grasp of the mechanics or ignore the fact that you don't understand some/most of them (Which is exactly what I did.) Terra Invicta becomes a very pleasant game. The strategya spect is challenging but fun to get into, the graphics are amazing, I could just sit and watch my stations and ships for hours (This game definitely needs a photo mode.) and the space economy thing is also really engaging.
   Summing up: if you don't have the time or patience to learn the mechanics, or just don't like very complicated games in general then Terra Invicta is not a game for you.

As is, it is only playable for people who are hard-core gamers who are either geniuses or that have a lot of time on their hands.  The differences in difficulty levels is lacking between normal and cinematic. 

 I got decently far in normal difficulty and really learned the dynamics of the game with all of the up to date spreadsheets of shipbuilding dynamics and researched successful strategies.  I got frustrated and quit for a month.. but now I just started a new game on cinematic.  And now I'm already frustrated by the alien expansion rate. It's supposed to be an easier difficulty but the aliens are expanding even faster that any of my previous normal games.  

The biggest issue with the game is the amount of time the it requires to advance is ridiculous bc it seems you have to constantly go back through your saves to make not get crushed.  That's understandable for a higher difficulty but that's pushing it for easy to normal.

The gameplay is exciting in the beginning and stalls eventually due to micromanagement and due to managing a constantly growing amount of assets.
The current UI is not suitable to handle the information and assets presented due to a lack of overviews, optimized workflows and automation.

Pros:
...which means the catharsis high when you finally get the antimatter/fusion torches and [i]they[/i] are the ones trying to run and discovering [i]there is no escape[/i] is equally long and intensely satisfying.
Surprising degree of realism, like how the immediate response to an alien invasion is for humans to start shooting at each other over the best way to fight back. Oh and the tech is mostly accurate to IRL design concepts (s/o Project Rho) too, I guess.
The geopolitics layer is already flush with ways to build the future you want to see. Plunder the wealth out of Europe and put it back in the colonies it came from. Dissolve America, or reawaken Manifest Destiny stronger than before. Or maybe just pillage the whole rock down to buy a ticket to Alpha Centauri and give this whole ""civilization"" thing another go.

Lategame player vs. human fights will make your first few times getting wrecked by aliens look downright fair.
The aliens are only really better in that they don't have a tech tree to screw up. In between the occasional wave of actually-dangerous full battlefleets they will feed the great majority of their fleet and resources into battleground orbits one corvette at a time, each one being the same as the last corvette that died accomplishing nothing more than wasting your time, giving the first half of the final ""total war"" phase of the game a degree of mindless tedium.

However, so far it is the kind of ""Early Access"" game that is actually being actively developed and not merely using the label as an excuse. The ""Corvette Conga"" above is apparently mostly due to a bug that will be fixed next patch, along with a host of UI improvements around the space game.

You have several overlapping gameplay systems each with enough details to *almost* be their own sub-game. For example, you have to manage your counsellors to manipulate global politics by bringing countries under your control or disrupting your rivals' countries. You can specialise your counsellors into different skills, and assign them organisations which boost their stats and unlock certain missions for them. Once you start getting countries to support your faction then you have to set their priorities such as economy, military spending, research/education, space defences, rocket launching capacity etc. Later in the game you also get access to off-world habitats/colonies and resource production, which is mainly used for further habitat expansion and ship construction. Ontop of all this, you also must design ships, position your fleets to protect your assets/attack the aliens, and fight space battles where you actually get to maneuver your ships in 3D.

Luckily, each of these gameplay elements only become relevant at certain points later in the game, so you are gradually introduced to them and aren't too overwhelemed. Although it's still quite challenging to learn, especially with the sheer amount of options that are available.

The game is very feature complete for an early access game, but two of the main issues right now are balance and micromanagement. (albeit the newer patches may have improved this, I haven't played in a few months). Despite one of the appeals of the game being so many different gameplay systems, it can become somewhat tedious to manage them all when you want to focus in on one specific element. 

Another main issue is balance. Although there are lots of options, there are only a few 'good' options, especially when it comes to the tech tree, country management, and ship design. There are also some parts of the game that can be cheesed a little too much. For example, if you get a very highly skilled espionage agent, you can assassinate all of your rival faction's good agents. If you can assassinate all of your rival's good espionage agents, all your agents become basically untouchable and you can permanently cripple a faction. Someone else's review summarised it very nicely: ""Hard to learn, easy to master"". Once you figure out what the good options are and where the AI's blindspots are you can cheese the game, which isn't very fun as it ruins the hard sci-fi semi-realistic feel of the game. 

Nevertheless, the game is early access and these are problems that are actively being worked on. So I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a highly complex and multi-layered grand strategy game. However the game is quite complex and requires some willpower to learn its intricate systems, so I would only recommend this to people who are already comfortable with the grand strategy genre.",1667147840,1681267666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The mythical ""near future grand strategy game"" that nobody ever dared to make, a game where orbital mechanics actually matter, a game where you fight for humanity's survival against an invasion by aliens whose technology is light-years beyond us, as you desperately assemble a fleet of scrap heaps carrying nuclear missiles in the hope you can ram them all down the throat of that assault carrier before it lands.

The bad: while it is a complete enough game to have a lot of fun with, the latter half of the game is more or less unfinished. While all the core mechanics are there, from the tech tree to the combat, the AI is very weak and once you manage to take control of Earth orbit, the seams of the game really start to show. And there's still bugs up the wazoo. And the balance is dubious at best.

But there is so much promise here. It scratches an itch no other grand strategy game has even attempted to scratch, and the efficiency with which the devs have been squashing bugs, improving the game, and working on AI/balance issues is incredible (not to mention their extremely positive and active engagement with the community -- I've literally seen them fix peoples' broken save files and send them back to them!).

The setting, the story concepts, these are excellent and really captivating. Unfortunately they are delivered in the most ponderous, ambiguous, confusing way possible.

From the very beginning you are facing an uphill battle against an aggressively unfriendly UI, that has all kinds of iconography that even with tooltips do not readily explain what your actions will directly result in. Meanwhile you are deeply under resourced playing whack a mole against other factions who are effectively your opponents while the big bad is running around making everything worse. Side note: for some inexplicable reason the whole solar system is in 3d which makes finding anything a total pain. A flat map would have been an improvement.

Let’s assume you manage to get earth mostly on track and handled, space is even worse. I’ve spent 40+ hours and I’ve finished one game, one. That one game felt like a job. I had to micromanage my councilors constantly to keep everything under control, meanwhile my space assets were constantly under threat by the aliens. That wouldn’t be a problem but the game doesn’t give you any tools to manage it. Everything is “realistic” so fuel isn’t listed as fuel it is “delta v” so when you run out of gas your fleet is stuck wherever. There isn’t a clear “resupply ship” functionality, so ships just run out of ammo then need to fly all the way back to a station to rearm.
Fleets don’t have any standard patrol or defense postures so you need to babysit every fleet and individually manage every combat interaction.
Some weapons are useless and others incredibly powerful.
The game leans hard on the “hard sci fi” elements and falls right into the “no longer fun” trap. It’s a job but doesn’t give you the tools to manage the scope of the problem. Everything in the space portion is tedious and deeply dissatisfying. What’s worse is trying to control your ships on the tactical map, because of course there is a tactical map.

Unifications on earth are tedious and time consuming, building any space assets or ships is the same. The game take absolutely ages because it artificially limits speed and progress. In fact all diplomatic actions take a massive amount of time and the AI can ruin your plans just by getting a control point and changing diplomatic relations for quite some time. Totally nonsensical.

I wish I could make a good suggestion but I don’t have one. If you speed things up all you have are multiple other factions doing the same. The player faction doesn’t have the tools to deal with the problem organizationally or mechanically. There is a ship builder but a small fraction of the tech unlocked is worthwhile, resulting in technological dead-ends.

They have trapped themselves in a situation where every effective strategy has been nerfed and winning at all is brutally hard and deeply unsatisfying.

When the demo during the next fest was released last year in Summer I was instantly hooked. The game was so complex and detailed for A DEMO and had almost everything I was looking for. Granted, I would have preferred something more broad and hopefully maybe there'd even be DLC that would take the fight to the Alien's home wherever that may be, since it's clear in the game that the Aliens are [spoiler]basically self-indulged xenophobes because of another alien race subjugating them they now believe making sure other sentient life is either contained, neutered, or exterminated.[/spoiler] So it'd be really nice to be able to put a stop to it.

While the game is complex, it is in no way hard to learn, it just takes time. If you are unfamiliar with games like this you may find it difficult at first and may lose a few times but keep on at it.

Terra Invicta is an amazing game for someone like me. I love science fiction and strategy games, I have plenty of time to spend how I want, and I enjoy complex challenges. This game will undoubtedly entertain me for years to come. Amazing purchase. 

But right now, in early access, this game is very hard to recommend to anyone else. 
 
- Very little respect for your time. A 'learning' campaign, where you are exposed to every mechanic, learn the general flow of the game, and come to understand how to play *well*, could easily take over 100 hours. That's to learn the game. I would not purchase this if you have only a few hours every week to play. 

- The technologies in the game (tech tree) are imposing, to say the least. A bewildering variety of global and faction technologies, blending real and sci-fi jargon, all supporting an obscene amount of customization over your spaceship designs. The crown jewel of confusion is the spaceship drive technologies, which are understandable to me only because I happen to frequent a website partly devoted to discussing real and imagined drives. Another confusing thing is the lack of concrete explanation about the space battles. So you have a crazy amount of choice how to build ships, but the game does not take the time to explain the underlying mechanics of the battles you fight with them. 

and less important

- Poor to Bad UI. This noticeably improved over the time I played though, the devs are working on this. Not really a complaint, but something to think about right now. 

- In a full solar system campaign with all the factions, starting in the mid-game the solar system is going to get very busy. This is tough on your computer processor and your human processor. Our brains are not meant to keep fleet transfers organized by date of intercept and threat, and the game doesn't do that for you. When you load a mid-game save, you often have to spend a couple minutes investigating what the timeline for the next few months is again. 


Things I loved

+ Once you understand how to control ships, use your weapons properly, and manage your delta-v zooming around Sol, the space combat is.... very satisfying. The AI will probably get better as the devs continue working, but right now there's a skill sweet spot with ships that can maintain thrusts of 1-4 g. A small number of medium ships ( I use destroyers ) can either kill or mission kill much larger enemy forces. I wouldn't try to take the Jovian system in 2045 with destroyers, but there's no reason that mothership heading to Earth should go un-harassed. 

+ Beating these aliens let me work out some stress from thinking about the Tri-solarians. I am not a bug. LIke objectively I know The Three Body Problem is not real, but I'm still angry.  

+ The political/covert aspect of the game is already solid, but I feel like it could become excellent if they polish it more. Let us co-opt the U.N. and unify the planet you cowards.

The game becomes more obviously unfinished if you look at some aspects, but overall the Earth game is well-designed and quite fun. There is a steady rhythm to taking over countries, upgrading your councillors, investing into knowledge points. The AI is also good at providing counterplay to your moves on Earth. It's hardly a puppetmaster but it will keep you engaged. 

Wish I could say the same for the space layer. I like the 3d models of ships, the variety of modules and engines and weapons, but on the whole most of the things you unlock - especially early on - are useless against alien ships. There is a steep difficulty curve between killing your first alien vessel and killing a full-on alien fleet. 

I gather this is because the human AI is meant to introduce you to space combat and be your main enemy in the early parts of the game (2020-2035?), but right now (3/31/2023) it's so incompetent at managing its space assets that it presents no obstacle to you. Most of its bases (when I seize them) can be taken effortlessly and are arranged in a haphazard, inexplicable way. No human fleet has ever attacked my stations or bases in any campaign so far. 

Alien fleets will repeatedly attack a small base with a defense module, appear to give up, then just try again a couple of days later again and again until I throw up my hands in annoyance and let them have the station. There is no rhythm to space as with the Earth layer, all in all. 

Note that I haven't finished the game as any faction (furthest I made it is the mid-2040s) but my review is positive because none of this detracts that much from the game; the core experience has a pleasing rhythm to it once you've figured it out. Everyone on the Discord swears by different strategies for dealing with alien vessels (which I take to be a good sign, that the game lets you be flexible.)

The game is very involved and will suck up a lot of your time (in a good way).  My biggest gripe is all the micromanaging.  Like defending your interests when you have maybe 5 points in a country to defend.  It eats up your counselor's time for 5 game cycles.  I like that you can ""get too big for your britches"" if you try to take over too much land.  I find myself getting too bogged down in the micromanaging aspect of the game.  Despite all of this, it has great potential.  In future builds I would like to see less micromanaging (defending your interests, publicity campaign, advising).  Not totally get rid of micromanaging but have the defending interests last longer would be a nice start.  Also the tech tree is VERY large.  I tried to get covert operations but I'm locked out now that another faction developed it first.  To me this isn't very realistic and it is preventing me from getting another counselor.  I would also like to see you able to control turned counselors after a while.  

I like that you can set the policy direction for your country and the ability to control the solar system is great.  The technologies you can develop are awesome too.  I like that one of my counselors is like Agent 47 from the Hitman game series.  This guy is awesome, he can purge, control a point in a country, steal and sabotage projects, and assassinate other counselors.  In one of my games North and South Korea reunited under one country so that was awesome.  The European Union is freaking huge in my game too.  These aspects are fascinating and stoke the imagination.  I was going to try and merge Canada, USA, and Mexico into one large nation but I couldn't develop that project...

There is genuinely nothing out there that reaches this level of graphical fidelity and visible mechanical complexity. Distant Worlds is the only close comparison I could make for the level of system complexity. Stellaris gets close through quantity of systems, but its complexity is pressed thin for the sake of accessibility and graphical fidelity -- which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

However, the systems in this game are paradoxically not structured to last more than a hundred hours of gameplay. By around 20 years of game-time (80 hours, or so?), everything feels like it grinds to a halt; the player can't get a good stronghold in defending Earth from the Alien threat because there just aren't enough good options at that stage for spaceship weapons and equipment, the available resources are too thin to push Earth into greater prosperity, and Councillors flip-flop between having nothing to do and too much to do. I'm either dropping nukes on [SPOILERS] or watching Earth spin waiting for research to finish, with almost no in-between. There's no 'casual jog' of mental effort, its either sprint or walk. 

The other most major problem is the other factions AI. The player will likely be the most major threat to the Aliens through the game, with the other factions basically being the worlds most recurring speedbump. There is no overt or covert cooperation once the player edges out ahead in the invisible scoreboard; once you're the leader, you're the target, and you probably will persist like that forever because the AI is not capable of the same level of decision making as a player. there's more to it, but the tl;dr version is the AI isn't as capable so its best to leave it there.

The UIX is not good. It's not the worst, but there is a level of inaccessibility to the interface and its pretty severe. To keep it simple, you get used to it.

Finally, the real time ship combat. It is certainly a system that exists. Frankly, if it winds up as a cut feature in 6 months I wouldn't be surprised. Ships display out their flightpath, with nodes the player controls, and there are buttons to cycle through different behaviours for the ship systems. It does not control like a real-time strategy game, like Homeworld, this system is more like trying to make an Excel chart fight in a 3D space. It is honestly a nightmare trying to figure out how to perform the most basic flight movement to the point I don't even bother -- I mark a primary fleet target, tell the ships to point the nose at that target, and otherwise leave ship control to the ship's AI. It's not a system I'm interested in learning because it is not a good system. It comes across as the least-completed feature in the game.

In terms of other games out there, Terra Invicta stands out from the crowd as a visually pleasing grand-strategy game that is also mechanically deep, which speaks volumes to the quality at play. But its marred by RNG driven systems, mostly-finished features, and not-smart AI. There is nothing really out there at the moment that captures what Terra Invicta can, but it needs more time to finish and be an easy recommend. I can't say confidently I'd recommend it to a stranger because its very challenging to learn, and the gameplay loop stops being interesting right in the 'mid-point' of the design structure, which could be a hundred hours in, and could create a very poor reputation for the game. 
I like it, but I can't recommend it. It needs more time.

EDIT: After a couple patches (and way more hours than I'm happy spending on it), its... still the same problems. The gameplay loop bogs down and quite frankly kind of wastes the player's time. Even modding some areas to speed up things, the gameplay loop drags on for no real reason; I can understand having unfolding depth of mechanics, but there is no further depth to explore after over a hundred hours.
The user experience is still pretty poor with a lot of poorly-explained statistics and mechanics. The Alien hate 
 or aggro system is not adequately conveyed to the player in terms of the consequences of expanding too early. 
The space combat, though it has improved marginally, is still an extremely rudimentary and frankly frustrating mechanic to play with. The pre-combat fight interface has a poor decision structure for when the player actually needs to set the fleet's formation, and the default formation is going to wind up wiping your fleet when you miss the un-intuitive step to choose the formation before the engagement is even confirmed to occur. 
Once in the simulation, ships are controlled through vector markers that are overly precise and finicky with no actual waypoint structure, the entire interface is clunky with single ship and group properties not labelled at all nor is it communicated that the player could even give group commands. It is not intuitive to move the camera around with zoom controls overlapping movement controls. 
The UI for weapon arcs are displayed in a totally-unhelpful blue overlay on top of the blue background in the blue UI so its impossible to tell where the firing arc is or isn't. 
Ship's only have 1 thruster so there is no lateral control with something like reaction control thrusters -- which I am surprised are not present considering the Space Shuttle of all things even had them. The vector marker requires at least 4 keys to modify in different axes (up/down, left/right, prograde/retrograde, and rotation) -- this has unintentionally implemented the meme of 6 pedals with only 4 directions, except there are 6 directions and upwards of 12 ways to modify a ship's heading, and none of this information is marked out against points of reference in the battlegrid so it is blind motion in a blue void.
Combined with the unclear mechanics of the Aliens to begin with this is creating a deadly trap for newcomers to TI that can only lead to negative publicity as people get 20, 40 hours in and give up due to the Aliens wiping out their stations and fleets, or getting a bunch of very poor results on missions, or they get into the fleet fight simulator and just walk away because it is honestly not complete nor polished enough to expect someone wanting to try a different experience to put in the effort to learn.

TI really needed to improve a lot more than it has in nearly the year since it has had public access. I won't say I'm hopeful, but the Discord is still fairly active on the dev-side and they are squashing major issues. However, the actual game needs to be playable in all areas for a lot of people too or its going to run out of early-adopter popularity and drop dead by release like most Early Access titles have been doing for years now. I'm strongly not recommending Terra Invicta, not until the UIX improves and the combat simulator actually resembles a finished mechanic.",1665974931,1679549896,False,266,7,0.861879527568817139,10,True,False,True

The biggest positive: there's a lot to do.

The biggest negative: there's a *lot* to do.

Starting out there's are a great deal to get your head around. I'd watched a few videos, but I still found it overwhelming, and it took a long time to work out what I should be doing. And a lot of it is fiddly, needing to pick actions for your councillors every two weeks. By the time I worked out what to research, how to fix countries, what space assets to build, and so on, I was well behind the curve> Consequently I spent most of the game playing catch-up before realising my position was utterly lost.

That's the other side of ""there's a lot to do"". It takes time. In my case I spent 99.9 hours, and this was my first game. I'm sure if I'd restarted I could get to a winning position in much less time, but I kept falling for the sunk-cost fallacy (""I've already invested 40/50/60/70/80/90 hours into this game, and i think I can still turn this around with a few more hours"").

Finally, at around the 97 hour mark, I gave up, loaded up the Cheat Mod, created a small flee of super ships, and spent a few hours blowing the biggest alien fleets to bits.

If you are looking for a mix of Master of Orion, Europa Universalis, and Nebulous: Fleet Command, and have a great deal of time for gaming, it's fantastic. I'm glad I played it, but I'm not sure if I'll come back to it for a second play unless the gameplay is streamlined.

If you're anticipating a Paradox-esque 4x title where the early game builds into later stages within just a few RL hours of meta-building, you may be disappointed (at best) or bored (at worst). 

There are many layers present. From simply getting your faction established (with a global power base) to the mid game counselor war/tech build to the end-game strategic/tactical solar system space gameplay, be prepared for multiple play-throughs and many invested hours PER run.

With this is mind I can't recommend this title enough. I enjoy the dev willingness to trade 4x snowballing for a bit of grind, of incremental advances. The premise that humankind starts off as the proverbial tortoise against a much faster hare (or rabbit) opponent really appeals and scratches a rather specific niche itch in a supremely satisfying way.

A couple of notes- I would like to see some more customization options for planetary colonies. It's a bit of a contrast between the dynamic and chaotic Earth and the passive, flat bases on other worlds. Also, it would be great to have a system where we can refuel ships close to our bases. It makes sense that poor planning can strand a fleet in the depths of enemy territory, but its a little jarring when there's no way to refuel when a fleet is stranded just a few hundred meters from a base.

After about 40 hours, someone is discovering the needed technologies to really start building potential fleets around Earth or Mars.  Small changes in the AI could vastly change how someone plays the game.  Someone who made some mistakes could be game over at around 40 hours given he wasn't prepared for it.  The changes in the AI may have been good changes, and needed.  Still, the game is a major time commitment.

For one, what probably every other negative review said: The game is very, very slow. In fact it is so slow that it takes probably around 100 hours to complete one game (not counting resets). It's not however so long because of the large amount of content you are doing but because for probably half of this time you spend waiting for something to happen.
The mix of real-time strategy and turn based strategy makes the game rather tedious and boring for most of the time.

Something that also bothered me personally is the writing. All faction leaders are written rather one-dimensional, each acting like a stereotype of their respective faction. You got a mandatory good guy 'resistance' faction, obligatory evil scheming supercapitalist faction, collaborating with aliens faction, etc.
Certain factions are extremely similar. There is Resistance and Humanity First, both wanting to defeat the aliens, the only difference is that R is like a hollywood good guy fighting aliens faction versus HF kill every alien or collaborator on sight and 'you can't make an omelette without breaking few eggs' mindset.
There's also Servants which wants to serve aliens like a bizarre religious cult and Protectorate which wants to surrender to aliens Wallace Breen style.
In both of these cases I really struggle to find a reason why these factions aren't just merged into one anti-alien faction and one pro-alien faction, the differences are really minimal except that Protectorate is really crippled gameplay wise because aliens often sabotage you to support the other pro-alien faction instead.

Amateur writing is also very noticeable in certain missions, story segments and flavor texts. Example: Leader of the 'Smart' faction talks in flavor tex: ""Consider Mansa Musa, Mali's greatest emperor and perhaps history's wealthiest man. His African kingdom spanned over a million square kilometers, yet he achieved this not through conquest, but by bringing about a golden age of knowledge, construction, and culture."" which is quite comical as historically Mansa Musa bragged in Cairo during his famous hajj about all the cities and areas he conquered.

Some good things about the game:
- Amazing soundtrack made by Breakdown Epiphanies
- Very complex and detailed
- Quite realistic space travel and combat
- Decent graphics
- Potentially gives hundreds of hours of gameplay

Game has a good potential but it has its problems. So far however the devs seem to be focused only on balance rather than adding content. If you check the patch notes, it usually consists of almost master thesis length list of insignificant balance tweaks without any actual content being added. 
I am aware that at this point of development it is rather unlikely for the game to be changed significantly, but it does seem to me from that the game is basically finished and except one new starting date scenario mentioned to be added in the future, the only thing that devs wants to change about the game is some numbers which is rather disappointing.",1678970987,1678970987,False,6,1,0.550107479095458984,0,True,False,True

It really combines several games in one - in a good way. It's really difficult to describe it more without spoiling parts that should be discovered by each player on their own, but: 
* There is a spy game
* There is a strategy game

* Late game is playable, but lacks refinement. It won't be a big problem for your first playthrough.
* Some areas of the game are still getting polish

With that said, the game is fully playable and until late game there are no notable issues.
The devs are actively working with the community to address the most annoying issues, and are also improving the game balance, AI and late game.

I tried to like this game. Hard. I have never been so excited about the idea behind a game. I check the patch notes nearly every day to see if they fixed some of the annoying things. But the experience has not improved much since I tried the game for the first time a few months ago.

The devs made a fantastic game but forgot to make it fun. You are drowned in micro management, a horrible UI, and a large amount of clicks required for basic actions.

The devs are the creators of the popular Long War Mods for XCOM. XCOM had an amazing UI. It seems to me the Devs thought, hey, lets make the most complex strategy game ever made. But they forgot they also need a UI to handle such a complex game. In XCOM they were provided with it, so maybe they never appreciated the importance of it. I would understand, I didnt realize it either until playing Terra Invicta.

Someone posted on their forum what the typical actions are that are required to intercept a small enemy fleet. I would like to copy paste that here, as it sums up well the experience of the gameplay very well:

get notification that 1/2 corvette fleet is in Callisto orbit

Select 1st fleet

click transfer

click enemy fleet

click confirm

Select 2nd fleet

click transfer

enemy fleet

confirm

wait

maybe they don't get there in time and a module gets destroyed

get popup

select engage

enemy fleet runs away

get popup

select high wall

select engage

enemy fleet cannot run away

gamble with autoresolve or fight easy battle and kill enemy

order fleet back to station (if I don't it will be attacked despite my fleet being right next to it)

Wait 2 days

Repeat the entire loop


This is a very typical part of the gameplay. No thinking is required, just repeating the same actions over and over the whole game long. The early game was fun, when you are learning about the mechanics. But after a while, the game feels shallow. 10% of my time is spent on figuring out the complex grand strategy elements of the game, 90% is spent on menial tasks like above. Its just not fun. Its like instead of playing a grand strategy game you got a factory worker job that just repeats the same actions over and over for 100 hours. 

Another example is producing ships for your fleets. You have to manually assign a new ship to produce to a ship yard. Then when a ship is finished producing, it needs you multiple clicks to send the ship to the orbit of your fleet. Then unpause the game, wait until it finishes transferring to the right orbit. Pause again, then select the fleet to merge the new ship into it. You also have to remember the name of the ship cause the UI makes it difficult to know which are the right ships to merge, so often time I find myself doing multiple clicks back and forth to select the right ship. Thats what you have to do for EVERY SINGLE SHIP you produce. Its slightly faster if you produce in the same orbit as your fleet is, but even then its annoying as every single ship needs to be individually merged with your fleet. There is no simple merge all fleets / ships button like in stellaris, or automatically reinforcing fleets. Every single ship you produce requires you to do clicks to assign it to a fleet.

Thats again just one example of the amounts of micro the game requires. The game is full of examples like that.

Most of the annoying parts of the UI and micro management could be fixed with enough focus from the developers. Most of the annoying parts drive me particularly nuts cause you can immediately think of some ways to fix this issue to 90%.

Its a shame that I have to complain so much about the game, cause the premise and idea behind it is amazing. Just the UI makes it horrible to play. 

The devs are also very very responsive. I posted bugs to their discord channel a few times and they were fixed within hours! I guess the UI just wasnt in their priorities when designing the mechanics of the game. Now its tough to make the UI handle the complex mechanics.

I hope that maybe in a year or two, this will be a game thats fun to play. It has a lot of promise. Right now it gets annoying to play fast. Especially cause I want to finish my campaign, but would have to drag myself through a click grind fest for dozens of hours to do it.

Do you really need many a hundred of distinct drives with marginal differences? It might be interesting if there were any trade being made, but in practice these things are irrelevant.

The game runs on a decades, perhaps 50-60 year period for very-long games, yet turns are two weeks (or technically twice a month), and you have to let the game tick, minute by minute, watching the Sun set (or is it the Earth that is moving?). The game couldn't decide if it was a turn-based experience or an RTS, so it went for both.

Councilors are your primary game pieces. They acquire resources for your faction. Resources get you into space, space gets you habs, stations, and ships, and these get you the ability to fight the aliens (or not fight them). The game is essentially the acquisition and management of resources. Eventually you marshal them at some objective, but that's largely irrelevant. The primary game is take stuff to take more stuff, and kill other stuff-takers. But the way you take stuff in the first phase is actually quite obtuse.

The game sort of refuses to tell you how to play it, but broadly you're trying to acquire territory which grants key resources so you can get to space and fight the aliens very, very slowly so as not to disturb them too much.

You don't play as a nation. Nations are territory, more like a garden or a piece of farmland. You have to cultivate it to extract resources from it.

Nations have priorities, which you as the controlling faction can set. This is all rather convoluted however. It's not like you can just take land and it gives you resources in a clear way. Sliders would go a long way here to communicating what's really going on but you get pips and have to do a lot of clicking. You allocate the nation's resources to several dimensions of its growth, and one dimension of its pillaging (spoils), typically you don't want to do this, unless you plan on torpedoing the nation intentionally. The dimensions of the nations that matter tend to be in some kind of tension with one another intentionally, so making everything good is usually not an option. You're not there to run the perfect state, your'e there to fight the aliens (or work for the aliens) so don't sweat it too much. Nations exist to generate resources for your faction, and for no other reason.

The nation generates ""points"" on a daily basis and these give modifiers which slowly build into some kind of resource. Research, Money, Armies, Boost, Mission Control, and Nukes.

The earth-resource game distills to these steps, acquire a large nation, the US, Russia, China, India, etc, and some medium and small nations that might congeal into a superstate later through technology. Cultivate these nations to produce boost, mission controls, money, and research. You'll want at least one nation with good armies. US has the best army at the start, but any top-tier nation can field fantastic armies with the correct investment. There are a few nations in the former USSR that have very high boost that stand out for the early game.

Boost is the limiting reagent of the campaign. You need enough of it to get into space, where the full game experience properly starts. The space resource game is actually quite simple however. Sites contain resources. You mine resources. Resources go into a magical ""space resource"" pool. You build ships, ships blow up aliens.

The primary issue I have with the game is there are so very many traps. 90% of the research is a waste. There might be a mod already to remove all the cruft. It's great flavor don't get me wrong. But in terms of the things you need to succeed in the game; most of it is very simple and unnecessary.

The objectives are largely irrelevant. The player faction doesn't get much for doing the objectives. Maybe a special org that has some marginal utility and some tech unlocks here and there. But councilor stats can't go above 25 for any reason, and otherwise the game distills to resource acquisition, and this is a winner-take-all kind of game.

I love the thematic quality of the game. The world itself feels awesome, but there's so many things to do that don't matter that could be removed or simplified for the sake of fun without harming the games sense of complexity. All the game really needs to do is present meaningful trade-offs to the players. But that can only happen when the player understands what they're actually trading.

Practically speaking, there's a mechanically correct way to play the game that's far more effective than the sandbox experience the game is built for. That experience is totally there, but you're on the clock. The aliens are coming and you need to be ready. There are a lot of failure and stalemate conditions that are not clear to the player until years later.

Be careful fighting the aliens too early though. They tend to leave you alone until they stop leaving you alone, then they'll never stop and you're locked in a stalemate. This will probably be your first game. Once you learn what you're supposed to do, which the game keeps well-hidden from the player at first, the game becomes a lot more playable and fun.

There are parts of this game that are beyond boring, especially the middle-game. There's just a lot of waiting, and small miscalculations or misunderstandings of mechanics can cause a lot of headaches and tedium. I suppose it's all learning a new game with a lot of potential, but still, very frustrating in the moment. A new game is an investment. I spent over 30 hours on my first playthrough only to have a stalemate condition where I couldn't get back into space. Felt bad, but I did have fun.

Overall, fun game, lot of potential. But damn this game cannot get out of its own way with all the little irrelevant bullshit.",1677725414,1677725414,True,22,0,0.728433966636657715,0,True,False,True

The game had some of the best potential, but by forcing us to play as 1 of the NWO and Illuminati type groups it forces us to make decisions we would never make. Why is it that only these shadow groups are capable of fighting the aliens? Are you telling me that the USA would not be dealing with the infestations themselves?
This game would be 100% better if they would make you play as a NATION rather than as a puppet master. 

You could still have the shadow groups, have them be allegiances that can be made public to gain support to cripple an opponent. For example: USA President is exposed as an Alien supporter when 75% of the country is Humanity first. This would cause huge stability problems in the USA. On the other hand, a leader could publicly declare their allegiance for The Initiative and gain support from that faction for their nation.

This all comes down to they restricted our political options to such a degree that Hearts of Iron 4 feels like it has more depth.

This game is all about science and politics! Terra Invicta takes the route of geopolitical simulation to see what the Earth would do after first contact, and with growing evidence that the aliens are not exactly a fully pacific bunch.

This game is basically two games at once: you want to control the nations of Earth against six other factions that have different views on how to deal with the aliens, and explore and expand into the Solar System. Sometimes the two parts feel a bit disconnected but I think you get the main idea.
The main mechanism is a turn-based one: you give orders to your agents, let the clock run, see what happens and rinse and repeat. Of course, in a game with such wide breadth, there are many things to keep an eye on: technology, developing your habitat in space, set the priorities for the nations you control, etc etc.

The game manages to deal with such a huge task pretty well, especially considering it's still in EA. If you like politics and exploration within a ""realistic"" frame, that's the game for you. It is also very unique: you won't find a similar one in the catalogue. And it is better than several 'standard' geopolitical games!
It's not the game for everyone though, and it still needs some tweaking. You have to accept that you won't understand everything immediately (the learning curve is quite steep) and the game, while having a tutorial, does not feed you everything.

It's a really, really slow game. In part this is a deliberate stylistic thing: send a probe to the asteroid belt and it takes 600 days because space is big and rockets are slow and etc. Sure, fair enough, that's no problem.

What is a problem is the way they've combined real time simulation and turn based strategy on the same layer of the game. That is: in games like X-Com/XCOM there's a real time meta layer which triggers battles, and those battles take you a turn based tactical layer to resolve them. This mostly works well, but sometimes causes frustration when you just want time to advance a couple months so you can finish researching lasers and yet like five tactical battles pop up and holy moly I just want it to be two months from now stop triggering combat!

The entirety of Terra Invicta occurs in that frustrating gameplay space. You take a turn, then the real time simulation runs for two weeks, then you take a turn, then it runs for two weeks, then you etc etc. Meanwhile, as you'll recall, sending probes or ships places can take a year or more, buildings take 30/60/90/180/360 days to construct, nations develop at a glacial pace and so on and so forth. But you can't fast forward through *any* of that, because every two weeks the real time gameplay is interrupted by turn based gameplay (or, from the other perspective, you have to run two weeks of RTS gameplay in between each turn you take).

So whereas in, say, Civ you can sometimes rapidly speed through turns while waiting for things to happen, or in a Paradox game you can set speed to maximum for a while, Terra Invicta's core design simply prevents the player from rapidly advancing, ever. What would already be a slow game gets slowed down even further, in a way that's pretty obnoxious.

I have other complaints (e.g., it's ludicrous that an assassination can cost the player or AI opponents literal decades of xp off a single die roll and the killed councilor doesn't have a deputy or understudy or something so the replacement will still take literal decades to train up starting from the councilor's death), but they're all things that I wouldn't hold against a game this early in EA, as they could very plausible change multiple times during development.

The RTS/TBS ""integration"", however, is so foundational that it would (from my outsider's perspective) require an *incredible* amount of work to redo one of the basic gameplay components and that just isn't going to happen. 

Plus, I'd say there're pretty good odds they already iterated on the TBS/RTS integration multiple times and this is the best version they hit upon. I'm not sure there *is* a good solution to the problem, given the apparent gameplay goals of a granular simulation of both global society and, uh, the entire rest of the solar system.",1677203119,1677203119,False,115,0,0.863657295703887939,0,True,False,True

I'm going to go on a limb and say that I even enjoy the first missions and bases out into the solar system. Then, the game loses focus on Earth, and I suddenly don't like the game anymore. Brick wall and game over. Do it again as a couple of factions, same kind of result.

Why is earth so nation/federation based, but space is suddenly just your faction? Shouldn't that moon base be owned by the country that boosted it up there? Why is our covert earth faction(s) the only real presence in space?

Suddenly all the building and hard work for the planet is not very important. Fine, I'll build some magical space hab/lab that seems to compare with, if not surpass, national level output back on earth. 

The spaceship combat is uninteresting for me. The theory of fighting the aliens back across the solar system is cool. The execution, not so much. It doesn't look fun and it doesn't play fun. I understand it is under development now, but I don't think it is going to ever develop into fun. I feel like it is a failed system. 

Why am I abstracting the entirety of earth's military, but personally designing ships? Sure, Master of Orion did that too, technically, but it worked in their system. It doesn't seem to work in this one. 

Maybe it is the genre shift. The game starts as a good geopolitical sim and takes a left turn to a poor 4x. Spore was similar to me. Early game was really interesting and then it got weird.

The game is fine, I got my money out of it. Got my 'money' out of Long War as well (thanks developers!). Again, I enjoyed it quite a bit and still think of the early game machinations more often than I would care to admit.

Do I want a Paradox game? Maybe, but I don't think so. In my mind, the geoscape could have been expanded out into space, bidding/fighting for space regions just like you were doing back on earth.

I think that it is not a game for every taste: here you can see a hard sci-fi grand strategy game that requires a great amount of micromanagement, but the resource aspect is abstract enough to not make it too much heavy. Councilors (the main mechanic of the game in the early stages, and still quite preponderant later on) add some RPG-esque mechanics, creating an interesting mix (like in Crusader Kings, to make an example, even if here it is less roleplay and more crunchy).
Also, it is incredibly long, I'm on my first playthrough and after 25+ hour I think that the road to victory is very long, which is incredible considering that you should at leat try each faction once to explore it (every one has a different ""campaign"" that you explore doing some mission). All of these aspects are good things to me, and I'm loving this game.
The main cons of this game are the incredibly steep learning curve and the small and laggy UI, but this is an Early Access, and I'm sure that this issues will be adressed in the future and they don't make me change my opinion: the core mechanics is extremely solid, which means that from there the devs can only make improvements!",1676751189,1676751189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

What the game does well is present a unique type of gameplay that is largely unique to other games I've seen. You fight a very long running war against an alien invasion. There are two fields of battle, earth and the surrounding solar system. Each arena is completely different and the scale is impressive. Winning against the aliens really feels like a long drawn out war and not just a couple quick battles to victory. You will take losses in this war of attrition.

The game makes a point of trying to go as hard science as it reasonably can. Learning good spaceship design balancing thrust, fuel efficiency, weight and so on is a lot of fun.

The problems sadly boil down to a few key aspects. The big one is that when you lose or are losing there is often little you can do but either start over or reload a save from a long time back. Often times the mistakes were made hours ago and that's assuming you can even identify your error.

This is further exasperated by the games intentional obtuseness. Unless you want to go trawling through reddit posts there are aspects of the mechanics that are just never clearly explained. No, some vague wording that appears once does not count as an explanation! In a game about strategy this poses some serious problems as you may be unable to make decisions due to simply not knowing how something works.

The two prior issues can be overcome by trial and error, reading online and generally learning the game. However, that's not enough. The next frustrating part is the devs insistence that EVERYTHING has RNG. I don't mind some RNG, if everything goes according to plan it just becomes boring execution.

The problem is that when the RNG screws you there is often little recourse. Remember how I said failures often leave you with little recourse? Well, some particularly bad strings of RNG at the wrong time can ruin a game, given a playthrough takes dozens of hours this can mean either save scumming or just being frustrated. Planning for the RNG helps but that only gets you so far. One game I was trying to open with India. I did everything right, good councillors, built up support, and so on. Lost India completely because I got several bad rolls in a row, the AI did no prep, got lucky, and locked me out in a couple of turns. Another game I effectively quit due to a series of bad tech rolls. I had planned around a specific set of drive tech. I knew RNG was an issue so I actually planned on getting one of three drives, each had decent odds of unlocking. I missed EVERY roll and basically got nothing after sinking years of research and hours of gametime into a plan. The RNG just doesn't care. So I had the choice of cheating or giving up and neither of those feel fun.

So, that being said. I think the devs here have something pretty special. I just hope they spend time polishing it up to improve the QoL issues and to be more respectful of the players time and ability to plan. Setbacks are fine but having major set backs due to bad dice rolls just sucks.

I am eager to get back into it with a fresh playthrough sometime as I have ideas on some early space combat that I think would be fun to try out.",1676707356,1676707356,True,3,0,0.560294032096862793,0,True,False,True

You'll probably hear plenty from other people about the UI issues. Well, this game is early access, so there's a good chance that'll get settled eventually. I'd personally love to see a list or something where the game explains how much boost various orbital bodies would take to build an outpost on ahead of time, and someplace where you can see all the solar system bodies you can send a probe to.

My big issue is unlikely to get fixed in early access. It's that the gameplay is so damn slow.
This game runs like an RTS, but it might as well be turn based.

While I was learning the game, this wasn't super apparent. (Aliens are popping up everywhere! There's so much mystery! I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm loving it! I can read the codex and all the tooltips while I'm waiting for my next turn! I need to micromanage my resource usage, I'm so close to establishing a space dock! I have no idea that I'm about to bankrupt my space programs by building one this early!)

So, very unfortunately, the more I learn about the game and the more the mystery wears away, the less invested I become into paying attention to it.
Don't get me wrong, it's still a very interesting game and I'm going to keep playing! I just can't think of anyone I'd recommend playing it, and a lot of my friends play Paradox games like Europa Universalis.

But there's still the issue that 99% of the time the globe is spinning, I've alt tabbed out to something else.
And even at the fastest game speed, that adds up.

It would be really hard to balance, but here's two branches I think game could take notes from. The first one needs a lot of work and deep thinking about balance:
- Desynchronize missions, so that faster missions can let you do a new mission right away
- A system to queue up missions for councilors, so that way you can plan and enjoy some gameplay while the game is unpaused
- Make missions take longer but have greater impact
- More control over when the game automatically pauses (eg, you can set an alarm on a resource or nation priority progress so that the game pauses when you have exactly the amount of boost you need, or when the spoils priority finishes)
- Reduce org micromanagement, make them more impactful but harder to change (And no, that doesn't mean make it cost more resources to swap them around. If anything, add a multi-year cooldown to swapping them around)
- Basically become more like Crusader Kings, maybe have councilors build friendships & animosities you can manage with their orgs and each other, including between factions
- Maybe let players have more councilors, but they can't move freely around the globe so you really feel like your agents are deliberately building mass movements and spheres of influence instead of playing 'Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego' with each other
- Or maybe fewer councilors, but their actions are far stronger so it's more exciting to use them

Once that's done, you can speed up the word timer on fastest to such a ludicrous degree that players are never waiting for more 5 seconds until their next move.

The other branch is, of course, to simply embrace becoming a turn-based strategy, so that way I'm merely waiting for the AI to calculate its turn and then I'm right back being fully engrossed making all my decisions at once, like Civilization 6.

You don't fight aliens. I don't know what you do. You have a little circus of five or six random clowns you send around to do ""things"". Magically these ""things"" can control a superpower and a nuclear arsenal in less than like three month, through functionally no sensible process whatsoever.

I wanted to fight aliens. Instead I got an insane palace intrigue simulator. Literally every piece of media about this game is showing cool ships flying around, when it should just show you a bunch of spreadsheets and a player sitting there numb, watching turn-based nonsense pass time while you wait for random rolls to determine if you're going to lose the game after 60 hours, because 'you didn't control the correct nation' on the third month of first starting.

There isn't even a real explanation for 'who' I'm supposed to be. Am I terrorist organization? Why am I stateless and I'm delivering 'manifestos'? Once I have a state, what am I supposed to be doing? I want to build ships and fight aliens and build outposts. Instead I'm grinding through the worst tech tree ever devised, which CRAWLS along, and the tech tree is like 75% traps and you have no way of knowing without multiple playthroughs and a wiki.

Even for all the ""real"" elements you have in the game, you constant run into gamey nonsense that clashes heavily with the entire concept. Like through 'normal' play you can have six of your own councilors. But if I control, say, the entire EU... really? I literally have bureaucracies of millions of people, and the CIA itself, under my control... but y'know. Only six agents can ever be sent anywhere. It just feels utterly insane.

Every piece of advice you get when you question how you should be doing things is ""here, watch this 4 hour long Youtube video"".

I'm not dumb. I can handle slow games. I can handle abstractions. But whatever this game is is literally like they intentionally made it to be anti-fun. Like whatever the early game is supposed to be about, it feels like it should START at the point you get to after like 20 hours dumped into it.

I think they made this game oppressively long and boring just so by the time you figured out it was trash you can't refund it.

Worse, the defense of every part of this game is ""lol you need to have a minimum of 440 hours played before it starts to click"".

It is also one of the most annoying in many small ways... lag, crashes, and a host of UI shortfalls that either slow play or drop you out of the groove entirely.

I've also played damn near 500 hours of it... so where a lot of games with those kind of issues lose me in an hour or two this one has kept me coming back and deeply engaged with my stories and characters. Clearly the downsides are worth it, at least to me.

If you're looking at playing it starts as a geopolitics/shadowy organization game on earth, and expands to a hard sci-fi expansion into the solar system and war with alien invaders. Both parts are interesting and deep, and both suffer from UI issues that detract from the fun. The Devs have been quite proactive thus far in making progress on those... but still a ways to go. 

The Tech tree large and opaque to the new player - take advantage of some of the online resources. You definitely need a plan, and should avoid most of the drives/modules/weapons; you only need a few, and better chosen, options. There are a couple of gating technologies that aren't entirely clear to the new player, so save yourself the heartbreak and look in advance :-D

Certainly won't be to everyone's taste, but if you like big 4x/space opera games, or loved Kingmaker as a kid, this might be for you. Call it an 8/10 in its current state, with upside if the devs continue to make quality of life improvements as they have been to this point.

Your first few hours is a headache learning so much over so little time only to realize latter on that was a drop in the ocean which is both exhilarating and overwhelming. There's so much to do that in just mid-game, I'd spend half an hour planning out a turn only to have it turn to ash as I neglected XYZ for 2 turns without realizing it. 

This leaves the game in an odd place. Do you simplify it to ensure idiots like myself stop complaining about the overabundance of Game Mechanics which is also a selling point of the game? Or do you invest hundreds of man hours into a more comprehensive UI to help aid the player.

This type of game I want more of. I just wish there was a lot of polish which may go directly against the vision of the creators of this game. The developers are still actively fixing(?) everything from UI changes, to balance, and everything in between. I won't be surprised if 2 years from now the game is refined enough to allow smol brained individuals like myself to enjoy. That said I would not recommend to anyone who isn't a fan of the cult classics of borderline masochistic strategy games like Xenonaunts.


EDIT:
After seeing the responses I wanted to add some remarks. Please notice the CEO Hooded Horse responded to my review within the hour. Find me any company that can do the same, I'm sure there's some out there but considering how recent games have been treating their player base everything I've seen from reviews, experience, and other players point to the developers being completely invested in this game. Hell look at the lengthy patch notes that only have 2,000,000,000 small changes to improve the game.

Secondly, I did play the demo. I got to the early mid game where it was absolutely a waiting game as you build up the resources to create fleets. I loved the feeling of dread you get as you see the aliens expand as well. Its a cold war where you feel inadequate and realize how all the factions are screwing each other over. I had the EU and USA under my control and I felt hopeless at seeing this invisible war go on.

I really want to press home this isn't an average strategy game. This is a very cerebral game where not checking every turn you need to check every tab not just the notifications.

I know I may lack the hours but please watch game footage and such and there isn't really much in terms of ""fun"" this is very much a thinking persons game with its greatest flaw as mentioned before the UI.

If this is the sort of game for you, which it certainly is for me, than I highly recommend it. I will however start with some of the few issues I have with it, for one the UI certainly could be improved, and the game could also use more optimization, secondly some of the federation/unification mechanics are a bit janky or just do not make much sense (For one example, the United Kingdom can reunite the commonwealth as a single nation and even annex the entire United States, but not Ireland, despite being able to make a federation with Ireland at game start, a federation which cannot be unified, just to name one). Assigning councilor missions can become tedious at times, keywords being ""at times"", for usually the periods of monotony do not last forever or often not even that long. These issues are by no means game ruining and some quite minor, and of course the game is both in early access and relatively new. So I fully expect the devs (who are both easy to reach and quite responsive on the discord) to rectify the serious issues in due course. Overall the game is extremely engrossing, extremely replayable with many different possible strategies even for just one faction (then consider there are 7 fully playable and fully fleshed out factions), delightfully challenging, the geopolitics mechanics are well fleshed out, space colonization mechanics and management are great, and ship design is as well, and although suffering from the aforementioned needing improvement UI, space combat is also very good and enjoyable. Ground combat is simplistic and functional, And to any fan of hard, or (as the game is) semi-hard science fiction it is even more of a treat.

I can't unconditionally recommend it, but you can probably tell if you're going to enjoy it just from reading the store page and looking at the screenshots. If you don't like walls of text, fiddling with obscure mechanics, not having any idea what you're doing but building up an understanding over a period of 10+ hours, etc, then this is probably not your kind of game.

On the other hand, if you actually enjoy diving into something that doesn't immediately reveal all of its secrets, don't mind losing, and your thought upon looking at an indecipherable list of hypothetical propulsion methods is ""wow, I need to spend more time on Wikipedia"" rather than your eyes glazing over -- well, this might be your kind of game.

My only criticism is that, while the entire game is playable (and a single campaign might last 50+ hours), it's less rewarding than it could be. The AI is not particularly good and once you've figured out how the game works, a lot of the difficulty melts away. I'm cautiously optimistic that this issue will be fixed before the game exits Early Access.

Since I don't write many reviews this will probably read like the ramblings of an old man (which it is.) This game is deep, very deep, and  as such very complicated.  Each playthrough will be dozens on dozens of hours, which for me is a good thing.  Start on earth, establish your power-base,  expand into space, push back against the other factions and deal with the aliens however your faction sees fit.  There are a lot of ways to approach this, and you can get lost in the details trying to perfect your countries, or sort through the massive tech tree.  

For those who have played Civ, you know the ""One more turn"" itch.  I get that same feeling here, constantly wanting to see what happens the next turn cycle, until I realize it is 2am and I should have gone to bed long ago. The time is more like Civ on Marathon mode, slow steady growth and changes, interspersed with some events which give a quicker boost or negative impact as your faction slowly takes hold (or is blasted out of space by some pissed off aliens). 

I have suffered from Restartitis, constantly wanting to try a different faction, or different approach.  I'd also recommend watching a couple Let's Plays or perusing the discord to get an idea of everything in the game to give yourself a bit of a guide as you play.  For example, you'll see pretty quickly getting your Councilor admin score up is extremely important, so you can cap more countries and buy more orgs. At the same time,  I still have no clue what the optimal or even semi-optimal path through the tech tree is, and I think this is a good thing as it leaves so much to still learn.

The Earth game is fun, building meganations and taking out the competition, but it can get a little repetitive when you're really starting to transition to focus on the space game. The space building is meh but it's not a big part of the play time. The space battle system is actually quite good, but it hits under it's weight because in practice the alien AI is not very good and actually flying your ships beyond forming a wall is somewhere between unnecessary and counterproductive a lot of the time, but it is still fun and depending on your ships designs you may actually have to think and maneuver.

The AI for the other human factions is a bit weak, so the big Earth problems and almost all of the space battles are going to be against the aliens. Which is a bit disappointing but the devs said they are working on it.

And it's actually quite hardish scifi if you care about that. Orbital mechanics, Newtonian battle physics, theoretical drive concepts, delta-v and all that.  The variety of drives, weapons and researches available is quite overwhelming and you'll probably have to look at a guide because figuring out the ""good"" research paths is not obvious in game.

Replay value: There are a few starting strategies in Earth to choose from, but anything except grabbing one of EU/USA/China is a challenge run. In space you can decide to go or not for asteroids, or rush Mars, and to fight the aliens early or just turtle and hope they don't bother you too much until you're really ready. The weak part is that despite some differences in end goals, and a few other relatively minor things, almost all factions play very similarly so the replay value of that is limited, but it is there. They also  each have good plot lines (for a strategy game) and a Alpha Centauri-esque leader with nice (or funny) quotes. And in research, there are a LOT of choices and paths you could take, but there's still a strong feeling that there is more or less a right path.

Conceptually, it's like XCOM but you control the council instead of XCOM. You have a small team of councilors who try to take over Earth governments and steer them from the shadows. Crucially, you play as the power behind the throne, not the countries themselves, and it's like the majority of the Earth's population is not aware of you, nor are they necessarily willing to cooperate with your vision of how to respond to aliens or whether the aliens are even a priority vs. warring on their neighbor and dealing with their own economy. There are multiple factions and each have their own goals, they have a lot of personality and seem inspired by Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, they even have quotes about the sci-fi tech you research.

The game plays a lot like Europa Universalis 4. There's generic manas like money and political influence, but also more thematic stuff like boost (used for launching rockets into orbit) and space water (your space bases need water which must either be mined on asteroids or lifted from Earth at great cost to boost). The councilors are like the diplomats and traders of EU4, you have similar ""armies"". For obvious reasons the councilors are more prominent and detailed, while armies and navies are simplified, compared to EU4.

There are ""orgs"" like companies, crime syndicates, national intelligence agencies which are basically items that you can buy and equip on councilors to get plusses. It's a clever concept that helps make it feel more like you're actual movers and shakers.

The mechanics are pretty original and cool. For example most research is global, unlike games such as Civ where after one country discovers a tech, other countries must inexplicably reinvent the wheel (even literally) instead of just copying it from their neighbor. You can build spaceships to fight aliens, and they have DeltaV. Even the aliens have DeltaV, they just have more. You have to plan orbital transfers to move around.

Main reason I decided to write this review though, is the developer. Initially, I was put off by the $40 (I'd expect more like $30 with occasional $5 off sales) and some negative reviews (Sep-Dec 2022) complaining bad UI and tedious gameplay (especially the councilor system and their RNG actions). After 10 hours I'm in mid of early game and the UI seems pretty nice to me. It's a bit choppy sometimes but I'll accept minor technical issues in a big concept-small team game like this. Many specific UI flaws, like not being able to see how much of a threat the AI considers you, seem to have been added to the game now. I started playing a week ago, and one annoying thing I noticed was having to go back and forth to figure out what councilor has what action and how much is his skill point used for that action. Today I see that the UI has been changed and now when you recruit councilors, it groups actions by skill and also says how many councilors you already have that can do that skill. It makes councilor management way smoother, and that's a big part of the game.

Clearly the dev respects his customers, listens to criticism, and improves the game based on what the players actually want, and not just what he thinks they should want. I respect that and I'm hopeful the game will get better in the future. It's already pretty good and playable as is.

A common complaint is that the game is long. I haven't played that much but it sure seems long. That said, I play lots of grand strats/4x like EU4, Vicky2, CK2, Total War, Civ, SMAC, ... These games always take a forever, and I hardly ever ""beat"" them. The process of playing the game is supposed to be fun in itself. For this game, the early game is really fun and there's a lot to do in different phases, so at this point I'm not too worried. I'll come back here and update the review if I'm proven wrong :)

And to be clear: I'm not saying the negative reviews are wrong or anything. I'm glad those guys wrote it up and I could see what I was getting into. I think their complaints are reasonable and I can see where they're coming from. Some of the issues have been fixed in the time since, others, for me personally, are not a big obstacle to fun gameplay (hope dev keeps improving them, though!). I encourage you to read the negative reviews and make up your own mind. Also the genre is obviously not for everyone. If you like grand strat you may think the game is great or you may think it's okay, but I doubt you'd feel like it's a waste of $40.

Perun gaming on Youtube has some playthroughs of the game, I recommend you watch some to get an idea of what it's like. He explains some of the meta which is nice. He also says there's a demo somewhere, which I couldn't find, but if you feel like tracking it down it should give you a good feel for the game.",1676088448,1676088448,True,60,0,0.839317202568054199,0,True,False,True

The reason I state this is, first during the intial stages of the game you must complete construction of mining in space on either mars or a distant place and the tech forces you to either choose to fall behind other factions in the game or choose the direction of humanity.  Now none of that sounds bad at first, there is a rush to outer space, which makes sense but that is where it is no longer in a players hands at all.

You build bases hoping for dear life that nothing of a event EVER occurs, because you will literally lose the entire game if you get one during the start phase. You will watch as you and other factions build a mining base on mars or where ever, as your time to rebuild is literally one whole year. While you wait a full entire year to START THE GAME the other factions are now taking more resources and constantly pushing forward. Your options are too either make more boost, which gets more bases that also have year or even longer spans of time to do anything! The other factions can even steal your space station early game too, getting rid of any tech lead you had!

The tech is disgusting, the AI mostly will decide the tech unless you need something. Reason is simple you will focus on getting what you need to get a certain goal done, because you cannot both lead in personal tech and world direction. Does the AI understand what to pick during tech choices, not at all!

My time-line is about 1.5 years in on my current game and I am just shy of having enough boost to start launching a single mining outpost on the moon or waiting 6 more months to reduce the cost and having a 2nd outpost up with a 2nd mining outpost a  couple of months up and running after the first.

The space combat itself is really quite unique. I get really strong Expanse vibes from it, with ships yeeting missiles at range, then closing in for rail guns, dodging each other's shots over battlefields that are hundreds of km across.

It's deep. Massively deep. I'm at 69 hours now (nice), and still am learning constantly, and don't think I'm anywhere near the end game yet.

Which also had some input from Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (in terms of the tech advance quotes).... also somewhat influenced by Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck (The Expanse)....  Perhaps chuck in a bit of ""Deuteros"" (another 90's game)

I bought it because I thought it would be like UFO: Enemy Unknown but soon found out that was definitely not the case.   I almost asked for a refund but I thought ""Eh, give it some time""...

This game is so addictive!!!  Beware - quite the learning curve.  You'll likely not beat the game on your 1st, 2nd, 3rd... probably many more play through attempts but bear with it...

So I went past the refund window...  but persisted...

Spun up a game as the Resistance... lost.  Badly.

And again, as the Resistance....  lost, but not quite so badly....

I'm on my 5th play through as I type and with each game instance understanding improves....  as does challenge and enjoyment.  The opponent AI seems to be highly adaptive.

I could go on....  But speaking as somebody who has been gaming since the 8 bit days, this is one of THE most enjoyable, and addictive games I've ever played.  

EDIT - Bad points.  I will say that the game mechanics are not very well explained and it takes a bit of 'sussing it out for yourself' and Googling to understand.  Even then, there seems to be stuff which nobody seems to understand, e.g. upgrade paths for space platform layer defences.  I'm also finding it difficult to understand spacecraft acceleration versus exhaust velocity and as a result have build some impressive combat ships except... they struggle to move from Earth to Moon orbit.

Also need to say - the UI is very clunky and could really do with major redesign.

But the good points outweigh the bad and as such I would still highly recommend this game.

This game is like X-Com on a higher scale for people who think X-Com (original or remake doesn't even matter) is a baby game for introducing the concept of fairness and skill to babies. Grown ups know that no one cares about your individual soldiers or nice happy narratives, this game is about pretty much becoming the Illuminati, ruthlessly exploiting the countries of the worlds and then also realizing that you are neither Will Smith nor Jeff Goldblum and you certainly can not tell the aliens ""welcome to earth"" sarcastically, after killing them, repeatedly, without eventually pissing them off so much that they will decide to actually come, in force, to earth, and ruin everything. The strategy of this game is more or less subtle, building up and researching and then you start colonizing space and it is amazing but - as I subtly foreshadowed, just getting your ships form her to ther can take, like, full minutes, sixty or more if you dont just play on max speed pausing when necessary. The semi turned based structure (its real time but agents get new missions every 2 weeks or so so you get a short break to plan some strategies, but this also means that, like, waiting a year just to send a probe to an asteroid can take a while with many distractions.)

Some downsides, with the assumption that everything I don't mention, I like:

The AI is probably fine, but its hard to distinguish the factions (not like the icons so much as just, I forget who is who) - each faction has their own agenda, both assumed from their faction itself (Science guys want to do science) and more specific plans and goals that you can reveal over time / by spying. This would be still fine but you have to really pay attention to keep track of changes in power - countries can shift allegiance very quickly and regardless of borders, and the amount of message icons you get on the side is ridiculous and its inevitable that you will just start ignoring them entirely because MOST things you need to know will have better indications, but this means that unless you're obsessively studying the maps of both earth and like, the entire solar system, youll find yourself surprised that a very hostile faction is suddenly united Europe and also fully colonized mars and all the asteroids mentioned in The Expanse.

Building and customizing ships is entirely over the top and unnecessary and exactly what this type of games need. However, large ship battles tended to crsah my game, which is why I stopped playing. Base building and customization is neat and feels cool but eventually you just keep spamming bases wherever you can, so they start to just blur together and I end up just making them all exactly the same, something something space communism and/or suburbia. I don""t know if I would want more simple rubber stamping of base layouts or more intricate fine tuning. Basically I'm never happy, so you figure it out.

tldr: probably not for everyone, but for people who like very intricate games with more adaption than simple 4x conquest, if you enjoy the moments of crusader kings that aren't just wars of conquest, then you might like this, and if you have like 200 hours to invest to maybe finish a campaign, then hit the lights.",1675362940,1675362940,True,1,0,0.49714285135269165,0,True,False,True

In my opinion it does this better than any other Strategy game I've played. The nation control aspect is an interesting early game, the space transfers and combat are genuinely excellent, and the focus on realism is noticeable, and appreciated, throughout.

Unfortunately, the game is plagued by a variety of issues that make me unable to recommend it.

#1 The UI is the laggiest I've ever seen in any game. There's noticeable delay any time you open any screen, click on anything and have the screen move, select units, etc. It's an awful experience and imo the devs should be ashamed to put something out there (even in early access) that just feels so bad. Certain screens take up to 10 seconds to load and they're not cached so when I wanted to compare two things I took a screenshot and put it on my other monitor rather than deal with the lag of switching back and forth. This is also the main reason I can't really praise the research system, interacting with it is such a laggy mess that it takes all the fun out of it.

#2 The councilors are really cool at the start, but they quickly become a mental energy drain. By the late 20s you'll definitely have your center of power set up and be focusing on space expansion and research, at that point having to stop twice a month to just do some stuff feels like busywork and really frustrating.

#3 The Mission Control alien hate mechanic is weird, basically it caps you from building anything but the essentials for a while until at one point you just build a large enough fleet to wipe out the aliens from around Mars, Mercury and Earth and at that point you can get as much Mission Control as you'd like from Mercury and now you actually get to enjoy space exploration and having bases all over the place, but the game is also  trivial because with Mercury you'll get hundreds of MC cap which you can use to squash the aliens.

There are also a few things I still don't understand like why there are two columns in each country's description with the relative ratios - regardless of the number of control points / number of factions controlling it.
So as far as the ""tutorial"", things aren't really explained well and you'll find yourself going online to get more information quite a bit.
In spite of that, the core concept for game play is solid I think.  It has quite a few factions with different objectives that are competing to control countries.  The factions can even control governments and if they don't take action, the governments will go to war / have their own objectives outside of the controlling faction's interests.
Cons:  
There's a lot of waiting due to the clock still having to run to get to the next turn where you make decisions, even when it's sped up as fast as it can go.
I spent a year in-game time gaining control of US control points and another faction was able to grab the DC control point (academy faction) even though I had usually over 50% popular support and they had almost none.  So sometimes things don't make much sense.
I've experienced a single bug so far where I spent 20 xp for a councilor to upgrade administration - it took the xp and administration did not go up.
I've gotten to the point where i have 5 councilors now (4 normal, 1 covert) in addition to a turned councilor (you don't control anything for these except what percentage of missions to deliberately fail for their faction in addition to seeing where they are and what mission they are working on - gives you a sense of that faction's priorities at the moment).
It seems like investigating enemy councilors doesn't give you much of an advantage in spite of taking a full turn.  Once you've identified them and they've left the area, you will see them as a gray/unidentified councilor again when detected later.  Even the intel screen will not show them under the enemy faction and it'll show them as an unidentified slot again.  Granted, they may have died, but it seems like you should have more information than that and this is poorly thought out.

As far as UI, I'd say it needs a LOT of work.  The tech tree is almost unreadable given that it can't be broken down into subtrees and there are far too many lines / no filter.
The orbital transfer tool (like the one you can see from the ship designer) simply won't allow you to select Earth as the origin - so if you're starting from Earth, it's a complete non-starter.

Overall, I'd say the game isn't worth what they're charging for it right now, maybe buy it when it goes on sale for $20 or under.  It does have a lot of potential if it doesn't turn into abandonware.",1675014867,1675016994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Returning to review this game after a few months away.  I found this game through a popular Youtuber who also became disillusioned with this title.  [b]Important caveats to my review[/b]: 1) I have never gotten past the early-late game 2) there have been a lot of updates in the 4 months or so since I last played, and I haven't kept track of the changes.  Nevertheless I believe the game's design philosophy is fundamentally flawed rather than something that can be fixed through balance tweaking, and I do not plan on reinstalling.

Terra Invicta is essentially what happens when the kind of people who ask ""Why doesn't the villain simply shoot James Bond in the head instead of lowering him slowly into a shark tank?"" make a game.  That's why Terra Invicta has game mechanics like disproportionate alien retaliation and being able to spend resources to nullify RNG.  There's a reason why most developers include gradual power creep and RNG in games in the first place, and that reason is [i]fun player experience[/i].  To put it another way, yes, Bond would be much more effective if he wore disguises, carefully waited until the enemy dropped its guard, didn't seduce the villain's daughter etc etc, but no, that would be a terrible Bond movie.  If you're going to try to make a more ""realistic"" piece of media you're still going to fail at being totally realistic, and then you need to figure out where your suspense and fun are going to come from now that you're not jumping naked out of a helicopter with a flamethrower and a snowboard.

Aside from the obvious drawbacks of ignoring conventional game design wisdom, let's look at some of the other problems with these choices:

The emphasis on realism ironically forces the player into game-y manipulation of TI's alien retaliation mechanics, as the optimal strategy is to carefully stay in 3rd or 2nd place so that the faction in 1st takes 100% of the heat, while building your power base tall along dimensions that don't contribute much to your threat (for instance, relations with other factions, agent levels, raw resource stockpiles).  This ill-conceived rubber banding mechanism requires you keep careful track of threat so that you know you won't accidentally trigger reprisal or suddenly be in 1st place and start taking massive negative opinion penalties from all the other factions.  

This leads me to the only outright stupid design decision in this game I can think of: making the player's threat level, the single most relevant info in the game, obscured and only available as an estimate (which is usually significantly underestimating the actual level).  And then the only way to get an accurate assessment is to perform hostile actions against the aliens, potentially pushing you over the threshold.   This is clearly one of those moments where the designer felt, ""Well, for realistic simulation purposes we definitely should shoot Bond in the head"" without considering the impact on the gameplay.  The estimate is fuzzy, but the effects of crossing the exact threshold are immediate and apocalyptic.  The estimate and response should both be either gradual and fuzzy, or both be discrete and exact.  This game is full of maddening design choices like this, but this is the worst offender by far.

Finally, let's talk RNG and uncertainty.  We all hate it, right?  So the solution is to allow us to buy points to minimize RNG effect on gameplay, right?  Well, no, the [i]actual[/i] solution should be to either make it so the player can create contingency plans that allow you to recover from bad RNG (XCom grenades and Psi), or to make it so that the RNG outcomes, even failures, themselves are fun (Crusader Kings events).  The midgame uncertainty in TI, meanwhile, generally boils down to ""which country do I need to whack-a-mole next turn"" and ""did I miscalculate and cause the aliens to instantly flip from totally peaceful to terminator mode"".   My suggested solution would be to make RNG [b]more[/b] impactful and only on big operations (ie not public relations or weeding alien shrubs), increasing the tension and stakes, NOT allowing point-buy, and allowing some special limited-use actions as contingency in case you get bad RNG.  

Long story short, the developers fell into the trap of falling in love with their vision of gameplay mechanics and systems.  But the first rule of designing games, and consumer products in general, is to start with the user experience first and then letting the overarching systems grow in service of those needs, and finally flesh out the mechanics.  Otherwise you get overengineered vanity products.  There's quite a lot to love here - the ship designing and especially the drive/orbital calculations, the scientific archives, the geopolitics and the allocation of economic priorities.  But in the end it feels dragged down by the agent and faction systems, and a lack of attention to what makes games fun.

Terra Invicta was an amazing experience but it wasn't without its flaws.  I'll try to focus on both the good and the bad in this review.  Regardless, I do recommend it since in its current state, I'm sure it can only get better in the future.

For the good, it’s a deep strategy game that tends to discourage “snowballing”.  If you build up to fast, too aggressively, you’ll have not only the other AI human factions jumping down your throat, but also the aliens, and you do not want to completely p-off the aliens until you’re ready to do so.  Most of the game is handled through technical control of countries and later, via assets you build up in space.  There are some “right” ways to play I’ve discovered – at least for one of the anti-alien factions.  The game’s tutorial leads you in the direction of a few.  

You’ll be cursing the AI when they try to muscle into your country-block you’re trying to forge into a super-nation.  You’ll curse the AI when they steal your research.  Then, the “big alien fleet” shows up, and you’ll groan as they make a lot of orbital debris clouds by destroying all your stations.  The tech tree is monstrous and you do NOT need most of it.  Things that give lifetime bonuses such as +5% Welfare or “Enemies get a -3 Penalty to XYZ missions” are great and stack up.  All the drives and weapons and ship parts though, not really needed.  Google some guides for good mid and end-game ships/drives and push the tech tree towards them.  Ships are only good for combat or quickly building outposts far away.   Ships with junk drives or crappy weapons are a waste of resources.  Remember, one slow ship in a fleet will slow the whole fleet down.   The tech tree is vast and confusing.  It’s technically challenging – especially with engines.  Some have great range (delta V) but take forever to get anywhere.  Some are powerful and great in combat but will barely take you to the moon on a full tank.  Some may be great at both, but require some exotic material for fuel like reactives.  Even the ones that just take water tend to take a LOT of water.  I held off the bulk of my fleet construction until I knew I had a drive/reactor that could completely overpower the enemy (Neutron Flux Torch) though that drive was expensive to refuel.  

The game is meticulous and plodding.  To really get into it, you’ll need to be just as meticulous.  Every turn, inspect all your countries for signs of attack by the AI.  Check for any alien flora spread that you need to destroy (and STAY ON TOP OF DESTROYING IT).  Check the big “power nations” and who is controlling them. Much of the game is keeping the AI off-balance and not becoming entrenched.  This is where the game gets flawed.  As you do slowly gain control of the earth and push into space, the game keeps yanking you back to earth twice a month.  There’s no way to “defeat” the AI factions.  You can take over every nation and push them into hundreds of thousands in bankruptcy as their space assets eat away at their reserves and assassinate their counselors ten-times over, but they keep coming back to annoy you and force you to check countries for tampering as you check the beliefs and unrest levels.  I certainly wouldn’t mind a condition where if they have no more control points on Earth and are in debt, they’re permanently out of the game.  The end-game maintenance on earth just slows down the action that happens in space and makes you loath to transfer any counselors off-planet for any space activities.

Likewise, by the time I had a drive/reactor combo that could take the alien fleet head on, the aliens had a death-ball of 100 ships with a fleet power of around 38k.  Needless to say, it took a lot of hit and run fighting, building up ships where I could and loss of dozens of stations before I was able to tip that hat in my favor.  Other gripes, the UI is a bit on the clunky side.  Counselors on ships have a bad habit of hopping out onto the stations you refuel at causing you to reload the game when you tell your fleet to take off and realize you left them behind.  Likewise with the UI, there’s a lot of “too much information” and “not enough information”.  The left-side icons for actions would be better made just a log window.  Same with the top-icons showing modules being built and control points coming up for protection.  It would be nice if the asset search and picker to the right told you the name of the planets/stations your fleets were hanging around, because most moons and asteroids look the same.  Pro-tip, rename your fleets.

Other negative things I saw with the game was the ship-combat system.  Try as I might, I hated it.  The camera controls are wonky, the ships difficult to select and command and the AI control is ugly.  I ended up “Autoresolving” all my battles with overwhelming force.  Autoresolving… all my fleet is “damaged” and all the alien’s fleet is “destroyed”.  Letting the combat play out in simulation with the AI controlling my ship tend to get 2 of my ships killed for every one of theirs.  The combat isn’t like what you’d see in Homeworld, and should perhaps take some pointers from it – especially for ship selection and camera control.   Camera controls are a bit wonky even outside this system.  Being able to free-pan around the solar system would be nice, and being able to select a fleet without the game immediately zooming the camera to it would be a bonus – especially when all you want to do is give it a transfer or merge in some new ships hot off the assembly line.

There are also performance issues with the game, especially when you do anything with large fleets.  My PC is on the higher end of equipment but still struggled at times.  Occasional crashes happen as well which is typical in this early access.  I’m not going to fault the game for either of these though.  They’re expected at this point.

Overall though, it was enjoyable and satisfying.  I cheered when I finally had a fleet that demolished the alien’s death-ball.  I cheered at every one of their stations I vaporized and every outpost I bombarded into dust.  Fiery retribution!  I breathed a sigh of relief when I finally kicked the alien threat out of our solar system for good.  Yes, the game is flawed, but I’ve played and enjoyed a lot of flawed titles from my Commodore 64 days.  Unlike some reviews saying the same, I believe it can be fixed without massive fundamental changes to the game.  UI improvements would be one solid improvement.  Being able to permanently remove other factions from the game a second one.  Completely redoing the fleet-combat would be a nice third, though honestly, I’m perfectly fine with a good autoresolve system for these kind of games.   7/10, would do it again once it’s baked a little longer.

It's important to invest early and concisely, and I feel like more leeway can be made for the 2030-2040 mark. 

The AI for other human factions feels rather poor when attempting to fight aliens, leaving the player alone to deal with an entire solar system. At the same time, they are very good at interfering with the player- especially in the later years, leaving me with a split attention between space combat and trying to maintain my countries at home. This could be a great balance, except that mission assignments interface can feel quite cumbersome. 

As a player, you are not only playing with a turn-based espionage grand strategy system that pops up every 2 weeks, but also a solar-system spanning war against an almost immovable alien force. Towards the mid-end game, I would greatly prefer if I could toggle an AI for my counselors and focus entirely on space as having to refocus on earth's issues can be very distracting.

Space combat is amazing, but I think the controllable UI can be refined.

Once I had fleet powers of 7000 against 9000 my game would crash almost instantly. Even out of combat, once the aliens had a certain number of ships and stations around the galaxy there were often delays switching between bodies.

There are mods to adjust your experience, and I highly recommend them if there's a part of the game that's driving you nuts (as I personally experienced). 

On the downside from a nuts-and-bolts mechanics point of view, the game suffers in three big areas. This'll be a Russian novel if I explain them, so again I recommend a video or two. You can quit reading here or check them out below, but the most important point to get across for fleet-combat players is that that system will likely frustrate you and it'll take a long time to get to, so don't buy this game if that's your top selling point.

So, details: the UI out in space, counselors, and fleet combat. There are some mods to fix some of these things if you're not an achievement stickler. More details below if you're interested:

The UI thing out in space thing is easy: when you hit ""go to"" on a space station or planetary habitat, it does a really nice thing where it scrolls over you the hab/station out in space. Cool right? Yeah, but not helpful. I've had to literally flip around to a station on an asteroid and click on it to get to the management screen. Rule-of-cool sh*ts the bed after awhile once you're trying to manage a solar-system wide empire. Likewise when you're warned of an impending attack, ""go to"" takes you to the attacking fleet, rather than the station or hab they're heading to, meaning you then have to open up your hab list and go find whatever they're after. This is also annoying and the opposite of helpful.

Counselors are incredibly micro heavy and sometimes have way too much power - like flipping space stations without having to assault them. I can deal with it on earth where the interface is much smoother and efficient, but once you have an entire solar system full of space stations and planetary habitats, where the UI for moving between stations and fleets is already pretty clunky, it just becomes f*cking annoying. I'm running a mod that essentially disables them in space and frankly without that mod I occasionally find the game straight-up unbearable.

Then fleet combat. Whew boy. Homeworld this is not. If this is your biggest draw for the game, maybe consider staying away. For starters, it takes a LOT of investment (in literal in-game resources and your time) to get to the point where your ships are capable of not getting completely annihilated by the aliens you'll mostly be fighting in space, unless you're a xeno-loving servant. And once you actually do start fighting? AI ship designations aren't very clear, nor are the pre-battle layouts, and in-battle controls are clunky with issues like -ships won't fire long-range weapons unless you designate a primary target for them- and don't get me started on moving your ships. Yes there's a very specific mechanic involving momentum and a fully 3-dimensional battlespace that the movement system is trying to emulate, but ship direction controls overlap with momentum controls in counter-intuitive and frustrating ways and...yeah. Lots of room for improvement.

I would LOVE, for instance, to just be able to click on one of my ships and tell it to attack a specific enemy ship, and do that for every ship rather than my whole damned fleet. I'm already micromanaging the hell out of my counselors; a fleet-combat-for-lazy-people feature would be friggin lovely.

I was so skeptical. Saw some footage and didn't get impressed immediately. Watched some more and then I was curious. Long war developers was the biggest selling point for me, because I knew attention to detail was top notch for those guys. I can not explain how much I love it. I played 30 hours straight. That is the wonderful take on on a very ""grand"" strategy. It's still a bit rough on edges and very detailed that it might be intimidating at first but oh boy, is this game good! If this state is early access, I don't know what the final version will be. Seriously, wonderful game!

FEEDBACK #1:

I think in this current weapon scheme, lasers and plasmas are no brainer as they don't get caught by PDs. I would prefer more viable weapons for late game. Like better ballistic weapons which can surpass lighter point defence. More like rock, paper, scissors style. Maybe as a faction gets more inclined with one type of weapons, they get better stats at it, like a mastery? This would create even more repeatable experience as your ship designs can use very different loadouts. Missiles even have to get better as tech goes up IMHO.

You control a small group of spies, and your task is to deal with an impending alien invasion. How you deal with it, or if you deal with it at all, is entirely up to you and the faction you've chosen to side with. Whatever you choose to do, your cadre of spies needs to take hold of the reins for human society and guide it down the path. You do this with missions and research primarily, but you can resort to war if need be.

However, the gameplay isn't as simple as nation vs. nation. Everything is politically spiked with whichever secret society of spies is currently pulling the strings, be it you or an adversary.

You send operatives out to capture the control points in a nation to take control of it - problem is your ops are so incompetent that the % chance of successful completion of the mission is in single figures. This leads to your ""Shawshank"" moment, continually retrying the same mission over and over and over again until the game gets fed up of you doing the same thing over and over and relents and lets you take control of a Control Point.....but as the majority of countries have more than one control point you have to continue the same process until you take over the country - and then you repeat exactly the same process for the next country. Which depending on how many AI are in the game you might struggle to find another one to try to take over. You can literally feel your will to live slipping away.

What you do in the game is as follows:
Send Operatives on missions, kick off a research if you have a research slot, put the game on fast forward until the game is ready for you to reassign missions to your Operatives  or a research slot becomes available, and then repeat this process for the whole game. That is literally all you do.

Even if you do take control of a country there is nothing to do, it just adds a little to your resources. 

Meanwhile your AI controlled competition is taking over half the planet, controlling what is being researched globally and moving off into space.
If your lucky enough to start the game with an orbital station, it just gets destroyed by the Aliens. If you try to launch anything from the planet, it gets hijacked and destroyed. Yet the AI is flying along - occupying the moon, and every other available location in space.

The only difference cheats make to the game is you can take over more countries and have a better chance of successful missions, but your still in the ""send on mission, kick off research"" loop that you are in if you aren't using cheats.

As Vaas said, The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting the result to be any different....but even when you do change the game parameters, you are still in exactly the same loop as before.

If Vaas knew about this game he would have said ""Playing Terra Invicta is the definition of insanity"". Maybe not as catchy, but just as accurate.",1673124851,1673728830,False,5,1,0.430705010890960693,0,True,False,True

I haven't played it since I came back to work, not because I don't want to, but because I don't trust myself not to stay up until five in the morning playing. 

I nearly didn't buy this based on other reviews of people complaining about difficult interfaces, this that and the other. That would have been a mistake. 

In a way, the game reminds me of Civ. It's 'real time', but turn based at the same time; you send your little super spies to do missions, and then wait for a week or two while those missions are performed. For the four days that I played during my holiday break, I kept saying to myself, 'I'll go to bed now, I'll stop playing now- oh, but wait, I'll just send them to do this, I'll just order this spaceship constructed, this base built, this thing done-' and then it would be 5am, and I would force myself to get off- not because I didn't want to keep playing, but because I was making silly mistakes from being too tired.

I would 100% recommend this game if you're a fan of grand strategy and scifi. It's a BIG game. It's a SCARILY big game. I had about twenty hours in to one campaign before I realised I had accidentally crippled myself with no way to fix it, and started again, and had much more fun because of it. My current playthrough, I've spent the entire playtime in abject terror, knowing that I'm doing well, but knowing that the enemy is just that bit stronger than me, can move that bit faster, are that bit more advanced. I haven't had this much fun with a game since- I have absolutely no idea, maybe Alpha Centauri when I was much younger, or Homeworld (again, when I was younger, and games were hard because I had no idea what I was doing).

Even the alien worshippers wind up having more depth to them than I'd expected.

The game was very difficult for me to understand in the first few days. I repeatedly found myself re-starting from day 1 after learning the way a new game mechanic worked. Frustration followed a few days of this as I wasn't sure the changes to my actions made a difference in my progress.  The game doesn't clearly tell you you're doing well or you're doing poorly.. it's sort of subjective.  In a way it can be a matter of opinion if you're doing well or poorly.  

As an example of what I mean by that statement: I finally stuck to one of my save games playing as Humanity First (the ""kill all aliens"" faction).  I've just about made it to the 2030's and put a great deal of focus into taking India first before slowly taking over China.  I was so determined to figure out how to unite these countries into one big mega country that I neglected looking into space for a few hours.  When I did finally look up I saw that most all of the other factions had expanded and were now mining the moon, mars, and a few asteroids.  I was on the verge of hitting the reset button again and starting a new game with a fresh focus on early expansion toward space... then I realized this crackhead agent guy I had was real good at smoking fools.  I sent this dude out assassinating the shit out of the Initiative (who are like flies to my nation building project... constantly landing on me when I'm sitting outside just trying to enjoy a nice day).  I was having so much success with taking out my opposition that I ignored space some more and started looking into developing this crackhead assassin's abilities further.  This led to me looking deeper into my own agents and... go figure, learning something new about the game mechanics again.  I realized I could invest in my guys abilities to steal stuff from the other factions.  Now, rather than re-starting my game again, I'm investing in my agents abilities to steal habs, projects, resources, and other agents.  I drastically shifted my approach to capitalize on the investments of my opponents and now I'm back in the game.

I've already typed way more than I intended to in this box.  If you like space stuff and strategy stuff you may have a good experience.  This is one of those games that you can kind of ""play"" after you turn it off.  It requires you to think and sometimes getting away from that screen and doing something else can give you the breath of fresh air to come back and figure out where to find your very own crackhead assassin.

I've sent the developer a few emails of constructive criticism.  I was pretty surprised when I received a detailed response from them!  A large update for this game was just released and I have yet to try it out.  The fact that they invested time into listening to what I had to say gives me confidence to say that, if you're that type of person, investing time into this pre-release game is worth it.  Thank you for your time!  I look forward to giving the new update a go when I get some more free time.

 if you coming into this from more fast paced war based strategy games though, you'll find yourself setting up your councilors and then pressing space alot more than you would have hoped. the UI desperately needs some work, and the ship building is an absolute maze to figure out. i also wish there was maybe more things you could do outside of your councilors, personally ive play 2 games to (near) completion at this point, once as the EU, and again as china, and both times i got to the point where i was nearly spending all my councilors every turn just maintaining what i have (isn't necessarily a bad thing but is certainly frustrating when you feel like you cant progress without backstepping on what you've already achieved, and even if you do back step its quite likely you still wont be able to achieve your goals). (IMO) the tech tree is quite bloated atm and its confusing trying to figure out how or what you should be unlocking to progress.

if you're the grandiose type player, then id say go ahead a grab it, as even at the moment its a pretty fun game, and if the devs take their time and put the work needed into the game it could very easily become a geo-political genre defining game. if your the fast paced war strategy gamer tho, then im sorry but i dont think this game is ever going to be what your looking for. really hoping the devs give this the polish it deserves, would love to come back awestruck.",1673231987,1673232092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The key to the turn-game masterpiece is to create a strategy limiting the need for ""luck"" or ""dice rolls"" to very few particular actions. 

Unfortunately not the case with this game. Here you roll toooooo much, and too much is left to luck, in my opinion and that force the Devs to make a stupid AI in order to avoid punishing player with bad luck.
Perfection is when you don't need ""random rolls"" (chess, for example). To the point that I prefer hidden information over a roll of dice like hidden strength value vs. hidden strength value. Because you can guess to a point a relative strength value due to various observations, but a roll is something you can't predict.

This game has a fantastic concept and a lot of really really good things going for it. But, there are way to many things that after 24 hours playing the game i just cant get passed and had to stop.  I would like to add that i think all these things are fixable, but the current state of the game is just way to much busy work. I dont feel like a commander, i feel like an Administrator.  The main underlying issue is that as the scale grows there is no automation of the tasks and everything just feel like a chore.
The other areas that I would say need work are the following:
1. Fleet management, The interface for this is really bad. Trying to combine ships into fleets is painful. Trying to easily find where ships are etc is also very hard. I dont have any issue with the Transfer window stuff, i think that is really good. It just how you manage your ships.
2. Research and Projects, There is a level of detail here which should be applauded, but having to do projects for every single variant of new weapon it mindbogglingly dull. I got to the point where i hated researching new weapon system as i would then have a ton of new projects that would then need to unlock. 
3. Whats good and what not. Its very very hard to see and compare different ship components, I didnt want have to get a note book out and write down all the values for each item so i could work out what would work best. 
4. Upgrades, Upgrading anything in this game is a chore, I gave up with doing ships as it was way to much hardwork due to the rules that have been put in place. Upgrading colonies and space stations is also a pain in the arse as you need to upgrade each component and switching screens is slow. You also cant see if they need upgrading unless you go into the component screen.
5. The Economy, The tutorial really only get you into the mechanics of the game. It does not really help you understand the Economy and how you start to build a stable faction. You need to go to Wikis for that. I had to restart a few times as i just kept running out of influence.

I really want to like this game. It has so many good ideas, the Agents, the Space combat. But there is way to much, as is you get bigger more of the earth stuff should be automate able (or at least you should be able to assign management to agents). 

I cant recommend it in its current state, its just way to much hard work. It needs some UX work and some simplification. 

I will probably come back to this in a few months if the game gets some Quality of life updates.

There is absolutely no way to stop the harassment and no way to get an organized start which will always affect down game play... in fact I have never even gotten to the point where I felt like I could make a real combat ship because planetside operations were consuming everything I could do.

TLDR: If you like strategy games, you should strongly consider this game. If you like a space-themed flavour in your strategy games, watch the tutorial. Sleep on it. Then buy it.

The Good / Great
+ Shaping geopolitics / nation building is a lot of fun.
+ Finally getting your spaceships upgraded is SO rewarding
+ The opportunities for different strategic choices both in space and on earth are significant and meaningful
+ Upgrading your council people is meaningful, balancing them is important and you come to like them
+ You truly have a sense of running a sophisticated organization with a unique and dedicated mission
+ Resources are all important, some are critical.
+ The AI fights back at you, but not exclusively or outrageously, it also fights itself at the same time. It's a legitimate 6 way tug of war.
+ The primary ""headline"" research categories are intuitive, and you can chart your course to certain unlocks. Hello antimatter torpedos.
+ It's Early Access but I have only come across one bug in 125h.
+ Game sounds and music are spot on
+ I've only played one faction so far (Humanity First), but the storyline is awesome. The writing is frequently hilarious.

The Ok
~ People will tell you the UI is *horrible*...this is an over statement. It takes a bit, but honestly it's not bad.
~ You do really benefit from reading the tutorial and watching the steam videos on how to play the game. I probably would've struggled without this.
~ Sometimes the space station audio stays with you even when you go back to Earth. Minor. 
~ Some stuff is unclear. E.g., An alien mining colony seems to have a defense value of 76K, but I can raid it with my elite marines even if my fleet value is 15K. However, I'd be blasted to smithereens if I attempted to bombard it. Which kind of makes sense (stealth vs. bombardment)...but there was no way of knowing until I figured...f it...let's try to assault it anyways.

The Painful bits
- Understanding and comparing sub projects projects in the research tree is only partially intuitive which leaves you guessing at times. Which nuclear missile is better? Which ship drive is better? (until antimatter it's pretty much Ion drive all the way...or I think it is? But I probably researched about 6 drives coming to this conclusion)...You can kind of guess from the stats what is better...but you have to understand each stat, which you don't necessarily understand or understand how it exactly relates to a game mechanic. Overall, it's not bad. But sometimes you're just like ...welll....let's try this one and then it can be a Homer Simpson-esque ""doh"" moment.
- In the ship design, you can designate certain components as obsolete, but the auto design still uses them. Is this because they are better? Or ...is something broken? Manually designing your ships is fun...but sometimes you just want to stop replacing all the components that it will autopick.
- Sometimes your ships are clearly superior to a station and you can unload 25x nuclear missiles on it...but somehow it still survives. I'm not sure why. You might always need marines. But again, I'm not sure.
- At 125 hours I have just about finished ONE playthrough. It's a double edged sword. It is so so seriously satisfying to advance and at the same time, I could go for a 50-80h playthrough vs. 125-150h.",1672725544,1672725544,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Terra Invicta is a MONUMENTAL achievement in the Grand Strategy genre, with limitless promise and a high degree of moddability. At the same time, it really demands a lot from you, time- and patience-wise.

To put it mechanically, the game works in increments of one to two week ""mission phases,"" where you assign jobs to your Councilors—people of great power and importance who Get Things Done. Councilors are your primary source of agency and action economy. They get you control of Earth's nations, investigate other factions' Councilors, perform assaults, assassinations & sabotage, and conduct diplomacy—because yes, you have to physically send your Councilor to set up a meeting with a faction's leaders through one of their own Councilors, you can't just press a Diplomacy button and start talks. Councilors have a handful of stats that influence their ability to Get Things Done, all of which work on dice rolls and percentiles, and the game tells you what roll you got so you'll know by just how many points you succeeded or failed in controlling China's state security apparatus. You'll spend most of your time managing your team of up to 6 Councilors, but thankfully, you can also put them on ""Permanent Assignment"" to repeat certain missions (like increasing public opinion) without requiring you to assign it again.

I won't talk about all the game's mechanics, though. Suffice to say they work well and intuitively. Now I want to talk about Aliens. Not the movie, the actual alien threat. Don't think for a second that you've leveled the playing field just because you started building battlecruisers. The aliens are LEAGUES ahead of you in technology from the jump, and nowhere is this more prominent than their engines. What do I mean by that? I mean they're using Ducted Fusion Torch Drives when you're still stuck with Solid Core NERVA Fission Drives. I mean they can reach your space stations in orbit in hours when your fleets may take days. I mean they can hit you wherever and whenever they want, and until you secure technological parity, until you have a grand presence throughout the solar system, they will be able to smack you easily just by getting there first. And even when you build up, you always have to balance it and be careful, because going too fast and hard will make the aliens come at you directly.

Took 4 resets before I got there, and some help along the way (watching some Youtubers play to see where I went wrong). This game is really 3 games in one (other might argue more, but for this description, I'm sticking with 3).

1) Risk, but substantially more complicated.  Although you CAN conquer other nations with armies to get their control points (or to merge into mega nations), most of your conquest will be non-military.  Lots of dice rolls, although you can spend resources to up your chances, or you can save scum (no shame, we all do it; the one's who say they don't are lying).  Train your counselors to make them better at dice rolls, find orgs that natively improve your dice rolls, try to avoid being the target of other factions' dice rolls, and occasionally kill other faction's counselors.  Also watch for aliens/alien flora/megafauna, and try to kill/capture them here (won't be able to kill/capture aliens right away, need certain techs for it).

2) Economy/Nation simulator: Once you take over control points, then the really complicated fun begins.  Each nation has a TON of stats (type of government, GDP, income inequality, national cohesion, nation education, military strength, naval strength, national unrest, etc).  You have to allocate investment points to adjust/improve it.  How you do so is up to you, although neglecting certain aspects increases risk of losing the point/nation.  Want to make China a democracy? You can.  Want to turn the EU into a totalitarian money-generator, also can.  Can unite Africa, re-establish the USSR/Eastern Block, can divide India, can unify all of North America.  This is also where you build up research to research global and faction specific techs, and where you work on your space race (stations, planet/asteroid colonies w/ mines, etc).  Lots of number crunching, not entirely intuitive at first.

3) Space War: Newtonian space combat rules; combat by way of the Expanse, rather than Star Wars/Star Trek.  It can be very complicated (adjusting pitch, thrust, yaw, ship facing, etc); I still struggle with it even after studying the skirmish tutorial a couple of times.  Fortunately, multiple builds exist where you can just make a phalanx of your ships going straight, and let the enemies run into you, so doesn't prevent you from playing the game if you don't want to go full Newton.  This is where all the space tech and stations/resources you accumulate during the economy part of the game let you build/design/upgrade ships to fight the Aliens (or the other human factions, if you play the *ugh* Servants).

Overall, closest comparison I can make is a hybrid of (Firaxis's) XCOM and Stellaris.  All of the systems and details of Stellaris, within a single solar system and with the ""Fight back and develop against the Alien threat"" theme of XCOM.  Other than the start of the game (8-10 turn cycles, I think), the game runs on 2-week turn timers, although space combat is real-time (can be sped-up or slowed, if desired).

Pros:
-If you like detail-oriented and immersive sim games, you'll love this.  
-If you liked the slow, methodical gameplay required from XCOM/XCOM 2's Long War mods, you'll also like this (makes sense, this is the studio that made Long War)
-Some optional parts of space combat; can either try to plot out crazy arcs and facings for more ""realistic"" combat, or can just go phalanx if you don't want to get that involved per combat.
-More to combat than just the ""fleet strength"" numbers, good tactics or good ship builds can vastly outperform higher scored enemy fleets (game rewards smart builds/play)
-Good variety of factions to play as (7 human factions, can't currently play as Aliens), each with different win conditions and a relatively unique feel to each.  Most will have similar early games (tech up, grab small nations to build up to big nations, etc), but all with distinct end-game goals and techs.

Maybe Con (depends on you):
-LOTS of reading, both tutorial and in-game.  100% a text-based game, and if you don't like that, you'll hate this (I don't hate this, but I know a lot will).  Minimal cut-scenes, more done as slide-show format (and only at start and end of campaigns).
-Single session to completion takes a long time.  Best I could do was completing in 2052 (you start in 2021); with optimization I think I could get it to high 40's, but that's still a lot of playtime.  Personally, I didn't mind it, but definitely not a speed-run game.

Cons:
-Tutorial tries to explain everything (and it's not overtly bad), but information overload and sequencing make it difficult.  Honestly, you're better off trying a throw-away run to learn basic mechanics, before starting a serious run.  Also, you're more likely to benefit from watching some Youtubers play to see where you might be making mistakes.
-Contrary to what the game might suggest, you HAVE to start with 1 of the 4 major nations if you want to have any chance.  You need one of the US, Russia, China, or the EU (which you need to unify as a single block if you don't want to get crushed by your control point cap early game).  +/- India as another, but it takes a little bit of build time to get to India up to 6CP status, so if you start with them you're probably already behind the AI.
-While there are few truly ""useless"" techs in the game, there's a lot of redundancy.  Probably because you don't always control what path global tech takes, so the devs didn't want you locked out of certain progression.  But if you aren't paying attention to what you already researched (or didn't get hints from other players about what to focus/avoid), you're going to waste time chasing down techs that don't help you and take you away from what you really needed.  This is most commonly seen with drive techs (i.e. 20-30 early drive techs, but I focus 3 and usually ignore the rest).
-DO NOT use Autoresolve for anything other than combats you expect to lose (i.e. aliens chase down an unarmored scout ship).  Fleets that I've reliably used to take down Alien fleets larger than mine get nuked on autoresolve, and I've had bigger/better fleets than the Aliens' also get nuked by autoresolve.  Not sure if it has to do with how it calculates missile fire (and your point defense against it) in autoresolve vs real-time combat, but you always seem to be at a disadvantage there.
-Some factions end-game requirements can feel a bit grindy (get alien's fleet power < 25% of all available fleet power in solar system, own 75% of all CP on Earth, etc).

Overall:
-10/10 for me, but I'm the right market for this game; not everyone is going to be
    If you like grand strategy or tactical games (XCOM, Total War games, anything by Paradox): Strong recommend
    If you're more of a direct action gamer (Sports Sim, COD, Platformers): might not be for you, but can always give it a try
    If your unsure, check a Youtuber playthrough (Perun has a few at this point, I think) for 1 or 2 episodes, will give you a pretty good idea

I feel it's worth the time sink, definitely feel like I got my money's worth, and overall enjoyed a unique game type I haven't played before.  Probably going to wait a bit before I try another playthrough, though.

Additional: It's Early Access, but only really by technicality; the game was feature complete at launch.  Most updates have just been fixes/adjustment tweaks.  I think the only additional content that might be pending is scenario starts (i.e. starting with some already established space resources).

Terra Invicta is three early access games in one—an incredibly in-depth, accurate, and detailed geopolitical simulator that pits seven human ideologies against one another, a much simpler and more reasonable space industrialization simulator, and an impenetrable space combat simulator game that you’ll only ever see by playing the absolute shit out of the first two games—all while an alien invasion of the Sol system is going on. The game's main geopolitical layer is endlessly engaging, with a level of detail similar to Hearts of Iron or Victoria 3.

But the geopolitical cramfest doesn’t fall away to make room for the next layer of alien-fighting gameplay. So while you’re fighting a critical space battle, a lucky roll by the AI could coup d’etat one of your crucial countries, and you’re now juggling the unification of central America with how many UV lasers you can get down range before the aliens pulverize to atoms the fleet it took you 15 in-game years to build. And a restart isn't a simple thing--it's a 20-40 hour process to get back to building fleets that can take on the aliens.

So, It’s a grand strategy game that’s too grand and complex with an overwhelmingly large challenge, but that’s not its main problem. The game is too random for even a seasoned player to play well each time, and there are enough balance issues with the base game that replaying isn’t as rewarding as it should be. It’s too easy to overthrow years of work with an unlucky roll—or a lucky roll, depending on your perspective, and the game is so long you’re going to get some unlucky rolls in there. Imagine my surprise when I realized that a game that clearly wants to be the doctoral candidate in physics and political science spiritual successor to XCOM turns out to have the same random number generation problems. The RNG mechanics really keep it from providing alpha-level story generation much of the time.

On top of that, the playable ideologies aren’t ideologies so much as reactions to the alien arrival. They’re reactions to the presence of aliens, which is fine, but four of the factions seem to be the light and heavy versions of the same reaction—the Resistance and Humanity First are ""resist"" and the Protectorate and the Servants (terrible name by the way) are ""submit."" Since these groups have so much in common, they really ought to be easier to work together with, but they aren’t, because not much effort was put into the diplomacy system. The others are a grab bag of leftovers that are not as interesting to play. We should have gotten more variety rather than the light and heavy resist submit, in my view—or a faction that straight up denies that the aliens exist publicly. 

Now I’m finished tearing it apart, because it absolutely is fun to play. There’s little more satisfying than when after 10 years of carefully manipulating Earth politics and building bases on and around the Moon, you launch your first, shitty little ship to get vaporized by alien plasma cannons. Kudos to the devs for including Lagrange points and recognizing their significance for space settlement, and for pretty easily breaking down resources and making the space settlement part of the game fun, even if the graphics for that part look like they belong in 1996. But back to the positives.

My god, I love the councilor system, and I wish more games had this. Organizations are not mechanical devices that you can set and forget—they are made up of people, who have loyalties and weak points--and apparently can buy the CIA. Seriously though, some of the best parts of the game are when you save enough influence or money to buy organizations like Livermore National Labs or the obvious SpaceX clones that pop up in the game. In one game, I took over Sweden just so I could buy a space company based there. More of that type of gameplay might have made it a decent story generator—""Hey honey, I used the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to research space lasers, and my Pakistani ISI spy managed to murder an alien in Alberta."" Chef's kiss story generation, RNG need not apply.

I've already mentioned XCOM mentioned as a spiritual predecessor for this game, but the truth is that Sid Meyer’s Alpha Centauri is just as much an inspiration for this game as XCOM. From the factions and their leaders, the little speeches and personal details about them when certain technologies are researched, and even their little logos, this game is dripping with nostalgia for Alpha Centauri a lot more than grotesque imitators like Sid Meyer’s Beyond Civilization, of which we will. Not. Speak. 

The worst part was the realization that I’m never going to finish Terra Invicta, because I love the game. I’ve blown up the galaxy as ruthless annihilators in Stellaris, I’ve built huge kingdoms in Crusader Kings III, and I’ve won on Diety in Civ VI. But I have a family now, and Terra Invicta is just one hill I’m not willing to climb. More accurately I climb the hill and then there are two more, taller hills that randomly change shape, like that dream I have where I’m on Legends of the Hidden Temple and I have to climb the Agrocrag.

So is Terra Invicta worth playing? Absolutely. Rarely is a game this detailed and interesting, and rarely is a review for a game that I’ve spent so much time playing over a short amount of time so negative when I enjoyed most of my time playing it. 

My complaints in this review come from a place of love for Terra Invicta, and what it’s trying to be, but it isn’t there yet. You have to make some compromises between gameplay and realism, and compromise is nowhere to be found in Terra Invicta.",1670895100,1672353329,True,242,2,0.9352530837059021,0,True,False,True

The way I see it it's all there. Complexity, multiple planes of operations (agents/space), super realistic, giant and interesting research tree. The story is great. That being said there are a few design elements that are so bad that they make the game hardly enjoyable after early stage. 

1. The UI. It's a monster and I think the worst thing in the game right now - the windows pop open AFTER the animations so you misclick all the time, agent focus switches automatically to a random agent after you select an action and so on. This bloats game-time and makes the player wait for the anims which is not what you want if said anims are to be seen ten thousand times during a playthrough. 
2. Performance - the game slows down, a lot and you end up in small freezes. Definitely ruins the experience.
3. Repetitiveness - while early game with agents is super fun, holding on to your territory after that stage is an unpleasant chore. Adding mechanisms to permanently destroy factions or to have the option for ceasefire would be great. 
4. Let me declare war even if I don't have access to a country. I'd like to nuke it for example.
5. How initial fleet positioning works is a mystery to everyone. Please just allow us to select a formation and see how it will look.
6. Mid game drives are practically all the same and that's really disappointing.

That's my feedback, hope it gets to you and you make a fantastic game out of this!

I am back to playing and I suggest to new people to not get to used to their saves if they're learning.

But when you get into the swing of this game, it's magical. It has great balance and only needs better tool-tips to teach the players what they need (like how much DV and speed is needed to force fights, which is about double/30DV.)
Also tips for new players to prevent softlocks and spoilers: 
1. Nuke missiles are terrible for fighting bases, but one hit will blow them up. This means that if the ship sending it lives, bombardments are a one hit kill.
2. Money costs scale. Boost/funding is not a waste, and Boost can be traded for money via space resorts/care
3. Most weight issues will come from reactors/radiators. Sometimes the difference between 100(0)s of tons is different reactors/radiators because of the ton/gigawatt ratios

Stay away from this game, the following summarizes my experience:

- You will see the worst UI in a 4k strategy game ever seen for the last 10 years.
- The space combat is very very terribly implemented. Controlling ships are disgustingly hideously terrible. Retro thrusters, anyone? Just make it simple dammit. Homeworld had achieved it back in 1999. Who ever designed space combat part of the game is the biggest letdown of this project.
- After you give your orders to your agents, every completed action pauses the turn. FFS implement a summary screen for agent interactions in the beginning of the next one and do not DO NOT pause the game! Let it run, so i do not have to hit continue 50 times!
- The game balance is all over the place.
- I do not understand why but there is a 'Zoom' problem to almost everything. Camera controls are terrible.
- Outpost interactions are very very limited, i am disappointed. You will find yourself using your cellphone for calculating the power needs of the modules when you retrofit or build a new outpost / station. The UI simply punishes you.
- There are so many module options, but only a handfull of them are valid. Module features are not properly explained.

7 factions and the choice is yours, You can chose from a coward to chad. The start can be a bit annoying because there is a lot of operative action but also give you the opportunity to develop a strategy. After some time you realize that tech-Tree is bigger then you mom and have a lot of depth AND cant research everything. This combined and a bit more makes the game have a high repeatability.

when it comes to countries and operatives. Its fun and boring some times a bit repetitive and sometimes you see your country go to civil war rating. Its a bit mangey when you control more then 3-4 countries, Everything from investment to ideology/faction control. AI sometimes also wanna fight for the country and that can be intense.  

Its a cool grand strategy when it uses launch-windows and it is a way to save on delta-V. That is some nerdy shit but practically Delta-v is the chance in velocity, The less fuel burning the more efficient and therefore more delta-v. Some ships are gonna trade delta-v to Acceleration/maneuverability to have a better preferment in combat and other ships need the delta-v for the range. Especially starter engines. One part of ship design that makes it very interesting. you design ships for a cause

but there are quality of life thingys that should be implemented. like a list of planets/asteroid so you can see what astro-objects you have surveyed ect. it can be hard to track when you come start have outpost in the inner-asteroid field. Sadly are the characters not wifu material

Bit of a steep learning curve but well worth persevering.  

Once you get your head around it and the UI it's one of these 'one more turn' games.

Edit:  I've finally finished a full play through as the Resistance, which I started in mid-October.

Initially the game was confusing and felt disjointed.

Then it moved into a roller coaster stage where huge disasters were followed by triumphant comebacks.  During this stage I seriously believed I would play over and over again as each faction.

After subduing the other factions and some early results in space the game entered the first big grind stage.   I was expanding in space, defending against spam single spaceship attacks on my bases by the aliens, whilst researching decent engines.  This stage took weeks.

Then it was into grind stage number 2.  Now I was strong enough to go after the many alien fleets and bases.  This stage also took weeks but was slightly more interesting than the previous phase.

And then the final anticlimax of the game.  An agent mission to close the wormhole.  No final battle, just a verbose dialogue telling me a little story about how the fight went.  Game over.

Well it was a great run and well worth the money.  But I don't think I'll be playing it again any time soon.   

The main failing of the game is a lack of any effective AI.  Although the enemy seems unbeatable at first that's just because of the alien technical superiority.  

As I started capturing bases it soon became obvious that the AI was incapable of responding in any meaningful way and just operated to it's script of spamming small fleets attacks which were easily repulsed once a system was in place.  I never saw the enemy trying seriously to recapture a base. 

So a great game in many ways, great concept, and worth buying.  But let down by almost non-existant AI and a final mission which is a damp squib.",1664629486,1672139336,True,1,0,0.427402853965759277,0,True,False,True

In the early-early game, about the first 5-10 hours or so, pacing is fine (on the first run). New stuff happens, it's cool. Then, when you slowly begin to build your first stations and outposts, the pacing crawls to a halt. I've spend several hours just... Maintaining control of the same few nations. I get that feeling that ""eventually, something really cool will happen!"", but until then, there's just a big void of nothing. It takes like 1+ year to get something up to Mars and yet you have to place your councilors every half month. That means you have to place councilors a whopping 24-36 times and then skip ahead in time until the interesting thing happens so that you can finally do the other interesting thing at an equally slow pace. This is several hours of in-game time spent waiting.

It would help A LOT if I only had to place council commands every month at this stage. Because as it is, it's just a whole lot of waiting. And it would cut that waiting and tedium down a lot, especially with an extra speed setting.

The speed issue is also terrible for replay value. When playing something like Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis, you can get something impressive and interesting done in less than 10 hours. That's just not really possible here. The most exciting thing that you can do in that time is to control a larger nation or two and begin the construction of a platform or three and that's about it. The early game was interesting the first time around, but I highly doubt it'd be as fun the second time around.

The pacing of the game is EXTREMELY SLOW, and the game UI/UX hides a lot of information and lacks a lot of Quality of life that makes it extremely frustrating when combined with the mind numbing repetition.

The game may seem complex at first due the everything dumped on you from the get go and the  overbloated research tree which is poorly presented and contains tech that nearly all of it power creeps each other and only exists to drag the game and burn time to get through it.
However once you are passed the initial ""shock"" you quickly find out that there is not much to do.

Space combat is very mundane and basic, you can control your ships in 3 dimensions and give them various vectors and directions but it is very clunky to do so and due to poor balancing and implementation, can be completely ignored and dumbed down to just pointing your ships towards the enemy and just sit and watch the outcome with no input.

The idea waking up tomorrow and learning we have a few years to prepare before aliens, who have already begun operations on Earth, invade and try to subjugate our entire race is a really cool jumping off point for a strategy game. From a gameplay perspective it creates distinct phases of the game where you begin with a focus on geopolitics and espionage, an early mid game where you're mostly launching probes, establishing a few orbital habitats and exploring, a mid game of aggressive expansion as you begin to colonize the rest of the solar system and a late game focusing on the war everyone has been preparing for. It gives a more dynamic playthrough and makes things really interesting the first time you play because there's a constant sense of discovery. 

So in my opinion, where does it go wrong?

Unfortunately, the core gameplay is the biggest issue with the game. Kinda hard one to fix. You'll spend the overwhelming majority of your play time repeating the same councilor actions over and over again with minor variations as you investigate miscellaneous alien activity. If it weren't for the constant popups that stop time until you dismiss them you could pretty much set your councilors to repeat their respective actions, defend all your control points then walk away from your computer for a full in game year and you would barely miss anything. 

But the fact that the core gameplay is repetitive and boring is hardly the only issue with it. Every action your councilors take is entirely determined by RNG. It's a strategy game where every meaningful outcome is determined by luck. You can manipulate the odds by spending resources to boost your chance of succeeding, but beyond that the only ""strategy"" involved is ""duh I use the councilor with high investigation skill for the action that requires high investigation"". In a grand strategy game where every decision can have considerable long term consequences it feels *incredibly* unsatisfying to play well and not be rewarded because you got unlucky, or to misplay and avoid being punished because you just got lucky.

And speaking of long term consequences, here's another issue with the core mechanics of this game in the form of a personal experience- I decided to try to control Russia and form the Eurasian Union. I got my early foothold, fought for the control points until I had them all, defended my interests, kept boosting my faction opinion and invested heavily for the late game. Basically no short term income, nothing in funding and hardly anything in spoils. Purely focusing on maintaining the existing military, boosting GDP, lowering inequality and rushing knowledge with direct investments. I spent a dozen real life hours committing heavily to this strategy which revolved around starting slow to hit an economic boom in the midgame, with most of my power on Earth heavily concentrated in the Eurasian Union. Well 13 years into the game my best councilor somehow managed to get themselves detained. They were my only councilor with defend interests, and my defense in the Eurasian Union just expired. Humanity First IMMEDIATELY takes a control point and defends the next week before I can crackdown. The next week they take another. Now 2/5ths of my entire strategy on Earth belongs to them. I spent 13 years (312 action phases with 5 councilors or around 1500 actions) building the Eurasian Union up, and with one unlucky detain it took another faction 1 month to ruin it in 4 actions. The only other option is to reload an older save and fire a really good councilor that I've spend hours leveling up so I can get another one with defend interests. Either way, one detainment that was entirely out of my control results in me losing hours and hours of time investment forever. Because I made one small mistake literally 12 hours of gameplay ago (not making sure to recruit another councilor with the defend interests action) my entire strategy is screwed, and I wasted hours of my time playing a game that I had no idea I had basically lost in the first 20 minutes of the game.

So as much as I like the idea, I can't see how they could fix something that I believe to be so poorly done that is such a core mechanic of the game. I have no hope for this game whatsoever, the issues I have with the game are so fundamental to the gameplay it would be easier to scrap the entire game and start from scratch than trying to fix them. 

Oh, and one of the most interesting parts of the game that it genuinely does really well is the story. Learning what the aliens are, what their plans are, what their motivations are, where they come from, how each faction proposes to deal with them, etc., it really makes you want to keep playing to learn more. And that's great the first playthrough. But when you get a 4X game you want replayability. While the lack of story doesn't make it impossible to enjoy replaying this game, I would say the story is one of the strongest points of the game so understand you will likely never enjoy this game as much as you do the first time you play it.",1671887402,1671887402,False,135,12,0.674173831939697266,15,True,False,True

Here were some issues that I felt were the most problematic in the game's current state:

- After a certain point, it became impossible to reduce alien aggression. I was in 2055 and had all the tech needed to wreck alien ships but big problem; the aliens were sending a steady stream of (eventually) 30 or so fleets to attack all of my mining bases. Fending off the attacks was not the issue, but it became impossible to have the resources to continue building and sustaining my fleets with having to constantly rebuild at my bases. I spent close to 20 years in the game doing this constant cycle of fending off attacks and rebuilding all while trying to build a fleet that just gets wrecked by a 8k alien war fleet. It got pretty depressing after a while ngl :(
- The huge redundancy in this game; the technology tree and list of tech to research. If you don't know what you're doing its VERY easy to waste time researching obsolete technology and overall becomes a waste of time for you as well.
- When the Alien Administration makes it's way to Earth, pray they don't land in a country with nukes and take over. They will nuke you non-stop with all of their supply to stop you from invading their capital and overall wreck the global GDP and climate.
- Space battle mechanics are still kind of wonky but overall work. Ship commands are good but maneuvering needs more detailed explanations

The game is both too simple and too complex. Most of the displayed information is not represented well in context for the user to understand, and some vital information is just not present at all. The game is run like a spreadsheet, with equations everywhere; but little information for the player to understand what equates to what without multiple playthroughs which can easily turn into a chore before fun for the casual gamer.


I can go about pros and cons, but lets go over what needs improvement,
- UI. The UI seems very outdated and too much info or most of the time not enough is available to see. I’m sure people would love to see progressionary charts & more info on how many space debris are in orbit.
- Camera. Please stop having the camera snap to each councilor after assigning a mission. I see myself clicking the next counselor I want to assign a mission to multiple times because I know the game will jump me around. Sometimes I'll be looking around the solar system and BAM, right back to earth to send my counselor somewhere else. Give us the option to turn snapping off.

- RTS or BTS? You tell me. I do not understand why the devs implemented a system of 2 weeks in order for councilors to finish tasks. I firmly believe the tasks should have a time range of completion, and after completion the counselor can be assigned elsewhere. Because of councilors only being able to have a task every 2 weeks the game will pause and force the player to assign actions. However, fleet actions can be taken at any time, making it feel like a BTS game for Earth, and a RTS for space. Over the course of multiple campaigns I find myself speeding through the 2 week process to assign new tasks, making the ame feel like a BTS early game and an annoying BTS/RTS later game,  it is repetitive and a killer way to bore one out. ..ie.. I set my counselor to assassinate a target which can take from 21-28 days. The target is on a control nation which can finish between 14-21 days. If I do not have enough knowledge of what the target is doing he can potentially leave and live to see another day before the assassination can take effect since his mission is shorter and he could leave for another country. If my counselor is not assigned a new task after completing the last then tough luck, don't pause the game and clip the camera to them.

- Countries. I understand there are countries in the world that are better than others, but in this game it REALLY is one of two that you HAVE to control inorder to win, and because of their populations that's China or India. Both countries' massive population is an easy way for the Aliens to win, which are almost always guaranteed to be in control of the aliens if not the player by 2040. (Both times I’ve lost before 2045 was because Aliens took both China and India, along with other minor countries around the world). It would be great to see more economic realities, like people crossing borders to other countries due to a coup, aliens taking over, nukes flying, famine, global warming, or what have you.

- Notification. The notification bar on the right side is so cluttered it is almost impossible to keep track of worldly events. Listen, I know a lot is going on in the world and little things matter, but when a popup is coming up every 2 seconds people tend just to ‘OK’ them and shrug them off. These need to be a better way to display important notifications like war being declared against a player's nation, rather than anytime a nation goes to war. …ei… 3 days before the end of the month..  War was declared by the aliens in Panama! *SKIP*  War was declared by the aliens in Sudan!*SKIP* War was declared by the aliens in the EU (My nation)!*SKIP*  War was declared by the aliens in India! *SKIP* **Fast forwards the rest of the 2 days**.  Ahhhh, time to assign new tasks to my councilors,,, wait, why are the aliens 20 stacked on my EU capital!?! Yea, it’ll happen to you just wait.

Listen, it's 3am, I’m heading to bed, there is a lot more to be said. I hope to update this review in the future for the better.

The major strength of the game are:

- [b]The setting / story[/b] starting from present day (2022), grounding it in reality and introducing aliens into the mix. It's unusually story rich for a game in this style and does a good job at engaging the player with the story.

- [b]Variety in gameplay[/b], from slowly introducing first a more intrigue based strategy to later also offering tactical space combat. This is accompanied by a generous research tree and the opening up from earth-based to solar solar-system wide operation.

Some problems are (keep in mind that the game is still in early access at the time of writing):
- The game can sometimes crash when you try to load a save that seemed fine when you left. As far as I can tell that mostly happens when a fleet assumes a temporary orbit after combat (which can be avoided).
- The strategy side doesn't play as smoothly as e.g. Stellaris due to a slightly to verbose UI.
- Although I appreciate the difficulty of implementing 6DOF combat, the space tactics interface seems unnecessarily cluttered and fiddly. I just avoided maneuvering.
- Some mechanics still need work to feel less cheesy / annoying (e,g, coups, orbital bombardment)
- Endgame win conditions for some factions seem weirdly at odds with their position in the story. This could also have to do with the rather simplistic diplomacy system between human factions.
- Some pacing issues with the game dragging on a little in late early game and (for the factions with the weird win conditions) the end game. If I hadn't chosen the Academy for my playthrough, I could have had the same amount of enjoyment in about half the time I took (150 h).

I wish there was a third option to these kinds of reviews. I know that AAA games nowadays are getting released as incomplete and buggy but I don’t like lowering my standards. At the same time, I believe this early access game has potential and the developers seem dedicated to this project. I would hope that they would fix, debug, and add more features to this game by its full release date. This is definitely something worth looking into further down the line, especially if you are an Expanse fan (Any modders reading this, I hope you're thinking what I'm thinking). 

This game basically has 3 phases depending on your faction: Claim and Influence Countries, Build a Space Economy, A Full War in Space (basically you do whatever achieves your faction's win conditions.  I've restarted and made several attempts to complete a game. I eventually gave in after several late-game crashes and lack of quality of life features.

There are two big things I want to bring up first. In the beginning of the game you can reveal your faction and info about it to gain some influence which can help with claiming countries or recruitment. With the game at its current state, I don't see any good reason for staying in the shadows and not getting that influence especially when it is far too easy to get faction intel or that info being readily available. This event makes me believe and hope that Devs plan to have the factions unknown and perhaps blank slates in the beginning of the game. Hear me out and imagine that scenario. When it is revealed that aliens did not come in peace, you definitively choose the path of your faction: protect humanity, leave (Exodus), surrender and submit to the aliens (Serpentis). If two or more factions choose the same path and have the same goals, you either work together and nations and people split their support to both your shared cause or you sabotage the other faction to gain more support. As certain events (ie abductions, the first destruction of alien assets by humans and vice versa, alien land invasion) occur, the protect humanity factions publicly refine their goals as people start moving towards the extreme ends of the spectrum. Going back to there being too much public info on other factions, maybe make it such that investigating a specific counselor sufficiently reveals specific info. For example, investigate a scientist enough and you gradually learn their faction’s finished and current engineering project. Sufficiently investigate a faction’s astronaut and you learn which ships and stations that faction owns. You investigate a faction's diplomat or a politician, you learn what control points they have and their priorities. If the priorities have spoils, maybe there's a small bonus to crackdown on that nation or control point. 

I know there are a lot of features not in the game. I checked the roadmap released back in September and there doesn’t seem to be a hint of something like this and it's unlikely to be added into the game. I just needed a faucet to get these thoughts out. Nevertheless, this event and its choices don’t make sense to me in terms of gameplay unless there’s some degree of espionage planned in the future.


A couple things to note. It would be nice if on any orbit infographic on the left-side of the screen show what fleets are en-route to that orbit and if those fleets are being intercepted. I also saw the win conditions for the Academy, which is supposedly similar to the Initiative. It’s kind of absurd. I have been persistently researching the control point increase project since the 2035s and I’m pretty sure I would need to start nuking countries to reach those win conditions in a timely manner . This doesn’t exactly align with the Academy’s passive nature. 

I’m glad the devs are nerfing Mercury research strat by adding a mission control cost to research campuses in the next update. Having too much active mission control would trigger alien retaliation. IMO I think they should nerf it by setting the bonus as a percentage like the categorical sciences bonuses instead of a defined amount. It doesn't make sense that thousands of scientists trapped in tin foil rooms in the vacuum of space surrounded by radiation would outperform the research output of the United States at game start with hundreds of millions of people on a planet where the quality of life is better and safer. 

I know this change significantly impacts research and prolongs the game but this wouldn’t be an issue if the player isn’t exclusively responsible for global research. The fact that the AI tends to push a lot of the high-research output democracies into totalitarian military nations does not help. Then there’s the spoiling/corruption priority for fast cash they always seem to go for. The AI, the need/use for cash, and, perhaps, research needs a rework. Maybe make all available global research progress slowly to a certain fraction and each faction is free to accelerate or complete the available research.

The upcoming mega-nation, aka map painting, nerf is something I can understand. There were definitely benefits with this strategy. Instead of defending several nations you just defend one and you get more out of the economy and knowledge priorities because of the increased population. The scale of these mega-nations and the steps to achieve them were kinda bizarre and, even after the nerf, unrealistic. If I unify via conquest I feel like unrest should constantly be pushed to civil war for years especially if nations absolutely hate each other like Taiwan and China or Russia and Poland. If I try to unify via diplomacy, that should take a long time in which the absorber spends GDP to the benefit of the absorbed or something, which results in a slightly-more stable super-nation but needs a counselor's attention. Benefits should remain but it shouldn't be so easy or the benefits so readily available. As of now, the cohesion problem that arises from mega-nations could be easily fixed by setting priorities in unity correctly and direct investment. 

Then there’s boosts. They’re important in the beginning to set up a space economy but become irrelevant  in the mid and late game. I’m pretty sure there are others that pointed this out. It would be nice to set up a space resource management system where you use boosts to transport materials to different orbits. This could give a purpose to the supply depot which is functionally inferior to the space dock/yard/works.

Lastly the ground-to-space defenses. I don’t know if the science behind it is plausible. I would think that the atmosphere will degrade the laser damage to be negligible or the laser itself would destroy the ozone layer. If the defenses are projectile, the atmosphere would definitely alter the trajectory and thus make it in-accurate. I feel like orbital space coilgun stations exclusively to Earth like the ones in the Expanse would be plausible. That of course sets up the issue of it being used against other ground nations or other faction stations…I’m just throwing ideas around. 

In summary, I definitely think this game is worth looking into in the future. I know that I’ve put in a lot of ideas and requests in this review but I don’t expect the developers to accept my ideas as gospel. I’ve played 700 hours since this game came out. I would love to continue playing this game as the goals listed on the roadmap are checked and the game is further improved.

Now that that's out of the way.

The BAD

The UI needs A LOT of work, the menus are a pain to navigate and assigning missions to your councilors is sometime a chore. When it comes to assigning people missions it will always go to the last country you have selected not where they're currently at. Space combat is confusing. The limit for countries you can control is too low without mods. There needs to be a menu where you can see a list of all the bodies in the solar system and be able to sort them out by what they are, where they are, and if they are currently in an Earth launch window. The AI know and are able to capitalize on it. I have to guess and because of that I am behind in space mining. And without space mining you can not build ships. 

THE GOOD

Now that the nasty crap is out of the way: For a game in Early Access it is incredibly stable. In all 30 hours, even with mods, it has never crashed or lagged.

It is hard to compare to other strategy games.  What lured me was the concept of conquering space, what has hooked me, it is like playing a combination of two TV series Colony and the Expanse at the same time.  Now that I have a few hours in let me go deeper.

If you are a strategy game player like me lots of blood and death for your enemies, screw that whole lets build a common vision together and learn to co-exist.  Well, I have not solved that one yet.  The aliens are FAR more advanced, and build ships like they give berth to them. Around the year 2030 I can generally muster five ships with an average attack score of about 60 with little combat acceleration, while the evil looking ones are flying ships called, ""Dark Avenger"" with attack scores of 800.  Them bitches I call the ""alien cock suckers"", are always going to war with me slowing my progress on earth.  

Technology moves soooooooooooooo, slow.  It is like Albert Einstein and his like from the Third Reich where recruited in operation Paperclip and sent into hiding in Antarctica or something, because the current ilk of scientist on earth seem like they failed the third grade. If you want hope of developing ships and habs in space you need to get construction module, VASMIR, shipyard, and some weapons like rail guns, and Hades torpedoes as fast as you can. Even then by the time you get a destroyer size ship well equipped you still are NO match for the aliens. 

What I have painfully learned in my 141 hours of game play so far is that persistence, trial and error, and giving my brain time to think through so many problems are very good skill sets to have. I am sure that over another few hundred of hours of game play I will finally get those purple looking red nerve hanging demons sent back to whatever planet spawned them.  Until that time I might have to actually figure out how to build some alliances, join together as one unified earth and save our planet, (Sound familiar, to today's new world order, WEF, united nations, WHO plan?)

My hat is truly off to AI in the development of this game and perhaps some day I will be contacted as worthy.

there are annoying menial tasks to do on earth like remembering to reinforce your countries and sending your armies to go clear out alien growths.

Take out the grid based combat of XCOM and just incorporate the interface. Take out the complex character interactions of CK3 and just have the map painting with a splash of an arbitrary growth/development mechanic.

It all seems complex until you realize nations don't actually do anything outside of scripted events until a faction starts controlling them.

Why must I choose a faction who has hard coded goals? Why can't my play style determine my goals?

I feel this game relies too much on text to indicate what is happening. If an alien is crash landing, why not have one of the actual ships be the one that crashes?

If Xenoforming fauna is overtaking a continent, why is that not showing up on the map? I get a temporary text alert that says a random country that I may not be inherently familiar with is experiencing ""x"". Ok, so how about we see that on the map while I'm scanning instead of arbitrary icons?

Why are other planets unable to be segmented into divisions like earth? If colonies and cities are formed, should they not also generate the eventual control point? Nations should control these outposts, not I. I am a shadow government.

My shadow government can colonize a planet that is independent of any earth nation, and yet the earth nations that supplied all of these resources are OK with the fact that they no longer have a say in how it works? Why are space fleets not tied to nations but ground armies are? Let me build up a standing army on Mars or at least re-assign an army to other planetary bodies based on the country that ""should"" own the habitat or outpost. And again, I should be convincing a nation to do this, not inherently the direct owner of these assets.

A few of these issues could be resolved if they allowed a Faction Federation to be created that nations can join as they are persuaded on which way is the better way. Naturally the one that I own the control points on is going to be the founding nation for my faction, but other nations who just naturally agree with them could join it and contribute to its success without directly contributing to me. Call them coalitions if needs be, but I am a shadow government and this game makes me take center stage when I should be merely pulling the strings.

EARLY ACCESS. Let's hope this game isn't set in stone for its development path and is able to broaden its capabilities. I'll be watching it grow, but for now the beginning game is too dull and the end game loses sight of the nuance of governments and politics.

For those who have played CDE and ksp as well as grand strat, this is an ideal combination of them, but if u dont, then u should maybe try this game later, since its earth operation and space operation have departed once in the mid or late game, and boots, which is used for transporting mass from earth, are pretty useless once u got interplanetary mining running. 

and, yeah, difficulties for new comers. Despite my experience in other 4x,  grand strat, and SMG, it took me around 150hrs to finish the first run, so [u]new players are very likely to abandon their first save.[/u]btw, this is a game made from the long war mod modders, so it is what u might expect from them, but dont give up and turn to alien superiors too soon, there is a special achievement for those attain a comeback from the alien and pro-alien factions.

What it's lacking is any sort of way to explain the myriad number of concepts it throws at you.  How to manage an economy, how to increase your technology ratings,  any real explanations of what the techs you research give you.  The tech tree is a morass of blocks and lines.  You have to select options like ""Search full Tree"" which seems inane to me.  If you're thinking about buying this game, you'd better go watch about 10-12 beginner videos on YouTube.

What really makes me not recommend this game is you HAVE to play a certain way to survive the aliens, which means you have to have the USA and spending every bit of investment points is cranking up your Tech because the Aliens WILL LAND and w/o stupid high level armies and nukes, it's game over.  BUT!!!! If you do manage to stave off the landing(s) the aliens will proceed to wreck your space based assets until you fold.  That 's just the longer version of how to lose.

I'm not afraid of hard games, however Terra Invicta is beyond me.  I think the game is great to look at and I love some aspects of it, but the parts I don't like are what is making me put it down until some things change.

Unfortunately have this feeling lot of things are  thrown in just to make  feel there are many possibilities that will be opened in future which is not true. In textual context (research three) yes but in gameplay change not really 

For example, better mobile phones have faster memory and processing power but there is nothing extraordinary new and exciting. That is the case here as well. Everything that is explored really only creates boring progress. For example, colonization buildings only give more resources than outpost, After 10 hours of play and research, in fact, only the math changes and nothing else, which is not very exciting for a game of this caliber. It is boring to unlock like 20 new drives and only important realization to progress is their delta v and combat acceleration increase. There need to be bigger impact and not this tiny changes. The point is research three looks complex but results of research are not so complex

Finally big thing is lack of automatization in game which badly and i mean  badly hurts game especially in mid and end game. You waste all time to research stuff so you can finally catch bastards in space and than you relize in this point when you zoom out solar you cant even see planets how many fleets are there including your stuff that it is becoming pain in ass to arrange all of that.

A great concept that has the potential to redefine the grand strategy genre in some exciting ways, with some fundamental mechanics simply missing or poorly implemented.

Terra Invicta has buckets of potential but isn´t quite ready for release I feel. (Even into Early Access)

Too much of the game is handed over to RNG, including a bunch of things that can really cripple you in the early game, such as country dispositions, councillor stats, councillor pool, research and a multitude of other things that can stack very much against the player. Add to this a really poor balance to the action economy throughout the game, with long periods of downtime in the early game, imposed by arbitrarily restrictive mechanics (Control Point hard cap) designed to fix shortcomings with other aspects of the game, while in the late game you spend far too much time in a cat and mouse game of whackamole with enemy agents attacking from all sides and being unable to do much more than counter them. You suddenly find yourself not engaging with the main draw of the game, the Alien invasion and the conflict in space.

That part of the game can feel entirely divorced from the half that is focused on the faction espionage game back on Earth. Indeed, the irritating, grindy busy work on Earth often kept me from really getting into the space oriented part of the game. All too often I´d be called back to deal with faction sabotage or takeovers, or I´d have my bases in space flipped or sabotaged by enemy agents that I´d have to squander my action points in chasing down.

I often feel less like I´m fighting an Alien invasion and more like I´m fighting against the games mechanics in order to get the enjoyment I´d like.

Diplomacy would really help to manage many of these issues, limiting the dog pile of enemy actions that serve to distract you from engaging with the ""Alien"" part of the game. But there is literally no diplomacy options between factions and those that exist simply don`t work anyway.

The game is still very underbaked. It´s got fundamental balancing issues and instead of introducing gameplay systems that help to manage things, I feel the devs are adding restrictions onto the already unbalanced mechanics that don`t serve to address the underlying issues, but try to mitigate the outcomes that result from a complete lack of counterbalancing mechanics for certain aspects of the game.

Until the game has had more time to cook, I feel the average gamer should avoid it. This review doesn´t even touch on the UI issues and the poor feedback the game gives on a lot of the games elements and mechanics. That would be a review in itself and you can likely find those here abouts.

I will update this review in time, should thingss change.

UPDATE: After 150+ hrs, I still feel the game is too undercooked for the open market. I have nominated it for innovative gameplay in the steam awards, because it is possible to see what the devs are going for. The unique gameplay I think they deliver well, but the rest of the product fails to make muster. Performance is poorly optimised at this stage and then some of the improvements the devs have made, to address issues with the UI and game pacing and balance, are counteracted by more bad design decisions. 

In order to tackle criticisms of the tech trees bloat (and it is bloated, with numerous redundant engine and drive techs) they have now introduced an even more restrictive ""chance to unlock"" for each tech/project, meaning you could pursue hours of research aiming for that one drive tech you know to be decent amidst all the traps, only to never have it unlock for you. I understand some people like the randomness introduced, but I'm not here to waste hours of my time, on a game that might end up borked because a tech I consider essential, is locked behind yet another RNG. The one redeeming factor here, is that you can mod the game. Which is what I've done. But not everyone is able to mod stuff themselves and the modding scene for the game is... spartan.

Still, it IS pretty expensive, even compared to full games and considering it's still in ea, I can't recommend this without a sale.

Regarding the game itself, I'm going to address the elephant in the room: the UI is pure garbage. When you first look at the tech tree, you'll me greeted with a giant mess of nodes and lines. And that's not even the full tech tree! If you actually click on the button to see the full tech tree, it'll take up to like 10-20 seconds to actually load and it's even messier. There are functions like a search bar if you're looking for something specific and you can right click on a specific node to see just it and its connections. But the problem is that most of these technologies are pretty useless. A lot of them are military techs that offer like 4-5 different drives or weapons that are mostly similar but with tiny, mostly insignificant trade-offs.

But the UI problems don't end there. During my Resistance playthrough, I started to expand my space economy by sending prospector probes to the asteroids and I built mines on them as soon as my mission control capacity allowed me. Naturally, this meant that a lot of these probes would finish their missions before I had enough mission control to actually colonize the asteroids I was looking at, and a lot of times they were asteroids with resources that I really needed. I had to just ignore them until I had enough mission control, but by that point god only knows where they went. There can be up to 350 bodies in the solar system, all of which can be colonized, and like 80% of them are asteroids. There is no way to tag an individual body so you can track it over a period of time. A feature like this would be really handy once you're out colonizing the solar system beyond the asteroid belt, as there are also lots of dwarf planets and most if not all planets from Jupiter and beyond are uninhabitable but have several dozen moons for you to exploit instead.

But besides that, I actually really like the game and can't get anough of it. The devs previously worked on the Long War mods for XCOM and it's pretty obvious that it served as a major inspiration for the setting. It does a good job modeling and simulating the current geopolitical situation, even modeling climate change into the game. Additionally, each faction is very unique, with its own goals. The difference in ideology dictates whether or not you can trade resources with them, and how fair the deal is gonna be. Additionally, some of them have unique interactions with certain events; the Initiative can often choose to exploit a dire situation for profit, Humanity First can employ scorched earth policies to hinder the aliens, and the Servants can choose to aid the aliens. The Academy is also a very interesting faction due to an early game research that triggers and event in which their public opinion tanks all around the world and half of their held control points are cracked down, putting you in a similar position to XCOM in which you have to make as much of a dire situation as possible. It's definitely better than a lot of RPGs which have different races mostly for filler.

The story in general is also surprisingly good. The leaders of all the factions have actual voiced dialogue and you can discover their backstory through their reactions to different events. It's not necessarily the *best*, but it's also definitely above the standard Hollywood B-tier writing you would expect to find.

Space combat is also really fun. It actually simulates gravity and the momentum of each ship and feels like actual combat in a vacuum instead of water or air. Plus there's a great variety of combinations for your spaceships that you can experiment with, although, like I mentioned above, most of the items are largely the same with some minor trade-offs.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for terrestrial combat. It feels very much unpolished; simply click on an army and click on the desired destination. If its navy is worse than your enemy's you can't travel across water and your country is ''blockaded''. When it does arrive it's really a matter of who has the better stat sheet. Nukes are also pretty terrible and unpolished. Simply point and click where you want to launch them and suddenly you just wiped out an entire army! How they're used depends entirely on the faction's AI, which is cool cause it adds another layer of immersion, and I get that it's supposed to act as an equalizer, but it's really dumb that you can't even react to it. 

Speaking of AI, is pretty actually decent. At the moment, the alien AI is the only one that really stands out. It has its own economy and goals that it achieves without cheating or scripts, and it's pretty admirable, but human factions aren't really as outstanding. It's about on par with what the devs made in their XCOM mods. 

EDIT: After playing an unhealthy amount of Total War, I have come to appreciate the AI in this game a lot more. It doesn't actually cheat. It may not sound like much, but it's a lot more fun when you don't have to constantly fight an uphill battle against an opponent with unfair advantages. It sems to know how to establish a power base, and it can build up that power base into a force to be reckoned with. This is a good thing. It makes the game far more intresting than if it was super dumb but had cheats that give it free resources to compensate. That said, it's a little rough around the edges. Often times, it will send councillors to perform Public Campaign missions on your territory and purge undefended control points, only to abandon them by the end of the phase, and it's more annoying than anything else because it doesn't have a solid reason for it. In my current Humanity First game I signed a non-aggression pact with the Resistance as soon as I identified one of their councillors. I have honoured this agreement completely, but they still do Public Campaign missions in the US, where I've established my power base. It's April of 2025, it's VERY early in the game, so even without the NAP, the AI has little to no chance of doing literally anything in the US, but it keeps trying to sway public opinion in its favour anyway. The Resistance in particular has near full control of Russia and a solid foothold in Europe; logically, it should focus more on trying to expand into the EU rather than annoy me.

To conclude: There are glaring issues with the game, which is to be expected in an early access title, but at the price tag it's probably kind of overpriced.

Everything, every single thing, from the most basic UI element, to the absolute fundamental design concepts of the game itself is utterly, irreversibly, and catastrophically flawed.

As an American, it strikes me as especially strange that the USA is considered to have a ""flawed"" system of government when our sytem of government not only requires the direct participation of the citizen at every layer, but has also served as a template for every democracy that has been founded since the American Revolution. Furthermore, many of the game's ""full"" democracies have hereditary monarchies, where the nobility has tremendous influence over policy (even though they pretend they do not). Of course the USA has its flaws and many of those flaws have to do with white supremacy, racism and the history of Europeans' invasion of the Americas. One reason why those flaws are readily apparent is because American Society publicly debates them often and has for almost four hundred years. Our intellectual tradition is what made the Revolution and every Civil Rights Movement possible. To characterize the American system of government as inherently flawed, overlooks the flaws and stratification within Europe, where the nobility still wield tremendous political power in government and society (I'm looking at you Belgium, Denmark, Great Britain, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden) and many folks from Africa and Asia, whose homelands were turned into colonies to support European mercanalism and hegemony, are not even allowed to travel, work or vote in Europe. How is that less flawed than the USA?  (I guess you have better vacation packages and sick leave than we do, but we have higher wages and more direct influence over our political parties -- suffice it to say, I'm far from sold that the USA is any more flawed than Europe).

Pros: 
The earth politics are good and the space combat is better. I'm about 60 (mostly offline) hours in and having a great time .
Overall the tech is detailed and interesting with multiple viable paths that each feel pretty different.

Mixed: 
Blindingly complicated, thus starting out is pretty slow.  On the plus side, the complexity keeps it interesting for many hours.

Cons: 
If you don't manage your (complicated) tech tree well you can end up with a lot of down time. For example, there were many hours of playtime between me clearing the aliens from Earth orbits and being able to go get them elsewhere due to not having good enough engine tech. In the meantime not much happens.
You can't make factions go away completely, so if you unite most of earth you pay for it because 18 councilors of mostly irrelevant factions are running around causing tedious mischief.
Mobility in space combat feels a little weak. Even with maxed 4g combat acceleration I am rarely avoiding missiles and railgun rounds, which in theory should be the easiest things to avoid. This may be realistic, but it's not super fun. I would prefer a rock-paper-scissors scenario where high-speed weapons (lasers and plasma) beat mobility but mobility is good vs slower weapons. As is it seems like slow, fat ships with lots of point defense is the only counter to missiles and guns, and mobility is not good for much.

Summary:
I may have written a lot on the cons, but the fun parts are most of the game and the cons are small issues.
Fun game, do recommend!

Amazingly good game! Not without some deficiencies.

What is this game in short? If XCOM had a much more detailed map, tech tree, international relations, and solar system colonization system = Terra Invicta. That isn't exactly accurate, but it is a good general sense of what the game is about.

Pros: 97.5% of the game design is very good or even excellent.

Cons:
1. Earth-based warfare is on par with Risk. Way too simplified.
2. Nuclear weapons are very simplistic. Even worse than the land/air and naval elements of the game.
3. Documentation and in-game tool-tips and help are lacking.
4. Large number of ""quality of life features"" are lacking and make gameplay more tedious than it needs to be.

This is an extraordinarily professional, well-conceived and thoroughly executed game.

The only arguably conceptual flaw is that the developers apparently believe that anthropgenic forces are in fact on the verge of causing Antarctica to melt and sea levels to rise half a meter.

Sp, bottom line? This is without a doubt one of the most ambitious games I've ever played. The sheer volume of things it's trying to accomplish is impressive on its own - part global geopolitics simulator, part 4X grand strategy game, part space combat shoot-em-up - but what's even more amazing is how well the game wears its vast multitude of hats.

Is it perfect? No. The interface needs work, obfuscation of some critical information results in some artificial scaling of the difficulty, certain quality of life features could be added or use revamping, and at times it can feel like the AI's playing by an entirely different set of rules. That said, for a game still in early access, it's a remarkable amount of polish.

Overall I'd give this game a solid 10/10 based on its ambition, uniqueness, scope, and outstanding (if imperfect) execution. Easily my game of the year.",1669731018,1669731018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Size and scope of the game (love it)
- Earth and the shadow corporation part (the whole early game) - absolutely a fantastic and fresh idea
- The whole space race with the humans and tech race with the aliens
- Soundtrack


Things that still needs attention:
- Tech tree - i love the size of the tech tree and the amount of alternative choices one can make for a lot of the unlockables. The chance system of unlocking techs is also great.

Let's say you need more CP and you don't know what techs unlock it you either need to go to the wiki or search each tech by hand. Search doesn't work. It sucks.

- Mid game - it drags a bit especially now. 

- UI - especially whole news bar on the left (and the tech tree). Give us some fitlering options or a choice to force a pop up for the news we're interested in.

- Dev communication with the community. There is none.

Complex, deep, and needing a lot of experimentation, research, and discussions on discord, this is not a game for the faint hearted.

But if you put in the work, the game is immensely rewarding. The world building is reminiscent of Alpha Centauri, with the tech and research lore being quotes of the various faction leaders.  The space combat is tense, and full of surprises, but the AI could do with some work in terms of how it deploys its fleet strategically. The UI in the game could also do with some work, it reminds me of a very wonky Stellaris, I guess Pavonis just needs more time to polish up.

I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get into a deep, frustrating, challenging but ultimately deeply satisfying sci-fi strategy romp!

I will most likely wait for a 1.x before playing again. Just to re-experience the game in a more polished and stable state.",1664758196,1669654933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

this game is good as early access can be. biggest problems: performance could be better, stuff is only explained basically game balance is off. 
So, if you are really in this kind of game and want to invest 1-2 years of beta invest 40 euros. 
This means for the majority: don't buy it (yet), wait and see what happens.
Tbh: for 40 Euros I expected more.

a bit longer:
I have 1000+ hrs in paradox games. Somehow I know this kind of games and Terra Invicta strikes the kind of nerve in me, which likes grand strategy and the xcom setting. Nice

Surprisingly this game is quite fine on the technical side. Some minor issues with tool tips and language, but they get fixed. But nothing major.
The UI needs some general rework for easier access, but nothing really bad, it is just medicore and could be improved. (it is somewhat better then Victoria 2)
Bad is the codex or any form of documentation. A lot of things are only explained basically. Or not. In a game where details can mean a lot in the long run this is a no go! Things like ""what this streamer"" is not the kind of documentation the developers should provide upfront. In the contrary it is an affront.
And here comes the even worst thing: The balancing is off. Somehow the AI is kinda bad an the non alien factions and kinda superb for the servants / aliens. So you are effetely fighting alone against the alien and the other factions are at best not helping, but most time hindering you. Oh and the Aliens have an huge advantage, which you need to match somehow / some when. Have fun ;)

Well, I will see how this one goes, hopefully it will improve. But for now...I'm not giving this a positive review",1664975542,1669650719,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

Terra Invicta is a grand strategy game focused on delivering a realistic scenario, where you're playing the modern geopolitical landscape of 2022 against a subversive alien invasion. You will try to seize control of the nations of earth as the different factions of the game (defined by their ideological reaction to the aliens arrival) all use national and extra-national resources to further their goals. You will hire Councillors, who are your people for getting stuff done on (and sometimes off) earth. These people will be diplomats, hackers, rebels, spies, tech billionaires, corrupt military officers, scientists and other such professions that an extra-national organisation would be interested in hiring. 

They campaign to the public in nations, investigate alien abductions, monitor areas for enemy activity, imprison or murder opposing Councillors and so on. Their traits, skills and managed organisations will provide a significant portion of your various incomes for the entire game.

As the game progresses along, you will eventually have to build an industry in space, as putting mass in orbit is supremely expensive from earth, you will send probes to planets and scope out what resources are there to be mined. You're going to be trying to get a surplus in the five critical resources: water, volatiles, metals, nobles and fissiles. Once you have this economy of resources established, these resources will further your goals, be it in research, further industry or military build-up. 

Significantly later, most factions are going to enter open war with the aliens, and you're going to be deal with actual rocket science, in that you take a ship, lay in the destination you want, then decide how much fuel (or in more advanced terms: Delta-Velocity) you want to spend. These transfers can be anywhere from a few days to a few years of in-game time, as all the numbers used to calculate inter-planetary travel are very real and very large.

Once you get into combat, your first few fights are either going to be pyrrhic victories or utter losses, as these aliens are using top tier equipment on their basic freighters, equipment you bring early on won't even have a chance at contesting alien interests outside of targets of opportunity.

You're going to be looking at 10 hours minimum before you're looking at building your first warship, and that warship will likely be a very ramshackle, leaky lifeboat with guns taped on that will be gutted by the first alien that looks at it funny, or even stranded in space if you try to send it beyond the moon.

Eventually, you'll get better tech, such as lasers, rail-guns, coil-guns, plasma cannons, missiles, entire magazines of nuclear shaped charges and some other choices of weapon types. Alongside weaponry, you're also going to unlock larger frames for your warships, better armor and radiators, but all this pales in comparison to the nerdy appreciation of the different types of engines and reactors. There are solar generators, and then there are so, so, SO many types of nuclear reactors to power all the different drives for your spaceships, and almost all of them have some grounding in science: about 80% of them will have a corresponding NASA white-paper report.

Not all ships are warships though, but when you leave warships as a category you understand that ships are not the purpose of the game, despite their comparative accessibility. Ships exist to do jobs for you, be that blowing up aliens, exploring distant planets, moons and asteroids, or building new colonies to exploit solar resources. 

This game is a very slow, very complicated and very rewarding burn, but it will eat up a lot of time. If you have the spare time, energy and will to learn how to run effective economies, learn what technologies are traps, learn large-scale strategies and build effective fleets to bully aliens, this will be your game.",1669634193,1669649434,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Firstly let me say I never got deep into the space combat which is the ""good"" bit of the game as I was already so burnt out by that point I just couldn't keep playing.
So for the purposes of this review i'm just going to assume the late game space combat is perfect and amazing and the best bit of gameplay ever made.
Thing is even if the above is true this game is still torture.
Please don't listen to any of the reviews saying the early game espionage simulator is fun and engaging.
It has system complexity under the dashboard however the gameplay boils down to take one of your agents each having an average of lets say 5 different actions and spam that same action every turn forever. That's it, you might pick one of their other actions every now and then to respond to a development but its fairly rare. your goal is to watch numbers go up as you gain control of more countries. I would describe it as the mobile game version of one of the worse paradox games.

You may have noticed I mentioned turns above when this game claims to be a real time strategy game. Its not its turn based but you have to let weeks of in game time pass in between your turns, you are not able to do anything while that time passes so its basically just a waste of your time.

this ""early game"" phase of the game where you wait 10 IRL minutes to click the gain control button for the 352nd time easily runs for upwards of 10 IRL hours to get through in one run.
So essentially for the first 10ish hours of any playthrough there is absolutely nothing I can really call gameplay its just click a button watch some numbers go up wait 10 mins click the same button watch numbers go up more kinda like an idle game.

If you want to play a 4x basically any other 4x ever made is several orders of magnitude better than this and if you want to play the space combat just know its gated behind many many hours of your life being wasted.

This fantastic game has three stages that blend into each other.

In the first stage, in response to a UFO crash and the arrival of alien life, you (the leader of a shadowy cabal with hooks into major world governments, agencies, NGOs, and corporations) uses your agents (called councilors) to vie with other factions for puppet control of major earth governments. You competitively consolidate control and cooperatively direct Earth's research efforts towards pursuits that will help deal with the alien threat. This aspect continues through the whole game, but is the entire game early on.

Before long, your faction and others take to the solar system in simple rockets to start building up the barebones of a space infrastructure and economy. Mining colonies on the moon and mars and in the asteroids. Small space stations with varying capabilities. You accumulate resources as via the plot you learn more and more about the aliens and how they might be defeated. Though you can build simple space warships at this point, you don't; your simple ships with present-day and near-future propulsion technology equipped with missiles and basic lasers are no match for the aliens, and if you build up too much of a space presence they will strike at you directly.

Eventually, you have the technology to go toe-to-toe with alien fleets and send ships to the outer planets like Neptune with a travel time of a few weeks or months rather than a few years or decades. Fusion-based propulsion, advanced lasers and coilguns, plasma weaponry.  With the resources of your puppet governments on earth and your mining complexes throughout the solar system, you build fleets of massive Dreadnoughts to take the fight to the aliens and wage war from Jupiter to Pluto.

Many cool things about the game:
- It is hard sci-fi. Your ships are governed by the tyranny of the rocket equation, which makes interstellar travel very slow until you have ships with the extremely high specific impulse provided by certain fusion drives
-Many, many engine options - all of which are realistically modeled in terms of performance and derived from IRL advanced engine concepts (note - not all of them are great to use! look at the performance characteristics of the engine options before investing research into them)
-Real-time Expanse-style space battles with great visuals
-Full solar system is modeled, from Mercury to the Kuiper belt
-Unique approach to the earth-side of the game - you play by politics and subterfuge, not military map-painting. There is no ability to arbitrarily conquer territory and annex it to countries. 
-Interesting research system divided into technology (which all factions contribute to) and engineering (which is per-faction). Decide whether to focus your research income into global technology to advance Earth's overall capability and unlock new possibilities, or into engineering projects to unlock new engines, weapons, and other goodies for your own faction.

Some things for new players to keep in mind:
- Don't research everything (except maybe if it is your first game, on minimum difficulty, just to explore). READ things. Is this engine actually going to be useful? I already have the heavy laser battery, do I actually need this heavy laser cannon as well? READ the descriptions of things and don't waste research on them unless you will use them. Read through the tech tree in advance.
-Contribute heavily to key global technologies research. Not all engineering projects (which are mostly unlocked by global research) are actually guaranteed to unlock. There is a probability (it will say in the UI of the global technolgy) to unlock certain engineering projects, and if you fail to unlock them you just won't have them that game. You can miss some useful stuff this way. BUT your % contribution to the global technologies that are prerequisite to that engineering project will get added to that chance - so if you want an engineering project that the UI says only has a 50% chance, make sure you contribute 50% to the prerequisite global research in order to boost that to guaranteed. 
-You're not meant to be able to beat the aliens in space until fairly late in the game. You'll want to kill one alien ship early on to learn more about them, but you simply won't be able to trade well with them until you're very significantly through the tech tree. But rest assured that eventually you WILL be able to build ships that can steamroll alien fleets and space stations.",1669594434,1669594434,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are, as mentioned earlier, rough edges, such as a poor tutorial, confusing UI elements, a somewhat impenetrable real-time space combat layer, and some pacing issues.

It's the kind of game, however, which many people might find frustrating: lots of micromanagement, high (and sometimes merciless) difficulty, and a long long road to victory... if victory is even possible, despite your efforts. That said, if you're up for a challenge and enjoy the addictive quality of turn-based strategy (""just one more turn!""), you'll likely get engrossed in this game for many hours and lots of bleary-eyed late nights as you're trying to achieve your latest self-imposed deadline.

If you haven't already gotten this from the material: the basis of the game is you controlling 3-6 agents as you assign them bi-weekly missions to do such things as take control of countries, investigate the aliens and other factions, and essentially patch together first a power base on Earth prior to expanding to the rest of the solar system. You're fighting against the aliens, who are incredibly far ahead in technology, although you probably want to walk a fine line and not oppose them TOO much initially -- there's a meter which tracks how much of a threat they think you are, and if they consider you too large of one they'll come and knock you back a few pegs and wipe out your stations and ships in one fell swoop. You need to fly under the radar until you're ready to make your move and start opposing them, the toughest call in the game to make.

Meanwhile, you're also struggling with other factions on Earth, including the Servants who are allies of the aliens. You can never get rid of a faction completely, but you can weaken them... and you'll be constantly competing for control of countries and for space on valuable off-planet sites and in Earth's orbit. Some factions might tolerate you, but if you end up at war with ALL of them you'll be constantly facing assassinations, sabotaged facilities, and stolen tech. Best to try and pick your battles, just as with the aliens.

There is indeed a lower difficulty setting, which not only makes missions a bit easier it also seems to make the aliens do less to attack you overall. That said, it's not a LOT easier. You can still play a game for 50 hours and then hit some mistake you can't back-track from (or get around by loading an earlier save), or face an invasion of alien armies on Earth before you're ready for them... and, poof! That's that particular game in the dumpster. Best to just start over. It can be a little sadistic in its approach, so if that idea doesn't appeal? Best to give this a pass.

I love the Newtonian space physics in battles and in the strategic map for moving between planets.
I love the slow, gradual progression from rinky-dink spaceships that can barely move to true warships that take the fight to the aliens.
I love the detailed geopolitical simulation on Earth and all the interesting gameplay that comes with it.

That being said, there are a few issues, which are understandable in an early access game. There's a bit of a learning curve, although not as steep as some other games, and the tutorials are pretty rudimentary so you mostly have to figure stuff out for yourself. The UI could be better, although I don't think it's as bad as a lot of other people seem to. Once you get far enough along in the game, the councillor phases become more of a slog than anything, as I run through a dozen or so cycles of defending interests, public campaigning, and advising while I wait for my fleet to transfer from Mars to Neptune. The alien fleets almost always use the same uninteresting tactic of flying vaguely towards you spinning like crazy so they show their weak side armour and can't even fire their forward weapons. There are a few bugs, but most of the truly game-breaking ones have been patched now.

But overall, I think this game is definitely worth it, especially on a cost-per-time basis (Assuming you like long games as I do). A single campaign easily takes upward of 150 hours, and it still always feels like there's something to do. With 7 factions each with their own story and victory conditions, you could theoretically get full enjoyment of 1200 or so hours, although realistically you may be burned out after a full campaign and want to wait a few months to start a second.

The Xenos here don't start overtly hostile, but instead are subversive, attempting to control humanity from the inside before their fleets and armies arrive. It's a interesting take on the invasion that I found really enjoyable. The ""shadow government"" player factions make for an interesting layer of abstraction as well, where countries are not homes and bases but tools to be used and at times discarded.

The end game still needs some work... it's still a lot of fun, but there's simply no way to get there without watching a ton of guide's and video's to walk you thru how to manage alien ""hate"". 

The UI is perfect when you're still on earth, but once you start spending most of your time in the solar system it gets really awkward... transferring ships anywhere but the main planets is painful and the entire delta-V fight avoidance system is horrible. Some kind of ""defend orbit"" function for your fleets would make this game soo much better. Instead you get a system where an enemy fleet can choose to instantly burn more fuel than it would take to fly to Pluto a take a year, and when it's over they end up right next to where they started the attack and their smallest ships can bombard with impunity, ignoring any defenses (while yours get wiped out).

The fleet combat is HORRIBLE! It looks very nice, but its painful to try and actually control your ships... you just start with a wall, watch your ships slowly advance forward, and hope that the AI runs straight at you. The Auto-Resolve option for fleet combat is badly broken... I've lost track of how many times I've used it against an enemy that's a tenth of the combat value and my fleet get's wiped out, and when I reload and fight it myself my fleet doesn't take a single hit.

There are also still too many crash's and it feels like something is wrong with how the game manages orbits... my very powerful computer struggles to keep up and lags.

Initially it seems like a fun game where you try to control and/or unite the nations to build ships and advance your research to fight/help/submit (whatever you choose) the aliens but after a while it becomes really annoying and the game doesn't progress on because another factions stole your nations and all your progress comes to a grinding halt and the game just becomes really boring at that point. There's hardly a point where you feel like you're actually winning the game. 

It's like playing two board games chess and battleship, where you need to be successful in one game before you make any moves on the other and if your progress in the first board games stalls it immediately affects the other game until it just not fun anymore. 

This game has a lot of potential ngl, but currently with what it is, it's just too annoying and cumbersome to play. I regret buying this game.

Very interesting game with a lot of potential. Burned 100 hours over two games having an absolutely great time... until the aliens show up.

From the Youtube videos I've watched you apparently need to outrun their fleets and pick off a destroyer or two and then go hide again. It's a miserable experience.

Bad: THE ALIENS

There are random delays implemented between completing the global tech and being offered the opportunity to complete the faction project. These delays can be very long, and it is also possible to be completely locked out of the ability to use a tech you spent a lot of effort on researching due to bad RNG.

The seven different factions each have different endgame goals, although there's a fair bit of overlap between some of them, such that their gameplay is similar and they can get along to some degree.  I've only played the Resistance so far, and I've got 200+ hours in the game now.  It's deep, and it's fun.

There's still some rough edges, like the battle formations system being a bit crap (please, let us preview and edit formations), and the semi-monthly ""assign councillors"" phase can get a bit tedious by endgame when you're waiting months for ships to travel around the solar system.

The endgame also lasts a bit too long, and could be sped up if the aliens would work harder to defend their colonies.  Without going into spoilers, one of the Resistance endgame goals involves reducing the alien presence in the solar system down below a critical threshold, and in my game, the aliens made that difficult by being cowards.  Whenever they saw one of my doom fleets coming towards one of their colonies, instead of choosing to stay and fight and go down with their space station -- which would have probably done some damage to my fleet -- they [b]conveniently[/b] decided to pick that exact moment to go strike at [b]my[/b] nearest colony instead (and thus not be there when I arrived).  The gesture was pretty futile and just served to slow down the game.

That said, it's still in Early Access and is receiving regular updates.

That said, this is definitely not going to be everyone's cup of tea. Other reviewers have done a fantastic job describing the game's Achilles heel, the UI, which is something I love the game [i]in spite[/i] of. 

This can be interpreted as either a good thing or a bad thing, but I am [i]still[/i] learning new things about the game, particularly finer points regarding nation management, after 500 hours of playing it. Some of these are things that I could've / should've learned by reading the Codex, but others are not explained clearly anywhere, and can only be learned the hard way.

[b]Bottom line regarding the base game:[/b] if you're into hard scifi and strategy, patient enough to take notes, and able to bear with a choppy and sometimes painfully redundant UI, it's [i]absolutely[/i] worth a shot.


Now, to discuss the bonus. [b]Modding potential is enormous.[/b] Changing the JSON templates is very easy, and just looking through the C# assembly in dnSpy, I got all kinds of crazy ideas. If I was more experienced with C# I probably would have released half a dozen mods for it by now. Unfortunately I'm still learning, and my first mod was broken within a week by an update, so we will see where that goes. I am certain folks better with C# than me will come up with some amazing stuff eventually.

If you're familiar with modding Paradox games, the JSON templates are very similar to its text-based configuration files, and in a way, even more streamlined: a great many things about the game can be overwritten as desired and nothing has to be replaced in its entirety, i.e. replacing a single variable in the meta template instead of the entire freaking 00_defines.txt file.

What makes TI vastly superior to Paradox games, though, is the simple fact that 70-80% of the game's core code is in a single 5-megabyte C# assembly — it isn't buried deep inside a 50-megabyte assembly to ensure the DLC can never be upstaged by the modding community. YEAH. That's right. Talking to you, Paradox. [b]THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A REAL GAME WITH ACTUAL MODDING POTENTIAL, INSTEAD OF A DLC FARM WITH A LITTLE SANDBOX FOR MODDERS TO PLAY IN.[/b]

If you're familiar with modding Rimworld, or other C# unity games like it, you will understand innately just how much potential there is for adding new things. As of the writing of this review, there is an unfortunate lack of support for loading binary files from mods uploaded to the Steam Workshop; one has to use Unity Mod Manager at the moment. I am relatively certain the devs will eventually correct this.

But the important thing is it connects those pieces in a really good way. I've been playing for 40 hours and I'm only starting to explore space. The goddamn fucking tech tree itself is so huge, that your PC will freeze up when loading up and I don't even dare to try to scroll through everything thats in there because im worried ill die of old age. You get factions with different goals to pick the game - you want to play as the alien loving cucks ? got it. you want to completely pulverize the alien scum ? check. you dont give a fuck and just want to play ruthless capitalists that do everything to get richer while aliens are burning the world ? available. you are above all of this and just want to escape to another star system ? you can do that. Each faction has different goals and achieves them differently, afaik more than one faction can win as well and you can also win after your faction lost, rising like phoenix from the ashes. the ship design options in comparison make stellaris look like lego duplo - which is also why you will fail at it a lot. for ship movement you gotta consider orbital mechanics, fuel load and escape velocities - if the ship is too close to earth itll burn too much fuel trying to get out of its gravity well and you wont get anywhere. but that all happens after the early game which is based on a lot of shadow government play where if you're like me you can create a mega-EU nation and annex russia. if you dont like to move it move it and/or lemurs you can go to war with madagascar and nuke the everliving shit out of them (might want to save the nukes for aliens, but i know its a hard sell when the alternative is no more lemurs) or take control of china and annex taiwan you heartless monster you.

There are cons too - the tutorial is pretty much nonexistant, theres a lot of research that you need to do to play this semi-succesfully, the community is very helpful and even the devs pop into the players-helping-players channel on discord to give tips, but im sure they can get that up and running for the full release.

I would also like to petition Paradox to please make a stellaris mod for this game. the events you guys have are pretty neat.

The space combat UI/controls are a source of frustration for many players;
Habitat templates don't exist yet;

the 1 on an info screen isn't always the same as the 1 on the resource bar,
they can in fact be orders of magnitude different but you wouldn't know that 
unless you hovered over the right small UI element and read 3 paragraphs of pop-up text.

So far I am very thoroughly impressed; the level of detail is awesome and the tutorial does a great job of giving you an overview of all of the important systems. Don't expect the game to hold your hand, though. You will be given objectives of course, but a lot of the decisions are left up to you, so expect to do your research, read your tooltips, and explore the menus. The game gives you all the information you need to make a plan and execute it, but it's not going to do the thinking for you. If you like independently analyzing spreadsheets of information to create long-term plans for world domination in a wide-open, hyper-realistic geopolitical simulation of Earth and the solar system, this game is for you.

I'll update my review once I have played a full campaign, but for now I'll be waiting for some of the future features to be implemented before continuing. Specifically, I'll be waiting for the ability to annex occupied territory from other countries. I'm looking to annex French Guiana with Brazil to get access to their amazing launch facility :)

1) What if you were the Spokesman for XCom, instead of the Commander? Or

2) Did you ever want to play a Stellaris Primitive Civilization Start?

If you answer ""yes,"" to #2, this game is for you in spades. If you know Stellaris, you can learn this game. If you like 4x strategy games, you should be at home in this. It uses a sort of Simultaneous Turns system, where you plan your actions (ala Diplomacy), and then watch them (and everyone else's) happen in Real Time with Defense actions and Influence actions taking priority over aggressive ones. And skills of the counselors involved determining who gets ""initiative"" if more than one is acting on the same object in the same turn. 

The Tech Tree is bonkers (And needs a UI pass for clarity). You will not research everything in one playthrough: That way lies madness. Rather you're meant to choose what works for you and make as direct a path to that through the myriad of options. The Shadow Government phase is compelling. Space Combat is a bit more frustrating right now than Stellaris. But shows promise. Again, there is probably some UI work that could be done here to make things more opaque. 

The thing that frustrates players the most at this point in the posts I've seen here and on Reddit (aside from the UI elements), is that it's easy to get into a Death Spiral of Alien Hate. Where you trigger them to respond, they blow your stuff up. You get mad and retaliate, which annoys them again, so they hit you even harder. And your replies become increasingly pathetic. The solution isn't clear: Don't retaliate until you're absolutely ready. Yes, you have to annoy the aliens at times. Yes, they're going to come for you when you do. But take it on the chin, rebuild quietly (and better), and don't go toe-to-toe until you're ready for full scale war. Also, the aliens will be in permanent hate mode if your Mission Control gets too high. So there's a balance that has to be made between expansion and provocation. These are things that again, could probably be less opaque. But learning how to navigate the rapids is part of the game. 

All in all, this is Early Access done right, in my book. Very playable now. Early Access is primarily about balance and player feedback. Not about content fixes. I'm sure things are still to be added. But Hooded Horse had a clear Roadmap and are, to my eyes, implementing it well. If you like 4X games, this is a strong entry, even at this stage.

 You prepare for an alien arrival and you level up your skills to prepare based on your ideology and faction you chose in the beginning. You take over nations and have an administration cap which prevents your spread with influence penalties which burn out your candle at both ends. If you take too much you keep your nose on the grindstone and can not research alien activities.

I find Terra Invicta to be overly complex. It's hard to follow, hard to learn, and hard to play. Just figuring out how to build a single space station is a headache and even after 10 hours I barely understand even the basic early phases of the game.

Massive, complex grand strategy game with multiple stages.  Somewhat realistic simulation of how the current world would react to aliens entering our solar system, including the fanatics who want to welcome the alien overlords.

Still a lot of work to be done on improving the UI and RNG can make a huge difference at the beginning.  Discord system and alien aggression system can easily lead to a death spiral.  Each game taking multiple hours to discover what you did wrong several hours ago.

If you are willing to look past the rough edges, do research into how various systems work (you can do nonsensical operations that give no benefits) and are willing to restart several times to learn the game, then this is a game that will occupy your brain for potentially weeks.

The game isn't for everyone, if you are used to high speed RTS this isn't the one. 
The game play slow as you get control over the earth nation and slowly expand toward the stars and can sometime later in the game result in you simply waiting with fast forward on without much to do.

to me Earth game have a nice sigma theory vibe with more management of coutry, and space offer a good variety of station and ship building (IMO way to many ship part that do the same stuff though).
Tech tree is really scary to get into but once you understand which milestone are necessary for what you want to do it's not that bad.
7 Faction each with a differente victory condition for replayability and alien shenanigans to keep some kind of space threat looming over you even if you rush past the other faction IA.

Biggest problem for potential new player, tutorial isn't that helpfull, i'd advise to look a youtube video for about 20min to get the early game control (or read some of the guide on steam/wiki)

Somethings to note are that the tutorial is still being fleshed out, and I found youtubes videos significantly more helpful. There is a steep learning curve at the start of the game, and honestly once you get to new parts of the game (i.e. when you first build ships, first go into combat, first control a nation, etc. It is also difficult to tell how well you are doing often. Certain parts of the game can also feel like a slog and like not too much is happening. Also, I am not convinced many people have managed to finish the game as it takes a lot of time and you definitely can lose.

To learn it I started by watching a few youtube videos then hopped into playing as the resistance. I played about 5 years (~5 hours) and restarted after learning quite a few features, where I went wrong and right and incorporated that into my next play through. Unfortunately, there are some wikis and guide on the internet but many features/questions you might have will be unanswered as of now (in part because the game is quite complex and people are still figuring stuff out). Some things can also be frustrating, such as when alien flora destroy your country or spaceships destroy you space base with no time to prepare, but perhaps with more experience I would've been more prepared. (your councilors who you grow attached to can also be assassinated for a similar feeling as when you lose a colonel in xcom)

If you like xcom, especially long war, or stellaris I would highly recommend the game. It starts off with a sort of stellaris-like and has large space battles at the end (but they are more involved than stellaris, I just haven't figured them out yet). What's also exciting is they are still developing the game (roadmap here https://www.pavonisinteractive.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=29475)

The game is a great mix of Paradox ""Crusader Kings"" Gameplay, XCOM mechanics and a generous topping of the ""Trisolaris"" trilogy of Liu Cixin. Main actions are performed by your council members in a semi-turnbased mechanic: The game evolves in real-time, with fixed dates every month to assign new council missions. After getting used to this, it creates a nice rhythm of decision making and watching the outcome.

As other reviewers noted the learning curve is steep but rewarding. Players new to the genre should watch a few tutorials on Youtube to avoid frustration. But once you got the basics covered, the ""one more turn"" addiction quickly sets in, and you will soon be sabotaging the competition, manipulating the population and plotting countries against each other while following your own plans in the shadows. And all the time, an unknown threat approaches from outer space...

Illuminati Simulator with aliens, and I love it!

Update after 144 hours more and finishing the campaigns of two factions: This was a great experience, but some flaws became hard to ignore after a few (dozen) hours.

Pro:
- The story was great and different enough between the played factions, so there is a lot of replay value
- While the core mechanics stay the same, the different faction objectives result in a very different endgame gameplay
- The AI strategy became very predictable after a while, but recent patches fixed that, so there is more challenge now

Cons:
- Some mechanics become VERY repetitive after a while, and managing the earth aspects of the game became a nuissance I had to go through every ""turn"" while focussing on space exploration (I hope they could put in some automated tasks in future updates)
- Once your organization and fleets reach critical mass, the challenge was gone; endgame felt more like cleaning up after a party than a grand finale

There are two things here, I don't particularly like. You get a lot of information, or you would, if you could find the correct menus. The HUD is very convoluted and is missing some quality of live things like being able to move the windows, close all windows instantly with a keybind (ESC usually) and a better structured outliner. 
The other thing is the ship combat. What is even going on? I just try my best to beat the enemy with overwhelming might and not strategy, because I don't understand how the combat works.

The game is certainty grand strategy, it feels like a giant board game, or maybe 3/4 joined together. It's a lot more focused than Paradox games, so where EU4 and Stellaris feel like they are spilling out and kind of lose their form, TI stays together and you can keep on knowing what you are doing.

I've played EU4, Civ Series, X-Com, Stellaris, and found TI very easy to learn and play.

The game does diplomacy very well, and really like half the game is playing this diplomacy / cold war on Earth. I've never played a game with diplomacy like this, I like it. It is like EU4 diplomacy but instead of 'Improve Relations' everyone then something else, you are actually being tactical.

An inspiration that hasn't been mentioned yet is Alpha Centauri, of which there are numerous. The different factions are divided by ideology, not country. There is a strong story element to this game, although I think it is only okay. The game does tap in the Alpha Centauri story telling of getting you into the progressive story through technology, quotes, expanding power.

The only issue I have, and I guess it's not really an issue against playing the game, is there is no real competitiveness, Basically, you are just constantly one step ahead of everyone else. This makes winning the game more a matter of time than skill.

I have to get better cause first of all save scumming takes like 5 minutes to load due to the size of this game. So thats one way to fix it haha.

     In all seriousness, its a great game, very in depth, hard to master and is getting regular patches fixing core issues. And like I said it makes you adapt to the pain the game inflicts when something bad happens. You have to adapt, and it makes you a better player for it. You gotta do a lot of research into things to reduce negative outcomes but once you get it, its soooo satisfying. I love strategy games, and I really really suck at playing them without being a save scummer, and trust me I hate myself for it too. 

     But this game is...different. You have to accept loss and recover. In short its like xcom in a lot of ways. (Which the game is inspired by considering the developer made the long war mod) And I think thats a benifit to the game when good and bad happens. Makes for great stories.

Having a servant gunship with one missile take out two battlestations (ARC lasers) and a fusion generator in one day with the worst missile available, the entire colony the next day leaving me at a massive deficit for space resources, and the aliens verging on declaring all out war.

This time 7 special interest groups are competing for resources to determine how best to deal with an alien invasion. Also Terra Invicta shift's the focus away from dealing with localized ground assaults, to preventing the aliens from making landfall in the first place. Even 13 hours in it's fairly obvious that any action taking place on Earth is considered a failure by the game and it deter's this via making it as uninteresting as possible. Only problem is that it seems that's all you really can do in the early moments of the game.

Game literally takes forever to finish, first 4-6 hours literally just early game setting up. Gameplay is a little shallow and follows a repetitive loop once you figure out how to play.

-Ground stage feels like a civ type game with really shitty army mechanics
-Ground stage has sublayer which is agent actions which you need to manage in order to expand land more effectively
-Space flips everything you knew upside down and you cant stay away from it but it is enjoyable
-Space combat is like trying to fuck a wombat. I havent figured out how to do it nor does it look appealing in anyway that i would want to.

You arent allowed to pick and choose which system you play so even if you really enjoy 3 aspects 1 is always going to feel like a chore or boring and if you stop fiddling with it for even a second everything starts to explode.

Something I cannot stand in this game but i know it will probably change:
-No inter country trade tied to gdp or anything, we live a world where 30 nukes going off wouldnt crash the world GDP and if it does it only does so because the pollution not because of the social and infastructure effects. That one country is a crater though
-Occupation and war doesnt seem to damage GDP
-Every race is borderline the same, you get a special unit a special research different ""goals"" but all the gameplay is exactly the same, you are still doing the same exact thing even though 5 modifiers are different.

The major negatives are:

1. Bad UI:
The UI is plain bad. Too much clutter and obscurity in the game mechanics. The game does very little to teach you on its mechanics. There are lot of obscure mechanics which isnt obvious and wont become obvious even if you spend 100s of hours trying to learn the game. You need to watch a lets play series by big youtubers just to even get into the game and another 100+ hours to understand it enough to beat the game. 

2. Poor Replayability:

At first the game looks like it has lot of replay potential like most grand strategy games. Thats why I invested so much time into learning this game and finding the nooks and nuances of the game. However, the more time you spend in the game, the more you realise that the replay potential is very limited. I have now completed 6 full play throughs in the game and all of them had the same path to victory, even the different factions. There are only very few ""good"" or viable paths to a win.

Many of the systems in place now are badly balanced. For example, Ship design and combat are a major part of the game. Even besides the poorly explained intricacies of space combat obscured by poor UI, the balance itself is poor. There are very few actually viable paths to get a good working space combat ship. For example, there are 30 different types of reactors and 30 different drives for a ship. However, only 4-5 of them are actually useful for anything you will do in this game. Most of the other choices are just wasted resources and bad choices which will just be a noob trap to use.

Same with the Tech tree. In a game with such a big selection of tech tree and projects, you would think that you should be able to finish this game through multiple pathways through variable paths in the techs in the game but in reality, thats hardly the case. There is hardly any viable pathways for success than the one or two paths for a win. Most of the tech tress in the game or useless and add very little to the path to victory. So, even though you might be overwhelmed by the tech tree at first(which is again due to bad UI), as you learn the game more, you will realise that majority of that is just bloat and you only have to do and WILL have to do certain must do technologies. So, there is nothing different to do in your next playthroughs except go through the same tech and project paths to get you to win. There is no meaningful choice or simulation here. This game is bloated with such meaningless choices for research and projects.

Whats worse, the direction the game is headed towards is even worse, wherein you can get locked out of critical technologies because of RNG.

Same with weapons systems for the ships. While there are 40-50 different types of weapons in the game, you only ever need 5-6 of them to win. Thats not a problem if many of those 40-50 systems are viable. But the problem is , only 5-6 of these systems are actually useful/viable and using anything else is just again a noob trap/bloat mechanics. For example while you can have Lasers, Arc lasers, Phasors, Coil guns, Rail guns, Nuclear Missiles, Plasma weapons etc, only Phasors and Plasma weapons are actually viable and you only ever need to prioritise them and nothing else.

This is what hurts replayability. Replayability will come come having multiple viable paths to success, not by having only viable path to success out of a myriad of bloat which clutters the UI.

And whats worse, the direction the game is going is really bad too- where the devs have decided to add replayability by adding RNG checks for techs and projects to unlock, which means you can actually get screwed out of the win through no fault of your own, because the only viable tech dint unlock for you on time or dint unlock at all. The devs seem to confuse replayability with screwing the player with unfun mechanics

3. Bad Gameplay design:

There is too much micro needed once the late game sets in. Even a simple process of colonisation and exploration requires too much micro that it begins to feel like work at some point. The game pacing is too whacky too. Either you have too much to do or nothing at all. There is no in between. For example, the early game is all about rushing for control of nation states for resources to start the colonisation of space going.  But once you get your colonisation in place, it becomes a waiting game for critical techs to finish and hoping for RNG to roll in your favor to give you the critical projects needed for progressing to the next stage of the game. This can take 20-30 minutes of staring at a blank screen with nothing to do while you wait and pray for the project critical to the next step actually unlocks so that you can progress to the next stage of the game. But RNG can screw you for 2-3 hours and end your entire run too, ending 20-30 hours of game play you might have put in at that point.

Another example is the colonisation of outer space. In the colonisation of early game, all you do is send a probe to a planet/ space body and then set up a base by sending them from earth, which takes 1-2 years of ingame time to set up(5-6hours of play). But as you go towards colonisation of Saturn, Neptune, Pluto etc, it can take 10-20 years for sending probes, 10-20 years for sending settlements and then make use of these planet resources, .ie 40-50 hours of game time. You can of course build a colony ship dedicated to colonising these planets and manually do it yourself within 4-5 months of ingame time(20-30 mins of gameplay). So instead of having this process automated, you are forced to manually manage colonisation of the outer planets and systems and there are 100s of such outer colony systems to track. This is the type of mechanic which adds tediousness and micromanagement to the game even though it seems realistic at first.

The game has so many such poorly balanced and unfun tedious mechanics. All of them add up by the end game and drags down the experience

4. Bad Balance and Poor Replayability:

The game is badly balanced right now. There are very few viable drives out of 30, very few viable weapons systems out of 100s, 1 viable armor type out of 7 etc. This is the least eggrageous of the problems as this is the easiest to address among the myriads of problems in the game. And all of this destroy the replayability of the game.


I have 400+ hours of gameplay as of now and I have seen pretty much everything I had to see in this game. Of that, 200 hours was wasted in just learning the damn thing. So If I have to invest 200 hours for learning a game, I want atleast 2000 hours of replayability to the game and frankly, thats not the case here. Games like Stellaris, HO14 etc take a lot of learning to become better but they all give so much replayability that you get 10s of times the game replayability in the hours invested to learn them. However. from what I have seen, this game is not worth investing so much time to learn it because it isnt that replayable.

after 22 hours of watching numbers go up slowly, you can spend 5 minutes shooting down a spaceship. I don't know why one's on the cover, you spend less than 1% of the actual game dealing with spaceships.

Believe me how painful it is for me to not recommending this game. I really do enjoy it, and all hours as of this writing can attest to that. As space and scifi enthusiastic, this game is a joy.

However, Terra Invicta is currently an early-access game, and it shows, a lot. They are lots of issue with the game, and while most, but not all of them, can be blame on being and early-access game, it's still a lot.

Firstly, the UI isn't really good.

It share the same general layout as your ordinary 4X game while having much, much, much, much more stuff that you need to see. You'll understand the sheer amount of mechanics TI has to offer pretty early on, because you will start feeling frustrated trying to keep up with it through the UI, trying to access several of very vital information, which are hiding behind a submenu somewhere, possibly inside another submenu inside another submenu.

To understand why things get overwhelming real fast, you can consider that you basically playing 2 interconnected games at the same time - a semi-turn-base grand-strategy for control of Earth's nations, and a real-time grand-strategy for control of space assets. Both progress at the same time, so you have to monitor everything that happen. I end up messing up because I simply miss one critical notification in an ocean of information more often than actually making wrong decision.

Secondly, the pacing is weird.

It's slow, but not in a Paradox-game kind of slow, where things happen slowly but still involving enough while noticeably building up to something. A TI game can have an entire hour pass without anything significant happening aside from dealing with AI shenanigans, yet sometimes you get a 10 minutes of tense, actually relevance situations, with everything happening all over the solar system. They're no transition between these two.

And honestly, for all the potential depth the game has, the gameplay....isn't that complicate. What look like a deep, involving gameplay is simply a byproduct of very repetitive loops.

And, as I've mentioned AI shenanigans already, the AI weren't really good with decision making either. All AI factions seem to focus far less on advancing their own interest and more on annoying everyone else in the solar system. As such, huge chunk of said repetitive loops is to deal with whatever shenanigans the AI came up that serve more to boil your blood than to sabotage your progress.

Third, Optimization.

They are way too many moments in game where the game will grind to a halt for a couple of second. While I can understand some of them, others....not so much. It include moments like ending the phase, opening some menu, and viewing the tech tree. Heck, it took like 5 seconds for the full tech tree to appear.

Speaking of tech tree....Fourth, Tech tree is a mess.

It's very detailed, which isn't a bad thing. The problem is that some area of the tree are very underdeveloped, while others have way too many steps to get through.

For example : They are 3 different laser wavelength, each have 3 different beam type, each of which have two possible mounting location (spinal-mounted and hull-mounted), which each of them have 4 weapon size available....and you have to research them all individually. On the other hands, things like civilian fusion development or entire field of genetic engineering are covered by one or two techs.

Then there are propulsion. They are dozens of them, which you'll likely be using about 6 of them, give or take, because most of them are side grade of one another, or just garbage. And likely, most new player wouldn't be able to tell which one they choose research as well, because they are tons of them that look good on paper but are too impractical to use. Again, terrible UI.

I could go on a bit more, but my point should be clear. Despite how awesome the potential of the game is, I cannot recommend it in its current state.

""But you played for 100 hours. Surely they must be some redeeming quality, otherwise I wouldn't stick with it this long""

Obviously. As mentioned, I'm space and scifi enthusiastic, and I play several of my games for narrative rather than gameplay, so bad gameplay can be substitute by awesome setting and narrative in some case, and this is one such case for me.

once you figure out how to actually play the game, the basic gameplay loop falls apart in space.
in other phases of the game, there are contested stat checks, warnings, little pie charts, and visual indicators justifying the gain (and loss) of ingame assets.
the game feels basically symmetrical between player and non-player factions.

so anyways, once you stop losing your first 5-10 games and start developing your space strategic map, you get enemy factions running 'control space asset' missions literally every single turn for the rest of the game.
enemy players start sending agents back and forth between every single space station you own.
you can never intercept an enemy agent or detain them as they *leave* a station your agents visit.
it takes 2 full game turns (or 1 month) to 'defend' a single space station, with 'station defense' actions lasting only 1 year.
you have to cross reference every single space station you have in the earth-luna system to check which ones have been 'defended' before sending agents off.

every single interface action in this process totally sucks, feels like a complete waste of time, and feels designed literally just to reduce the number of player turns that can be taken per hour in a game that is already incredibly slow and drawn out.
I cannot describe how big of a stumbling block this is for a game, or how much goodwill the game earned in other game systems and totally burned away here.
I genuinely regret paying full price for this game because of 'control space asset' missions.

Started with The Resistance, all factions, on Normal. My first two attempts were learning the ropes, and on the third I really thought I had it. I got all of Europe, combined it with Russia, almost all of North America unified, working through the Middle East and Africa. More often than not I was leading in tech, had Mercury to myself, various outposts bringing in the resources, building what I thought were pretty decent ships. The first alien landfall the AI even helped out, nuking the majority of them and mopping up the rest. However the second landfall was near China, which was Servant territory, so the aliens had a foothold, and the AI decided that nukes were no longer useful. I managed to stay off the aliens' radar and got to the point where I needed alloys from an alien ship. My fleet was on par with the aliens', so I figured I'd take out one of their smaller groups and I'd be able to deal with the consequences.

It was at that point when everything went bad. EVERYBODY turned their attention to me. The aliens roll in with a 6k fleet to my 2k and disable it, then would routinely hit it just before it finished repairing, and eventually destroyed it. My backup fleet at Mercury is nowhere near that, so I try to build it up. But back on Earth, I'm getting hit by councilors from all sides, and mine are mostly tied up trying to keep my territories in check. All the while, the aliens are systematically taking out the non-ally AI who don't seem to care because they're too busy causing coup d'etats in my territories that I thought were in a good place. Eventually, I control one half of the world, the aliens and their allies the other. I'm moving troops to prepare for war, the aliens declare it, then somehow the USA revolts, and I decide I've had enough. 

That all took me around 50-60 hours. I was having fun, but seeing all that I had built up fall apart in only a few in-game years was frustrating and soul-crushing. I really don't want to waste another 50-60 hours for it happen again.

**Update** So I gave in and started another standard Resistance run, and this one has been much, much better (hence the additional 180+ hours). Using the experiences from the last game, I currently control 99% of Earth, have bases on Mars, Mercury, and Europa, and have fleets/stations that can successfully fight back and defeat the Aliens. My complaints now are superficial, or due to it still being in development. 

I would now recommend this game, but with caution. It will take time to learn the ropes, and you'll still keep learning things as you go. If you stick with it, the feeling you get when finally taking it to the Xenos is a pretty nice reward.

There will be times, particularly early on, when you close the game and say it sucks out of frustration.  That said, something will be bugging you about giving up and it draws you in.  What draws you back?  It is the sheer depth and challenge.  The game goes in phases and when the midgame or late game kicks in, it can take an enjoyable experience and turn things upside down.  With each attempt, the player is more prepared and ultimately becomes stronger with each try.  This is the reward.  Tens/hundreds of hours of playtime to explore different options and strategies in a sandbox that is very large...this makes you feel how hard it is to conquer and control a solar system.  Push too hard or get too confident..prepare to be humbled (setting you back tens of hours).

In an odd and gratifying way, playing the game also provides a potential explanation for the world we see IRL.

The game does have bugs and unusual interface issues.  This is a legitimate pain in the butt, at times.  

I consider this game great just for the depth and replayability.  Few modern games make such a painful experience; it is a lost art to make a complex, engaging, and thought provoking game.  The amount of time you will invest playing this makes it well worth the price; this game will give you hundreds of hours of playtime whereas some games give you a 10 hour rush.

These factions have views that range on the spectrum from 'kill the xenos' Space Marine style, to the aliens are the messiah and should be worshipped. Initially, you are on earth and you compete with the other factions for control over nations and resources in order to further your agenda. This part of the game play is innovative, pretty well developed for early access and fun.

As you learn more about the aliens, human technology advances rapidly and your faction must start to colonise the solar system, extracting resources from the Moon, Mars, Mercury etc. This is a second phase of the game, which comes at a nice time, so that you are still growing and consolidating on Earth but now have the fun added dimension of space colonisation, plus the story line surrounding the Aliens continues to advance.

Late game is where the game falls down. Ultimately, the point of all the resources you are mining in space is to build ships. Assuming you are an anti-alien faction your goal is to fight or at least hold your own against the aliens. 

The ship design process is clunky and poorly explained. It can lead to you getting ships stranded or not able to do the missions you wanted them to do. Just about everything in space feels a bit janky and like a lot of effort just to navigate.

The space combat system is even worse. I positioned defence fleets at all my main mining spots, Ganymede, Mars, Mercury and Titan. This is because random Alien ships show up and destroy the colonies. However, even with the defence fleets chasing the Alien fleet is super painful. The Aliens can just evade away if they don't want to fight and you can't catch them. This is with every technology unlocked, as chances are you can't afford the absolute best ship drives. I understand the evade mechanic is for realism, but its not fun. Also, after the fleet evades my defence fleets they just bombard my colonies and kill them anyway. This is one example, but it feels like the late game is a slog and a process to get through rather than something fun.

Yes, initially I was impressed by this game and it seemed to tick all the right boxes. It was deep, engaging, interesting... however, 300+ hours in, that has pretty much evaporated and the arbitrary time-delay concepts integrated into the game simply to make it longer are frustrating and feel really cheap. 

As of right now, it has been nearly a decade of game time where the aliens our outmatched by my ships but the limitations imposed on me by the game means I have to continue to wait. For example, to create ships, you need resources. To get resources, you need to mine them. The top level mines cost 5 mission control (MC) each... except, once you have a certain number of mines, and that number isn't particularly high, that cost goes up exponentially so that now, each new mine costs me 90 MC. Even if I build Mission Control in that base. It doesn't make sense except to needlessly slow the game. 

So, what to do in the meantime while resources slowly trickle in? Auto-pause every 2 min to shuffle your agents around and deal with Earth issues that have become trivial and annoying instead of meaningfully contributing to your gameplay. Why can I not unite Earth despite controlling nearly all inhabited land? Why are factions with goals that at the very least aren't opposed to mine at war with me simply because I'm doing well even though I have traded resources and given away technology to them? Why are my enemy factions still able to exist despite my killing all their agents time and again, despite them being bankrupt? 

There is a lot in this game, which has now become rather shallow, that is not a bug but a design feature simply to draw out a game which has long since had an inevitable conclusion. Continuing it does not add anything enjoyable to my experience. 

Worst of all is the end-game mission. Just... why?! Without spoilers, to even be able to do it, I have to achieve a status that makes doing the mission moot. If I am able to do the prerequisite for the Resistance end-game mission, why even bother with the end-game mission. It doesn't make sense. 

I hope the devs fix these things but considering these aren't bugs but the game designed to be this way, I have little hope of positive changes. 

I'll leave my original review made at 60h down below. 

In short: Is this game for everyone? No. Is this game worth it for those who like this style? Well, look at at time since release and my hours played. 

It's deep and takes time to understand. In some ways, it's like chess in that you can learn the rules fairly quickly but the larger strategy of the game takes longer to appreciate. For an early access game, it's remarkably polished. The tutorial does a fairly good job of helping you to understand the different aspects of the game even hours later since many aspects you won't even encounter until quite a few hours into the game. 

The game can start off a little slow but that's a really good thing because it gives you the time to explore all the things you need to do since complexity really starts to take off as you progress...

Your primary gameplay loop revolves around Councilors, highly talented humans with specific skills, such as being Spies, Tech Moguls, Journalists, Judges, Commandos, and so forth. Presumably they are the pinnacles of human skill and ability who can do near impossible feats like infiltrate a government in two weeks. Try not to think too hard about how Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian both kinda fit as Tech Mogul and Celebrity as our last, best hope against the Aliens.

For your turn, you assign each Councilor an action and they spend the next turn (one or two weeks) carrying that action out. Do that again and again until you've defeated the aliens. Well, and as you take over countries, some of them have armies that you can move around the map.

Countries have money, science, and ideally a space program, which gives you the resources Boost and Mission Control. You use dots to allocate how a country spends its effort on all these things, you can change those any time on countries you control. If you spend wisely, countries stabilize and grow. If you spend cruelly, you can pillage a country for its wealth, leaving it war-torn and unproductive. You can also gain technology in the form of sociology strategies that unify countries into bigger and bigger nations, such as the European Union. Bigger countries have more ""momentum"" and are easier to develop and manage.

Your Councilors get ""items"" in the form of different military groups, intel agencies, corporations and crime syndicates that build up their stats like pieces of armor in other games. Higher stats make your Councilors more effective at the things they do: Gaining Countries to your cause, stealing them from other factions, investigating the aliens and other faction councilors, imprisoning or even killing your rivals, and defending your turf. The country stats are probably loosely based on real world almanacs and worldbook settings. So developed countries with space programs and militaries like the the United States, European Union, Russia, India and China all have a strong value for your goals. But they're also nearly impossible for starting, low-stat Councilors to grab. They gain XP and as you give them orgs they get strong enough to turn the big, powerful countries. Although lots of things, including countries you can control and space assets have caps you can grow over time. Anyway, eventually you either conquer a country with a space program or gather some smaller ones that don't have one but develop them enough until they do. This opens the space game.

At this juncture the game becomes a little bit like Anno 2205 or even very early Stellaris, in that your goal becomes to get some space mining outposts. Your Boost stat allows you lift hardware into space. Early goals for the small amount of boost available at the start of the game could include small space stations in Earths orbit, or moon bases. Basically the baby steps IRL Earth has now and in the upcoming years.  Landing a base on Luna, or perhaps saving up a larger amount of Boost and making the jump to Mars, lets you get things like Water, Volatile Organics, Metals (like iron), Noble Metals (like gold and titanium), and Fissiles. Earth has all these things of course, and you can build them with a mix of Money and Boost. But if you mine these things in space, they are free from Earth's gravity well and generally available in a space-side pool. Boost is a big bottleneck, but once you have space resources in space, it becomes exponentially faster to build more space resources. This creates a rather beautiful transition where huge Boost costs give way to very low space costs.

As your space resources grow, the sleeping dragon of the Aliens begins to notice you. At first, they are like a sleeping dragon who arrived in the Sol system. They are in theory powerful enough to win right at the start- but they just flew a long way and need to take a long dragon nap before they do whatever their plan is. (I won't spoil it). So your goal is try and achieve YOUR goals, while being in the same cave as a large, powerful, sleepy dragon. While unifying the Earth in the ground game that has lots of conflict and wars and the like, and expanding in the space game.

Terra Invicta isn't for everyone- I find it fun, but it's a very narrow, particular kind of fun. If you enjoyed paying attention in geography class, or learning the planet names in astronomy class in grade school, odds are improving that you'll like it.

The PACING- the pacing in this game is slow, like cement shoes slow. It can take a long, LONG time to do anything, and while you can accelerate time, every two weeks you have to lay out which ""cards"" you want your Councilors to play... again. And again and again. The single simplest cure I can think of for this is to either just allow, or offer an early tech, that lets you put Councilors on autopilot so you don't have keep manually doing Defend Interests again and again and again.... I know this feature wouldn't be impossible to add, because the AI already figures out what its Councilors should do.

A second consequence of pacing is that space is big, and there's nothing close to a fancy warp drive here. Orbits are calculated something close to realistically, or at least ""authentically"". If you have a beginner spaceship engine, Pluto is 80+ weeks out there, and even Jupiter and Saturn are going to be a year away. This is NOT a game about instant gratification in any stretch of the imagination. Looking at my play time, it looks like it's about 150 hours a campaign so far. Coming from a team who once made something called ""The Long War"", this is pretty long. At times I was thinking that it felt so slow and ponderous that it felt borderline disrespectful of player time. That said, no  one had a gun to my head forcing me to play. But I want to warn anyone going in just what an EPIC TIME SINK they are potentially signing up for. The biggest fix I would suggest to this would be to shave 30-50% off the tech point cost of any tech over 2000 tech points, scaling. 90,000 research just gets tedious when you have to click Defend Interests again and again and again.... 

Pros- 
Gives a good feel for earth, and our struggles with poverty and war and education. You will learn or at least practice a lot of geography.
Will get a feel for space, and what feels like a plausible strategy for maybe spreading out to Luna, Mars, the asteroid belt, then maybe someday the moons of the gas giants. The series The Expanse fits nicely in this niche!
The mystery of the Aliens and finding some sort of path forward through the darkness can feel fun and interesting.
Making progress on Earth can feel good too.

Cons-
UI is functional but pretty clumsy at time. Sometimes lists are alphabetized or ordered by number. Sometimes NOT!
PACING. Time sink! This game sucks up a LOT of time to get anything done.

What I think holds this game back right now more than anything is a lack of clarity in certain areas.

A simple example: Setting priorities in countries does not easily show you the outcome of your actions. I can hover over the tool tip, and get a floating point number indicating how much the value is changing every day, or you could clean that up and say to me ""At this level, [blank] will increase by [blank]/ be ready by [blank]"". Some of these kinds of explanations are in the game already, such as the ship KPS needed to get to Luna, etc.

Counselor Management, something that is absolutely vital to the early part of the game, especially on higher difficulties, is difficult as is. I want to be able to compare a counselor that I'm considering sidelining against the counselors I have access to in the pool.

Confident that this team can tackle these kinds of issues going forward, so I have no reservations recommending this game. Happy Hunting!

edit: really guys? You're going to not include Helsinki as a claim, a duchy of Russia for over a century before the Whites took advantage of the formation of the USSR, and with the backing of Imperial German soldiers, couped the country and then proceeded to commit war crimes, starving thousands upon thousands of their ""political enemies"" in concentration camps? Not even going to allow for the Paradox-esque stupidity of allowing Sweden a claim because before the formation of Finland that whole spot was just Sweden?

I normally end up with a sinking feeling of inevitable defeat and ""there's no point carrying on"" with RTS games ,as the realisation that on this occasion I've failed to keep all the plates spinning the way they should be and opposing forces are taking advantage of that failure.
This is very different  - basically because I don't have a clue what is going on...but things are happening alright.
As my agents subvert nations, bring about coups, undermine democracies, or undertake peace keeping missions, assassinate the opposition , or steal their technologies, it looks like I'm back stabbing my way to victory...and that's without researching the most mind boggling complex technology tree I've ever experienced, , launching probes, building space stations, designing real life physics space craft. 
Did I mention micromanaging individual nation's economies and directing investment towards my goals - military, knowledge, diplomatic?
Unfortunately  there's an ever present threat from invading aliens, whose motivations and actions are yet to manifest - they seem to have subverted an Earth government and have their own agents walking amongst us, and a lot of fleets in low Earth orbit for some reason, but they probably come in peace, and if  they don't I think I can probably exploit the chaos  their  arrival will bring. Probably.
So to sum up - I haven't got a clue if Im winning or already in the downward death spiral and that's fine - there's simply far to much going on and things to manage to worry about ""winning"" - and I'm not even sure what that means in the context of this game. The plot slowly unfolds around you, and you're never quite sure if what you're doing is helping or hindering your efforts - it's a real ""X Files"" type vibe- the truth is out there (probably) but at best I feel I'm just nibbling at the edges of it.
Now there must be a reason all the space ships I'm designing have weapon hard points, and the tech tree reveals ever more powerful weapons - but as just transferring a space ship from one la grange point to an orbit around a mining base on an asteroid requires a basic appreciation of delta vee and orbital physics, I'm not really sure how ship to ship combat is going to work...but I'm aching to find out.
Visuals for the game are nice, the text is hard sci fi heavy and the plotting is complex to the point of ""WTF is going on here?""
If you like your games complex, deep, intelligent and multifaceted - this definitely for you. I'm currently playing against three AI opponents rather than the available 7 and I feel I'm just about keeping up. Probably.
The learning curve is steep but not insurmountable,  and once you understand the gentle art of subversion and insurrection,  the rewards are extremely satisfying. All that remains is for strategic and tactical blunders in space combat to leave my ambitions in smoking ruin...and that's fine -this is a game where the journey and the fun along the way outweighs the destination.

Gameplay: 
The game essentially occurs in two different areas. Space, and earth. Earth has most nations and national economies and structures simulated to provide a place for your faction (the group you lead) to take control, build up assets, and provide a power base from which to build your space control. Once the technology is unlocked (and your boost stores are high enough) its time to take to space and expand your operations there. 

Cool things this game does: 
- Space combat is honestly awesome. Its intense, fun, and while the controls are a little clunky, it runs well and is enjoyable.
- Earth control. I didn't think once I hit lategame in my first playthrough and actually understood how the game worked I would enjoy coming back down to earth and developing nations, but I did. The earth portion of the game is actually a lot more fun than I initially gave it credit for. 
- the insane tech tree and system. It is truly a simulation game tech tree and while it has flaws and is insanely complicated, its cool to go through and unlock new stuff. Alongside that, global technologies (the main techs) are group efforts among all the factions so everyone unlocks the same technological baseline simultaneously. 


Now, onto the Balance issues:
- Drive technologies need to be better balanced. It is a simulation game so I understand the need for drives that simply aren't as good, but having them set up as practically a noob trap isn't good (higher tech cost and better stats on paper, massively impaired by heat management, Firefly comes to mind) 
- Making techs in a tree occasionally just not appear from random RNG. I can (barely) accept this with drives, but doing it with upgraded buildings and ship modules which have no alternative is just bullshit. As for drives you can always go down a safer alternative path, but when gamechanging drives which require largescale tech investment such as Daedalus have a 20% chance of being unlocked it just becomes kind of bullshit. Stealing the tech from another faction would be a viable explanation and way to obtain techs you didn't unlock, if other factions were ever capable of becoming anything other than a joke lategame. 
- AI running nations into the ground. This just needs to be looked at in general, the AI not knowing how to create functional states turns them into pushovers late in the game even when they control large chunks of territory. 
- Lategame human ship meta is boring. Less a balance issue, more something I hope gets changed.",1668044170,1668044170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

   We have failed and it is becoming increasingly obvious we have done so.   Every day the ships of the aliens who darken our skies become more and more numerous, and except for a few scouts we have been utterly ineffective at bringing them down.   We are starting to match them in technology but they have numbers and they have time... Time that we do not have anymore of.  

   As leader of the so called resistance, we were supposed to be the last, best hope for humanity,  We surely gave it our all, and if you look on paper, we did an amazing job.  It took humanity 100,000 years to climb out of the mud to make a campfire.  It took us 10,000 years from growing our first plants to a civilization that spanned the globe.   And now it only took us 20 years to spread throughout the solar system colonizing everything that the light of our sun reaches with any intensity.  

But it was all for naught, for we are surely going to lose this war,   We do not know why the aliens do not just pound us into the dust of these world we cling to, maybe they find our bodies unworthy to even be killed... Maybe they are afraid the high radiation levels might resurrect us..   But we have no real chance to make a comeback.  The protectorate is working on a project to permanently subjugate humans in exchange for our survival as a species, and they may be our best hope right now.

   Then there is Humanity First. I thought them crazy when we started all those years ago, but  they have saved humanity again and again.  Make no mistake our world has payed a heavy toll for our survival as they used nuclear weapons over, and over, and over, and over again.    My scientists tell me if we had not warmed the planet so severely with global warming, we would have had an ecological collapse.  Over the  last 20 years every faction except ours has launched every nuclear weapon they can get their hands on.   I say it like we are special but we were too cowardly to do what should have been done: our nukes are the only ""effective"" weapon we have against the armies of the alien.   Even the aliens when they got a foothold used nukes against us, with millions of lives being lost as we attempted to fight them through the curtain of nuclear armageddon.  

The rest of the factions appear to be so far from their goals, I really wished the exadus project the best to escape but I do not think they are going to... and the initiative... well.. peace was never really an option.   

Only the servants are probably going to get their way, hope they appreciate getting what they wished for. 

Humanity will probably survive but I am not sure we will want to. 

To the 9 billion souls I failed... I am sorry. 

9/10 would doom humanity again.

Edit:
After some downright ridiculous playstyles I did manage to win this game in November 2069 after 400 hours of play.  What can I say, I am a sucker for desperate last stands. 

 I could write a novel about the 90 year old councilors with near superhuman abilities defending earth against the aliens and hundreds of other emotional moments that if you consider them happening in the real world rather than as pixels on the screen are heart wrenching.. 

I want to thank the developers as well.   Their game had a lot of really nasty bugs that completely blocked my progression multiple times but each time I sent a copy of the save to them and they were able to make a patch allow me to keep playing.

Good complex 4x strategy game where you can/required to take fighting from Earth to the solar system.
It can be played as a massive geopolitical sandbox where almost everything is possible to do. Wage the wars or stop them. unite the nations, make the modern empires fall and result in a lot of smaller independant states, nuke your enemies or overthorow them by coping or fueling the revolutions. Possibilities here are truely numerous.

But there are also things that wasn't so good from my personal VERY SUBJECTIVE perspective:
- some tech projects can be locked from you for days while you already met all requirments to unlock them. It was really frustrating cause I thought that I'm simply missing something. May be there was some hidden date requirement...
- it seems that uniting some nations is simply impossible without some 'hacking/cheating'. You always required to follow patterns that devs prepared for you, which is not best for the freedom of choice and replayability. (e.g. it seems that you can't start EU unification not from the France)
- no military air force. We have nukes, army, navy. But where is mah planes? Yes I'm aviation geek, how can you tell? Aviation can deal some damage to the defending army, or help attacking army with occupation progress. Also it can potentially help with some flying alien threats.
- Crimea(Sevastopol) is part of Russia but not occupied while there is occupation specific state in the game. Weird choice.
- I can't find any active way to counter enemy councilor when you know for sure that they will try to purge youre CP. There should be an mission to sit at country and attempt to intercept any foe with offensive misions if their Espionage and protection is not good enough. I may be missing it somewhere.
- damn, unification projects are expensive
- there seems to be no way to ally with factions or exterminate them completelly. Even when you manage to kill all of their representatives and they should not have any influence left to afford the new ones. The only way I found to somewhat disable them is to compromise them by re-recruiting one-two of representatives and then systematically killing all others.

Played about another .... 40+ hours since my initial post. There's a couple bugs that I've found - the tooltips will resize at random to something almost too small to read. Been mentioned on Discord a few times with no response on cause or fix.

Warfare math is worse to calculate than in a Paradox game. Apparently 2 units with a 50% advantage will outperform 4 units fighting at the same time. My armies take 12-18% damage every ""round"" and combined my troops do about 6% to 1 of the targets. Thinking that math doesn't add up so much.

I'm hoping that Pavonis will maybe look into these so I can keep enjoying the game. If not I'll hope for fixes over the course of EA and pray that it's fixed at full release. 

======
If this is what the ""Early Access"" phase of this game is like I'm going to be absolutely floored when the full release comes out. I'm still pretty early in the game, I think, but with everything I can see I can't imagine what else they would need to put in for to to actually be ""complete"".

Seriously, I've been looking for a game like this for a while and I'm quite pleased with everything in it so far. The multiple factions and separate goals they all have will mean there's some replayability here as well.

Primary problem: Way too much management for way too little progress. I mean, things are tracked down to the hundred-thousandths place. When your traits are like +1 buck per month, then you're getting like 0.03 bucks a day. Not that the day matters, because despite taking the time to simulate everything down to the couple hours, you can only interact with the world (outside of commanding armies) every half month. Honestly, that half month is even too often. 

Also, doing anything in space before you can mine is literally a trap. Don't do anything but put down the hab core on valuable moon provinces, until you can mine. Then as soon as you can mine in space, you place the mining facilities, and actually take off.

Also. Launched a nuke. Just because. Nothing really seemed to happen outside of the light show. Not to mention left clicking on the research priorities screen decreases priority. But left clicking on the nations screen increases it. Like what the hell?
Oh boy. And the fact that you can't tell what national policies you can enact, until after you've assigned your advisor to do so, and waited an entire turn... why? Why doesn't it just like... have literally any tool tip like ""Can join federation. Can unify."" Or stuff like that?

My suggestions:
Have the management take place every month. Roll a couple times for the mission they are assigned, and then at the end of the month give the report. It will also help to counteract the feeling of frustration when you roll a 79 when you have a 78 chance of succeeding, because the report right after will probably succeed.

Slow down combat. Simulate movement by the day, but don't bother simulating the economies and research and such until the monthly tick. That'll cut down the needless calculations by around 30 times. Makes it run faster. And nothing of value is really lost. And much, much more pertinently, let armies just be told an end destination to try and reach, rather than forcing us to walk them there one province at a time. That's really annoying.

I've played 11 hours, and by the end of it, I was just exhausted, despite basically assigning half my agents to permanent missions. It just keeps stopping to ask what I want to do with the agents. Let me try and build the space economy in peace. Jesus. I don't have any more control points for the Earth. There's nothing left for me to fight over.

What I would like to see is just a way to have your propagandist agent to just indiscriminately wander around each month, spreading the good word. A lot of the time (past the early game, where you're trying to capture particular countries), I really could not care less where they do their thing. But it's inefficient to keep boosting one place past a particular point. So just wander around spreading the good word to random places.

However, this game suffers from a few very critical issues.

0.  It is grind tastic.  Make no mistake this is a 120 to 150 hour game for your first game.  The first 60 hours are fun, the last 60 are playing wack a mole with Alien Spaceships that drift away crippled from an engagement with you fleet faster than your shit engines can catch them.

1.  Diplomacy is garbage, There is functionally no diplomacy in this game between the factions.  They will all turn on your and the only way to keep them in check is to assassinate all of their councilars/spies all the time

2.  The Space Combat interface is garbage.  There are no methods to issue group orders outside of attack.  Movement is horrible and becomes a simple game of charge in a straight line and point your ship at the enemy up until late game (in which you just turn AI control on).

3.  Engine Design is garbage, About 90% of the engine techs are worthless garbage where guessing the wrong tech just delays your progress.  Best advice is go find a strategy guide on Reddit and only research 1 of about 3 engine tech paths and be done.  All Engines need to have their thrust doubled and their Delta V increased by 2x or 4x, to incentivise fighting the Aliens outside of Earth's orbit.

4.  Earth management is horrible.  Basically the earth based country investment takes so long that its only function is to provide research points and military strength.  Anything else provides basically no return due to how long it takes and penalizes groth for large nations.  It is literally more effecient for a nation to just conquer a bunch of tiny countries that invest in Mission Control than to invest in your own.

5.  Control Point Cap is stupid.  The only way to increase your CP cap is research, and at the end of the game it is a 5 CP research (that increases in research points each time).  You start with less than 150 CP, and you have to research that tech 30 times to increase it by 150 at the end game, and it stays the same pay out the entire game.  Basically it is an end game tech when you are bored and is designed to make factions that need to control the world for their victory conditions have to wait 30+ in game years of researching the tech and doing nothing else to win.

6.  Mission Control cap absurd, It is intentionally designed to be low and can only really be solved with installing command center/mission control modules on satellites (yes you can invest in Mission Control but after about 30 hours in game it is more or less a worthless investment over just taking over any number of smaller countries).

7.  Resource information needs to be presented better.  There is no real way to see the natural resources your colonies make after the mining installation bonus.  You have to manually click on each colony one by one to find out if you made a bad early mistake and need to destroy the colony

8.  There is a hidden Mission Control penalty that as you use more Mission Control you get a general Mission Control Debuff.  Early game a colony might need 4 Mission Control to operate, and then late game to add another colony that cost might be 30 mission control.  Which is mitigated by building more colonies/stations to make more Command Centers/Mission Controls which cost more mission control to put up.  The solution is to delete about 200 MC worth of colonies and Stations and build a bunch of MC on the remaining stations to drop yourself under the exponential limit

9.  More garbage engines, early engines take thousands of water to fuel.  It is stupid.  You only get the kinds of resources from mining to support those late game, and by then you just shift over to antimatter.  It is designed to make it so your fleets can only be used for Earth Orbital defense

10.  The UI is on cocaine.  A pop up comes up, to close it it immediately zooms you in to a random spot on earth.  Regardless of what you were working before.  That needs to stop

11.  Basically no replay value.  Very few people are going to want to restart another game to experience another factions slight changes to the text in research at the cost of another 100 hours per game.  Once you finish your first game, presumably with the Resistance, you uninstall it.

12.  Country Unification rules are stupid.  You basically can't unify the entire world unless you decide to make a murder board of how you need to conquer/cede nations to get the claims you need.  There needs to be more claims on nations at end game to make a unified world nation instead of 4+ separate alliances that are under your control the entire time.

13.  Because of the of the above, it basically means mods are required to increase the CP, MC Caps and earth investment to speed up the end game grind, which of course invalidates achievements.",1667621362,1667621774,False,1,0,0.489773958921432495,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- difficulty
- really great space battles
- interesting story
- kaijus
- unique gameplay
- decent ai that's fun to play against
- skirmish mode is good for testing ships, but is still fun on its own if you just like playing out Expanse style space battles. 

cons:
- ui is awful
- a lot of repetitive actions that should be automated, I felt like most of my game was spent rotating councillors  around on defend interests missions
- first campaign was 250 hours, and it took 50 hours before any of the juicy space stuff. 
- music and sound design is terrible, but you can mute that
- All the graphics work clearly went into space combat, which is fine but it leaves the story and events as card pop-ups 
- It would be nice to have nuke animations and a kaiju model that's rigged properly. 
- Habs and colony's are pretty repetitive, it would be nice to have templates and a way to calculate building yields before they are built

Second, this game is - easily - three or four games?  Stacked on top of each other?  It's a ""take over the world during an alien invasion"" game, an ""early space diaspora economics management"" game, and a ""combat and fleet tactics"" game to boot.  You will play all of these games at once.  It will be very difficult.

I waffle on whether I'm having a good time with Terra Invicta - but since I'm at 51 hours in and I keep thinking ""ooh, what happens if i..."" in my off hours, I think it's hard to argue that it hasn't been worth my time and an enjoyable diversion.

As far as criticisms, it's very very slow?  Temporally, very slow.  I'm 51h in, and I'd say i'm maybe 2/3 of the way to losing the first campaign I've started.  It takes an extremely long time to do stuff, and there is a *lot* that you need to figure out for yourself.

None of this is _bad._  This is a good game, and I'm having fun with it - but I'm hedging my recommendation against ""games in early access tend to change a lot before final release.""

It's probably the most engaging and enjoyable strategy games I've played in years. Made by the development team that formed producing the excellent Long War mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Terra Invicta delivers a grand strategy angle of the alien invasion concept.

As mentioned in other (both positive and negative) reviews, however, it currently (accurate to 4th November 2022) struggles a lot with teaching a player how to play it past the early game. There is a lot of game concepts that's difficult to keep on top of every turn, the UI is at times clunky and confusing (especially the tech-tree, until you know how to navigate it) and there are some hidden mechanics that need to be explained better when they fire as to why they fire (alien 'hate'). The good news about this is that the game is still in early-access so more polish is likely. In the meantime, there are an increasing amount of guides online to teach what the game and it's tutorial fails to.

So overall: if you love the game's concept and are willing/able to dump the time into learning how to play it, I think you'll have a lot of fun with the game even in it's early-access state.

The theme is enormous fun--you're playing one of a number of Illuminati-esque factions vying for supremacy in the wake of an alien invasion--but the execution is a little shaky.

The audience for this game is fairly narrow; you'll need a tolerance for 40-hour playthroughs and spending a lot of time staring at a spinning globe as you fast-forward until the next ""turn."" The initial early gameplay where the player is gaining power, investigating abductions, and causing Earth mayhem is tremendously fun. However, the mid- and late-game (which you likely won't reach for 10+ hours) can approach tedium; there is a huge lull between the periods where a player has established initial power, where the aliens invade, and where the player possesses the capability to actually fight the aliens.

The tech tree is famously dense and I would argue too much so. The game wants to call itself hard sci-fi, which is fair enough, but it is a game and even complex games abstract certain elements. I don't think it adds much to the game to have players choose between 50+ engines for ships, build them all individually, choose exactly where power cells will go on space habitats, and so on. It reminds me of elements from Diablo II's game design where certain class traits were basically traps, where once you picked them you were basically doomed to be subpar; here many of the systems are traps, but it is not immediately clear which ones are, and the game is far too niche to have exhaustive guides to help the player. The equivalent here would be scrolling to Minute 42 of a Perun video to see whether you need to roll back to an Autosave from 4 or 5 years ago.

In its current state, Terra Invicta reminds me of perhaps my favorite game, Hearts of Iron IV (into which I've sunk a disturbing ~2000 hours over the years) after all of its expansions came out; you'd find yourself running a country, sending individual spies around, designing planes for the Pacific Theater, and choosing how much butter to put on the popcorn at the Normandy staging ground movie nights. But in Terra Invicta, some of those fiddly systems are crucial to the gameplay; at present, if you give your troops kettlecorn instead of butter you might well find their morale is too low to defend a Martian base from the Protectorate. But unfortunately you made the decision to go with kettlecorn ten hours ago.

The game is very interesting, and it has many fun elements, but at this stage it does not particularly respect the player's time.

I love the fact that the focus is greatly on geopolitical intrigue. You can have several agents from different ""walks of life"" (among these there is military, politician, diplomat, activist, investigator, criminal kingpin) each having a unique set of skills, which can be further developed as the agent acquire experience. You can be ""the good guy"" and try to steer the populace to your creed and mission through public campaigning or you can try to subvert a nation controlled by one of your opponents, toppling them.... or you can just conquer them militarily, if you have an army!

The game is incredibly, amazing good in a lot of ways and mind boggling terrible in quite a number of other ways. I love the game, I'm going to keep playing the game, but I can't in good conscious recommend it to anyone without severe reservations. 

First and foremost is optimization. I've got a pretty good rig. But this game CHUGS, even on the slowest settings. My guess is the problem isn't with the graphics quality, but with the sheer complexity of the simulation math, and this introduce lag that makes the game damn near unplayable at times. And this is supposed to be early in the game's life cycle, they've stated that there is more to come, which with current performance is completely untenable. The game WILL become unplayable for many people unless some serious work is done to streamline when and how various things are calculated. They may have put themselves in a nasty situation with the decision to make it real-time rather than turn-based. We will see. 

The second major complaint is clarity of information. The event tracker that is supposed to help keep you up to date on events and going ons of your rivals is essentially worthless, but at least its hidden so well that you can mostly just forget about it. The game can't make up its mind on whether to display income and upkeep as months or daily (and quite frankly, since this is a real time game, the having a distinction doesn't make much sense at all. Does my monthly income change per month based on number of days in the month? Does my daily income increase per day for shorter months?) On and on and on in terms of just presenting you with decisions and ways to ""plan"" but never explaining anything and presented in such a way as to make the ability to infer information from context difficult. 

But what they have is fucking great. The factions, the building up of nations and space assets, the competition and strategy. If you beat your head against the wall long enough and can put up with the fact that the game is a slideshow sometimes, the underlying gameplay is fucking brilliant. It's feels like the old, original XCOM from 1994 in some ways, given a fresh face and its own twist.

[b]Good:[/b] Puts the [i]grand[/i] in grand strategy and the [i]hard science[/i] in science-fiction. It's a staggeringly impressive game, in both scope and detail. Essentially several different, nearly full-sized games, somehow successfully stuffed into a trenchcoat. Somehow, it works pretty well. In particular, the factional shadow government sim/strategy loop is nearly Sid Meier-levels of addictive. (Just one more coup d'etat before bed, I swear...)

[b]Bad:[/b] For an ordinary title the UI would be a fine (if a bit homely) effort, but Terra Invicta's sheer gameplay mass outmatches its UI by quite a margin. The result is usually serviceable, but often lacking, and occasionally quite frustrating. Also, the nascent AI makes for a fine punching bag but isn't yet capable of tying its own shoes, much less running a space empire. Lastly, the tech-tree is a bit, er, ambitious. It comes off feeling a little preoccupied with plausible physics theories, and not quite focused enough on things like balance, usefulness, or *ahem* readability.

[b]Ugly:[/b] The space combat is awful. The only thing the controls are consistently capable of succeeding at is causing frustration. Wrangling just a few ships is exhausting; trying to coordinate a 30+ ship melee is a disastrous cat-herding nightmare come to life. I invested nearly 300 hours into a single playthrough(!) and the space combat was where I had to draw the line.

Overall, I really enjoyed Terra Invicta. It has immense potential, and one day this game could find itself in a league of its own. Sadly, I cannot recommend it to just anyone as of yet. If you're *truly* willing to put up with the awkward teenager/early access phase its going through, it (probably) won't disappoint. But if you're looking for something ambitious, amazing, consistently fun, and well put together: wishlist and be patient.

As someone that is an over thinker, I enjoy this complex game play and abstract thinking; however, it comes with some draw backs. Whilst you can diversify and increase your councillor abilities, for the most part, it is very repetitive. Because it is such a grand game, by the late game you can have a enormous amount to manage: councillors; nations; diplomacy; control; stations; bases; ships; design; defence and offence. I am sure there is more. It can feel like too much. Because games take a while, the thought of starting a new game leads to despair - but you most likely will because you will learn so much in your first game or two.

So, would I recommend? Yes. Well, why? What do I like?
I like the early game and rush for power.
I like the struggle to maintain power.
I like establishing and growing my councillors.
I like being a shadow government.
I like the real world setting.
I like the ability to chose what I want to focus on, I like the freedom.
I like growing my nations how I want, ""priorities"".
I like the espionage.
I love the story and the struggle to save Earth from the aliens, that is why you thought about this game right? If so, buy it.

So what could be better?
The AI and diplomacy. It often just feel like me and my councillors in the world doing our thing with the aliens, I don't really feel the presence of the other factions too heavily. The AI and its general interaction with you amongst the other factions needs to feel more real: I want them to trade with me; I want them to tell me how ""not cool you stole Italy from us - pay reparations now or we will retaliate"" - then I have to rush to put all my councillors to ground or one risks dying. Presently, this never, if ever, happens and I really do feel alone with the aliens.
There is a steep learning curve. The tutorial helps, but there is a lot going on - this may be too much for some people.

Because of this, it isn't a game for everyone and even for every strategy fan, but for a hardcore space/science fans or the people that enjoy the combat from The Expanse – it can be a cult title.

It is still in Early Access – it has a huge amount of content, great potential and can be very enjoyable, but it not polished, not user friendly and not easy to learn and understand.

The game has steep learning curve – there are lots of rules and systems to learn. The tutorials are very basic, which is expected from an early access game and absolutely not enough to understand how to play well. There is a lot of information displayed when hovering with the mouse over the many game windows and stats – reading it helps, but even this is not enough sometimes. The game is not intuitive, the rules are complex and many, and there are some traps for the unsuspecting player during the game progression – that means you may need guides and information from outside the game to win. But if you love to discover how things work - this game is a treasure.

Terra Invicta has three very different “games” in it.

- The Earth national politics game. There your shadow cabal of agents play James Bond games trying to control as many nations as they can, to get control on the planet and resources to go to the space. You have to manage the resources, the economics, the population, the armies (some with nukes), the space programs and even the global warming. All that while the aliens abduct people and the other factions try to get the control for their own agenda.

- The space colonization and economy. The initial establishment of space stations and mines requires a lot of resources from Earth, but once you have mines in space, it becomes much easier and cheaper to build from there, and you need a strong space economy to discover and build space ships to fight the aliens (or to fight for them). There is a strategy game, what and where to build and how to manage you threat to the aliens, so they do not crush you before you are ready to fight them. The traveling to the various solar system bodies uses realistic orbital calculations, which may bring excitement or frustration, depending on good you are at understanding the matter.

- The space ship building and combat. You build you space ships from the many different components you discover and initially they are much worse than what the aliens have, so an early space war is a suicide. The space battles use realistic physics rules – no turning in space, unless you turn the whole ship and burn. There are rockets, lasers, railguns and other weapons – the fights feel like a slower and more strategic version of these in The Expanse show or books. The controls are not well explained and definitely not intuitive, but when used properly can change the battle outcome by a much. It is possible to have battles where depending on the strategy you may lose all your ships with most enemies surviving or you kill all enemies without losing a ship.

The game definitely needs more work - it can use many quality of life additions and some balancing here and there, but even in  its current state, it has a huge value to offer for people who don't fear complex challenges.",1667342157,1667342157,True,3,0,0.522601187229156494,0,True,False,True

The game has a lot of depth and can be overwhelming at first with a lot of information and mechanics to assimilate, but once you get the hang of it, it is a blast. There is multiple factions with each having different objectives, stories and play styles, making the game have a lot of replay potential. Also, a game can easily take over 30 hours to complete, so you better be in it for the long haul. 

The space warfare is the main appeal of this game and it is really good. It lets you experiment with all sorts of ships, weapons and tactics you feel like trying. Pretty much every ship type and weapon type are viable and have a purpose. The management of nations on earth is also pretty interesting letting you expand a wide variety of nations with the many formables that the game has to offer and let's you specialise nations how you see fit. Pretty much every region has their strength and weaknesses, making every countries you choose to focus on viable to some extent. The earth warfare is a bit simplistic, but it's not the main focus of the game. 

My only complaints with this game is that there's a small period in the game around 2025 to around 2028 where you aren't really doing a whole lot after you set up your earth economy and start going into space as you are just waiting for probes and stations to be built without potential for much earth gameplay due to being at command point cap and not much space gameplay due to not being strong enough to take on the aliens just yet (Though playing in the european union is more proactive for earth gameplay and makes the game more fun in that stage). 

The AI is also very incompetent at building good nations on earth and they make very bad ships, but they will do their best to slow you down if you get too ahead by sabotaging your techs and stealing your technologies if you are not too careful, but it is pretty easy to outscale other human AI factions. They will also mess with you in space by attacking undefended space and mining stations, so they will still put up a fight. On the other hand, the aliens are pretty competent for what they are intended to do and will be challenging without being overwhelming for newer players. There are higher difficulties to make the game more challenging once you're good enough to beat normal difficulty that make the game harder without making the AI cheat, so that's always great. 

The game has some performance issues in the late game, but if you play on a smaller galaxy setting, that doesn't seem to be a problem. There is also a couple of crashes that can occur every once in a while, but it's not very common. 
That being said, the game gets updated frequently and I expect this to be fixed by the time the game is officially released. 

The game is also currently only singleplayer, though it seems like MP might be a possibility in the future. While the singleplayer is very fun, doing co-op games with friends or team based PVP would make it even better, so let's hope they add it eventually. There is also a active modding community for this game, so I fully expect this game to get a lot of extra content from quality mods in the future. 

If you are a fan of paradox games and have too much free time on your hand, you will definitely enjoy this game and you won't have to gaslight yourself into playing victoria 3 just to watch your GDP go up as you can do that and so much more in this game.

Another annoyance: your agents get abilities that are useless to them due to the fact that they don't have necessary skills to use them efficiently. But no way to hide those extra buttons, making it hard to remember which agent is good for what. I ended up just renaming them to some like ""Spy skill"", ""Comm skill"" etc.

With the current state of AAA games selling you the same game every year with a blind focus on sales, Terra Invicta is a refreshing release that is innovative and ambitious in its scope and mechanics.  The level of realism and complexity present in every aspect of the game is truly awe inspiring and clearly shows the passion, creativity, and commitment of the developers, writers and artists.  This game is something different and represents the best qualities of the video game industry.  

In depth, I want to talk about the complexity and ""difficulty"" of the game.  I can agree with other reviewers that this isn't a game that you'll play for the first time and be instantly good at.  The tutorials provide an explanation of what the UI does but they certainly won't make you an expert or give you a lot of direction.  Many reviews complaining about difficulty and claiming you need to be neurodivergent to enjoy this game are appealing to gross hyperbole.  Terra Invicta's complexity is its strength, because when there is so much to learn, there is so much to experience, improve, and succeed at.  I want to firmly state that the difficulty is not ever crippling because if you identify and learn from your mistakes, you will get better at the game.  I highly recommend watching a playthrough from someone like PerunGamingAU on youtube as he explains how to approach the game with a lot of knowledge and specificity and you can really see how much fun it is for an experienced player.  In general, looking up stuff on Reddit and asking questions will benefit you a lot.  5-10 minutes of learning from other people will yield hours of more optimized and fun gameplay.

If you're curious about what I mean by complexity and depth, I'll give a few examples below:

-Nations are wonderfully intricate.  Your ability to control nations relies on your public support, control of neighboring and allied nations, and the nature of that nation's government (ranging from autocratic to democratic).  The population, economy, education, and order of a nation are all interrelated and affect the nation's capacity to provide a range of resources.  Learning to understand how a nation's investment points work and should be allocated is tricky at first but later allows you a fantastic amount of control over their development, resource revenues, and overall direction.  The ability to influence nations' international relations for your own interests is robust and rewarding.  Destabilizing the countries of rival factions while expanding and securing your control is how you'll spend most of the early to mid game and assembling the right team of councilors is crucial.

-There are a range of counselors who specialize in different missions.  Augmenting your own counselors by acquiring organizations will increase their stats and increase the probability of success in their missions.  Understanding and improving the tools they have at their disposal will have you thinking things like ""India is controlled by the Servants right now, but unity is low and unrest is somewhat high.  My activist can increase public support while my officer can increase unrest, allowing me to launch a coup in around a year.  I can use my inspector to investigate their councilors and if I acquire some orgs for my kingpin he can improve his chance of assassinating them.""

-Researching technologies is a lovely exploration of game theory.  At any given time there are 3 technologies being ""cooperatively"" researched by all factions, as well as up to 3 faction projects that only you research.  You have to decide how to allocate your research income across these technologies and projects.  If you contribute the most to a global technology, you get to choose the next one, allowing you to move the technological agenda of the world in your desired direction.  You can go straight for mining the moon, but if other factions have better space programs in their nations than yours, you might want to choose another technology until you can better exploit the opportunity.  If you need to develop your fleets faster, you'll need to focus more on your own projects than global techs.

-Space is handled with realism in a hard-sci fi setting.  The entire solar system, including the asteroid belt, is yours and your enemies' for the taking.  Once the world has researched space mining, there's basically a gold rush for establishing mining operations on the moon and eventually asteroids, mars, and other planets.  Building and launching these operations from Earth is expensive and takes a lot of time, so you'll want to expand your infrastructure in space.  It's really cool to build a space station on Mars and then have that station set up a base on the surface.  Once you have fleets, you can bombard surface targets, assault alien and enemy ships, and destroy enemy stations.  

-Fleet mechanics could be a whole game just by themselves.  You have to design your own ships, accounting for mass, acceleration, range, firepower, survivability, and role in a fleet.  There is a candidly ludicrous variety of ship components that you can research, and online discussions of which are the best to go for are plentiful.  You can choose between railguns, missiles, and lasers.  You can choose between different drives that use different fuels and power plants and have different levels of efficiency and maneuverability.  Researching everything is a waste of time and resources given the breadth of techs, so try to specialize for a certain set of designs.  Optimizing a ship design in the 2030s is an exercise in judgement, because you'll always be thinking ""If I can just research a few more techs, I'll have better ships, but there's an alien carrier inbound on Earth and the Servants are already building a lot of shitty ships.""  Ship battles are in the style of Total War games, which I like, but I will admit that the game's tutorial for ship is particularly sparse and the combat UI really does need improvement.  My honest advice for ship design and combat is again, look stuff up online and practice in skirmish mode.  PerunGaming on youtube has by far the best explanation currently.

I can go on and on and still not cover everything this game has to offer, but I want to emphasize that I don't think of myself as super smart or even experienced with 4x strategy games.  I just put in a little time here and there googling stuff and asking questions and I realized how awesome this game is.

Also the radio chatter when near a orbital is incredible and I want it for ASMR

So I'm at 70 hours now.  It's great.  There's a few things I'd like to see though, so I'm gonna put this on the shelf and watch it closely.  Here's some of the things,

1. Supply ships.  I heard its in the roadmap so thats cool.  Having a ship run out of fuel and just be SOL is lame.

2. Tooltips.  I had to dig around for a while to see what influenced GDP and pop growth (which is it's own weird thing.  those static pop growth modifiers are kinda weird and I just removed them after 10 years or so) Anyway there could be way more tooltips or codex entries to explain certain mechanics, or at least how to improve them.

2.5. Filters.  Please let us filter unwanted techs or fleets or habs or whatever from any lists.  Choosing a tech is starting to be an actual headache around 2035, can't imagine what late game looks like.

3.  This is weird, but I found it odd that the aliens let me build anything in earth orbit at all while having a fleet nearby.  It wasn't that much of an issue until the Protectorate declared their mission.  Soon after their declaration, the aliens started fighting them in Earth orbit and destroying their habs.  REALLY CONFUSING.  I don't wanna spoil too much but that turn of events was wack af given their mission.  Then the aliens left Earth orbit, leaving everyone elses stations alone.  Me as the Resistance had 8 or so, with only 2 being defended at all (with fleets half as powerful as some of their single ships).  

????????

anyway this is a weird immersion thing so low impact but immersion is what made these 70 hours awesome so I hope something can be done here

I also hear the game starts to get weird and crash heavy as saves get older, which is fine for early access but dang that really needs to get fixed for a game like this lol.

If these things get fixed this is an all time great for me.  The overall simulation is incredibly fun to interact with and watch.  The faction system, agents, and RNG is great since there are so many ways to influence it.  The density of research is crunchy as hell and some (some) of the global tech presentations are Alpha Centauri tier.  I have barely interacted with the ship builder and space combat, and am looking forward to it later down the road.

anyway yea it makes you feel like XCOM vs 6 other XCOMs and its an incredible mess 10/10",1666463798,1667256544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I played Dwarf Fortress and all of the Paradox games, so I can work with obtuse user interface, but sometimes this game is in the league of its own. Like when the councilor is not allowed to do a certain mission on a certain target, when you click on the target, it instead selects the first one from the list... You get used to checking the target box after several times, but this is a really bad design! Or how to find out the best asteroids for space mining you have to juggle multiple screens, without forgetting to click on the actual asteroid, otherwise it still shows you the information for some previous one... The whole UX needs tons of polish to stop being frustrating. 
And then there's the difficulty curve. Apparently, you are supposed to play the game once, get steamrolled by aliens (after sinking like 40 hours into the run), google what you did wrong (also trying to understand if it's a bug, as some say, or a very intentional design, as others say), and then start again! Such fun! The game has tools to show you alien threat level and what actions set them off, but these tools are actively misleading the player instead of helping.

Overall, none of these are problems that can't be fixed. I just hope that devs do not mistake lack of convenience for difficulty.",1667124970,1667251687,False,6,0,0.558018982410430908,0,True,False,True

It starts great as you take command over an illuminati-type org trying to enforce its agenda on the world in the wake of an impending alien invasion. Cajoling nations to your cause, redirecting research and funds, wars, taking over NGOs, even assassinations and coups. And then slowly starting to step into space, building space stations and mines on the moon and beyond. 


But then some very questionable balancing comes up: Your ability to control more of earth is mostly limited by your administration capacity and not by your shadowy manipulation skills. You suddenly have twice as much research as all the other factions combined. You have more space resources than you know what to do with, because spending them makes the aliens take steps against you personally. So you feel very artificially constrained on multiple fronts, while some gameplay elements become irrelevant.


And after that, you reach the slog that is the endgame: Nigh indestructible alien stations, year+ travel times to get anywhere and just needing to slowly grind out a victory against human factions that have been made utterly irrelevant, and aliens too afraid of your fleets to take offensive action, and too cheaty to be dealt with via attrition.


And some issues are just game long. The interface is poor, and so much of the information you need is hidden in different submenus or not filterable. It also lags something fierce, with just opening or closing the *reduced* tech tree freezing the game for seconds. Menus are also grouped seemingly at random, and with no consistent sorting/filter options/defaults. And some obscure mechanics as well, such as having your armies instantly go from modern to WW1 relics because you peacefully united two countries. 


The combat also deserves special mention for being cool in theory (newtonian ships with somewhat realistic heat dissipation issues) but a complete nightmare to control. You can design your own ships, but there are dozens of nigh identical modules (do you want gas, molten, or a solid core fission reactor? Or maybe not even fission at all?) and lots of dubious numerical problems: your phaser point defence will claim to have twice the range of particle point defence, but in actual combat the opposite is true due to something something optics.",1667248454,1667248454,False,42,0,0.755388557910919189,0,True,False,True

When this first came out at the end of Sept/beginning of Oct, I talked it up to a coworker as though xcom, crusader kings, and the expanse had a baby but that was only after 20 hours or so of playtime. Now, after putting in over a week of in game time into the game, I have to say it is so much more than that. Yes, the premise is very xcomish, but the execution is something else entirely to the point that calling it grand strategy doesn't emphasize how [i]grand[/i] it is. 

The game is basically two separate games combined into a single package. You have the on Earth portion which acts as your standard strategy game of taking and holding points, amassing influence, hindering enemies, brokering deals, ect. But this portion is really just there to get you off world and colonizing and exploring the solar system to be able to either help the aliens establish control over the Earth or hinder them and their allies progress. How you go about doing all this is up to you.

There are issues with the game. I haven't actually ever finished a playthrough as I either get into a death spiral due to missing key features of the game or screwed up with how I played, or hit instant crashes at certain times in the game. Playing the validation release of this has eased off the crashes that I've seen as each release seems to be more and more stable.

The UI definitely needs work, but it does appear that they are doing that as I noticed when I booted up the validation release today that the threat meter is now always visible as well as the ability to hide tech and ship items that are obsolete. 

Some of what certain things do seem obliquely referenced, and I would honestly love a more in depth overview in game of what each of the ship archetypes do. The tech tree is a mess to be honest, but with how everything interconnects, I have no idea how to make it easier to navigate.

I am putting this down as a recommend, but really for those that enjoy strategy games and hard sci-fi. For me, it was an instant purchase when it came out as it was one of the games that's been on my wish list for a while and there aren't really any games like it. That said, I know it isn't for everyone but if you are tempted, wait for a sale.

In the end, I came for the space part of the game but stayed due to the robust geopolitical sim in it and am really looking forward to what people do with mods for the game.",1667238536,1667238536,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
1176470,124716470,76561198014775585,0,8,237,0,237,1667150524,"First impression
From what I can say right now (early access, 3 hours played), this game is still in it's infancy gameplay wise.

What happened up until now: not much, actually. From what I've additionally seen (and what I fell asleep to) in a Let's play, the game takes it _extremely slow_ . 
To start with, there is really not much more happening than: Alien arrived in a ship. And crashed. Go deal with it.
That is your startingpoint really for selecting and sticking to a gameplay style between ""We are pro alien"" and ""We are pro Humanity"", ""we cooperate"", ""we flee"", ""we use that for our advancement"" and so on. Overall there are up to 8 factions in this manner (including the aliens themselves, I believe, and no, you cannot select the aliens so far ;). 
First impression:
It's promising.
It's only, in this early stage of development and personal time invested, giving not much to to, other than figuring out the game.
""Figuring out"" goes into all directions: is basically starting with a ""sandbox engine"" that has been finished to be usable. In this sandbox, there is a realtime model of the [strike] galaxy [/strike] solar system, a complex arrangement of elements and menues that you might or might not expect from a 4x game. Only, it describes itself as a ""grand strategy"" game.
The game itself is somehow ""realtime"" even though it is - currently - only giving you options for ""every other week"" quite litteraly. Maybe that will become a bit more ""real time"" and is - IMHO - quite boring so far.
One thing that makes it quite hard to play is the amount of text. There is a lot. Tons of it. Everywhere. 
From a SCIFI literature point of view I am happy with that choice. From a gameplay point of view, not so much. It is an understandable choice, as text is still easier to display as cutscenes and special effects, and yes, _some text_ is also read to you by one person or another. 
Overall it looks like Terra Invicta started out ""everywhere"" and is currently still not focused on ""one way"" - other than taking it slow, as it seems. Ah, and the ""which way do I choose"" also seems to be a one time choise - you do not have any influence on how your faction will act with / against the aliens other than at the start of the game. 
That being said, there is a lot of room for development. Currently, what you do at any point in time feels like ""we need to figure things out"" & ""feedback welcome"". 
Well, this is mine: The game pace is too slow for my taste as is. I am loving games like Stellaris and can identify a lot of elements in this game as well. I also see a lot of Xcom like games as an inspiration, namely the base idea of ""aliens are invading earth"". 
The game looks quite fine so far, the engine seems to be thought out basically fine. But: currently, there is no sence of urgency or purpose of the game elements in this game. It works, but it takes _really a lot of_ getting used to, also timewise. 
My hopes for this game are that:
1. the mission statement gets into focus - currently, your faction selection is not confronting you with consequences clearly enough. You simply get assignments / goals, and that is it. I hope that the game will show consequences and difficulties that you as a player have to overcome by choosing one faction or another
2. the sense for urgency is missing: with so many options on how to proceed, currently the game is completely open. While that is interesting to start with, with so much time passing by, urgency for specific choices does not become clear.
3. UI design & focus: While ""everything is there"", not everything is clear. [spoiler] e.g: if I want to be able to see all meaningful information for developing nations under my control I have to click between the overviews for all nations and a specific nation, because I cannot see all details in one or the other view. [/spoiler] Either choice is meaningfull or unnessessary. This is also true for
4.  the gazillion of technologies that _could / must?_ be developed. 

Currently Terra Invicta already looks & feels like a lot of effort has been spent for development. Now the hard last 20% have to be finished, to become a truely satisfying gaming experience.",1667220335,1667220335,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

I can only give the singular tip (for councilors) of trying to specialize the councilor pool that you have for your faction with the idea of replacing them before the mid game. The idea of wealthy, scientific, or influential councilors can off shoot the terrible pool you can draw from. If you think you can balance orgs with councilors you may want to increase the pool access you get very early through specific tech researched to have greater chance of getting what you need.

PROS
-Fun to be the underdog and try to herd all the squabbling Earth Nations into one Answer to the alien presence

-If you like analyzing and adapting to often counter-intuitive and complex systems interwoven in a game then this game is for you

-If you do not mind an Early Access game which has some - concerns - then give it a try
CONS
-Projects linked to certain Critical Technologies will seldom appear in the Project List until you research a Project to make more projects appear. Example - I got my 6th councilor slot in 2034 (20 years after discovering the Critical technology

-Occupation mechanic often seizes a country on a simple timer which the player cannot stall, leading to bizarre war consequences. Example - A war over Indonesia with similar tech values on both sides, with the EU having one army and the US having 7 Armies ready before they landed. Then the EU gained all four control points. Then they ended all of their alliances, which ejected all US armies automatically to a nearby country (even though they were already in the process of relocation to the US to make way for a nuclear response)

-If someone is docked at a Station and you want to Assault or Destroy the Station, you must first destroy all ships docked at that station to begin an Assault/Destroy mission. So you have to take out folks parked in orbit who may not be of the faction you are trying to act against, leading to the political fallout of that collateral damage.

-Enemy Councilors must be repeatedly Investigated because they Go To Ground and you waste a lot of time chasing all the Unknown Councilors repeatedly 

-A rudimentary understanding of rocket science equations is almost necessary to understand the ship design options, particularly as regards analyzing the correct amount of Delta-V for movement, combat maneuvers, and return capability

-If you dislike a steep game learning curve, then avoid this title as you almost need instructional videos to play the game at even a basic competency",1667068153,1667068153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Obviously, it's early access and it's undercooked. The AI stinks. The tech tree is illegible. The UI creaks when you push on it.

But there are glaring, fundamental issues that I don't think can be fixed on a budget.

The primary activity in this game is Waiting. It's how everything important happens. You go to a frankly underwhelming screen for a country, set some pips and then you wait. You wait and you dig up tooltips that tell you that your country has gotten better in the past few months of waiting. It will be now be more useful for when you're waiting for the next technology to be discovered. Most of your actions are about making you better at waiting. You build bases, you buy organisations, you conquer new places so that your numbers might go up more while your pips do the work. Waiting is the culmination of your goals, and I'm desperately looking for a meaningful sequence of events or even just a button to press instead of sending my councillors to passively advise for another week because it's what's best for waiting.

The game is ridiculously adversarial. I told you that the AI is bad at the game. That's okay, the aliens can trounce you at any time regardless. But the AI will continue to be bad at the game because the best way to advance, the best way to make yourself better, is to walk all over them any time you can. The best way to get the organisations you want is to steal them from other factions. The easiest way to increase the size of your armada is to steal the command infrastructure from countries under the AI, along with the whole country their pips worked so hard at. The way you protect your experienced agents from assassination is to assassinate their experienced assassins yourself. And the space race is just a game of Monopoly where the first people who get to the Moon and Mars will gatekeep the otherwise incredibly detailed solar system. If the AI were any good at this, you too would be struggling to make ends meet by embezzling tax money in Sri Lanka. There's a good chance you'd be knocked out in the first few turns, but if you didn't then you would still steamroll through the midgame until the aliens remind you that maybe you're all in this together.

Terra Invicta is a space 4X. You're going to be managing a whole empire of space rocks. It's got a tech tree just like Civ 2 (1996). It has the same very tired ship designer you've seen in every other space 4X, complete with the old missile/gun/laser split from GalCiv II (2006). And yet despite this, it's missed that these games easily become nightmares of micromanagement - something Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri already knew about in 1999. Every mining outpost looks the same, but it still takes two dozen clicks to set one up. You're going to be switching back and forth between your Low Earth Orbit stations to try and balance your waiting bonuses; save yourself the trouble and write down what you have and what you want on a piece of paper.

The organisations that your RPG-like agents equip are a staggeringly ridiculous puzzle: You will be, quite early on and for the rest of the game if you are so inclined, juggling 50-70 items of different sizes across 5 inventories, culminating in the late game which gives you a sixth agent for a total of up to 90 organisations equipped, plus 10 in your reserve. Did I mention that you get 15 of these to look at in the shop every other turn ? And you could also be buying them from the other six factions, a catalogue of several hundred minute combinations of numbers from the 31 stats they can offer. Of course, you get none of the convenience: No sorting, no recommendations, no preview, no overview, they even make you pay to swap them from your reserve! I'm not sure what RPGs the devs have been playing. Perhaps they feel this is a scale comparable to XCOM Long War - it's legitimately ten times bigger - but that game had chunky increases rather than 3-percenters, strongly defined classes instead of Commandos carrying my teaching organisations, and a pace that focused on a few moments of crisis and not maxing out your numbers each and every day.

So, that was a lot. There's more, like the fact you can lose your whole space economy because you passed an opaque threshold where the aliens deem you a threat. But it could be fixed. Some of the fixes don't even involve ripping out whole systems. You could have meaningful agent actions that improve a place you share a stake in. You could have more abstract space infrastructure, that fits a planet on a single screen. You could have a shared organisation pool, maybe a skill tree that's progressed through shopping opportunities. You could have an admin cap that's increased through overall game progression and not plain snowballing. But that's not what's on the roadmap. There's going to be more detailed warfare, more policies to describe imperialism rather than anything that would make discovering the technologies to travel the stars and to govern ourselves in a uncertain age a process I can feel involved in. And I fully expect another twenty space engines based on niche speculative technology to complete the 86 we already have. The devs are locked in at this point - it's what sets their game apart, it's what they're selling.

I think my largest issue with it in its present state is the sheer state of the user interface. Simply put, the game requires another game's worth of development time to make the UI usable. It currently takes far too long to do anything and you will end up wasting a lot of time doing simple actions. Like for the love of god, could the game not automatically zoom on everything I select, please.

Even worse is that, because the game is poorly tutorialised, it is incredibly easy to waste a lot of time performing actions that will actively hinder yourself.

I’ve debated the rating but after writing all this out I think I have to round down to a [b]not recommend[/b]. I’d be more than happy to change that if TI adopts just a couple of my suggestions below

First the good, the early game and the political system is a lot of fun. I dearly enjoy sending my councillors into countries to tamp down or pump up unrest, protect elites or set of coup-d'états, or just to try and uncover what the heck the aliens are up to. The narrative is woven in pretty well with the game, and I like that (as far as I've gotten at least) it all remains relatively plausible, in so far as a game about an alien invasion can be plausible. Still, all the different national policies are a bit tough to manage in the mid game. I think the unification techs should probably be moved earlier in the tech tree which would help smooth out that transition.

TI reminds me a lot of another game I've sunk a ton of hours into, [b]Fate of the World[/b]. Fate of the World by the way has an excellent interface for pulling up historical data (and future projections) of various metrics like atmospheric CO2, economic output, human development. Remember, good artists copy; great artists steal.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/80200/Fate_of_the_World/

One thing I would like a pop-up for, although there are probably too many pop-ups overall, is when an ally is eligible for joining a federation or unifying with another county, it’s very unintuitive to have to go in and hover over tiny flags, and until I figured that bit out I was just periodically sending in an agent to try and effect policy, which often just resulted in a wasted action while my man ate bortsch in Moscow or somesuch

Everything related to space is pretty incomprehensible to me. I've set up mines on Mars, the Moon and various asteroids. Researched a shit ton of spaceship parts and built up a minor fleet. Have a cloud of stations in low earth orbit, all to accomplish...what? That piece, along with the pacing, the tech tree, and the interface, all could use a good overhaul.

My suggestion to Pavonis, and I hope you take it to heart, pick your five favourite engines, armors, batteries etc and ditch all the rest. It’s ridiculously complicated for no good reason that I can see, other than to delight the physics/chem grad student who spent a few years of their dissertation dreaming up the engine/armor in question. 

(You can keep all the weapons, weapons are cool, because this is a game about blowing up aliens, you’ve got to have cool weapons or why even bother)

One thing I feel weird about is how there’s apparently no airpower in this game? Or railroads? My fault for taking over Russia but man it takes forever (like literally 6 months I think) to move them from one front to another. It also requires quite a bit of clicking from one province to another and managing more pop-up notifications. I think we can all agree Russia has a lot of problems mobilising their army but this is a bit much

Still TI definitely has a lot of promise, it's just also definitely an early access game. Interested people (and you know who you are, especially if you're digging into user reviews) might decide it’s worth the risk. I think you also might want to consider giving it a few more months of polish before diving in. But if it sounds intriguing to you it might be just what you're looking for this decade.

Also, they're working on a Cold War invasion scenario which actually has a pretty solid historical grounding: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/reagan-and-gorbachev-agreed-pause-cold-war-case-alien-invasion-180957402/

But as you can see I'm giving a neg review. And the reason is a couple design decisions that I truly do not understand, some major, some just cosmetic, let's start with the biggest one for me.

1. Assignments. Every two weeks the game stops and lets you assign mission to your councilors. Quickly you will have 6 of them. Every two weeks the game FORCES you to stop and manually assign stuff for them to do. It KILLS the pacing. For first year or two it's okay-ish, but after a couple years like that i want to shoot myself. 
I don't understand why not just make those assignments 10 or 20 times longer and just let it play in real time. Right now, the gameplay on Earth is more like a turn based strategy game, and gameplay in space is real time. Whyyyyyy? Dunno

2. Nation developing. It's slow. Very slow. And dull. You just click on couple dots and country after maybe 10 years will produce an army. You can invest in the country if you want, but change is miniscule. 
Endless Space 2 did it much better. Not only it explains what you're actually building/upgrading(like let's say upgrading railways to maglev or whatever), it also provides a beautiful arts to make your imagination run even wilder. Here - you click dots, forget about them for 10 hours and when you come back MAYBE you will notice that some numbers in infopanel have changed. I don't feel like I have any impact on my countries at all.

3. Right panel. It lacks vital information. Okay, my fleet is in transfer, but it wouldn't hurt to know where. Okay, my councilor is doing assignment, why not display its' chance for success? Okay, I have an outpost on an asteroid, instead of the name of asteroid you see and image of it. Now good luck seeing difference between that rock and another. You're observing Earth and want to just add one module to some station? Fuck you, you're forcefully teleported through an entire solar system, have to wait till camera gets closer to let you click the actual station, and only then you're able to build anything. Now go back to Earth. 
If it just opened station window I would save time and a lot of clicking. I dunno, make it so that I get teleported to the station when I double click or something, surely it's not that fucking hard. Same with councilors, fleets, anything.

4. Units. Inconsistent units  in values is a standard in this game. I set in options that I want units/months, research window still shows me in days. You have a missle launcher that launches 2 missiles/ 5 seconds, and there's this other one that shoots 3/7 seconds. Do the math, fuck you.

I enjoy this game and will probably keep playing it, but designers should really sit down with it for a while and actually see if some mechanics are fun or practical. Because they're not.

The good:
*the world diplomacy is great, the different nations and their historical and future aspiration to me are the best part, it looks like devs took it to heart and it scratches that alternate history itch very very well.
*the solar system has a very high degree of detail and feels like i got to know our solar system better
*the aliens feel like a threat and the different factions feel distinct even though they all have some similarities
*with so much going on in the research tree and the world relations it feels like there are countless ways to play it and the part of figuring our how to min max it is very intriguing.

The Bad:
*even though the research tree is very extensive it feels like there is a lot of dead weight especially in the ship building in the case of power and drive
*diplomacy between the different factions is a chore, finding the a councilor from the faction you want to is a game of hide and seek and you usually get nothing for it.
*losing the executive resets the 180 days timer instantly, we either need a way to counter or if we take control back during a set time it should not reset. this is too painful, makes no sense lore wise (did everyone decide my faction who ruled the state for years is suddenly illegitimate?) and is stressful not in a fun way.
*letting AI control space combat should be avoided entirely as it just seems to not take into account the maneuverability of the ship, consistently placing the long side of the ship in harms way
*space combat is about who has the better PD stack and who can overwhelm the enemy with fire power
*space combat controls are janky even with a maneuverable ship making it not worth while to invest the time and effort to do anything else either then moving in a straight line
*you need to babysit your armies, moving an army somewhere inland is a game of pathfinding the game could have solved for you but you need to click every country in the way to your destination. (and you would want to do this baby siting because it hurts your economy if they aren't in their home region)
*you also need to babysit your armies to get rid of the alien growth around them. if i am humanity first just shot the damn thing.
*after a space battle you need to wait around a bit to have control of your fleet and you cannot stack actions like, repair but also resupply (which happens so many times)
*sometimes you expect you could use the build in space function but on the asteroid belt it seems inconsistent
*public campaign having inconsistent results because its shifting things in an opinion graph towards your faction and not directly to your faction is convoluted 
*[spoiler] alien administration holds onto the nukes it got from its founding nation accumulating it and making it way more difficult then it should be to destroy them when you dealt with their armies as you cannot control executive and disarm them (this also makes no sense, shouldn't nukes be related to a region where they are stored? are the aliens keeping them in their quantum pockets?!) [/spoiler]

The Ugly: 
(mostly a lot of UX which admittedly they said that's what they will address but i want to highlight what was most painful to me)
*when unpause does not work because you need to choose a research, confirm assignments, fix org pool, it has a tooltip that says what you need to do but as a new player you do not know where to find it and nothing is trying to correct your mistake (i used the spacebar to unpause)
*research tree has a nice view you can see what leads to what and a fuller tech tree with search but you cannot use this UI to queue up research so you need to learn the name and go back to the UI which has that functionality.
*research tree is lacking information when hovering over faction projects (base on name alone, how can i decide to direct my research to the firefly drive or the antimatter drive?!)
*UI of research when choosing a project fills up with a bunch of projects making it difficult to find what you are looking for
*when the research UI is full of stuff there and you don't know what to go for there is no way to compare projects (should i choose weapons X or Y?)
*when armies are moving by sea it will state a destination region but no way of finding it on the map ([spoiler] how am i going to stop the alien death squad traveling by sea to hanoi if i have no clue where hanoi is?[/spoiler] well at least you get to learn geography that way...)
*when a fleet can no longer transfer. due to no fuel or damage its a guessing game of why that button is disabled
*when a councilor cannot act in a country its a not fun little mini puzzle to find out which trait is causing it 
*when you are blockaded its a mini puzzle of figuring out why that is
*when you try to move an army by sea and you can't (blockaded/no navy) its a mini puzzle as well (at first).
*there are too many cases where UI forgets your preference, (transfer UI always opening up expanded, habs always on everyone and not just my faction, quick select on the right opening always showing everything. game speed notches always starting on 1 and not automatically switching to 5 when going into planet view from fleet view)

I hope the Devs see this and i hope they work through these issues and flash out this gem, making it more accessible and giving a better feeling of the game honoring the players time as i admire the Devs for bringing this wonderfully complex game to life as i would like to be able to recommend it to everyone.

Terra Invicta is basically the strategy layer in XCOM (the original from the 1990's) with increased complexity and no tactical missions. You recruit and control a group of covert agents, do research and try to gather international support for your chosen cause. Much later in the game, you launch spaceships to do ship battles but there's really not much to this as your fleet are either numerous and powerful enough to crush the opposition, or not in which case the enemy crushes you. There is no artifical balancing to make sure ship battles become interesting. If you have the tech and resources, you autoresolve and win. The game is all about getting to that point (technology and resources) before the other factions do.

The pacing of the game is ""experimental"", if I'm being charitable. The tech tree is bloated and filled with ""empty"" techs that do nothing other than open a path to some other tech and give a bit of fluff. The game doesn't intuitively introduce you to its mechanics. Agent missions are poorly explained and important notifications, such as notifications that an agent has enough XP to skill up, are missing.

On the positive, the international politics of shifting countries to causes, unifying countries into super-nations which are either militaristic 1984-style hellscapes or thriving democracies with high research potential (hint: you need one of each) is quite engaging and fun.

If the pacing and UI is worked on, Terra Invicta has potential as a niche strategy game for the hardcore strategy gamer. As of now (the game is in Early Access) I can't recommend it unfortunately.",1666950604,1666950604,False,6,0,0.573951125144958496,0,True,False,True

I must admit that I only gotten this game due to its association with XCOM 2 Long War mods.
During the first few hours of play, I was thrown into confusion with the complexities of the game mechanics to the point that I questioned whether I made the right decision about purchasing the game. The in game tutorials does not do a good job in teaching the mechanics. This is an area in which I think the developers could have done a much better job. Continuing to fumble around research and not having a good sense of direction in my strategic goals saw me losing ground against the AI and Alien factions. 

I restarted my game several times after many hours invested in each run. I was not comfortable to proceed knowing that my starting few hours of play were far from optimal which lead to frustration as i saw the other factions progress while my economy was at the brink of collapse. 

Feeling rejected and dejected, I turned my attention to Reddit and Perun playthroughs (do check out his youtube) which gave me a better sense as to how I was supposed to play. With a better grip of the game, and having clearer on what I was supposed to do and how I was going to do it allowed me to see the game in new light. And I started to appreciate the complexities and the effort that the developers put in. They definitely did their research and I tell people that if you just removed the aliens from the game, this can be considered a geopolitics simulator. I would even go as far to say that the developers should be given PHDs (who needs to write thesis when you made a game that simulates the world!). This is a game for people who love realism with a twist, and requires great patience.

I do like the game a lot. The fact that I played about 60h in just a week is proof for that. The pull of ""just one more turn"" is too difficult for me to escape.

However the game is a mess, which is fair, given that it still is in early access. The tech tree is very extensive, but half of the technologies are outright useless, you have way too manypropulsion systems, that aren't doing anything fundamentally different than the next one. I've found that having the ion drive for early game exploration, the (advanced) cavity drive as a early-midgame workhorse, and then the orion drive for midgame serious ships being all you need. Afterwards the propulsion systems actually get interesting and you have meaningful choices (IMHO). Of course there are alternatives to all of them, however the way my first (as of yet incomplete) playthrough went, they showed up way too late to be of any use, or have disproportional requirements as standalone drives. I'm not implying that getting the tech that unlocks those drives are dead ends, many of them are required for very useful tech later on, but by themselves they are pretty underwhelming.

In general, the tech tree is too big. Maybe not too big, but too untransparent, because it isn't always obvious which technologies are actually worth rushing, which you can generally skip and so on. Obviously you can/should study the research tree, and plan things out. But for a first playthrough you don't know which technologies actually matter a lot, some sound better on paper and end up being underwhelming, and vice versa. I'm all for the right research at the right time being a potential game changer, however this shouldn't be something you only really are able to know on your second playthrough. You should be able to figure it out ""blind"", or at least get some good hints.

The AI has such a hard doing anything useful and advance their goals (well, except the servants). By the 2040 I had about as much mission control as all the other factions (apart from the servants) combined, and was the only one (again, apart from the servants) with triple digits MC. Generally the AI has such a hard time not getting completely outpaced by the player, and the invading forces.

I like most of the concepts, like going out, colonising the solar system, setting up mining outposts on resource rich asteroids, fueling my economy. However I feel like, even on decent asteroids your mining output feels very anaemic. A fully built tier 3 mining outpost barely covers the resource expenses of filling in the rest of the colony with shiny tier 3 buildings. Maybe that is intended design, maybe I'm supposed to at best keep a handfull of fully built up tier 3 colonies/stations around, and make the rest just dumb mining colonies with the bare essentials. 

The tutorial isn't great at teaching you what actually matters either, which given the sheer scope of the game is not surprising. The hints, while often useful on a very basic level usually don't teach you the specifics you want to know. Usually it just tells you where the buttons for certain actions are (which, thanks, I can read an UI), but doesn't really explain any specifics. Especially the shortcuts you need to adjust a ships trajectory/heading during space combat is kinda unintuitive. There are lots of great players out there who put their gameplay on YouTube, who can pull off crazy manoeuvres, and who have mastered the system, however for a new player (or at least for me) it is very hard to pull off most useful manoeuvres. Which isn't helped by the fact that in the early game your available drives aren't really combat worthy due to terrible acceleration.

Another big gripe I have with the game are armies. You get a pretty hefty investment point malus, if troops aren't in their home region. Which I think is implemented to balance out the effectiveness of just taking over a region/nation via ground invasion. However in combination with slow troop movement, especially early-midgame makes that yet another chore you need to consider when moving/using your armies. 

But before this turns into the ramblings of a mad woman I'll end my review by saying: Playing this game often feels like a chore. However I cannot in good conscience give this game a negative review, because these are just balancing issues in a game that isn't even finished yet, and overall only sour the overall great great experience slightly.",1666897775,1666897775,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The only connection this game has with it, is that the developers made the long-war mods for the recent xcom/xcom2 games, and the fact that both franchices have the alien invasion theme.
 
This game has 3 phases that open up organically. 

Early game is like democracy 2, only you are not a nation, but an organization sending your agents to missions and earth is your playground, but essentially it is a spreadsheet game, even more complicated than paradox games, considering the number crunching. 
Mid game is when the exploration of the solar system begins, building bases, habs with hotels, hospitals, marines, mines on planets and asteroids. 
Late game is when you start designing ships, and prepairing for realtime fleet space battles with newtonian physics. 
Now from early to late game you have 7 other factions against you, each with unigue win goals while aliens keep creeping up until the point there is a proper invasion. This game takes a while to figure out, in every aspect, the tutorial needs a bit of polish and there arent much articles or videos out there so you have to figure stuff out by trial and error. For example i really got the hang of every aspect in around 80 hours, and i am now doing my first playthrough that i will see to the end.
These where some of the best gaming hours i ever had however. I want to personally thank the developers for this, i didn't know i needed a game this much until i played it. I am obviously biased and can't find many faults in this one. 

This is the future of 4x games hands down. I am in awe of Pavonis interactive, of what they managed to add in the game, the scope, the mechanics, how organically the game slowly changes forn a spreadsheet to space exploration and fleet combats, the math, the numbers, the crazy stuff you can do, sending tank armies to fight Kaijus (not actual playable ground combat sadly), trolling the opposition hard, revolutions, planetary defences, trying to unite or divide Mankind and the list goes on.
Not convinced yet? They made the game with Modding in mind, so get ready, to have this one forever installed in your drive.

This is like the games that don't need graphics to spend thousands of hours on, like dwarven fortress, dominions, unreal world ect. Only this one has fidelity as well.

My objective was to resist the alien threat on our world and oppose those who would seek their 'friendship'. I began establishing my factions foothold in Europe, managing to gain complete control of France. I would continue to use my influence and agents to spread my control over all of western Europe. I had a small arsenal of nukes and an army now. Whilst keeping an eye on the alien threat, by sending agents to investigate UFO crash sites and abductions, I noticed other factions were growing in power across the world. One notable one, in Russia. They nearly had complete control of the nation, yet they were a rival faction and Russia had a large arsenal of nuclear weapons, I deemed this unacceptable, and using my existing rivalry status with Russia due to the war in Ukraine, I used my factions influence to make France declare war on Russia. USA joined me as an ally. The war was slow, I only had one army and I didn't want to attack before the vastly greater American armies arrived. When they did, I moved in... and launched a nuclear strike on Moscow, destroying all but one of Russias armies. I engaged my army against their final one but in a desperate and unexpected bid for survival, Russia nuked Moscow, their own capitol, in order to destroy my one army. Well, you USA's armies would help and follow me into Russian territory, they did not. The allied AI is a bit dodgy, constantly moving back and forth from one province to another scared to attack when they could obviously win. Weird. But alas, I sued for peace with Russia, having crippled their armies and population with my nuclear strikes. My land remained untouched. I later began to pass legislation within my factions nations of France, Germany and the Benaleux regions to create one unified European Union Nation. This made it easier to defend my country from external faction's schemes. Right now, I'm attempting to build a space station of my own, in order to begin building fleets later on.

I like the councilor and org system with their stats and traits. I would love to see more events or flavor that define their personalities and differentiate their ""classes"". 

I like the hybrid 4X feel of the game, unifying North America was really fun and realizing how hard it would be to actually turn it into a ""unified"" country was interesting. 

I do not like the current UI. For example, the space map has to focus on an object and doesn't allow a free floating camera which makes looking around harder than it needs to be. Another example, you cannot see the available pool of hireable councilors unless you have an empty slot, so you will have to fire someone if you want to check for someone possibly better. I would like to see another pass over for a lot of UI systems like nation menus, councilor menus, and space map. 

The game also lacks tutorials for a lot of critical mid and late game concepts, you'll probably need to watch a few youtube videos. 

I do not like how the game pauses for events, it makes it feels like its constantly stop starting and I typically keep it around 4 to 5x speed which means I am constantly clicking off windows and unpausing which becomes very tedious. Its like the game wants to be real time and turn based at the same time and they need to adapt either planet management/councilor missions or fleet combat to fit the other.

It's unreasonably complex and takes hours to even understand the basics, then you realize there is an entire 4X element to it you've not even seen yet, then the alien invasion starts for real and you lose because you pissed them off, time to start a new game! Terra Invicta is beautifully complex in (almost) all the right ways, I have extremely high hopes for the future of this game and any DLC they may make, give it to me. Few games let you play a political simulator in the shoes of a shadow organization controlling the nations and organizations of the world from crime syndicates to government special forces.

That being said the game does come with negatives. The research tree is...probably overly complex for no reason. It literally lags the game out when you open the full tree because there is SO MUCH SHIT...and a good 70% of it is sidegrade engines you largely don't use and sidegrade weapon systems. The game could use an ACTUAL tutorial and not just a bunch of popups and giant text boxes, this is a running issue with grand strategy games in general and I hate it. When you need youtube guides an hour and a half long to learn the game's basic mechanics you've failed with your new player experience.

Currently the first 20-50 hours of gameplay are engaging even if you're just building up your Earth economy and starting the story.  Unfortunately the late game has a lot of problems that are really low hanging fruit, for example:
- There are no refuelling tanker ships/no way to refuel ships except at stations.  Ships that use all their dV in combat are stranded and must be scuttled.
- No way to repair ships that have become immoblised; they must be scuttled.
- No way to change a fleet's orders once they're given, even if the game is paused.
- When moving to intercept a target fleet, the orders are 'cancelled' if the target fleet moves, but your fleet is still locked in to moving to that original location.

Tricky thing is, you won't have a single ship for your first 20-50 hours of gameplay.  Even then your first ship won't be able to fly to the moon, let alone attack anything.  The game plays like a Hearts of Iron 1936 Russia campaign: you spend hours and hours building up an economy before the war starts, or in this case, before the space economy starts.  You're probably spending 40% of the entire playthrough with no ships, which is fine, but just understand a lot of the hype around this game is covered up by the issue that most people haven't made it to the part of the game that needs a lot more work.

The next most pressing issues are earth economy and the faction AI.

There is an obtuse minigame surrounding how you direct investment in the nations you control.  The game design here is riddled with hidden numbers (eg if xyz > 4.2).  The UI does not reveal those magic numbers, nor does it explain the emergent concepts from the game design.  Sid Meier famously said games are about making a series of interesting decisions.  To make an interesting decision you need to be informed of the consequences of your decisions, otherwise you're just stabbing in the dark.  Terra Invicta got that right with their events system where it presents a choice and explains the consequences and %chance of various outcomes.  It fails really badly with the national investment screen.  Fortunately someone has already exposed all the inner workings of the economy on the TI subreddit, so we know how it works. Unfortunately it is complex to a degree which prevents a UI/tooltips from being able to explain things adequately.

As for the AI, it again seems to hold up well in the early game.  It does well with the initial land rush and manages it's economy well.  But regardless of the faction ideologies, they each seem to drive their holdings into the ground.  By the late game their lands are trashed and they don't show enough interest in grabbing the lands you have carefully nurtured.  In my current game, 5/6 AIs are effectively bankrupt (no $ and negative incomes).  Their income from earth isn't enough to support their space assets.  When a global economic shock occurs, the AIs have no reserves on which to draw.

I am generally excited about seeing Terra Invicta develop throughout early access.  As a SMAC fan, I adore the distinct ideologies of each faction and the obvious inspiration this game draws from SMAC as exposed in the tech tree.  I love the story and setting.

I'm 12 hours in, and I've only touched the surface of what Terra Invicta is about.  My Resistance forces are keeping low profile, other than assassinating the Servants (Alien pawns)  at every chance I get.  So far, no retaliation from their overlords, Ze Aliens.

XCOM vibes are real here, but, there is a RTS for the space warfare with Newtonian physics.  Most of the early game consists of taking territory and disrupting your enemies on earth.    It's key to not fight them all.  There are 7 factions (Not including the Aliens), and  not all need to be your enemy.  You will be ideologically opposed to a few.  The others you keep on a leash and feed tech and resources.  

I haven't actually built a fleet yet.  I'm not ready to.  I can't tell you what the second half of the game is like.  It's promising thus far.  I'll update accordingly.

*UPDATE*  10/25/22 AND 37 HOURS IN

There are actually 3 different game loops here.  The second 3rd of the game consists of keeping your earth assets secure, expanding those earth assets, harassing enemy assets, exploring space, and colonizing planets/asteroids with stations and habitats.  Your space fleet economy requires mineral rich planets/asteroids.  The AI opponents (Aliens and factions) will expand as well.  

You'll need to watch your threat indicator with the Aliens.  They don't know who or what you are until you start killing their agents, blowing up their ships, harassing their human helpers (Servants), or building your mission control too high.  Mission control (MC) controls the number of space assets you can efficiently manage.  Piss them off too early and they will curb stomp you like the filthy ant they think you are. 

Still, at this stage of ONE play-through (37 hours) , I have only a few combat ships and only killed a couple of Alien agents.  The research tree is unbelievably large, confusing and I can see endless strategies on how to play after my first play-through, but I have some time to go....",1665800188,1666697302,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

And I can agree that they can't get any more true than that. I compare this game to something of learning how to fly an aircraft. There is a TON of reading and learning. This is NOT game you jump right into and compare to another game in the same genre. A single playthrough will take multiple days to finish, and in those days you will be crafting not only what the game advertises, but your own perfect world. I've yet to finish a single campaign because there is so much to take in, and I'm still eagerly learning. I absolutely see this game getting some kind of nomination for a Steam award in the future, and I will gladly vote for it no matter the category.

After selecting which faction to choose, setting up shop is the most important thing you decide for the game as it determines the climate and challenges you'll be presented with. You can't immediately start with a world superpower because of their strong independence. I started my first real playthrough after the tutorial with the Initiative (which i renamed to the Chairmen and designated myself as ""The Boss""). My goal is to make money, and exploit the worlds reactions to aliens and renewed fascination for space. So for me, that means we gotta make those space hotels baby. Witness the alien invasion from the safety of space!

I started with the idea of setting up my organization with the backing of China. But due to China's EXTREME propaganda, most of the population are unaware of any goings on in the world, and are generally unaware of my presence. So we start in the smaller countries bordering China. North Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam were easy targets to spread my influence. Eventually we're finally able to get a reputation by acquiring various Chinese councillors to our cause and help us spread the good word of the Chairmen and their dream of being rich.

Of course not everyone likes this idea so I have to fight for every bit of support for my cause. But because of my more passive and self interested alignment, that means none of the other factions really see me as a threat, we're just trying to look out for ourself. But the more support we gather means the more specialist we gather. Even brilliant minds need funding for research after all.

It is now 2026 and I've unified the Koreas while also bringing Taiwan back into the fold by pulling strings in the Taiwanese government to no longer resist Chinese authority. Our interest in space travel has brought about numerous mining colonies on Luna, and we've got multiple research stations each dedicated to their own sciences in Earth orbit. Things look pretty secure for the time being with my prioritization of welfare and economy being a good hit in balancing out the Korean and unified Chinese populations. The peoples voices still remain unheard but we know whats best for them anyway... we must now bring our attention to the alien beings in orbit and how to secure our riches and independence...

This is all considered early game. And I believe I've put 14 hours into this playthrough. What story would you have created?",1666692565,1666692565,True,1,0,0.496188044548034668,0,True,False,True

Or actually dont. Your plan might not be viable. Not the ""Oh no, I need to change that now to recover"" kind of not viable, but the ""You better trash that 50 hours save"" kind of not viable. You havent done that one tech at the beginning, then clicked on that country 154 times and done a backflip? Thats gonna come back and bite you 15 years into the game. And that bite gonna be unrecoverable. The game gives a million technologies out of which only a handful are useful and worth pursuing. Which ones? You can easily read this in the guides that offer a clear step by step solution to win the game. Not a fan of that? Trial and error for alot of hours to find out then. 

This is especially bad in combat. Stats on items dont really make sense, items you researched are just worse than what you had without a way to find that out beforehand. Ships are floating bricks who try to give out papercuts unless you have three savior technologies (good luck finding out the path to them without a guide), while they are controlled by probably the single worst control system in a game ever. Honestly, the idea to control ships in a 3D space with a 2D arrow is just special. Have I mentioned that the alien ships are effectively fidget spinners with weapons that ignore all relativistic constraints? So if you expect any the expanse like combat in space, drop that expectation, the meta seems to be AI on for ships and make some food while you either win or lose, not like you could do much about it. 

 I really really enjoyed the planning, the prospecting of planets, moons and so on, getting my fleet up, managing my resources, all the good stuff. I loved the game, till combat happened. The community is great, they really tried to help me, however sometimes the only help was ""You need technology XY, others are just not viable"" and I dont have enough time to retry again and again and I am unwilling to read guides on something I want to figure out myself. If you have enough time and/or are willing to read alot of guides, this game is amazing. If not, maybe this is getting fixed in the future either by the devs themselves or mods. Till then I cannot recommend the game for you, as sad as it is for all the other extremely good parts it has.

(You can assume that I am just a bad player. Yes I played on the easiest difficulty, and maybe you can all do that way better than me, but I would say that my skills in strategy games are quite acceptable. I am doing quite well in most other games, may that be XCOM, Stellaris or Civ, but TI just wasnt fun after enough hours of struggles and trying to recover)",1666689911,1666689911,False,6,1,0.571111977100372314,2,True,False,True

For one thing, this is a great interpretation of the sci-fi setting. It reminded me a lot of the Three Body Problem book series, and I bet the devs are fans of it too. If you're unfamiliar, that series is about the time between when humanity discovers extraterrestrial life (or really, when they discover each other) and when the aliens arrive. There are factions that aim to aid the aliens, there are some that aim to defeat them militarily, some that aim to escape the solar system or live in a pocket dimension, etc, each with various agents with different schemes of control and subterfuge. Familiar stuff if you've even seen the blurb for this game. If you like hard sci-fi, politics, conspiracy theories, UFO lore, etc. this game will surely scratch your itch.

Gameplay itself is a lot get your head around, and I know that I've hardly scratched the surface of it if the game supposedly escalates to space combat but I'm still researching market research techniques. I'm sure I'm not the first person to say this but the game could use a holistic redesign of its UI. Too much important stuff is buried in sub-sub-sub menus.

The core gameplay revolves around your agents (""councillors"") doing various missions to take control of the world's nations and to thwart other factions from doing the same, all so you can control their economic and research output to advance your anti- or pro-alien agenda. Things are a little abstract in this arena, since even if you ""control"" a country, its more like you have controlling influence over its media and executive branch (imagine a conspiracy about an international cabal...). It's not like your agent is president of that country. So it does perhaps leave a lane for expanding on exactly what your agents might do to come into control of a country? In the game's context it takes literally 2 weeks for an agent of your international conspiracy movement to ""take control"" of a country. Ok then how? Did they kidnap the president's kids? Did they pay a bunch of bribes? I haven't seen anything about how agents with different skills may go about this differently, though some agents do have the ability to do a coup d'etat on a nation, which is a different thing. So, all of this is just to say that this is not quite like Civilization or something where you literally play as a nation. I suspect that gameplay for each faction (especially on the extremes of the spectrum) begins to differ significantly in the later game, but at least as far as I've played so far it's not too different.

Maybe this reflects my inexperience with the game but I also find diplomacy and trade either useless or broken (it's early access, after all). Conceptually it is also a little squishy, like why cant the resistance faction and humanity first faction get along when they have basically the same goals? It seems like there is a lot of room to expand upon how different factions might make secret alliances and betrayals with one other, on a faction-to-faction level and not merely on the level of the nations they may ""control."" Right now there is a strange gray area where I can locate and imprison an agent of another faction (or they can do the same to me) but then they are just let go with consequences later. When I have them in my custody and I try to have another of my agents assassinate that prisoner they have a less than 100% chance of success? Why??

So, the game has some quirks in logic and gameplay, but the setting is awesome. Maybe its appeal will be very narrow and specific? I can't say.",1666644541,1666644541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Also it is one of the most ambitious. Another big plus for me is that this is a near future sci-fi game that actually tries to be quire realistic about potential near future technologies (and in this metrics surpasses any space sci-fi strategy game I know of). At the current date the game is certainly fun and playable but there is a lot of room for improvements. 

Certain plus side is that it is completely stable (in my 160 hours I think I had just 3 crashes). The early game plays mostly like a grand strategy game on the world (Earth) map. This parts of the game aren't that innovative but they are well-functioning and my main complain is a clumsy UI, Latter significant part of the game start to revolve around the colonization of and warfare in Solar system. This part of the game is quite innovative since here the games is very realistic: ships obey Newtonian physics, you should take into account Δv and acceleration to make orbital transitions (essentially this is roughly as realistic as Kerbal Flight Program that is a dedicated space program simulator). Giving that this is (as far as I know) the first game that tries to do something of this sort, it is surprisingly well-done. And for the most parts it is functional with my main complain again would be again the clumsy UI. However, the tactical space battles, although very promising with 3d battles and ships moving according to Newtonian physics, right now unfortunately are barely functional. Also the AI for all space part of the game has a lot to be desire.

The storytelling style of the game is very much inspired by Sid Meirs's Alpha Centauri. That is you are playing for one of factions defined by their ideology and having one leader, the personalities of the leaders and the ideology of the factions are uncovered by citations of the faction leaders coming with each next researched technology. Here the comparison would be in favor of Alpha Centauri, that had done much better job at creating interesting and memorable faction leaders. And here, for example, despite playing for Academy in my longest game I hardly could tell what aspects of its leader views resulted in the approach to aliens that we see for her faction in the game. The only faction which presentation I actually like is Project Exodus.   

Despite all the critique above (and given the fact that this is still early access, I hope that there will be a lot of improvements) I am really impressed by the game and could totally recommend it.",1666640176,1666640176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The story is interesting, but it feels sparse given how infrequent the milestones are. More stuff going on, especially inter-faction and faction specific plots could be interesting to see and a welcome interruption to the current monotony of gameplay on earth.

There is a lot of busywork for which there is scarcely any automation and no action queuing, and a lot of things one would want to keep on top of with no way to do so intuitively. The UI would be greatly improved with the addition of more filters and search functions in every interface, and methods to compare things to each other would speed things up a lot.

The ship designer is pretty good, and the tactical combat is interesting though difficult and tedious the whole way through. Maybe a unique node and the current end of a ships' path, or a key modifier to choose any node and have it command all nodes prior would help here.

I have never played one with a more ambitious scope.

It's Earth, September 30th, 2022, rendered in spectacular geopolitical detail. The Russo-Ukraine War rages on. America's income inequality threatens to overtake public order. China tightens its authoritarian grip on its populace, while a fading European Union begins to wonder if Brexit was the beginning of the end.

But now, Aliens have been sighted at the edge of the solar system. The player is the shadowy leader of one of 8 secret human cabals, who all have different ideas how to respond to this news (Fight the Aliens, make a deal with them, submit to them, profit from the chaos, etc.) Using your covert shadow operatives, you must subvert control of various nations by taking over their oligarchs, mass media, legislatures, etc. to swing the efforts of as many earthlings as possible to your cause. Meanwhile, whatever your goal, you'll need to spread out into the reaches of the solar system, either to prevent the aliens from gaining a foothold, or combat the other earthlings who are trying to do so. The entire globe shares a single tech tree, but each technology unlocks projects that your faction can pursue or pass by, depending on your needs.  There are economic priorities to balance, space programs to build, alien flora and fauna threatens friend and foe alike, and if you're not careful, your enemies might steal your own country out from under you.

This game is a slow burn. 8 hours in, you may find you're only 3% of the way through the tech tree. But somehow it also manages to be incredibly tense.

First off, let me be clear; major kudos to the devs for doing their darndest to include as much rooted-in-science and real-world detail to the game as possible. Clearly much research was done on a multitude of scientific concepts as well as Geopolitical themes and how they all weave together into our current real-world. ""But if you love the detail so much; why not recommend the game OP?"" Because detail alone, does not a fun game make reader.

Pros:
> Very robust tech tree that is heavily rooted in real-world science and concepts
> Global nations and national interactions that make sense for the time period
> The fact that they thought to put actual orbital mechanics into the fleet actions in this game (also a con, more on that in a bit)
> Visuals look great & being able to zoom right out to the solar system map at any point to check something is smooth and great for getting an at-a-glance look at things beyond our blue/green ball.

Cons:
> Pacing...dear lord is this game slow. I feel like 90% of the time playing, I'm waiting for some lenghty process to finish, only to begin the next equally or longer paced process to begin...
> The inability to put an end to opposing factions, sure; you can mess with their research, steal their control points, research and even go as far as assassinating their agents, but thus far; aside from just starting a game with fewer factions, there is no way to put an end to a faction so they stop being an issue.
> Council Actions Phase - each week or 2 depending on what the turnaround time is; you have to set the actions for your agents, while this makes for a bit of fun in the early game; constantly having to redirect the couple of guys you have that can defend interests to every nation you grab and having to always have 3-4 agents doing public campaigns to keep support up; gets very old, very fast. (last attempted game I had the US, Canada and Russia with Israel, Jordan and Egypt and could barely keep 65-70% support with constant campaigns)
> National Support - aside from the issues above, you'll get random ticks each cycle that will tank your support for seemingly no reason (aside from enemy agent actions) and it seems as though - can't confirm at this time though - that having borders with a nation held by an enemy faction will mostly prevent you from reducing their support within your own nation beyond a certain point
> Ship Engines & Orbital Mechanics - As said above, kudos for the devs even thinking to implement these into the game, most 4x games don't (maybe that's why I'm a little biased) - there are so many engine modules that do many different things and if you're not in the know (most aren't) then you'll end up focusing on Delta-V and have ships that can barely break station keeping let alone transfer to a nearby enemy station or fleet. There are a few Youtube videos out there addressing this, but the game does a very poor job in assisting with navigating the plethora of engine modules and thrust types/requirements. 
> Aliens - Yes, the main point of the game, how can they be a con; they're the main BBEG?! The con here is more about their mechanics than them in general. The aliens are allied to the Servants and the Protectorate, so if you're not playing those factions, any action against those factions generates threat/hate towards the aliens. Also, once you start building out your space industry to begin ramping up; once you hit a set usage of command points (based on your difficulty level) the aliens become, more or less, instantly hostile; even if you've avoided their traitorous human allies the whole time, this can and usually does; result in a rapid death sprial...
> The Ban-Hammer Death Spiral - As soon as the aliens have the hate on for you, they'll start sending attack fleets towards your stations/infrastructure, this usually (for my games at least) occurs around 2028-2032 - where you're just comfortably getting into T2 stations/bases and have researched some ship techs that are capable of going up against other human ships. At this point in the tech advancement, you're going to have ships that are little more than missile boats with a couple of railguns or particle cannons if you researched that far, that have maybe 2-10 Delta-V and anywhere from .5 miligees of combat thrust, up to about 2Gs if you've followed a Youtube guide. The alien ships will usually be in single ship or dual ship stacks at this point and have anywhere from 150-1.2K fleet power depending on the type of ship; while most 10-ship human fleets with the above tech will have somewhere between 350-500 fleet power. Your stations might have a basic defense platform or two but will quickly fall to the aliens regardless as their weapons almost 1-shot anything you can put up at this point. In the above listed 10-ship fleet, I had 418 fleet power with a destroyer, 2 frigates, 4 escorts and 3 corvettes figting against a single alien destroyer with 157 fleet power. Now I expected to lose ships, maybe 2-4 or so; but in 5 attempts at this fight, the alien ship always flew up and above the fleet at about 4-5x the speed of my fleet and rained plasma shots down, usually popping 4 ships immedeatly whilst heavily damaging 2 of the remaining ones while the 4 remaining were untouched, long before I could even get into weapons range with my missile boats or railguns. I even attempted this fight a couple more times with the AI running it to see if I was just bad at positioning or some such and the results were much the same. Eventually; if you break off from the aliens entirely; they will lose enough hate to go back to being somewhat neutral but in the meantime; your fleet gets kappa'd along with many stations while the're on the warpath, resulting in you having to dismantle or otherwise shut down other stations as resources dry up, all the while having to constantly deal with the planetary game because none of it can be automated...

In the end, the tedium of having to constantly deal with the planetary aspect, aliens that are stupidly overpowered and actively punish you for attempting to catch up to them and the long grind of waiting for research and other projects to end so you can 'get on with the game' and do equally long or longer projects, just burns what is otherwise a well thought out series of game concepts. I WANT to love this game, I WANT to recommend it, but for many 4x players out there, especially the more causal ones; the systems here are a victim of their own complexity. It's a matter of too much detail, too much realism and not enough sci-fi. Too much 'playing tall' and not being able to 'play wide' and take out your Earthly enemies so you can turn your attention to the alien ones. I think with further itteration, QoL changes and further expansion of Mods and Modding tools, this can become a great game; but until it does, you're better off playing Stellaris or Sins of a Solar Empire.",1666475260,1666563331,False,6,0,0.584608674049377441,0,True,False,True

You use agents you recruit and level up to spread your influence. Slowly you spread your power, taking over the government of countries and adjusting their policies to your needs. All the while other AI factions also vie for power, including the aliens, who continue to escalate their mission in the solar system. At first they only seem to study you, but it isn't long before their agents directly intervene on Earth. Their is a story that you slowly piece together.

There's a race into space going on and you will be able to colonize planets and asteroids, build stations and fleets. You research new technologies as you try to close the gap with the aliens, who are vastly superior at first. If you are too aggressive towards them, they might retaliate, by destroying some of your space assets for example. Later on they will land armies on Earth, bombard you from orbit or otherwise try to directly influence things. 

It's really a brilliant combination of Xcom and Stellaris with an Expanse background. The ability to roleplay is excellent as well. When the aliens first invaded with ground armies in one of my games, I sent a coalition of armies of the United States, European Union, Russia and Australia to counter them, before they could expand their foothold. Unfortunately they quickly conquered India and then they used captured nukes to take many of my armies of the board. Excellent.

Summary: After several runs learning the game, I can reliably not recommend game due to countless design and technical issues the game has. 
So much that it reminds me of Fallout. Yes, it is that bad.

Main Review:
The game is slow turn/phase based(kinda) nation controlling game with alien invasion, I kind of dig it for the premise and style. But the game has issues.


I think the game will be good or excellent once it gets finished, but the game has so many technical and gameplay issues I don't think this is worth it right now.
It is only matter of time before you step into design pitfall or technical bug that will make you load back into previous save or simply ruin your run.
Now, there are games that expects you to fail but most of people call those rogue-likes, and in this game runs typically take at least several dozen hours.

Also unfortunately, many of those are in space stage where you won't be able to refund.
For example, right now it is very easy to ""brick"" your space fleet. I.e You can move fleet to orbit they are currently in or you can simply click something like earth's and close orbit selection without clicking ""x"" button. Congratulations, your fleet now cannot move nor act, nor salvaged.
There are much more ways to brick your fleet but I want to make this review readable.

You think it is just the fleet having issues? no.
The space combat is leaking your memory and depending on your PC, after x amount of space combat it will start cutting out sounds and will crash the game at the end of the combat.
In Patch 4 canceling habs while it was being built crashed the game and I am too afraid to test this now.

You might assume that issues are just in space but no, it is also down on earth too.
I.E merging unions will merely grant union's land. Not union's claims on the land, AND your unified nation lose claim on land you did not unify yet.
If you merge EU with Eurasian Union that unified Kazakhstan and ununified Uzbekistan? Whoops, 
1. EU don't have claim to Kazakhstan so this country is free now. 
2. Kazakhstan will also have their mil tech set back to stone age(3-3.3 or something) regardess of miltech level of Eurasian Union because fuck you
3. Perhaps you have not unified (or granted freedom to) Uzbekistan to prevent 1 and 2? Well congratulations. You can never claim them now because Unifying Eurasian Union that has Russia in it does not grant Russian land claims.

Jesus F. Christ. Taking over Europe lategame after it is fattened by AI is popular strategy and so is taking Kazakhstan ASAP. How can you screw up this hard?


""Yes, there are a lot of technical issues LoC. But surely they can be fixed eventually?"" I would agree but this game has design traps to scare away (probably) casuals.

You might have noticed about 50% of the techs are focused on on space, so you might assume they are actually useful. But no, they are not.
Allow me to give an example. There are a lot of early game chemical Drives like Nova and etc that costs some research in the early game. 
If you even somehow obtained enough volitiles/boost to fuel those ships, you might have noticed that they don't get far and costs a lot of volitiles/boost. You can't do anything with this drive. Only if you knew this drive was a waste of time.
So you built ships that has really good fuel and fuel efficiency with Grid Drive. Surely you can go to places and do combat. But this engine has no thrust and your ships are immobile in combat.

This is a good lession because 90% of the drive in the game is hot garbage that either has shit fuel efficiency or terrible thrust. 
Some clowns may claim that this is ""realistic"" but I can assure you that those people probably never even seen ships launch with multiple drives on say, actual space shuttles with booster rockets. Can we get ones from 50 years ago and start with 4gs while we are on grid drive?
The tech don't look realistic nor balanced to me.

Same with weapon techs too. Riverjack/viper/whatever missiles will kill everything early game and only counter to swarm of projectile weapon is point defense lasers.
Do you know the counter to point defences? Overwhelming amount of projectiles. Preferably something like coilguns that never runs out. Or ships with riverjack on high thrust.
You'd think lasers will do shit but eh, not really.
You'd think armor will do shit but aliens lategame weapons have high armor penetration so also not really.
If you are curious, you can try out space combat from title screen by importing ship designs.

All this space tech are frankly, noob traps. Waste of resources. Imagine if they had something like ""Rubberband powered rat launcher"" weapon that launches a tiny rat with speed of several m/s at an enemy. It would be very realistic to have correct stat on rat launcher but the question should be why we even have the option to pick this in the first place.
Clean up the tech sections because there are lot of garbages in it. Not limited to ships too because some modules are useless too.
Like the point defense module on satelites that can't defeat a single alien ship, making them absolutely useless. I'd like to check their performance on human ships but they never attacked me before. (only 110 hours in btw)
That being said, human faction AIs are also forementioned casuals invested in some shitty drive so they can't even leave the system without bankrupting themselves.

You'd think I would have been finished by now but know that this is a fraction of what the game is about.
80% of the game is protecting yourself from game's default mechanics fucking you over. And it is looking to do so at every opportunity. Nation's decisions, Events, tech tree, ship design, combat, you name it.
Just by not knowing that some missiles are automatically set to point defend you can fuck yourself even if you avoided every other pitfalls.

As such I will say ""perfected version"" of this game is very slow pased dark souls like turn based management where you are expected to fail and retry because system is out to get you.
But instead of not checking for mimics and dying, you did't check for drive chart/tech progression/fuel type/what have you and waste several hours of progress as a punishment.

Remarkably bug-free but in active development, expect things to change. If you go in expecting a finished game you'll likely get about 100-200 hours in and feel unsure. That's ok - it's changing every week.

You play as one of (currently) eight factions, varying from the elusive Initiative (think Illuminati) to the in-your-face Humanity First - a xenophobic group of fanatical anti-alien pro-nuclear barrage military folks ready to solve their problems with burning fire. You will navigate a turbulent period starting in (quite literally) present-day Earth: aliens have been sighted, definitively. Different factions believe different things about the aliens' motivations: the Academy wants to work with the aliens, while the Servants want to submit to them, and Humanity First wants to nuke them from orbit (it's the only way to be sure). 

You use your Councilors (secret agent-types) to control nations, investigate and combat alien phenomena, interfere with, capture, kill, or flip enemy councilors, and defend your own territory. You can acquire control of orgs that provide substantial benefits, from the (in)famous FBI to the all-powerful Steak4All (welcome to the Meataverse). 

However, earth is but a launchpad. Your journey will take you to Luna and beyond, founding space stations and bases on space bodies for research, defense, ship building, resource gathering, and - ultimately - offense. Colonize Mercury to gather endless energy; build stations orbiting Venus to gather precious resources or stay close to home on Luna for easy, if limited, basic resources. 

You design & build fleets of ships to combat fellow humanity & alien threats alike. In this, the game is more like the Expanse than Stellaris - design & build your ships, but each vessel is precious. You won't be churning out 10,000 ships a month - give your ship a name, imagine the captain barking orders over the intercom as point defense systems blast railgun charges and missiles out of the sky. 

The game is semi-real time, breaking up into a Mission phase (roughly every 2 weeks, in game) and a real-time phase. In the Mission phase, you assign missions to your councilors. In between, you control all your other assets - invest in your countries' economies or infrastructure, build new space assets, send militaries out to conquer territory, make fleet actions and send your ships on years-long excursions to the outer planets, and launch nukes (because the Servants definitely deserve it). 

Terra Invicta isn't for everyone. It's a complicated game, with lots of moving parts, and is under active development. If you're excited about watching Small Number Get Big over time, and you like hatching a plan that will take 3 years (roughly 3-5 hours in game) to complete, you'll like TI. If you want to steamroll the world and see it all painted your faction's colors, this might not be up your alley - but worry not! The modding community has got your back.

The bones are there for a really good game. Between the agent management, the nation management, the space management, the resource management, the ship design, base design and space combat systems. Really good stuff. But the difference between Good and Great is in the details. 

There isnt a second of this game where it doesnt feel like you are fighting it. Its a pain to juggle agents. Its a finicky to assign agents to taskings. Nation management hides its conditions lists and other helpful information in its nooks and crannies. Space Travel has a lot of information there but doesnt do a good job at spelling it out for you. The system map has zero filters on it. The intel section is too busy and doesnt sort well. Information on enemy factions doesnt compile. You have it. You lose it. Space combat has a lot of depth but I am too crunched for time elsewhere that I feel like I cant put the time into it. The Tech tree is a complete waste of time. 

The potential is right there on the screen. All of the above issues have easy, clear fixes which we might see as it goes through Early Access. Without going into a whole thing, here's a handful of fixes; 

-Let me pin upcoming events so I can watch the timer go down or get a notification for the upcoming turn or when it is the turn. Add a ""management"" screen that has a calender that lists all upcoming events that I can filter for Resistance only events, known events, pinned events etc. 

Straight away I can close the excel spreadsheet on the second screen and run it properly in game. 

-Let me queue up agent actions. Early game is touch and go, but as you start federating and unifying the threat of losing big nations goes down. Let me be able to setup tasks ahead of time.

-Agents are cool but enemy agents are just blank faces. AFAIK the game doesnt record history of interactions down between you, your agents and enemy agents.

The interface is very janky. For example, the game will reset your target when you select a different action, which often causes you to choose the wrong target for your action. The information is very limited, and the long timers mean you're punished for mistakes.

The tech tree is a nightmare. There are tons of techs that do almost the same thing, and you're given very little information on what the results will be. And searching through the tech tree takes a huge amount of time due to the games poor optimization. Even sorting a list of countries can take ages, and that's inexcusable. Sorting is a freshman level computer science problem.

The geopolitical game is fun at first, but gets very annoying fairly quickly. You're basically playing wack a mole while other factions try to steal your control points. I find I end up doing the same things over and over again.

You are one of eight competing Earth factions in a situation whereby a hostile alien race is invading Earth (abide very slowly). Each game mechanic is individually simple but the combination of all of them creates a measure of emergent complexity. The AI seems competent in some aspects of the game, although it does seem overly fond of military invasions in the early game (because wars are generally just a big resource hog). What's really nice is that all your enemies are resource constrained, the same as you, so the game does feel very fair.

Where it has issues are mostly around the user interface. This, is very clumsy. It generally doesn't remember settings, and sometimes old UI elements don't disappear, so you have old frames on top of the new UI you are trying to navigate. There are far too many dialog boxes where if you click on an option, the information presented is gone forever. The 'log' tool, for example, is basically useless. You can hover over events to prompt a tooltip, which is very slow and clunky. If you click on a log, it disappears forever. You cannot scroll through the log events. You cannot filter which events cause the game to be paused.

The relations and tech UIs are particularly bad. 

The tech UI is basically un-navigatiable. There are global techs (which are collaboratively researched by all human factions), and individual  techs.  Global techs, of course, have parent techs and child techs. The child techs are shown, but just as text, there are _not_ any hyperlinks to let you navigate from one tech to another. The tech map itself is a messy graph with multiple overlapping connections. There are plenty of tools out there that can optimize a graph render, so no idea why the devs aren't using them. The faction/individual techs have no summary screen. When you pick them, you just get a giant listbox with no ability to hide techs you aren't interested in, so it becomes progressively more of a PITA to find the tech you want as the game moves into the mid-game techs.

The relations screen is also super awkward. If you want to compare 'Resources', you have to individually click the resources tab on all six of your opposing factions. Six clicks when one would do, why? If I go to the 'Prospecting' tab to see what planetoid has what resources, there is _no_ way to navigate from the screen to a body I might want to drop a base onto. I have to go find it manually. I generally don't like context menus, but this game badly needs context menus.

TL;DR game is very interesting but they should fire their UI developers.

I've got almost sixty hours and I'm still winging it through the multitude of redundant technologies and complex trade-offs between techs to support me at Earth and support me in space, or between long-range exploration vessels or shorter-ranged but combat-capable craft. 

I love it.

There's a lot I could describe in the game but to be honest I'm still learning, but almost nothing is negative.
There's some parts of the game that could be clearer. Space combat doesn't really have a tutorial and I've lost a few ships before I really understood what was going on, but you can always autoresolve combat or let the AI do most of the work for you. The transfer window from Earth to other planets is really clear, but if there's a way to change that to check transfer windows from other planets, I haven't found it yet.

None of these are deal-breakers, and they're all minor things. So much of this game comes down to ""just try it out, you'll get the hang of it"" and I think you've just got to go into it with a Darkest Dungeon or X-Com mentality of ""things will go bad. That's okay."" 

The choice of factions and their varied goals, as well as a lot of variance in resource generation (one play-through you might get a lot of what you need from the moon. Other play-throughs you might be better off waiting for Mars) mean that every run feels different (not that I've finished one, I've started a few) and I can see myself playing this for a long time.",1666480727,1666480727,True,2,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,True

> All major features are in, but for strategy games especially, late-game balancing, AI work, and similar final tasks are critical to player enjoyment.

The game plays fine through the mid-game, but at the late game several new mechanics kick in which quickly move the difficulty bar toward the impossible.

* All human factions betray you based on how close you are to achieving your victory conditions.
* Once your space economy reaches a predefined tipping point, the aliens will hard aggro until your space economy is below threshold. 

Combined, this means that there comes a point where every faction in the game will team up on you, pit 30 councilors against your six and wage suicidal war against your fleets and nations. This quickly ratchets up to an absurd level.

Further, the game is seriously lacking in critical documentation, discoverability and usability. This is a game you will not get far in without reading the third-party guides, video tutorials and asking questions on the forums; the devs have not given you all the information you need to win. 

Finally, the research tree is a hot mess. The game will not tell you what your ship modules do until you've researched them twice, and to add to the difficulty there are a ton of crappy, unnecessary ship mods often with no clear progression from one to the next. You do not need to research all of the eight different radiators, six kinds of batteries and ten kinds of missiles that are unlocked with basic research; you need one of each. Further, there are dozens of different propulsion and power options for your ship - most of which are outright bad. 

All of these issues can be fixed - indeed, these are the issues -after- the devs have spent an entire year on polish and fix. Hopefully many of them will be fixed, but at the moment I can't recommend the game as it is an exercise in frustration to spend a hundred or more hours carefully building up your empire only to watch the ai trigger ""end game"" mode and burn everything down.",1666480218,1666480218,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,True

The faction politics and maneuvering on Earth are well done, the tech is realistic space travel and well done, only you will be researching blind most of the time, as there is very little information to tell you what you will gain with a particular tech at the moment.

Combat has potential to have huge depth, buts its controls are an abomination of the highest order. If you want to turn your ships and keep them in a formation, you will spend 10 minutes doing it. For every turn. Combat is 3D, but there is no easy or intuitive way to get the ships going where you want to except on the horizontal plane. There are plenty of deployment options, but no visual aides as to how that will end up, you can reload a combat autosave to try again, but game takes upwards of 2 minutes to load :( There is no way to assign ships into formation once the fighting starts, no way to select multiple ships, so your by far least painful effective strategy is for now limited to build your ships so they just get carried by initial momentum and take out any incoming projectiles and ships.

Regardless of the combat controls, the game is EA, so it does get thumbs up.

I love the game setting and the combat and the idea of the planetary fight for the hearts and minds of earths people but it has been poorly implemented in that last respect. As many have said on here it is just wack a mole. I disagreed with those comments when I first started playing the game but now reaching endgame I have to agree. The lazy loop that the devs use to traverse time on planet earth involving your operatives is repetitive ineffectual and a endless timesink while you work your way through an impressive but ultimately not that deep tech tree.

Most techs relate to % percentage gains on resource collection, most weapons and tech is laughably useless and the game stops progress whenever the player is doing too well by a big smack down that will mean you invariably dont fight for probably 90% of the game because there is limited / no advantage to it.

I like the game, but don't like aspects of it more!

Please redo in TI2, better techs that are more meaningful, better military combat on earth and include airforce and navies since we are stuck on that globe for so much of the game. Better spy system that is not whack a mole and where if you take a country it is meaningful and should be hard won and not easily lost. But that requires a more intricate army/ battle loop and not a % percent chance a spy will take it in a couple turns.

-Divided Earth in a hard scifi setting
-Hard scifi mechanics
-A narrative driven by scientific progress
-Ideological factions that feel real and plausible, even those we hate. (Looking at you, Initiative and Servants)

Above all else, I want to praise this game for its vision. The devs clearly had a tight and narrow setting and story that they wanted to share, and they did so with no strings attached. 30 dollars for unique mechanics and SF elements quite a few of us in the hard SF community wanted to see, and they delivered.

Sure, there are some bugs, and the game does crash occasionally. The game isn't for everyone either; the achievement to beat it on Normal is literally called ""The Long War"", and it felt like it; more than 40 years in-game, 200 hours out of game with several restarts plus all the time I spent reading guides. It's a niche title, I can't recommend it to everyone. There are lighter, more generally appealing games, like Stellaris.

I write this as a positive recommendation mainly for the devs, and other indie and double-A devs: please keep making games like this that are dead set on sharing your own vision.

The game is supposed to be a fight between earth and a mysterious alien race. 7 groups fight among themselves to consolidate power on earth and use that power to prepare humanity to face (or in some cases submit) to the alien menace. You start the game dealing with earth issues (early game), but eventually you need to expand humanity into space (mid game), and finally take the fight to the aliens (late game). 

On paper, this looks wonderful. In practice, it doesn't quite work. In short, the UI is abysmal, there is very little feedback about the game state, the AI is poor, and the mid and late game is extremely grindy. A lot of these problems don't really show up until you are 30 or 40 hours into the game (mid game), but some of those are apparent from the beginning.

This is definitely a game where I would love a ""Meh"" option.

First and foremost, is the absolutely terrible tutorial. Unfortunately, because the game is so unique in the way it tackles this modern-day sci-fi real-time/turn-based strategy genre, it really needs a strong tutorial. all the tutorial does is explain your immediate UI, but nothing else. This means allot of research on how to do some really basic things like how to build a habitat, how does the research screen work, how do you start getting basic resources for building ships...

I was disappointed by the terrible controls for ship battles. The AI seems to be able to do all sorts of crazy moves with their ships, while mine feel like they are stuck in one direction. The ships can turn themselves, but the inertia keeps them moving in the same direction, making them really easy targets and incapable of dodging incoming fire. Again, if I am messing up here, I cant possibly know because the tutorial is useless.

The game really feels like is mainly about the campaign. So far it doesnt feel like the AI is cheating in any way (im playing in veteran difficulty), but they constantly do stuff that i didnt know could be done, until i research it later and often find myself more confused that before.

Also, there are so many different resources and currencies in the game that are given no explanation as to what they do. the devs haven't even given the option to hover over them and get info that way. So when you need to make decisions and are told that it will cost this and that, you have nooo idea what the cost even means.

In all, the game seems like it can be really fun, but it needs to do a ton to make the game more player friendly and more easy to learn.

Played for 80 hours-

So there are still so many things that I feel that I do not know. Regardless, I really started to get into the game and enjoyed the progression from one stage to the next. But I had begun to run into a different set of issues. This is a single player game, which means that no matter what you never really get the feel that all the factions have the potential to strategize as you would. the problem is that as the game goes on you start to feel like the other factions have been given a skript to follow and just declare random wars on eachother and take eachothers territory, while no one but you seems to care about the alien threat.

This takes many forms. Firstly, you are literally the only one on the planet who does the alien asset missions. Its really weird that the world is slowly being invaded by aliens and you are the only one sending people across the globe to stop it. The list of occurences grows more quickly that you can tackle it, and the rival factions could not care less what their main territories get completely annihalated by aliens.
Secondly, They build 1-2 ships, and do nothing with them. they have new technology for their space navy (which I know they have because the game says they stole it from me) and yet they do nothing. I even go out of my way to antagonize the factions by destroying their stations, ships, habs, and there is 0 response. I really feel like im the only one in this game with even half a brain cell.
Thirdly, you would think that when you spend a load of time and money training an operative, only to have them killed about 40 times, that you would maybe stop trying to antagonize the person who kills them. Yet the AI just bogs you down once you have even a somewhat comfortable set of territories, and will not leave you in peace. Even when there are tons of other territories out there to take. Because of this The 2-week councillor mission thing gets really boring when all you are doing is swapping between restoring public approval, stabalizing you lands, and defending interests. Eventually it just gets annoying because there is no way to just eliminate the other factions and just take on the aliens on your own. It would be great if you could ally yourself to other factions (i.e. humanity first with the resistance), but no such thing.


So long-story-short, The game has some really fun mechanics and has a great foundation, but the enemy AI is there just for show and will not do anything towards a direct threat to their existence because it is too busy just annoying you. Because of this, the game quickly begins to feel shallow. 

Learning the game is hard enough, but even once you do learn it enough to play, it gets old pretty quickly.

I wasn't able to figure out how to capture enemy hubs. Here are my ships with marines for assault, here is the enemy hub - no option for assault available. It says that I need to dock the station. But I can't dock the station, the option is disabled. Enemy fleet seems to be docked at that hub, so I ask my fleet to transfer and engage - and it says 16 weeks. 16 weeks to engage the fleet docked at the hub at which my ships are already located at (it took 20 weeks to get there from my hub). What the... it was just enough for me at this point, I gave up on this game. One could say I overreacted, and should have gone to the web to learn how to play, but with this game this happens all the time!
The game does a really poor job on explaining how different mechanics work! There is no info on so many things! Example - unrest in your country is rising. Now there are plenty potential reasons for this - is it lack of cohesion? or is it enemy agents actions? Did I put enough priority points into military category? How does my armies affect it? Is it because of my government rank? Now if you go online, for that particular number, there is a wiki article about it - and go look, there is like 6 formulas there just related to that number alone! Now imagine having this problem with almost all in-game numbers? And this game has a lot of numbers! The most frustrating thing is though, is that not all of the info is available in wiki, some of it on the dev blog in videos, and some - you might hear from youtubers playing the game. Here is a fresh idea - how about the game tells me how to play it itself?! Because if I need to gather several sources online to just figure out how to play this, you should at least bring something worth playing for to the table
And what we actually have as a gameplay, why should I bother learning all this stuff? Hearts of Iron 4 spy simulator. Damn, you can't even conquer a country here. You assume control of a country. If your spy gets assassinated or dies of old age, your adm capacity falls down, and you might lose your country that you have been nurturing for the past 40 hours. How is this fulfilling? I never feel like damn, i am the mighty new european union colonising mars, I feel like im a bunch of 60 year old dudes, who tricked european union for a time to let them build an outpost on mars. And even the agents - they can get killed, they can die, they can be turned by the enemy. The only thing you accumulate with time is technologies, but you know what? The real, important techs, are actually global, meaning that you cant just fly into space leaving every other faction behind - every other faction will learn those techs too. Global tech is not yours too!
Now the spy game - it starts interesting, but little do you know, that for the rest 40 hours of gameplay you will be doing the same darn things again and again - boost public opinion, defend interests, go underground. Sometimes crackdown and purge. Do some orgs game. And those orgs... ffs... each of your agents can have like 15 max orgs assigned to them. They are like stat boosters. The strat is to buy/steal orgs that give admin points, and then fill the rest with some point boosters. Cool mini game, but that means going through a shit ton of orgs, assigning around 60-70 orgs manually for all agents. Sometimes new orgs comes into market, and you are supposed to go and check - maybe from those 60-70 orgs, you can replace one of them for a better stats?
This game has great ideas and great promises, but at this point this is so frustrating, that I would rather go play something else. God I wish I've known all this before I wasted 60 hours in this game",1666231107,1666231107,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The Earth and solar system are massive, and very well done, and some of the other tabs, like the expanded tech tree and countries list, are a heavy lift for the processor. But I turned the textures down and have only had one crash. This seems to have made the hefty switch between Earth and solar system view less cumbersome. 

In terms of play, the game unfolds from a land grab in the beginning to a much more expanded interface with space stations and fleets. The main component of the early game is using your counselors to take over nations and acquiring control over various organizations that give your counselor or faction bonuses. You're going to want to plan out your early game before you start and figure out what countries you want to end up with. As you might expect, you won't be able to take control of large countries like the U.S. or China in the beginning. You will need to take smaller countries to start, level up your counselors, and build public opinion in the larger nations. You will also need to defend your nations from the other factions. I think there are some balance issues with the purge component at the moment. I've had other factions succeed with a purge over my purge, despite me having >75% public support and them having no public support in the country. Each counselor has a variety of skills, and you're going to want to grab additional counselors with a wide range of skills. Orgs can also augment your counselor's skill set. I would suggest watching a video on Youtube about the counselors to better understand how to develop them. I would also suggest stacking their management points, as this directly ties to how many control points you can hold. You're going to want multiple countries to build boost and mission control, and you're going to want control of a powerful country like the U.S. or China, as well. 

The tech tree is one of the best I've seen. It's massive, but you don't need to ever look at it. Each technology has prerequisites, and only those preceding techs show up in the list of researchable techs. There also appear to be many techs that improve the same resource, like boost, so you don't necessarily need to focus on researching all of them. 

There's so much to this game. Each country has a variety of values from GDP, to population, to education level, to cohesion, and you need to manage all of them to get that country running full steam. Or you could just extract wealth from the country through spoils, though this increases climate change, which is tracked by the game. You can be the savior, taking care of folks, or you can abuse the people of Earth to beat back the alien menace. It's really up to you.  

The aliens themselves and their story are super interesting and compelling, and their strength and menace increases as the game progresses. It flows along as you attempt to learn more about them and research tech while expanding your presence in space. The game starts with next to no presence in space and gradually develops into very deep and technical ship building and space combat. There's definitely a learning curve. 

The entire form and function of the game is just very well done. In fact, I would love to see a future game mode that axes the aliens and has you use the core game functions to build a coalition on Earth and then expand into the solar system and into the nearby star systems. Overall, there is so much good here.

But you start the game as an underground organisation that have to grap the power 
and so to speak use the country or countrys you take to finance your fight for various objectives depending 
who you play as.
Example the rebels see the aliens as the enemy and want to protect earth, while other organistations
want to welcome and help them.
So as you can imagine this will lead to conflict, sabotage, and even war all mixed together on Earth but also in space and other planets.
You have x people you control who can move freely on the map to do various operations, example go to france and do propeganda and later on do a takeover and now you get access to the army, and the nations resources and so on.
Now you will want to do some research. You can desided to take part in 3 public world research projects and you also have your own private personal research projects or maybe i should say Agenda to get science and things that fit into your personal strategy.
After  you get your hands on some nations and resources you can build you first space station in earth orbit and get x boost to your research and other things. After that you want to expand to example the moon and build bases there and mine materials so you can begin to construct things in space vs always having to send things from earth.
These bases can be both mining bases, or secret bases with a military purpose so its really up to you.
To go forward-back inbetween planets you can design ships and use the tech you researched. Belive it or not even the orbital orientation of planets/asteroids and launch windows are implemented in the game.. so if you want to go to example mars there is a good and bad time to launch. So while you wait for the perfect launch window then save the required resources to build that cool fusion power reactor on mars, mining base or what about a colony.
Honestly this game take a really long time to play, so you wont develop all tech or even put it in your ships but maybe ship a generation of weapons or other stuff.
There are many details in this game, example your crew/operatives can also buy coorporations and the income from this will help your factions in various ways.
( click your peoples photos and you can buy it on that screen its a great way to get x resources or income )
So its not just about having a budget for your nation, its also about buying example coorporations such as google to help finance your fight against the enemy OR the other organisations since you dont really want them to ehhh have a successfull spaceprogram do you ?.. so why dont you sabotage it so you get an advantage getting that sweet nice spot on the other planet.. If that is not good enough for your, well you can always send your people to space and sabotage stuff there.
You can also use military to counqure countries, and even nuclear weapons.
I did not yet try, but its also plausible to build more or less secret bases in space. Regarding your ships you can design different classes of them and different weapons as well. But you also have to think about resupply after battles and such things.
In general this is a complex game taking place both on earth but also in space.

What i dont like so much is the usage of your people on eath to contqure territory and effecting countrys to help you in your couse. It feel repetative and honestly a bit boring to do the same over and over again.
But lucky you can so speak park you people and make them repeat the same action or simply just skip their turn.
It would be nice if there was less micromanaging of this.

Be aware this game is slow pased and it take a long time to play, and just to go to the moon and build a base will take you several houres of playing.
You will properbly also want to start over a few times until you learn the game.
Example max out your personal science, i had no idea i could since i invested in global science with 25% each place but it turned out that is just 25% sicence for that specific science projekt and not a total of them all.

Also, some bugs are still present:
AI of other factions consistently breaks other countries to the point of EU having less than 5k GDP per capita
AI of aliens sometimes just breaks and causes them to stop expansion, stop agression towards you (only after I killed a random fleet aliens have ""woken up"" and started expanding again, but it was too late)

Balance:
High tech drives for ships require so much power that radiator has mass of 30 ships, which makes these drives not so usedul as expected, causing player to fit smaller drives and moving around system slowly - here is the slog problem. When you have to wait for couple mins every turn for button to be clickable it adds up when your transfer is half a year.

It’s been a ride I can tell you that. And although it’s a bit rough in parts, the UI can do with improvements, and it’s got many aspects of early access jank in various places – I can confidently say its one of the best games I’ve ever played. 

It confidently tells a tale of a divided humanity in an unpromising start position of real world analogue 2022 (with all the wars, inequality and fiscal ineptitude simulated with painful accuracy around the globe) – immediately splitting between arrival-era factions and doing their level best to make things worse with the infighting while an actual alien threat/opportunity arrives on Earth and begins to progress its own objectives. 

What I didn’t expect going in was the incredible depth of storytelling presented in the voiced technology quotes, the faction-specific missions, and the slow reveal of what the heck the aliens were about. Its up there with Alpha Centauri in terms of hard science fiction emergent narrative in my eyes, and beautifully blends a near future techno-thriller with the dawning existential dread of Cixin Liu's the three-body problem and finally the Kim Stanley Robinson style hope and optimism of a timeline where humanity moves past its immediate problems and addresses some of the big profound issues of our time. 

I think mine was a long game – I appreciated the fact the aliens weren’t cheating or creating magic fleets from nowhere. I really enjoyed the ways I could hinder and ultimately economically ruin the other factions and take control of a growing coalition of largely united nations against an external threat that wanted to control our destiny. I murdered and assassinated *a lot* of billionaire oligarchs, quisling sympathisers, kleptocratic dictators and hyper-wealthy disaster capitalists as well tbh - but none of that counts as attrocity in the game's estimation.

By the final missions it was 2058 and most of my initial genX and zoomer counsellors were in their 60s and 70s (though life extension technology had reduced the pain of that considerably) – but in truth I’d won the war some years before when human and reverse-engineered alien technology had allowed me to effectively fight back and begin winning space dominance in the inner system and belt. 

But it wasn’t a quick business. Even late game ships can take half a year to transit the system to strike alien targets. 60,000 ton spaceships take considerable resources and build time and the slow increase in military capability (especially aimed at survival hulls and reducing attrition) makes it a marathon not a sprint. 

I got a powerful roleplay sense that the world knew it was going to win the war from about 2048 onwards but the logistical planning, the expansion of mining, the adoption of late game power sources and design and prototyping of fleets was going to take most of the decade it did. 

But as the fleets in orbit and the solar system were reporting improved results and multiple victories, I became increasing focused on what was happening on Earth. 

I became obsessed by the climate change figures and level of atmospheric co2 – by the rates of inequality in the growing alliance of nations I controlled, by the democracy index, and by the thoughts of what would happen when the aliens were defeated. 

My Earth had survived pretty well, we’d dealt with 3 full-scale alien invasions handily with a south American campaign, a middle eastern campaign, and a Chinese invasion – in all cases the invaders were destroyed without the use of nuclear weapons or the large-scale establishment of alien government. 

The only major earthbound atrocities we’d suffered were when humanity first and the initiative got squabbling over India and nuked Delhi in 2031, and when the alien fleet (frustrated at being rebuffed in south America) decided to begin orbital bombardment of the southern United States in 2033) 

But the Delhi tragedy focused the resistance on goals of both addressing the invaders and gaining control of every nuclear weapon on the planet (either by seizing control of the governments in charge of these weapons permanently, or by short term coups that allowed resistance agents to take over and decommission the weapons.)

By the time the war-in-space was nearing its conclusion we hit that planetary goal and controlled every nuke on earth and removed all but those in the continental united states and European Union (which had incorporated the Russian Federation, United Kingdom, Turkey and all of the former Soviet republics some years before.) 

And by 2054 we hit another goal which was after keeping the global climate change projection to 1.7 degrees of warming – for a decade, the nations of the world finally achieved real terms cut in global carbon emission of a fractional (but real) denomination against the previous year. 

This really hit home. Because it took the US, Greater Europe, the Pan Asian Federation, India and Australia completely realigning their economic priorities and spending towards carbon capture and economic equality policies (less econ, more welfare, no spoils) combined with a host of zero carbon power generation technologies, civilian fusion, the end of oil and widescale deployment of engineered lifeforms and nanotech triage to achieve a 0.01% reduction in global carbon emission. This was about 2/3rds of the planet’s population mindfully driving their governments to take climate change seriously and accept a greater than 2.5% dip in yearly GDP in the interests of slowing and then infinitely slightly reversing the decline.

But on the other hand – this is a world population that has increased to 11 billion people (from 8b in 2022) – wealth inequality has dropped massively. Clean energy is available to most of the planet. Over 131,000 people live and work in space.  

***

While the final strike fleets were on their missions in the kuiper belt the people of earth were celebrating if not the end of the fight against climate change and late-capitalist economic insanity – then at least a turning point, where the planet was beginning to heal and the nature of global existence could afford to think again about a non-apocalyptic future. 1.7 degrees of warming is bad – but its survivable for most of the planet. 

I can’t easily express just how profoundly moving and incredibly satisfying this latter achievement was in the context of the game. I definitely loved the ethos of the resistance – the voice actress for their leader was excellent and had major naomi nagata vibes – and the goal of utilising technology and unification to defend the human race’s right of self-determination without trying to become technocratic autocrats, hyper-militarised fascists, or various shades of surrender/quisling/escape artists was perfectly tuned to my preferences. 

This is a game that will stay with me for a long time – and it’s a triumph that it’s been created by a bunch of former modders off a kickstarter that sounded ridiculously over-ambitious from the off and nevertheless delivered one of the best strategic scifi gaming experiences I’ve had since Alpha Centauri. 

Its absolutely complex, extremely demanding on the player, a ridiculously addictive time-sink, but in the conclusion is something I’m hugely pleased to have engaged with, understood, learned and mastered on the journey to a magnificently satisfying endgame and outcome. 

Yep, I defeated the Aliens.

But in many ways the ability to change the course of the future and defeat the death spiral of late-stage capitalism is an even greater victory.

Always dealing with enemy agents trying to steal your territories. Manage your finance and other points building space mining and stations and producing some underpowered ships you can send against their dead(aliens) or evil fractions assets. And all that by doing a vaste vaste research tree.

The Servants are basically degenerates that want eggs planted in them and all the art of it happening they can commission on Twitter.

The Initiative are the same assholes that have been ruining life for everyone since time immemorial - your war profiteers, career politicians, hedge fund managers and DMV agents that see the emergence of aliens as an opportunity to clamp their lich-like grasp even tighter around the throat of mankind.

The Academy are eggheads that want to stand side-by-side with the aliens in some sort of Rodenberryesque future. Think Star Trek, only not the dumb one ran by that hack who can’t stop failing upwards, Alex Kurtzman. 

The Resistance wants to kick the aliens off their lawn and make sure they don’t burn their home down while doing it.

If the Servants want eggs implanted in them, The Protectorate is their husband that’s watching it all happen from the closet wearing his Quailman cosplay with a belt around his neck, a framed portrait of 40th U.S. President Ronald Reagan in one hand and his penis in the other.

Project Exodus has had enough. They think we should just pack our shit and find another planet because, heck - we already kinda screwed this one up, right? Mulligan!

You utilize agents to project your wishes on the world. Drum up public support, crack down on opponents' strongholds, subvert governments, draft ill-advised policy, assassinate rivals, sweep out alien infestations, invite them to your house for netflix and chill, buy OnlyFans and use it for propaganda… the options are not quite endless, but certainly abundant. Each agent has a RPG stat and trait system reminiscent of Crusader Kings to represent how skilled they are at different things. Enlist Commandos, Celebrities, Diplomats, Reporters. Imagine if Amouranth was spreading alien microflora through her fart jars or Mitch McConnell had a real reason to lock up the legislative branch of US Government besides spite.

Fight Kaiju. Mine the moon. Build spaceships to assert dominance over the alien scum trying to hole up on your exoplanets. What’s that? China is getting uppity and all the users on WeChat are basically saying, “Haha wouldn’t it be weird if we just banged the aliens and let them fill up our bodies with their eggs? XD” Sounds like a Servant problem. Don’t want to get blown up in a low-grade nuclear exchange getting rid of them? No problem! Take control of North Korea and have them send a salvo at Beijing, severely crippling the global economy and getting them glassed in comeuppance while you laugh and clink glasses in the penthouse of a Lyon skyscraper (they put them out there so it doesn’t fuck up the Paris skyline). Uh-oh, looks like Kim Jong Un has been getting into the black market Western bourbon again! At least the fine, irradiated ash of the exchange will cool down global temperatures because guess what? All of that shit is tracked. Methane. Carbon. You’re battling the aliens. You’re battling all the people you already didn’t like on earth. You’re battling global warming. Enemy faction has more satellites in low orbit than you? No problem - blow them shits up and create a Kessler Syndrome effect that will cripple satellite uplinks for generations! Need cash? Just do what the United States does and cause a coup in South America so you can drain the economy and make it safe for American interests like Dole and Chaquita. Who needs forest when my kids need 26g of sugar per serving of pineapple juice? Diabetes fuels the bio-med sector! Live out your wildest fantasies and take direct control of the United States to stand down their military, dismantle their nuclear arsenal, remove them from all their alliances and set the spoils to max. Why would you do this? Because you're a goddamn insidious organization that operates outside man's myopic, infantile sense of morality and have no God or master but whatever Puckish urges get the Super Unleaded flowing into your blood bomber. Now kiss me hard you sonovabitch, because we're going to mould the world in our image and by God it's not going to be pretty. Don't worry; by the end of it all your brain will have woven an elaborate, delusional narrative elevating you to the status of a Christ figure because that's the only way it can compartmentalize the sheer amount of human suffering you've inflicted on your way to the top. By then you'll have just the most infinitesimal inkling of what it's like to be Jeff Bezos. 

This game is great, and by great I mean awful. Never have I seen big picture corporate exploitation so clearly illustrated. Every time I started to get sucked in I’d start retching uncontrollably when the borders between reality and fiction became thread-bare. My wife freaked out the first time and started yelling at me to clean it up. I calmly explained I couldn’t use the mop because we were going to have to start saving our potable water in the bathtubs for when the water wars of Ceres broke out and the pigs started forming ‘Community Action Programs’ to steal our cloud tears. They’ll never take me alive. I’ve been using a carbonization process to break down bananas for their potassium in my shed and have enough to make Waco look like a block barbecue. 

Loyalty is an illusion. Nations are mere pawns to be positioned against one another. People aren’t even individuals anymore but merely a number to be tracked. There are fears that need to be stoked and ideologies that need to be nurtured. The game tracks and models everything. It’s ripe for evocative, emergent storytelling. Some of it is clunky and a bit hard to intuit. I’d suggest checking out youtube because the tutorial is a joke and the systems are complex. You're going to be staring at a globe on 4x speed a lot, but you may also be doing things the hard way. New player experience is a waking nightmare. But I think with a little bit more time, it may be one of the greatest games ever played. 

It’s nice to be able to sit down and play a game that lets you forget for but a moment what a ridiculous clown world we live in only by the merit that it contextualizes all the madness that occurs on a day to day basis as the works of impenetrable, ubiquitous shadow governments fighting or working with aliums. Sometimes I marvel at the imagination of the developers. I mean, c’mon. Really? The entirety of the world being steered by the whims of the few and powerful? Wouldn’t that be wild? Haha, oh man! The weed must hit differently in Colorado, Pavonis.

Wouldn't that. Just be. Fucking wild. 

Buy the game if you're into nerd shit and don't need the Dopamine hit of something shiny appearing on the screen every 5 seconds to be entertained. The real graphics engine is in your brain.

Do not make the existentially damning choice of introducing new children into this hell simulator called life.

The physics are shockingly realistic (at times punishing), and the massive technology tree provides for so many distinct options and strategies that it feels practically infinite. The solar system that serves as the true game map is meticulously recreated to an incredibly level of detail. Ship design and space combat, again, could legitimately have been an entire $60 title on their own - space battles are precise, and the possibilities for designing both individual ships and entire fleets working in synergy are honestly staggering. But the most important and most innovative aspect of Terra Invicta is in your opponents. The Aliens (as well as other human factions) play by the same game rules as you do. The Aliens in particular might have different strengths and weaknesses, but the difficulty doesn't come via the AI receiving free resources, cheating the physics, or scripted advantages. The level of difficulty comes from the AI behavior (i.e higher difficulty AIs don't just ""cheat,""  they simply behave more aggressively toward the player). The AI is actually strikingly competent even on Normal, but they do wait a bit before committing at a high level to aggression towards the player.

Game is incredibly slow-paced, encumbered at every turn by overwrought mechanics, requires INTENSE micro-management, and has very little design focus. Normal gamers will bounce right off this.


[h1]Overview[/h1]
[b]Terra Invicta (T.I.) doesn't know what it wants to be.[/b]


The game's page might lead a reader to think that T.I. is a combination of X-COM's simulation of a hostile Aien First Contact with the squad-based tactical focus replaced with 3D Ship Combat and mixed heavily with a ton of Crusader Kings style game mechanics. [b]That reader would be WRONG[/b] (and right at the same time). 


Let me get the nice words out of the way: I had zero crashes, the graphics are fine (ship combat visual could be much better but meh), there is a ton of great voice acting, the lore text is EXTENSIVE.


Moving on to the raft of issues... [b](I cannot even hit 10% in 8,000 characters so bear that in mind here)[/b]


[h1]Pacing[/h1]
Most games with throw a sampling (at least) of the action-oriented or combat portions of the game right up front to ensure you get hooked. T.I. doesn't even make a nod at it. Instead you will spend dozens of hours (at least) fiddling about with the Earth global map trying to take over nations so they can generate resources for your Faction. This is OK but gets incredibly tedious, dull, and repetitive very very quickly unless you are highly neuro atypical. 


Try and rush this phase to build space stations or ship very early and you will quickly find yourself completely hog-tied by a lack of resources you won't be able to make up while the other 7 Factions leap-frog ahead since the AI knows about the timing of most actions. This doesn't mean you HAVE to restart and try again but most normal gamers would definitely do so. 


[h1]Overwrought Game Mechanics[/h1]
*Note: I am on the spectrum myself. You can't let people like me have the final say on most things marketed to normies. 


[b]Bob the Sperg-dev:[/b] ""Terry! Come see the new Sim shirt ironing game mechanic I designed on my own time last weekend! It has more sub-features than I have waifu-pillows!"" 


[b]Terry the Neurotypical Game Design Manager :[/b] ""Hey Bob! Before we do that just wanna say I really love the work you put into individual 401k retirement fund simulation of each individual Sim in Sim City with custom tailoring to individual market conditions per SimNation. What a Beautiful Mind you have! Got to tell you though, 95% of the Play Testers actually gouged out their own eyeballs from frustration.


[b]Bob[/b] (huffily): ""They should just [b][i]'git gud![/i][/b]""


[b]Terry [/b](smiling indulgently) : ""Yeah, maybe... but we are going to pull out 90% of the sub-mechanics and have Dan the Normie streamline the other 10% before we put it in-game. Great work though!"" 


Sadly T.I. has let a bunch of Bobs overrun the joint at nearly every turn with incredibly over-complex, half-explained, and incredibly obtuse mechanics that really obstruct most people from enjoying the game. They need a Terry and several Dans to come fix this.


[b][u]An example: [/u][/b]
In games of this genre it is common to need Earth Nations (or often abstracted groups of nations instead) under your control to generate resources and to shape they way your individual strategy can proceed. X-Com used this as do many other games. Each controlled Major Region also frequently might come with some special flavor of in-game benefit for the controlling faction etc. 


[b]This was apparently way too straightforward for T.I.'s map Bob-dev.[/b] Instead Bob has modelled [u]every Nation on Earth individually[/u] and then decided to take it further and [i][u]model each nations individual sub-regions![/u][/i] Gathering steam, Bob then decided that instead of one unified budget model for your controlled Faction you should have individual Budgets across [b][i][u]11 (YES ELEVEN) different Budget Priority areas not Per Nation (too normie!) but rather by EVERy INDIVIDUALLY MODELLED SUB-REGION!. [/u][/i][/b]


Bob then decided that simply having these 11 different Budget Priority line items work the same way for each Nation would be WAY too normie and decided that multiple individual equation elements should faction into every bloody line and that [b]every bloody line item should ALSO have 2nd and even[i][u] 3rd order effects [/u][/i]on other line items![/b]


[b][i][u]Sub-example: [/u][/i][/b]
A player might well assume that dumping say 75% of a nation's GDP into the ""Economy"" priority would in-fact grow the Economy... but [b]Bob strikes again! [/b][u]The Economy line item works differently not just for each Nation but for [/u][i][u]every sub-region too![/u][/i]


See this fantastic thread from [b]Lantantan[/b] for an explanation of how wildly over-the-top-Bob this single sub-mechanic of a sub-mechanic is:

<apparently I can't link to Steam forums on Steam... ok.>


[b]Folks, that is how overwrought 1/11th of a single game sub-mechanic is in T.I. [/b]


Instead of a player focusing on intense space battles against the Alien Menace in their customized space ships they are fiddling with North Elbonia's Economy priority because the template they used for South Elbonia won't work here since South Elbonia has 2 Economic Core Regions while North Elbonia only has a single Religious sub-region and... [b]you get the picture I hope. [/b]


[b]The game isn't supposed to be about micromanaging Earth geo-politics and economics. It is about dealing with an Alien Invasion FFS. [/b]


Sadly the above example is just one of many dozens of similar issues right now. 


[h1]Bloat and ""Trap"" Game Issues[/h1]
The tech trees in T.I. look AMAZINGLY DEEP at first glance and they are but... there are just GIANT CHUNKS of tech you will NEVER BLOODY USE FOR ANYTHING. EVER. The game is loaded with resource and time traps like these. Not going to spend time on it but these result in most normal gamers either restarting entirely or simply walking away in frustration after wasting too much time and getting trapped (see [b]Pacing[/b]). 


The tech tree and areas like it need big chunks simply deleted, major areas streamlined, and the rest reviewed for timing and fun. Bob went bonkers in these areas.


[h1]Lack of Flavor[/h1]
Whether you unite the Earth under the Islamic Caliphate, the Glorious Eurasian Union, a United North American Empire, or Bob's Micronesian Fantasy Kingdom, each empire will have zero flavor and play EXACTLY the same aside from minor differences in resources yielded depending on what regions you do/don't own yet. No visual differences, no cultural differences, no religion playing any role.. just as bland as a dry rice cake. Ships will be the same, tech trees will be the same, even the color of the territory is your Faction color and not anything to do with the Empire you have set up. Given the level of sperging over everything else this is bafflingly weird. 


[h1]Summary[/h1]
Unless you are SUPER into intense micromanagement of game elements most people would give 2 small feces about this game isn't for you right now.  I will walk away and check back after a few months of patching. 


Hopefully the devs will find a Terry to lend a normative hand here so T.I. will play like a game instead of a Bloomberg Terminal.",1666025793,1666026343,False,38,2,0.599029898643493652,9,True,False,True

And yet, despite this game making me want to dash my keyboard in frustration at every turn, I still keep thinking about it, and finding myself excited to boot it back up to play more. 

....So yeah, if a game can be that frustrating and still not keep me away, I guess we can consider it a good game.

Jokes aside, this game has really well written lore and characters that drive one of the deepest geo-political simulators I have ever played, that ALSO has the Xcom and Expanse universes thrown in for good measure, and it does all of THAT really well.

In terms of game design its honestly pretty brilliant, your playstyle is forced onto you by the ai. The other factions and the aliens themselves will react to how aggressive you are being, as well as having their own goals that they are actively pursuing. For example, giving Project Exodus a new drive tech could allow you to get some favorable trade deals with them, or stop them from attacking your assets on Earth or in space. The aliens are not just some events thrown together in series either, they have limited resources to actually throw at you and the AI has to react accordingly.  One game the aliens might of had a good start and earth is getting invaded 2-3 years earlier then normal, in another they might of struggled to get off the ground so you have more time to build up your economy without worrying about their intervention.

Main problems I have:
1) Annexing countries hurts your own tech if done peacefully... it averages tech scores, instead of keeping the highest.
2) AI is abit braindead, Aliens invading, you are playing Resistance? Well humanity first (hates aliens) will think this is a great time to attack you, instead of work together against the aliens.
3) AI logic seems abit hardcoded, I noticed servants repeatedly went for the USA, India, while Humanity first took small useless nations in 3/3 starts I did. AI needs a revamp.
4) UI is bad, its hard to find stuff, hard to navigate properly, and has very poor information on what different things do for you.
5) The Technology research Tree has an overall path, but it needs to clarify if certain techs are at all needed to progress to future ones, or If are they dead ends after research.
6) Some hard coded diplomacy seems odd, why would russia under humanity first, hate the EU under the resistance after a decade in that setup, they refuse to end the rivalry.
7) Quality of life things, like i couldn't figure out how to launch multiple nukes without repeating a very slow process over and over, why can't i just shift click for multiple launches?
8) Tutorial is nearly useless in its current state, its like telling someone trying to learn how to fly a plane ""here's the keys, have fun""... its not wrong, just not enough to get you anywhere quickly.
9) So many events happen with huge frusterations, just to find out its covert ops, or alien stuff that's not explained at all at the time (randomly losing control of nations super entrenched by yourself, unrest problems even with a full team and good setup going, etc).

And lots of other stuff that needs attention, but... once this goes full release, if they fix the above I do think it will be a great game, its just not anywhere near there yet - and it feels like a waste of time in its current state.",1665964346,1665964428,False,5,0,0.546694099903106689,1,True,False,True

Thanks to our African presence, we were able to get our hands on the alien technologies first. The first examinations were yield amazing results. This was finally the moment where we stand and become the rightful ruling nation of the world.

Unfortunately, we quickly learned this was not just a crashed ship. The aliens clearly had their plans with us. And I know too well that in the world of power, there is no second place. You either rule or you serve.

I got desperate, time was not playing for me anymore. I ordered a takeover of Taiwan, we had to expand quickly. We were able to replace the government with our puppets but the response from the US was swift and brutal. We clearly underestimated their military advancement (only later I learned when they got these new weapons from).

We settled for a temporary peace but there weren't any moves left out of this situation. I got paranoid and started clearing my political opponents. But then, I got a surprise call from Macron, the president of newly united Europe. Normally, I would not waste time with him but desperate times leads to desperate measures. Macron was persuasive, he played on my strings. He knew very well that we stand no chance to the aliens as we are. But he had a bet. The aliens are superior in technology, strength or unity but they lack human ingenuity. If we would only open our technological findings to the world, the brightest minds would expand us much quicker and maybe we would even find where the aliens are vulnerable. I wasn't amazed but there was nothing to loose.

I established democratic institutions and opened the country. I could no longer rule the country alone but this was a decade of flourishment and technological marvel. We even reached the planets. Maybe we weren't the inferior after all. Unfortunately, the rest of the world did not follow. The US became isolated with clear ties to the alien government. The rest of the world was in chaos, with different groups fighting for aliens, against them or just for themselves. We and Europe were the only bright light in this darkness.

Our openness had its cost, the alien agents were clearly in our ranks and they saw the abrupt advancements in our knowledge first hand. Perhaps that was the final trigger for aliens to act. They landed in Damascus and took over their proxy regimes in the Middle East. Then they headed east. Macron sent his best tanks and planes but stood no chance against the lasers. The aliens blitzkrieg took over the fractured South East and in no time they stood at our borders. They might have not attacked us immediately but what chance we would stand later once they conquered everything else? I had only one out left.

No one really knows who was behind the assasination of Vladimir Putin but it doesn't matter anymore. Russia became a country of no future with a constant civil war between the oligarchs and alien servants. Fortunately, I still had my contacts there. Thanks to strong diplomacy and some dissapearances here and there, we were able to hold of the executive. It might be just for a few months but that is all we need.

Macron tried to stop me. He thought we could try to arrange a peace deal. What a naive. Those who hunger for power will never stop if they are winning. But true leaders are able to do terrible actions if those are the only right actions. 

I pressed the button, many times. We might have missed the targets several times and Russians are not knows for their delicacy. But it was done. Cities burned, millions dead and whole world in crumbles but the alien army was no more. They clearly underestimated what was hidden in these old Russian vaults.

Some understand me, most hate me. I made the world go back a century, maybe two. I wish I could say that nightmares of destruction are waking me up. But no, I did what I had to. We will stand and we will come back stronger than ever. That is what we, Chinese, do the best. We build.""

BLUF: The game has a really cool concept and for the most part executes it well, but its complexity and length are a problem and make the trial and error required to succeed a painful prospect.

Earth faces an imminent invasion by technologically advanced aliens.  Seven factions spring up to take control behind the scenes and direct Earth's resources toward solving the problem according to their own philosophy. Your choice significantly changes the storyline and win conditions.  The resistance wants to protect Earth and its status quo.  Humanity First takes a more offensive stance and wants to wipe out the aliens and anybody who supports them.  The initiative is illuminati capitalists who see the aliens as competition.  The servants worship the aliens and are straight up fifth columnists, playing to help the aliens win.  And so on.

The game has two or three strategic layers, first is the illuminati shadow war shit where you use your agents to take control of nations, influence their development, and siphon resources to your cause.  There's also a political layer with alliances and wars between countries, which is independent of the shadow war shit (e.g. your controlled countries aren't automatically allies, you can invade your own countries which can be useful sometimes).  Then there's the space layer, with a huge and detailed solar system and semi-realistic delta-v dependent space travel and combat.

You start out by taking control of countries and fighting the other factions to secure terrestrial resources like money and research, eventually start building space stations and mining bases on the moon and mars, and as your space economy expands you move into building warships and spread further into the solar system.

There's a really fun dynamic going on where you have two forms of competition; the other factions are competing to control Earth and the limited resources available in space, while at the same time the aliens are lurking out there watching you.  They vastly overpower you for most of the game, packing fusion thrusters and terawatt lasers while you're puttering around with chemical rockets and converted naval missiles.  Your only advantage is they don't take you seriously and are mostly content to watch you and occasionally destroy some shit if they think you're getting too full of yourself.  Over time you improve your technology, take a few pot shots at the aliens to scavenge their tech, build towards fleets that can actually go toe to toe with them. Or maybe not, maybe you're the servants and you want the aliens to win.

The big problem is the game is 1. extremely complicated, and 2. extremely long.  The complexity is in every layer; stuff like priorities and investment points can drive your countries into the stratosphere if done well or leave them weak and pitiful if you misuse them.  The tech tree is a labyrinth with huge lists of prerequisites for stuff so if you don't know what you're doing ahead of time you can end up never accessing shit you need.  Ship design is complex and the overwhelming power of the aliens means there's little room for error and a lot of fake choices.  Likewise building your space economy, before you have construction modules and space resources getting anything into space is expensive and time-consuming and you can fuck yourself if you don't know what to do.

Add in the length of the game and it becomes painful.  You either looked up a bunch of guides to avoid the pitfalls or you're doing it trial and error, and these are the kinds of mistakes you can't just reload your save for, because you fucked the game up fifteen hours ago and there's no way to correct it now.  You will restart the game multiple times before you get things going properly and that means hours and hours of replaying the slow, repetitive early game.

But if you do avoid the pitfalls and get into the meat of the game it's a lot of fun.  The concept is cool, space combat is cool, ship design is cool, the whole ""full-spectrum simulation of Earth being invaded by super-advanced aliens"" aspect of it is cool, there's just a lot of pain before you can get there.

i would have more hrs if i had more time to play videogames

- create customs councilors (For no Modders Users)
- A Completely Randomized map Where for example The US is a Poor Country and A Country like Honduras its a Powerful one
- A Global Generic FREE (kinda of useful) mission for all councillors in my first game i did run into a 
What do i do now with you? Type of Scenario and the progression of the game got Kinda Stuck i didnt have an optimal council so a Lot of turns with your people just doing nothing

Maybe Something like find Talent  or something like the ""Advise"" Mission But Light

Heck, I don't honestly know.

Honestly the most impressive thing about Terra Invicta is that it hasn't dramatically exploded due to its vast scope. The ambition of Pavonis is clear to see and it's really unique to see a game try to tackle both space colonization and earthbound geopolitics at the same time. My hat is off to the devs for somehow making this thing work. 

But while I do think the game is genuinely amazing (look this thing somehow got 100+ hours out of me in the first week alone) I can't deny that it's also a complete mess on the UX front. The interface is extremly cluttered, explanations for key mechanics are either too vague or missing entirely, the tutorial is on par with old school Paradox games (aka very bad), the tech tree practically requires you to know what you are searching for, combat controls are completly unintuitive and the late game desperately needs stronger automation tools for the geopolitical side of things. If you want to get into this game I heavily recommend looking up internet guides (Perun has a great series up on his gaming channel) in order to learn how to play and I really shouldn't have to do that. I seriously considered leaving a negative review and while I ultimately decided not to due to the devs being pretty fast in responding to feedback I will be changing my recommendation if they can't make substantial improvements on the UX front.

On a more serious note, the game may not be for everyone at this stage. UI needs major rework, programming needs optimization, and it takes a beefy computer just to load this thing. 

Game play wise, mechanics are rather opaque. A lot of this is intentional, since this is a simulation and IRL decision makers aren't gonna know when and how crises hits them ahead of time. But I do wish technology names are more descriptive. It took me until mid game to figure out that you need to research middle-sized ship modules to mount on stations, for instance (that might even be wrong).

A lot of game play hindrances are also from or associated with UI. The ""Going to Location"" button, for instance, would bring your camera to the location across the solar system, which means loading in all the objects, etc. Most of the time, however, you just want to build stations, and that UI is not on the pop up. So forth. I am sure the dev is actively working on this, but this may give new players an additional layer of frustration on top of the xeno apocalypse.

This game combines space simulation and grand strategy in the most glorious way possible, and has the promise to be one of, if not the, greatest Indie title in this genre. This is almost definitely not for casual players though. The amount of hours and know-how needed to enjoy this game is incredulous.

its a good game. but as of now with a few bugs. 
this game can be made great once fully finished and the kinks are ironed out. 
looking forward to expansions and DLC


 i have my first 49 hours after i ragequitted. yet again. 
first time was because aliens came and destroy everything around 2033
2nd time. i tried to do better. but its impossible because this game at midgame becomes a Whack A mole fest. 

so first time i didnt know what i was doing and my economy was bad and i was behind in tech. 
2nd time i was doing great. Unified europe. didnt touch the alien fauna at all. managed to supress. the servants to the background until around 2033. aliens havent noticed me yet but i have a fleet of 12 ships already. 

Suddenly the servants and every other factions start sabotaging me. killing my councilars taking over my assets. especially my habs in orbit. the servants suddenly came out of nowhere with superpowers and start taking every hab i have.  now this is a hidden mechnic with loyalty and over mc or cp cap whatever. but its never clear. so for me it happens out of nowhere. 

so after 2030 a game of whakamole starts. is there even a way to make other factions like you. 
and first time. when i made it to 2035 the aliens only sent fleets with about 200- 300 power. each
but now that i have scaled up with my own 1k fleet suddenly they come with 4 k fleet at me. also at 2035.

so yeah thats what i meant by balancing. 
also the research seems to slow for me. too much redundant research.

There’s a great concept and potential in there, so I hesitated a while before going with Steam’s binary thumbs down. But there’s too much frustration trying to get into this game for me to recommend it at present.

I’ll start with the good. The game has a hugely ambitious scope going from nation state level politics on Earth, out to space stations and off world colonies spread across a full solar system with hundreds of potentially settleable bodies. There’s an intriguing background plot of the aliens, what they’re up to, and the ways various factions want to approach dealing with them. But getting to any of this is slow and frustrating at best, for reasons I’ll now explain at length:

While this game has a lot of depth and complexity, the tutorial is practically useless. It amounts to a handful of pop-up messages (which show up erratically, and occasionally behind other interface elements) prompting you to do various tasks, often without explanation of why, or even more frustratingly *how* to do those. Quite often there’s a “take me there” button which [i]should[/i] do this – but it just opens a panel with a list of objectives that contains basically the same one-line instruction. It's all very well directing people to wikis and lets plays, but that's really not a great way to get info if you're trying to avoid spoilers as well.

The tutorial also misses out some key aspects of the early game entirely. There’s no mention of organisations (orgs) – essentially companies and agencies that your councillors acquire to boost their stats and available missions. Acquiring these is the single biggest aspect of improving the councillors abilities, yet the only clue this mechanic even exists is an occasional pop-up mentioning something about “new orgs in the faction marketplace”. Where’s that marketplace? Well – it’s up to you to find it buried in all these opaque menus, and it took me a while. (I’ll help on this one – click on the background of a councillor’s portrait, and it’s the panel in the bottom right of the screen).

It doesn’t help that one of the first things the tutorial prompts you to do – build an orbital platform [b]before[/b] you have any off-world mining – is objectively a bad move. Such a platform does nothing but sit there wasting the “boost” resource required for launching anything from Earth, and make it even slower to establish the mines on the moon or Mars that actually required to do anything practical in the “in space” portion of the game.

Which brings us to the next big problem with the game. Getting to do anything with that magnificently huge solar system is glacially slow and tedious. Now you might say that it makes sense to take a while to expand, and it’s fair enough that if you want to send a Mars mission you’re looking at a couple of in-game years. The problem it takes an awful lot of real time for an in-game year to pass, due to the mechanic of Councillor Missions. 

Every two in-game weeks, the time acceleration is brought to a screeching halt and forcibly paused while you are required to assign missions to each of your councillor agents. After the first year or so, this turns into really tedious and repetitive busywork. Public Campaign, Stabilize Country, Defend Interests – you’ll be spamming these out every two weeks simply to counterbalance the AI doing the reverse missions. So during that Mars mission you’ll have to go through about 50 cycles of stopping to set these councillor missions, and clicking through a pop-up from every single councillor saying that they’re doing what you just told them to. Yes, there are buttons for “repeat mission” and “do this mission forever”, but there’s enough moving around required to cover all your control points, and whack-a-mole AI agents, that you can’t really leave a councillor to do the same job for more than a couple of cycles, so these options do little to reduce the tedium.

The ”Defend Interests” mission is perhaps the clearest example of something that only wastes the player’s time. Every few months you have to run this on each of your control points or they’ll become vulnerable to AI councillor missions - and you will lose them if you neglect it. Since it needs to be done on each country, and only every ten cycles or so, the player can’t automate it, and has to keep manually assigning these missions. It adds nothing to the game – the AI always runs it like clockwork on any relevant control point it has, and since it finishes earliest in the mission phase there’s no “vulnerable window” you can exploit after a while, so it's basically the default state. It’s just an annoying chore the player has to remember to do and spend time clicking through. This could easily be abstracted by making it so enemy missions are just automatically harder after you’ve held a control point for a certain amount of time, streamlining the play significantly. 

You’re looking at spending several real time hours of this stuff before you’re really at the point where you can do anything with the in-space phase of the game. And it doesn’t go away even then. Every two weeks you’ll have to be yanked back to Earth to tell your councillors to “defend interests” on your main control points for the hundredth time. It massively slows the game down, putting hours of real time busy work between any significant development on the more engaging aspects of the game, without feeling like you’re really getting much done.

Now, right at the very beginning of my playthrough, I thought I saw how the devs were going to handle this. For the first couple of months, the “mission phase” was only one week long, and then the gap is increased to two weeks. I was expecting this progression would continue, so that by the space phase of the game you’d only be setting councillor missions every few months or so. That way you’d only have to go through a few cycles of setting them between major developments in the more RTS portion of the game. But no – you’re stuck with this slow, click heavy, busywork for the whole rest of the game.

I've really only just got to the actual building spaceship part of the game, and I am so [i]bored[/i] with the endless councillor assignments I suspect I'm not going to get much further into this playthrough. Hopefully this gets streamlined in later versions so you're no longer looking at 10+ hours to get to the fun stuff, and it still being a constant distraction even then.

I think the genius lies in how it opens up modern geopolitics for dynamic gameplay by giving an impetus for rapid change. Aliens. 

But within that is the starting point for a whole genre of science fiction that I've never encountered before but actually blows my mind. Which is the idea that any new species that arrived in our solar system likely wouldn't bring all the resources they needed for an invasion with them. When the Americas were colonised, the invaders didn't arrive with a fleet of a thousand ships, loaded with weapons and supplies. That would have been a logistical nightmare. Nah. They arrived slowly, extracted local resources, and used those resources to push outwards.

That's what the aliens do in this game and it's way more interesting than those overpaid, fancy-pants aliens in the movies.

However, the main reason I do not recommend this game is due to what I feel are bad design desicions (in no particular order), with semi-detailed explanations:
[h1]Big issues[/h1]
[list]
    [*]War design - ""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play."" The aliens obviously start with extreme technological advantage, and while you can fight back here and there, you are actually rewarded for passive play: build stations, build defenses, collect resources until you match them in technology and firepower. Trying to fight before then is more likely to launch you into a death spiral. There's very little incentive to ""go out there and explore"" (you're actually penalized for building on too many planets/asteroids). So it's better to just sit on your Mars mines and click ""next turn"" until you have ships capable of standing up to the alien fleets. 
    [*]Agent mechanics - at the start, you're acting like a shadowy organization, and your agents are your primary way of interacting with the world, which is fine. However, in the middle and endgame, when you expand into space, there are bigger things to manage, yet your agents don't really drop in power. Allow a lapse in your vigilance and lose a high-level agent, and you may well lose some of the countries you control because agents alone easily provide over half of your administration capacity. Likewise, in a country of 1.5 billion people, they can sway 10% of public opinion for their faction, in just 2 weeks (the duration of an agent turn after early game). This is very disruptive to the general flow of the game - you're waging an interplanetary war, watching your fleets and colonies, and every 2 weeks you're interrupted with this agent phase, where you're forced to micromanage icons on Earth - are there enemy councillors in my capitals trying to kill my agents? is there a drop in public opinion? Missing any one of those CAN bring you into a spiral of ever-increasing disaster. Even in the late game, the majority of your time is spent looking after your 4/5/6 agents who apparently control your entire space empire.
[/list]
[hr][/hr]
[h1]Moderate issues[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Technology - the game showers you with various technology, offering you a ""choice"" of 56 types+tiers of reactors and 90 kinds of spaceship engines. At first glance, this may seem good. However, the absolute majority of them become obsolete either shortly after, or even BEFORE they become available, and with many others having so little practical difference they might as well be condensed into a single drive. For instance, in a game where I got all 90 drives researched, I have only ever used about 10 - and that number would've been even lower if I knew what I was doing. Combined with clunky UI, it means you have to search for your required research and/or ship part among dozens others every single time. Likewise with weapons - you get new weapon projects way faster than you can research them, and when you repeatedly need to find that one weapon you want from a list of 70 other military technologies, it quickly becomes a chore.
    [*]Earth contries' economy (directly tied to the next point) - everything your countries do and/or build in this game relies on IP - investment points - which scale with countries total GDP nonlinearly: a country with 10 times the economy of the other will only produce about 3 times their investment points.
    [*]Ground combat and nukes - ground combat as it is now relies heavily on stacking your armies, whereas nukes typically oneshot armies in a given region. The problem with nukes is a combination of 4 factors: (1) they deal EXTREME damage anywhere in the world, (2) they are impossible to dodge, (3) they're very cheap to produce - given the same economy, a nuclear barrage is just 40% cost of an army, or 15% of an army with a navy, (4) it's impossible to disrupt their standing supply OR production. Given the previous point, you can build 2 nukes for each 1 enemy army while having half their economy, giving the attacked no chance of military victory. And since nukes don't require upkeep (unlike armies), you're actually better off not having any armies as far as human ground combat is concerned, and alien invasion can likewise be beaten with nukes alone for decades without any major adverse effects.
    [*] Space combat controls - they give a ""wow"" effect the first time you use them, because FINALLY NEWTONIAN PHYSICS, but then you quickly realize that the way the control widget is done makes it a nightmare to control more than 3 ships, and if you try to execute any maneuvers that include vertical movement, you have my condolences. The widget is extremely fiddly (often snapping to the opposite direction of where you're trying to go), and trying to return it to a semblance of normality after a maneuver is an exercise in frustration. Added to that, there are no automated actions for ship maneuvers like matching velocity or getting with a certain distance. The best you can realistically do is just make a big enough wall and let it glide towards the enemy hoping you'll destroy them before they destroy you. Combat AI looks more like the captain and the nav officer are having either a party or a seizure (ship just turns every which way, giving the enemy the opportunity to shoot you into weak side or tail armor), and doesn't really help even against ships that are completely disabled.
[/list]
[hr][/hr]
[h1]Minor Issues[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Ties between Earth and space economies - when you just venture into space, it makes sense that a lot of your infrastrucure relies on Earth help (mission control, boost, etc). But even after you move your industries into space, after you start producing ships 20 at a time very far away from Earth, you still rely on that Earth infrastructure, and missing an agent action on Earth (one of the major issues) can lead to you losing your space assets. This may be a balancing issue because the buildings that provide it give too little, but I feel like the player should be able to make space economy less reliant on Earth countries later in the game
     [*]Lack of dedicated support ships - think a fuel tanker and a mobile repair bay, or even a tow tug. If one of your ships gets a damaged thruster in space, or runs out of fuel because you spent all of it trying to chase an enemy fleet, even if you're in the same orbit as your repair/refuel station, you have no way to get there. The only thing you can do with such a ship is simply scuttle it.

1. UI problems and tutorial problems 
Some of the games systems aren't explained well. Main example of this is nation policy. Whenever you want to unify or form a federation between two counties the option to do so is greyed out. The reason I found out later was because you needed to wait for a certain amount of time before that became available. But its not clear in the games UI WHEN that time is available.

I'm constantly having to use crackdown and purge on the other 7 factions because they keep taking my main nations I'm building up...even though I have 80% public opinion...they still get in. I also don't like how limiting the control points are. I took one major nation and that's the only one I can control directly/use defenses for many hours of gameplay. The turns aren't very meaningful because I keep having to do the same actions for many months/years without much progress. The game pacing needs improved. So many turns are wasted that provide no rewards...just back and forth senselessly.

I love the satellites, space bases, technology, geopolitics lots of actions you can do that reminds me of cold war times, and the councilors and attributes. The game has a lot of potential to be amazing as development progresses.

The diplomacy needs more work with the factions so that teamwork can happen with some groups as the player decides. Please keep working on the game devs. Hope i can delete this comment in the coming months.

It's purge that ruins the game for me. i think the game should be setup like:
Phase 1-secure nations that fit your strategy and max your control points. Other factions will do the same.
Phase 2- either ally/work with other factions or try to eliminate them as much as possible while avoiding world war 3 or destroying too many resources on Earth.
Phase 3 - space colonization or more geo-politics or only near earth defense and geo-politics
Phase 4 - alien battles on land and space
Phase 5 - end game, pending faction mission

Update:
The geo politics and space colonization is very addicting. Changing to recommend because this game is just going to get better and better. I had to come back and mess around some more to see if I could make this game work better for me. I started a new game with only 5 factions. I didn't attack any of the factions and that made it to where I wasn't under constant purge assault. Now my problem is pacing...there's too many useless technologies. Why are there so many components to ships in the early game? I just want to colonize the moon and mars and beyond.

Territorial control has little strategic value; later in the game, you swap earth-bound countries back and forth as meaningless pawns. It is simply something for your agents to do that has little value after capturing the 1st few territories. Countries have little to no loyalty and easily change hands from turn to turn.

I spent my entire time simply waiting for resources so I could do something interesting. But after getting to space, it’s the same old same old, wait, wait, wait, while you build one thing at a time. Can eventually build more than one thing at a time, but you’re still waiting for things to build.

Turn after turn; o wait, there is an alien on the planet; yeah, send an agent to deal with it. Oh boy, one turn later, you get a small percentage boost to research. Or you get to attack an alien, which does nothing in the game but allows your agent to earn a little XP, but no other impact.

The AI is honestly a bit dumb; its only advantage is it knows the rules better than I did on several attempts to play the game. But in the end, the AI opponents play identically, the only difference being on the country they own, they set different policies. 

For instance, the Human 1st faction mission statement is, well, humans above all; in truth, I see nothing that indicates it’s ready to fight a war against aliens.  In one of my playthroughs, I decided not to do anything about any of the Alien invasions, like sending agents or armies. Do you know what the AI factions did? Nothing, not one thing; if you play long enough, alien monsters start popping up all over the place. How is that Human 1st faction doing nothing more than trading territory with you? The motivations of the other factions are to simply interfere with you trying to save the world. One faction’s mission is to leave earth but then doesn’t focus on doing that; lets s just trade territories. 

I think this game is more about simulating how the developers think the 1%’ters would run the world. And countries are no more than cards in a poker game.  It’s not a game about alien invasions and saving humanity. I will go to war with you because I can, and I like that you took the time to make that territory more valuable than the ones I have. Or because the AI has nothing else to do with its Agents either.

At the end of the day, it is a very slow waiting game, waiting for resources, things to build, or pretending agents have nothing meaningful to do. Let my campaign get the 70% of the people on board with my mission; o wait, they don’t like me now because an AI agent caused the country to change hands overnight (in one turn)? 

Buy the game if you enjoy waiting and waiting and waiting; I had to watch moves, YouTube, and tv while I was waiting and running at the highest speed.

Expecting more focus on space, colonization of the solar system, etc. It has that but with a serious focus on earth and what happens there isn't very interesting to me. The ground combat is very simplified and it's all about using agents to do various things on the world that just ends up being tedious after a while. This part of the game lasts a VERY long time and in my opinion feels like a side thing to the rest of the game.

The research is kind of chaotic. There are a lot of techs you could potentially research and it gets to the point of overwhelming. It took me a while to figure out what is good or not in terms of techs for ships, I still do not know what weapons you should be focusing on 40 hours into the game but have an idea of what drives to look for. There is such a thing as less is more, and that would be the case here. Either I pick a drive tech, and all similar drives are then put in an obsolete list, or something of that nature. There is just WAY too many technologies. For green lasers for example you don't research just green lasers and get them all, you have to research each and every size and type. Shouldn't be that way.

For being a game about space 40 hours in I hardly do anything there. I can't really fight the aliens at all, if they wish to flee they simply get away. I can't prevent them from treating earth as they please because any sizable fleet is impossible to destroy. All this while i'm far ahead of tech than the AI players who don't seem to do anything. Only when about 1/2 the world was conquered by them did China ai wake up and begin attacking them and that is only after I got desperate and nuked the world which basically ended the game for me as every faction then started to target me. 

Controlling ships in combat isn't good like it was in Homeworld. There is no option to tick to have the ship like auto face the enemy. You can to fiddle with every little bit of it and turning it so that the AI controls things is a huge mistake it doesn't think about how your ships are designed at all and you will get basically instantly destroyed. I would say the controls for ships in space is extremely bad and there is precedent of good controls for this kind of space combat with Homeworld. On top of this a lot of weapons are very ineffective. This compounds my frustration with the system. 

Diplomacy with other factions is basically useless and nonexistent. It only exists basically for trading resources or possibly buying an org, game equivalent to character items. 

Overall I look at this game as having potential. I think the build up to the meat of the game is FAR too long and they said they will create a start that is when the real game begins. I look forward to that. I very much dislike the fiddly system and attacking with armies works and how countries work in this overall and the space combat controls are god awful. Some people may enjoy this but I can see this game is not for me at least until they make the 'future' start date or someone designs a Expanse mod for this... but even then the space combat controls would get in the way of my enjoyment.",1665627740,1665627740,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. Game pausing event happens
2. Maybe (but usually not) react
3. Max speed until next game pausing event

This is the game loop for the majority of the starting few hours. Once you tech up and start the space stuff it still has the glacial pace and game loop. 

While there is a lot of complexity underneath with the politics, large research trees, wide space area, there is actually very little gameplay substance to keep you involved except going from pause to pause event. There are some level of space combat, but early designs also lack the tech to move fast enough so early engagements are like watching two slugs slowly move, and heaven forbid you don't have the longest range weapons possible. 

There are several other issues, such as performance and crashes, but as it is in EA I won't count that against it. This is a long step down from the awesome long war mods that I loved. I really hope it gets better and I'll finish my current run probably, but can't recommend it to anyone else at this stage.

I will give big credit to the devs, it's great to see the hard work being done during EA to fix bugs and things like that. I'll stick around to see how this game develops for sure.

Additional note on completion: 

Point 1, please fix the Brutal achievement :'( 

As you macro up into the later part of the game some things that were minor annoyances become insanely frustrating. To be fair I was playing on the harder difficulties, so I know it will be more challenging, but damn some things just grind on you the wrong way. Mainly is just having to constantly keep the annoying purge missions off your back and having to split your chancellors everywhere to cover your space assets etc makes it very difficult to progress anything from the earth side. 
In space, protecting all your assets, particularly your further mines, is near impossible until you get the good engine tech, but for production you absolutely need to have these mines so you just have to hope they don't get picked off too early because the aliens got annoyed with you keeping them out of Earth orbit. That was for sure the biggest hurdle through mid to late game was maintaining production enough to get out the ships to protected your production. 

Ultimately, while I did knock out a lot of hours to complete this game, it is still so much grind and I finished it mostly because I felt I needed too, rather than the enjoyment :S

I'm a sucker for strategy games and yet....I got something like 100 turns in I think, at least that's what it felt like and still had nothing to do. I'm just waiting for things to happen. Everything is so artificially limited it's stifling. That is pretty common for strategy games but thats not a good thing, Kinda why I had to stop playing stellaris which this game essentially improves upon. If you're not a fan of stellaris you won't like this game but vice versa is also true. 

Focused criticisms: I do not like that the available actions that each character has available to them is seemingly random so even if they have perfect stats they likely don't have the skills you need. This leads to having a bunch of character just not doing anything because you got bad RNG, you can go back to casino and reroll for a new one but that's even more annoying. Some control points should be handed out at the beginning of the game, especially given that each faction has a very clear leader originitating from a very specific place. At least 6 of the factions each hold a piece of the US. Where else would a shadow government start after all? The other 2 factions get a special start somewhere else like china and india.

I love the world building and the way the tech is explained, the way the world is explained, and the interactivity of the map is perfect, it looks like a perfect strategy game on the face of it but again, everything is taking sooo long. For example, humanity obviously needs to create the tech to face the threat and the way tech is developed is perfect, factions each having to cooperate to push humanity forward even if reluctantly. But what are you supposed to do until such a time that you can take to the stars sufficiently enough to play the next part of the game? Answer is....nothing, sit tight and wait. It should be that you fight other shadow governments for power until one of you becomes dominant enough by the time of the tech boom but if you play smart you can take any of the world superpowers relatively quickly, or a bunch of small govs together, which maxes out your administration then all you do is sit on your hands. You cant play with the other factions because you cant try to steal territory from them, you're maxed out. You can go a little over, maybe take 1 or 2 small nations but that's it. You have one person who can defend your interests and boom! You're done. Hopefully you have a character to go assassinate or do something interesting outside of go to ground or advise while you wait for investigations to pop up because that's what you'll be doing for fun, even if you don't really need to.

Sounds like I'm being too harsh but that is because there is definitely something here, and we're only in early access so there is time to turn the ship around, but that early game compounded by the fact you only have a very small amount of councilors means I never made it to the meat of the game. Frankly given what the early game puts as a foundation it doesn't really seem like it would be worth it even if I did. But it looks damn cool, and the world makes sense, feels as real as you can get, nations feel accurate to what they are in real life, organizations are a neat idea, tech progression is excellent, etc. This is exactly what I hoped for out of a space strat game but holy heck i was bored, honestly if it mimic'd real life even more by replicating the real world geopolitical strata, how money, influence, media etc actually interact then this would be beyond good, like a real stock market and in depth government control but for me it's too close to the traditional 4x games to be of any interest. If this and xcom or total war had a baby that would be one of the best games ever but this is still early access, maybe when this game comes out of early access I'll change my review, finger's crossed.",1665578802,1665581449,False,2,1,0.501763582229614258,0,True,False,True

Pros: Clearly an engaging and novel approach. 
The grandest of grand strategy titles in recent years. The scope is huge. 
Shipbuilding is fun.
The 'world building' / lore is pretty good. 

Cons: Early game feels far far far to long. 
Ship combat is PUNISHING, ships are very expensive to build at first, and having to learn combat with your expensive (and it turns out usually fairly useless) ships against the superior aliens is a tough way to learn the combat mechanics.

There are lots of great ideas, lots of depth, and lots of likely variation in gameplay/repeat value knocking around in it. I really look forward to coming back when it is a bit more energetic / balanced. But at the moment, writing for people like me (XCOM and EU4 are my favourite games, and I play them at a medium-hard level rather than insanely challenging), I just can't recommend.

Basically after half an hour of fun flurrying to grab a key strategic national base (I got the US and locked down Kazakhstan) it's a dull grind. For the last four hours of play (OK I play quite slowly, but still!!!!) I haven't been able to increase management cap sufficiently to do much more than tinker at the margins and slowly go through more research. I've watched videos and read quite a lot of tips and don't see obvious ways out. I seem to be doing pretty well if not spectacularly relative to the other factions, so I don't think I'm playing poorly. 

The key problem for me is the fortnightly councillor missions. In other grand strategy games such as EU4, if you are boxed in, you put up the speed for a few years and aren't hassled repeatedly for input. The game kind of runs itself with occasional interventions until a new opportunity to conquer etc emerges. In other games, like XCOM there are still meaningful choices frequently. But here, every couple of minutes even at max speed, you have little chores to do. And I do see the logic of some of them, but mostly they are tiny incremental things... and after a while it just gets..... boring. A poor UI with a bad font to stare at. And then there's all the other things that other reviewers have said about how impenetrable it is.
 
I really hope to be changing to a thumbs up in a few months.

(To get technical, for the devs if reading, in all that time despite researching the tech to increase orgs offered to me, I have literally never had the chance to get an org boosting my admin that could help lift the constraint - this lumpiness of types of org is annoying;  so I don't really have the power to succeed in my hostile takeovers/detentions/assassinations even throwing large amounts of ££/ops etc at it; yes I will get my management cap increase of 25 shortly from the defend the earth project but it doesn't feel it will dramatically change much. I also think the lack of being able to take over and absorb smaller countries without the tech from many hours of research, which would free up management cap, unless you are EU or Eurasian union, means you really have no interest in most of the map most of the time, except to irritate your biggest opponents. It would be good to have some genuine side intrigues that allow you to amass connections in smaller and/or developing countries while you are waiting for the bigger things to shift - in ways that make a difference to the overall picture after some time - after all, this is effectively what the big blocs have been doing IRL for the last hundred years - but the management cap is a blunt tool that means you have to abandon any less critical place instantly - maybe at the risk of adding to the complexity, a ""satellite"" stat separate from management cap, whereby the more small places or tin pot regimes you nurture, you can use it to lift the cap or get other benefits)",1665552367,1665552367,False,1,0,0.485779643058776855,0,True,False,True

This is a really cool and fresh mapgame of the Paradox breed fighting against (or for) an alien invasion, and against (or for) those who would aid them. You can play factions that believe the aliens are essentially demons only worthy of being slaughtered, those who would try to protect humanity from the aliens, a faction who wants to convince the aliens that we can be equals, and another which wants a negotiated surrender to the aliens as it believes humanity is too weak to resist.

The game begins in 2022 and features realistic GDP and current events such as Brexit and the Russian invasion of Ukraine - although if you ask me the Cohesion of the United Kingdom is still way too high! lol.

Each of these factions have unique story and lore content and their aims and motivations make sense. Much like Fallout: New Vegas, which faction you support the most depends on your own worldview and I could see reasonable arguments being made in favour of each one, including the extremist anti-alien and pro-alien factions.

Not only do you have to worry - if you are an opposition faction - about the aliens, you have to worry about their collaborators, too. 

What happens if you let the collaborators get nuclear weapons?

You will go from recruiting Agents, who can accomplish actions such as ""capturing"" a nation, improving another Agent's loyalty, turning an 'enemy' Agent to your cause, and much more. You set the economic policy of these nations and their economies realistically fluctuate - for example, as more news about who the aliens are and what they are doing on Earth spreads, the global economy tanks.

Research works on a two-tier system: the first tier is a global pool of all seven factions' research contribution, which then unlocks Projects which are what actually unlocks specific things.

Eventually you will go to space and the customisation and freedom of strategy here are simply mindboggling and the relatively slow-paced nature of space travel means the AI at its best is scary, dangerous, and has minimal jank.

Climate change is also modelled in this game, but I have not seen it yet.

Quick tips from someone who is still a beginner:

It's usually a better idea early on to first get the surrounding capture points of your target large country with a good economy (USA, France, Germany, China - India gets a special mention here as with the correct development it can become a powerhouse - superpower by 2030 ;), Russia is a good target too.) and unify them together later if you can.

While developing your economy, keeping inequality and cohesion in check, and increasing your education levels are very important, don't neglect your ground-based Mission Control and Boost capability as well as the military spending that keeping it requires.

Another point is that this cannot be played casually. I suspect that a single campaign takes about 40 hours to complete. If you don't have that kind of time then I would steer clear. 

Terra Invicta is a standalone game from Pavonis Interactive - an indie game studio, formed primarily from the creators of the fantastic Long War mods for XCOM 1 and 2. Following a Kickstarter campaign, they created a grand strategy about aliens invading Earth. 
At first glance, it looks like a very watered-down version of Crusader Kings. But then you realise that this game has correctly modelled orbital mechanics, and requires you to learn delta-V, transfer windows and orbit types for the purpose of spaceship combat. Then you learn that you have to design your spaceships in an incredibly meticulous process, in which you select the weapon type, engine type, fuel type, armour type, armour thickness on the front/side/back and even the type of armour, various additional modules, etc. And all of this you have to balance against the weight of the ship (affects delta-V), the cost of the ship, the cost of the fuel, the cost of the ammo... It's spreadsheet porn. Finally, you have a surprisingly open-ended spaceship battle side of the game, which you can autoresolve, or play manually.

As for the politics on earth, you have about four agents to manage. Everything is a modified dice roll. The modifiers can be something as simple as popular support, but you can also pay resources to increase the likelihood of success. Other modifiers are, for example, how destabilised the country is, how much public support you have, how rich the nation is, etc. Agents have stats such as persuasion, espionage, science, security, etc. Agents start off with an occupation, for example ""diplomat"" or ""mercenary"". A diplomat can improve relations, but cannot attack things, while a mercenary can attack things by default, but not improve relations. However, you can attach organisations to your agents, which unlocks new abilities. Say you use your diplomat to take over Iran, and use this influence to attach Hezbollah to your diplomat. The diplomat can now attack alien assets or attempt assassinations, based on their ""command"" stat. I think the idea of sending Hezbollah to waste some ayys is a very strong selling point.

There is criticism, however: the current state of QoL is not acceptable. There is far too much repetitive clicking that serves no purpose. The game is tragically unbalanced, and the only viable strategy is to play Western nations, because controlling them costs the same amount of administrative points as controlling anywhere else. Finally, you end up with strange things such as low-democracy countries being unable to invest in military tech level (???); or the well-intentioned but poorly-implemented climate change mechanics leading to countries having a -20% modifier to their ENTIRE ECONOMY for no reason (with no explanation), as early as 2023. They could've made alien plants grow faster from climate change or whatever, but instead we get a hamfisted, nebulous, and unfinished mechanic. 

I like that they tried to model economic development vs societal inequality; I like that high scores in democracy lead to your nation's unity moving towards a resting point of 50% which can be good or bad; and I like that they attempted to model short term gains vs sustainable development and pollution/climate change. But at the end of the day, countries are on a one-dimensional spectrum from ""totalitarian"" to ""full democracy"" - where one is better at literally everything (including military!). And the player has the same totalitarian control over all countries, anyway, regardless of how democratic they are. I feel as though the game spends too much time haranguing about exploitation, climate change and inequality - and too little time on programming an economy that would convincingly model this. It all feels arbitrary and scripted, and the person who feels most alienated as a result ends up being the player.
[spoiler](Given a certain, bizarre undercurrent in the XCOM modding community... it would explain a lot. I don't know whether these are the same people, though.).[/spoiler]

For a game with this much complexity, a SERIES of tutorial scenarios will also be important. The current tutorial is not acceptable (plus it's glitched).

However, my issue with this game is the INSANE AI. It's not a difficult AI to really over take, but when you have an AI willing to literally NUKE it's own country because it's being attacks, I just have to say it's a bit of an issue. As well, the AI will NEVER go to a spot that is being survieled. However, the instant you take your councilor off that location for survielance they are there in force. 

The game I was playing I took over USA and Canada and was working for about 6 years in game. Still about 2 years away from getting the Great Nations tech which would allow me to combine all of North America. I was getting EXCEPTIONALLY bored at just telling my councilors to wonder the planet spreading my word and doing minor tasks against the enemy and aliens. So i decided to start a war with the Servants. They are a natural enemy of all earth and as the resistance just made sense for me to try and fight the aliens in the only way i had at the moment. So i attacked London. Which Caused London to literally launch a nuke at itself. I would hope that no country would be like, ""We're going to lose this war, LET'S FUCKING SUICIDE TO SURVIVE!"" To me this makes no sense but I guess the AI doesn't consider nuking itself as an issue. 

During the Campaigne I was able to turn a councilor. Which from what I could tell was fairly pointless in all. The intel you get is always old, you can see the orgs of your turned councilor but can do nothing with them. The only thing you can do is have them fail missions at a certain percent marking. From what i gather the more you make them fail the faster the councilor will be found and dealt with by their own faction. Therefore, I can only conclude this is a worthless skill.... Why would i want to know the tasks that have already been completed by their faction? I would love to gain an insider that will tell me of FUTURE tasks so I can determine if they are worth trying to stop or not. But past tasks that I can see on my own is pathetically worthless intel.

CP is crazy low. You can basically only take over very small countries or 1 large country. Then you have to abandon anything else you take over. The AI once again are the best vultures ever and will instantly take over every country to abandon. Making it basically pointless to take over more than 1 country. After about 4 or 5 years I was finally able to take over both USA and Canada without having to abandon parts of them. That's with sinking all my experience into orgs and administration points to try to increase my CP as much/fast as i could. Considering 1 Admin point gives to 1 CP this game is entirely designed around you spending a rl month playing to just get off earth. I am also very curious as to why the AI seems to self destruct every country the take over.

I personally find Grand Strategy games extremely fun and interesting and Terra Invicta is no exception.

This game is very very deep. There are hundreds of different technologies you can research for everything. I have so far spent 48 hours in the game and I have yet to even reach mid game. Ship building is so in depth its amazing. 

This game although I enjoy it, is not for everyone. To even begin to understand what I was doing, I had to watch 5 different YouTube videos explaining the game's many different parts. Terra Invicta has a tutorial but it is not very good and can sometimes make you even more confused, but the game is in Early Access so it is understandable. 

The UI also takes quite a bit of getting used to and I still find new menus that I never knew existed. The UI I would not say is bad, but could be greatly improved. With the game in Early Access I imagine the UI will be fixed up eventually.

Recommended, but this is definitely a case of 'it depends'.
(Early access review)
This is a fiendishly complex game, and I definitely wouldn't play it in its current state without watching a lot of videos of decent streamers playing it first. Not only is it complex, it has some design and communication issues with how it presents its mechanics, making it very challenging to get a handle on.
That said, if you want a deeply intelligent game that will challenge you (and it will challenge you), then this is worth picking up. The story is great, the science appears (amazingly) accurate, and the emergent gameplay is very engaging. I hope and expect that it will improve how it communicates with the player as the game develops, and will be a much smoother experience on full release.",1665419736,1665419736,True,1,0,0.511437892913818359,0,True,False,True

If some weird 4X merge of Hearts of Iron and XCOM isn't you're thing, you may not like this game. But you may also like it.

But if that is you're thing, you'll love this game.

The factions all feel interesting, with believable stories and goals.

The Earth is *Important*, you'll spend a lot of time here. Managing your own nations, investigating foreign countries, and possibly re-starting the cold war.

All of the countries have a solid representation of where they sit in 2022. Emerging economies grow!
Countries meaningfully change over time. The EU expands to become a large, single nation state. Want to revert Brexit? You can!

But, as you leave Earth and venture further into the Solar System, exploring different planets in hunt for solid bases, to secure more resources to feed your growing industry, you'll discover just how rich this game is in detail.

Great representation of orbits, interesting yet realistic ship designs. The good for this game keeps going on.

I've been playing the game pretty endlessly since the release of the Early Access and so far have only encountered one issue, a crash to desktop when decommissioning a hab-module I'd just started to build seconds before. No worries though, relaunched the game, reopened the auto save and I was straight back to where I left off.

#1 Tech Tree - This is the single greatest leap forward in 4x game design I have witnessed, absolutely love the strategy here. There are 7 factions and only 3 global tech slots researching at any given time. Inside the global techs there are techs that will benefit all, benefit the enemy and benefit you. Controlling a global tech point means controlling the general path humanity takes, but the trade-off is your faction specific tech is going to lag behind.

#2 Victory Objectives - Unlike your Civ type games, the victory conditions here are different based on the faction you choose. This will also influence the factions that tolerate you at the start. I personally find AI diplomacy in 4x games to be the least interesting, and in this game it thankfully takes a back seat. Also, the fact that initiating a diplomatic exchange costs one of your councillors a turn is a great change from the ""spam dialogue boxes with leaders to find who gives me the best price for my goods"".

#3 Crisis Event - The alien threat is either your biggest ally or biggest enemy and it holds all the cards in the beginning. The best comparison I have are the crisis events from Stellaris where suddenly the new threat makes all the other squabbles seem like children play fighting. This game takes the crisis even from Stellaris and makes the entire game about it.

Finally, while not a gameplay mechanic the pacing of this game is perfect. Most 4x games generally have pretty slow starts but not this one. The frantic land grab/colonization (best part of Civ IMO) portion of the game is the very beginning continues to play out throughout the game.

It has some rough edges, I questioned the loyalty of one of my councillors because he was consistently aborting missions without saying why. Turns out he has a character trait that prevents him from going into countries with high unrest. There was no reason why he couldn't just say ""target went into high unrest area, I am scared...aborted mission"", instead I got the generic ""councillor aborted mission, reasons unknown"".

If you have any of the following in your library Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, Victoria, Stellaris AND wished they had more depth then this game deserves your consideration. If not, perhaps best to run now.

I have put in the same hours on the demo and the purchased game. And watched all of PERUNau's Youtube videos.

IMO they are used often by the AI and present an option for you. There is a lot of detail here, but it requires investigation to get the most from it. 

Yes it's UI could be better but its a small development team and early release. 

Where it does need a lot of attention is the AI's attempts at re-balancing your threat in game. Simply put, the game's AI fudges 'rolls' to keep you in check. Often multiple rolls in a single turn with the most ridiculous probability. 

Or incredulous actions, like an AI faction nuking the capitol of a country it runs in successive turns in the hope of eliminating your counsellors who may be visiting on a mission. 

If I've got the upper-hand in a game, I know I'm in for a pasting on roll outcome (despite probability) AND/OR on the receiving end of a series of nasty events. And If I'm getting a kicking in the game, I know that the game's AI will re-balance and shower me serendipity until balance is achieved.  

I imagine this is to keep the player engaged for the developers' predicted span of a single play through. For me it doesn't have that effect. It just makes me regret the purchase and time invested playing it. 

However this is early release. Patches are coming thick and fast now. And the patch notes reference that AI re-balancing is ongoing. 

So my recommendation for those that have one of the games above IS: don't buy it YET. 

Tag it on your wish list and keep checking the store page & reviews there. And when someone tells you the AI balancing is fixed take a chance, because if fixed this game is an award-winner.",1665329643,1665404044,False,139,3,0.774907112121582031,10,True,False,True

It's biggest flaw is that many important concepts aren't explained in game at all. To make this worse, the consequences of bad choices aren't immediately obvious. If you go in blind, expect to find out you made a big mistake hours ago that's put you way behind your opponents. I hope that the devs will improve the tutorials and advice as early access goes on.

If you do put in a bit of work, you'll find one of the deepest strategy games ever made. It hits the one-more-turn feeling like few games do. There's always another goal just ahead to keep pulling you forward. 

The hard sci-fi setting is hard to make work in games, but Terra Invicta pulls it off. It feels like the events of this game are actually possible. The ships' realistic designs are distinctive yet believable. Learning the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to understand what ship drives' statistics mean was eye-opening (Remember what I said about this game needing research?)

There are seven playable factions, each with their own main quest ""plot line"". That gives multiple games a good bit of distinction, though I'd like if there were more mechanical differences between factions.

The graphics are... there. Much like Civ, the focus is on letting the game handle a large number of objects, not beauty.

The most distinctive part of Terra Invicta, that makes it feel so different from other strategy games, is that the aliens start out with a massive advantage over you. You compete with the other human factions for power and resources like other games, but the whole time you worry about attracting the aliens' attention. This fixes a huge problem of many strategy games, where the winner is obvious early on since power snowballs. The aliens can put you back in place until quite late in the game.

got it to 10 over my cap, just kept the USA, but that amount then varied to 20, 30- 40 over the cap with me not chaning a thing. Of course the mouse on the cap didnt tell me where i was spending those...

Anyway.
Got to space with 70 boost, learned that mars is cheaper than the moon for some reason (cost 20 for mars, 40 for luna) so i saved a years worth for nothing

Tried to buy everything on Mars to block others... learned that its cap to 11 Misson control? but buying stuff DOESNT tell you you are taking those... so surprised im block from building more mines...

You colonize Solar System one rock at a time, you pick your way through a tree of technologies most of which are only slightly bullshit, you can watch your ship flip to decelerate on the second half of their transfer from one point to another, you gotta keep in mind a matter of your ships' propulsion mass so they don't get stuck in the middle of nowhere.

My personal view, I think it's paced right. I read a lot of reviews about how people would like to automate this or that to make the early game run fast and get to space quicker. However, I feel this would take away from the essence of the game. You work to consolidate your land, stifle other factions, track alien activity, secure your assets, etc. Bypassing this to play a space colonization game feels outside of the scope of what this game is going for. I think it works well as is, given that as you consolidate your control points, the tedium decreases with time. Though, again, that's just my personal view. 

My advice is to check out PerunGamingAU and PotatoMcWhiskey. I've been watching their videos since early release and I picked up on key insights I'd of not known. (such as why the CPs seem to flip out of nowhere). Of course, if you don't like spoilers I'd say play it blind.

So far I honestly cannot recommend it to the average player unless you have very particular tastes or preferences. It is something where I love the concept far more than the actual game. Mechanically, you play by essentially collecting a set of agents that manipulate things on a global stage, taking control of countries, gathering information and trying to push public opinion towards the positive for your faction. All the while the aliens slowly appear and stuff... but here is where things get tricky. Its very much ""slowly"". The game is incredibly dense and slow. You can play for hours and just get a little satelite in earth orbit up and maybe you will reach the moon. Then combine this with the opacity, or lack thereof. The game is ridiculously complex and confusing, especially the tech tree. I have played other Grand Strategy Games like Crusader Kings and EU4 for a sizable amount of time and none of these felt even half as dense at this...

The general recommendation on the reddit pretty much to look up guides and let's plays for a good chunk of time to actually understand what you are doing. They are datamining basic information like how IPs, Alien Threat meter and the like function trying to understand the game, that is how dense it is. And then combine it with the fact that you will probably spend dozens of hours playing this game trying to get it. This is not a game like EU4 where you have a lot of freedom in what you can do, everything feels like a pain and a struggle to get anywhere. If you don't enjoy spending huge amounts of time into a game just to understand the basics you should probably skip this one. I personally have decided to drop the game until they add speed options and make the game less obtuse and confusing. As is I know I will never even get past early game because I play in short bursts and come back to games sometimes weeks+ later. And this is the kind of game where that would not accomodate for such a playstile.

I get a lot of prompts telling me that things are happening but I am finding it very difficult to actually translate that into a positive or negative indicator, as an example I am trying to secure a nation, despite having several points and repeatedly succeeding in Public Opinion missions the % for the next point gets lower every time I look, I've no idea why. I seem to have patches where a whole bunch of high success chance missions fail yet I have no idea if this is some sort of counter action from the AI or a bad spin of RNG, maybe if I put 40 odd hours in I would start getting a feel for it, but honestly at this stage I really don't want to, its not grabbing me in a way that makes me want to put in the time and work these things out and I think one of the games biggest problems.

The opening of the game is VERY RNG dependent, you need Councillors with specific stats to get early traction, if you don't might as well re-roll the RNG as try and make it work (you can play on and buy councillors with what you need, but why start from a negative position when a better roll of the RNG would fix it) This is a massive barrier to entry, having to re-roll a game at start innumerable times to get the councillors you need is frustrating and is not really enjoyable and that puts a negative onto the mood for the player going in. 
Letting you select your starting councillors would be a massive improvement over what looks like a D&D style random stat roll (I've starting councillors  roll with 0-3 in every skill across the board and had them with 5-8) 

This is an in depth, hardcore game I get that and I was really excited for it for those reasons, but honestly its not making me want to learn it and that's its biggest failing, it desperately needs a proper tutorial that hand holds the new players though opening moves like securing your first nation, what the various mission types are for and maybe how to get into space (I honesty only found how to launch a probe by accident) but all Terra Invicta has is some pop ups with are of questionable help. 
I'd also suggest either letting players pick councillors at start from a pool or letting you just edit them with points or just set two fixed councillors with decent stats to lower the barrier to entry and make the game less dependent on the RNG gods at start. 

I'm sure if the dev's read this it'll be counter to a lot of the vocal feedback from the min/max hardcore experience crowd but you can leave the current mode in for them, what this game desperately needs is increased accessibility to lower that barrier for entry, once I know what I'm doing, what tech should be prioritised at start and the basic principles of what to aim for I'm sure it would be good, but right now its not making me want to learn it, I click missions and aim for goals because I saw PerunGaming do it and not because the games provided me with a understanding of how it works and that is a big problem.

Fundamentally it's a Diplomacy board game crossed with an extremely in-depth space simulator.  The interface is barely adequate.

There's a lot of ""if you liked X, you'll like this"", so lemme dive right in:
- If you like real-life space travel, you'll like that it takes a year to get a probe from Earth to Mars at the start of the game (once you research the tech to even do that).
- If you liked Kerbal Space Program, you'll like realistically building your shipyards at Lagrange points so that you can send fleets to other places for less delta vee.
- If you liked Hearts of Iron-style grand strategy games, some of the mechanics and concepts will feel familiar, especially ""dumping an entire day into the game and not realizing it"".
- If you like shadowy conspiracy theories, that's great, because you ARE one, and you spend more time fighting other conspiracies than you do fighting aliens.
- If you liked the Illuminati! board game, you'll enjoy having your agents controlling a mix of real-world and randomized organizations. Use a Government-connected councilor to take over the CIA, and use the Administration boost that gives you to control several worldwide marketing orgs for a further boost to your Persuasion.  (This mechanic is SIMPLE, but it feels cool).
- If you liked Malkari for some reason, you'll like planting bases all over the asteroid belt.
- If you liked Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and its futuristic tech-tree sound bytes that tell a story of the factions and their leaders' personal madness, you'll at least find something familiar here - it's closer than Civ, but nothing challenges the master.
- If you like real-time-with-pause fleet combat in 3d and customized ships - god, I don't even know what other game does that right - well, this game sure does have it.  I haven't been able to screw around with it, and the skirmish mode (that dumps you right into fleet combat) baffles me.
- If you like multiplayer, too damn bad.  Any individual part of the game could probably pull it off, but I don't see this game ever getting there.

Give the player the opportunity to expand into space without too much opposition, giving them a chance to learn about it and space flight. 
Second, and this one's weird given that this is one of the most info dense games I've ever played, but the game needs to talk to you more and more directly at that. I was prompted to write this review because of a 20 hr save I just lost minutes ago because I was paying attention to space during a mission cycle, thus not knowing about the alien army that rolled into france and took control of all of europe in one fell swoop. The game informing you about enemy armies entering your territory, same as any time your own armies move, would be a great addition. Also info about launch window timing (i.e. a reminder for when it comes around) for stellar bodies would be appreciated. The date for when 2 countries in the same federation being able to unify should also be readily available on a list or menu somewhere, given that as is you can only find out through the splash screen when the join the federation, and given how much is going on at any time in the game, it is easily forgotten
Newer parts should also replace older parts in your ship designer, or at the very least make it condensed. As is, the screen and menu is very cluttered even in the mid game of space combat. It very much discourages the player from designing their own ships and just hitting the button for the computer to make it. 
Last for now, a system for creating hab 'profiles' for easier en mass hab construction. Rather than go through and individually build 15 different mining habs that are all exactly the same, just save 1 as a 'mining' profile and then hit 'paste.' The system could obviously work in more situations than that, that's simply the somewhat annoying and tedious situation I found myself in.
I won't ask you guys to nerf the aliens, since the whole point is that they're op AF and you're just doing your best to survive, dragging every victory you can get from the jaws of defeat. And that's something that I love! Every victory, however small, feels earned and worthwhile, not to mention satisfying. I love this game already and can't wait to see where it goes from here!

You have to scramble your councilurs to defend your interests in a country as soon as you take it, even in the first few turns, or else you will suffer a crack down and lose that point, and you might think ""Oh well I can just do the same and take it back"" but the AI will defend all of their interests immediately, so there's no possible way to do this without too much effort. I would like to suggest an alternative to the current method, and take it with a grain of salt because I am by no means a game designer, I just play a lot of games. My alternative suggestion is to make it a point value, so say you have a base value of 5, say crackdown reduces it by 3, but defend interests also occurs and raises your control point defense value by 5 again, making the value now 7, but say they just do another crackdown further reduces it down again, so now you can effectively do a back and forth and still win or lose because as it is now, the player is just in a lose lose situation because noone can react fast enough on on turn 6 to 3 different crackdowns at the same time, because on normal difficulty that is how it is.",1665324564,1665324564,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

* Initially it was wicked fun. New, tons of content to learn, strategy.  Overall it's like a big complicated game of chess.
* After a few dozen hours I noticed this was 90% of my gameplay.  Space fleets and battles were another 100 hours away and a distant dream based on mechanics.  
* Tried skirmishes because I wanted space battles, it was fun but real tactical and detailed in the battle. fun but losing just one ship felt like a week's worth of effort. Back to the gameplay on earth.
* More gameplay on earth, like I said a complicated Risk type play.

After all I've seen, all I feel is the dull pain of repetition on Earth.  It's slow, it's frustrating, algorithms seem to be tilted beyond random (enemy missions or similar coups). Now I have my space stations and space bases and they're racking in the $$ but it's just for looking so far.

--forgot to orignally add:  so far, with literally thousands of variables, well balanced
but will update that opinion --

There are no tactics.  There is very little graphical interface in general.  I should share that I'm not super far in and all I know is what is already meta is only going to get meatier\meta-ir.  But Im pretty sure there's never any tactics.  You hire the guy in charge of tactics.  You groom him\her, carefully (advisors can be assassinated, can also be rescued but extremely difficult; XCom in common [take a shot]) and you send im off and wish for the best.  This is the deepest game I ever played.  I also been watching various youtubers play the game.  Let me share what I've learned.
You're probly, if you're an ultra moves per minute strategy player, 20 hours in til you have any idea which tide has turned against you.  Nevermind if you have a chance yourself.  This reminds me of Paradox games.  Pick one, Crusader Kings.  It's not about whether you played well.  You're awash in chaotic humanity and hoping for the best and you can play your best game and still be effed in the your mother.  This is a beautiful story creator in the grandest sense.  Without the ability to zoom in as far as CK does to individual characters.  That being said, your counselors are priceless and once they get assassinated there's no plot armor to bring them back (XCom in common; take another shot]).
On the other hand, if you suck at research, you dead.  Take a shot.  The difference here is you generally take control of countries in your coalition which supply you with research.  Owning single-governmental, multi government or strictly capitalist organizations can help.  I don't know yet if you can make your own coalition such as the EU.  It would suck if not.  That would piss me off. BUT this incredibly fleshed out for early access.  They've averaged about a patch a day so far.  Hope they keep it up.  This is a winner.

A small dev group who xcom fans are probly familiar with.  Long War.  A game for very particular tastes.  One hell of a niche.  You'll love it or hate it.  What I feel like is Stellaris is a giant embarrassment.  Terra Invicta is a masterpiece -- still gotta tell you why I think so.

What I already feel is the breadth of geopolitcal possibilities.  For example, The Academy, call them a neutral faction, grabbed South Korea first.  Humanity First, the extremest of extremists, grabbed North Korea shortly thereafter.  The nukiest group reacted first.  I'm still effin with a little Asian federation.  Singapore and New Zealand, that should do the job.  But two factions just grabbed one of the hottest zones on the planet and the stupidest has nukes.
I've never seen this play out in anybody else's playthru.  Not upfront.  Safe to say no two games will ever play out the same, and the fact that you can control any faction, each with their own goals, makes this an incredibly replayable and malleable sandbox.  Kinda WorldBox like.
Can't tell you about endgame.  But the point of the game is obviously not the endgame.  If you need a satisfying conclusion, this likely is not the game.  I know it's possible to ""win.""  Either as humans or as aliens.  I just have no idea how that looks, and like Paradox games, this shiz is so deep I feel like it would require a whole other franchise to cover details. 
Trying to define scope.  You can build entire space fleets once you reach like the 73rd phase of the game.  I know you can't literally watch them battle it out, same as fights on the ground.  It's Ender's Game, the book, without the connection to character.  But enough time goes by for some arcs to seem practical only for a day and others to span decades.

You'll come for the rich interaction of systems and simulation.  If that's not enough, don't get this.  What devs decide to focus on graphically is relatively pretty according to indie standards.  I hope there's lotsa development to come on how to see and feel that the tides are washing this way or that.

Tutorial is pretty fleshed out.  They took their time and put some polish into the systems.  And also just the game.  Zero bugs so far.  The graphics are barebones and the complexity hardcore so not sure if I woulda known a particular thing was off.
Graphics aren't ugly.  Portraits look pretty good in 4k.  There's just not enough immersive placement of you in this world.  It requires plenty of your own imagination.

The upside or downside of the game, in the end, is you don't have any idea whether your strategy was smart or dumb or aliens rolled good RNG and your rolls sucked or just the world was against you on this particular playthru for...Idk how long.  20 hours?  I'll come back and update.  You'll work your ass off.  You might beat the world but lose to aliens.  Not much mercy to be had. 

I do recommend checking out playthru videos to see if it might fit you.  I personally watched a couple Potato McWhiskeys and it saved me hours of learning on my own.  
I don't have the energy to edit this very long review.  Besides that I NEED TO PLAY NAOW

If you DO like such games, this game ramps all that Grand Strategy stuff up to 11.  Very steep learning curve, but that's because of incredible depth.

What sets this game apart is the storytelling drama.  There are seven playable factions that are the best factions since Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.  With utterly different goals, each will shape your diplomacy, path through the tech tree, and tactics on the geopolitical board.  The first part of the game is a spy game, but the inexorable approach of alien invasion raises the stakes, which negates the mid-game slump that many Grand Strategy games have.  You really never have a moment to rest of your laurels.  Your 4-6 agents don't exactly have personality, but they have distinctive strengths, weaknesses, and usefulness that you shape over hours of gameplay.  When your 15 year veteran with amazing skills gets vaporized in an unexpected nuclear attack while he's trying to intervene in a devastating India-Pakistan war, it's a tremendous loss that will take a long time to recover from.  As a shadowy organization, you can shape the policies of Earth nations, but you sometimes don't control them completely.  Without careful stewardship, they may still test nuclear weapons or wage war,  Painting the map is not always painting the map in the ways you might expect.  That being said, ending the Russia-Ukraine war and the Arab-Israeli conflict was immensely satisfying.

The later stages of the game increasingly involve the industrialization of space, making this akin to The Expanse.  If you're to build a fleet to take on the Aliens, you need resources only available on Mars, Jupiter's moons, and the asteroid belt.  If your control of Earth builds up your money, mission control, and popular support, it's your expansion in space that gives you the raw materials and tactical range to advance against the Aliens.

The AI is really smart and devious, though it never feels unfair.  The core systems are really in place.  It is completely playable in its current state.

It's still in Early Access, so there are rough edges to be smoothed.  1) OMG, the game can be opaque in the extreme.  There need to be better explanations of what everything does in the UI and tooltips  Like OMG.  2) There's still a lot of balancing to be done.  A lot of agent abilities don't do much, and some abilities are very overpowered.  3) The tech tree is an absolute mess.  Half of the techs seem to be redundant.  While it's great that the different factions are working through the tree in different ways, do we really need 20 different kind of missiles that are researched individually?  The tree needs a LOT of pruning, and there needs to be more guidance in the tutorial or the tooltips about the impact of your research.

None of these rough edges are insurmountable, and I've seen some improvements just since it's launch in Early Access.  This game already rocks, and it will be a juggernaut once they work through some difficult pruning and polishing.",1665310500,1665310500,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Yes this is an EA game, so things may change in the future.
I hope it will be better.

1. Too many bugs.
From simple text overlap in the faction screen,
to a frequent crash or CTD.
So i made a ship then enter the manual combat, it immediately crash to desktop.
I download the ship design from the save game and it still produces the same crash.
I sent the save game and what the dev said ? We can't load the save because it was a modded game.

The Alien deathstack of 4k power came to the Earth orbit, then, the game crash.

I plot a course to chase an alien fleet using the latest antimatter drive, and the game decided if my fleet should go out from the solar system.... Then crashed to desktop.

Engaging the alien ship at LEO, with Earth is shown in detail during my late game also will induce CTD.

Now read the no 2.


2. The dev refuses to investigate a modded game file. I was like WTF, it is promoted as with modding in mind.
The log clearly tells which mod i used.
And I only used a Portrait changing mod, nothing else.
Look, I've spent 110 hours to the game. I had many crashes at the previous run as well, Both firsts are unmodded game.
If i have go through a new game just to present the same crash, sorry i think i will pass.
What I sent was like the 3rd playthrough of the game.

Good luck squashing those bugs with that kind of attitude.
I mean who knows anyone sent a working bugged-save file, and it have the same crashes as mine.
I do pray it happens, because deep inside, i love this game. I bought this at the 1st or 2nd day it launches after tried the demo program. And has been long at my wish list.

3. Severe memory leak at the late game.
It even written in the log.
The game will start ""Light"" when first loaded.
Then after some hours playing, it will start to write to HDD.
I installed the game on SSD, but my Windows virtual memory is at HDD.
There was an occasion that i need to go out, saving the game was like 15 minutes long.
I have 16GB of RAM.

4. It has a complex and unintuitive method to steer your ship in combat.
It likes to plot every single time in an RTS style combat.
There are points you can modify in the front of the ship to change the course of the ship.
To yaw, to roll, to turn etc.
There's also the control button next to the AI button.
I pressed stop and the ship went backwards...
I pressed lock the nose to enemy ship, presents the dorsal section of the ship to the enemy.
Idk, it doesn't have a good tutorial as well.

I'm not sure if the plotting style will still relevant at the end game.
I mean plotting 10 ships in real time ?

Mind you the ship facing is super important in the manual combat.
Some hull allows you to install Point defense lasers to shoot down incoming projectiles and it wont work if your ship nosed in to the enemy. They have arc, that doesn't intuitively visible in real time.
Until you hover the mouse at the said weapon.
Ships can't take punishment. 1-2 missiles hit and good bye. No matter how big it is.

Now, there's AI control to help to delegate the bussiness.
The AI control is mediocre at best.
It often using meaningless maneuver, just expend the precious fuel for nothing.
And has tendency to ram the ship into alien mothership. For no reason.
The mothership was practically sitting duck w/o weapon left. All the AI need is just either orbit the mothership while shooting, OR following it steadily from behind or something. I used energy weapon so it should be my victory as i didn't have ammo issue.

If your ship ends the battle with zero fuel, practically you lost the ship.
There's no buddy fueling method or to tug the ship way back home or anything.
Scuttle is the only way. At one occasion it was a battle near my space station, as i can see it floating behind.

And what is more irritating is the fact that auto resolve doing it better than me.
Manual combat... All my ships evaporated, 0 alien loss.
Auto resolve...My ships intact, not a single scratch, all alien destroyed.

5. The game requires a strong CPU, not much on GPU.
This is not why i don't recommend the game, but just a consideration.
So i have an i3-8100 with RTX3060 Ti.
If i ran the game at full solar system, it will run the game with like 43 fps, from the very beginning.
And getting worse each year in the game.
I had to reduce it to the simplest solar system.
This should be not an issue if you have stronger CPU however.

I'm not someone who minds long term strategy games, not at all, but there's several issues here that make the experience just plain annoying. The game has potential for sure, but is held back by a few things:

- poor quality of life mechanics: having to manually assign your council every 2 weeks took the vast majority of my time. Alot of the screens have unnecessary layers, slowing you down a lot.
- rough interface with not enough info about what is happening (like why is gdp going up or down).
- You could've lost the game 10 hours before you actually realize it, again due to poor explanation. An example is going too high on mission control, which wasn't explained anywhere, and ruined my 20 hour save. (If you go too high the aliens just destroy a shit ton of outposts and habs, crippling your space capabilities and economy instantly.)
- assisted zoom on planets and astroids is so annoying, remove this please.
- Managing astroids/habs is a mess. There is no way to sort them, neither are they sorted by planet/astroid. The management hub also lacks visibility and easy management functionality.
- Ship design/functionality's explanation is nonexistent and ruined my 20 hour campaign.
- ""Alien enters ..."" popup spam constantly around the 15 hour mark and doesn't stop.

It could potentially be an amazing and fun game, but right now i find myself frustrated a lot by the issues mentioned above. So for now, I'd say wait.

No crashes or performance issues either. The tech tree is massive. You set up a power base in however many countries you can handle with your soft control points cap. You can fight wars, unite countries, and interact with the other factions. You can set up bases in space, build space ships, extract resources, and fine tune the economy of the countries you control back on Earth.

...but then you have to deal with the absolutely terrible ""councilor"" mechanic. Every two weeks you have to assign your councilors to new missions. The very early game, your councilors stay busy spreading your beliefs and infiltrating governments. New councilors unlock new missions, but usually because of how terrible the stats align with the actual missions, there is one thing, maybe two that they are good at. After securing your power base, you simply send your councilors on the same arbitrary missions over and over again. You have this massive game with long timescales and every fucking two weeks youre interupted by these stupid pointless councilor missions. This mechanic needs to be completely redone. Different missions should take various amounts of time. You should be able to assign councilors to do some background thing until an alien ship crashes and you need them to investigate, or an enemy control points loses its protection and you want to go in for the capture (crackdown & purge). Think of the councilors as military units in Civ. When playing Civ, sometimes, youre actively moving all your military units around, fighting wars, scouting, and killing barbs. But other times, they just sit there. Sometimes for centuries. Boosting the loyalty of your cities or acting as guardians for your traders. This is the route that Terra Invicta needs to take. Give me some background shit to keep my councilors busy. Also get rid of the stupid ass mission phase crap, and just let the missions flow with the game, like tech does.

If you're into HOI IV, Civilization-games, Stellaris, Europa Universalis-games, and also maybe games like Kerbal Space Program you will probably like this game.

Important Points I like to Raise:

ITS STILL EARLY ACCESS PEOPLE...

I was 2 hours in and I forgot this was a ""alpha early access state"" game, if you follow the semantic versioning concept then for game version 0.3.20 it implies there's still one or two major features coming up, and a dozen of small features still to come alongside that

UNIQUE PLAYSTYLE...

What the people behind this game(the devs,designers etc.) are trying to do here is I dare say a bit bold, combining multiple genres into one, and so far, based on my experience, they have managed to find a certain equilibrium and its working, albeit not perfectly, but excluding the rough edges they have managed to combine the genres effectively enough. For example one thing about spaceships is that you can build them using resources transported from Earth or via resources mined outside of Earth

VERY POLISHED FOR A EARLY ACCESS GAME...

This is a very polished early access game, so it might feel its lacking if you think you are playing a full game, but its not a full game. Almost every moon of every planet and lots of asteriods in between that in the solar system is ripe for exploration or mining or building bases at, and when you zoom out of the solar system map it seems there are planets or celestial bodies one can access outside of the Earth's solar system. So I think we are going to see more stuff added there in later releases

I EXPERIENCED ALMOST ZERO BUGS

MOD SUPPORT

RESEARCHING PART OF THE GAME IS ABOVE-AVERAGE

The research tree is full, and in my opinion is well-enough thought out, not some bleak research tree completely in the world of fantasy but more on a sci-fi fictional level with technologies that make more sense etc. (from my experience, I don't know how the technologies look further down the research tree but they will have to make stuff up at that point because it gets then too far in the future). 

Research has a unique approach to it in this game, there's 2 sides of it, the global research of all of humanity, which is shared (but can be influenced by players/AI to be in certain directions) with all factions and then there's the more specific-faction-research happening. It prevents factions getting too behind in research and makes it hard for factions to be too ahead of other factions. But the game puts emphases on that once a ""concept"" is researched, you must research the different parts for it etc.

AGENTS-PART OF THE GAME IS FUN IF DONE RIGHT

The agents are a big part of this game, they do actions, support other agents actions (they can be used together to achieve one goal), provide resources, own corporations. I imagine because one starts at Earth they focused the most into agents because that's what the player gets the most involvement with in the beginning.

Agents can do a lot of stuff, from stealing technologies from other factions to sabotaging their research to stabilizing nations, putting down unrest, to advising nations and helping with their growth etc. (a scientist helping with science stuff and a more economist type agent helping with economy stuff or a agent with a mix of both helping with both economy and science stuff).

I agree partially with some other reviewers that there's a certain repetitiveness and linearity with how agents work, but I think those reviewers over-stated it and its not that bad in my opinion and if you work correctly with your agents you won't get harassed every turn.

THE AI IS ALIVE...

The AI on Earth is very alive, they wage war, they send agents, they do stuff all around, I at one time saw all of China going through a de coup, basically causing all of the factions entrenched there to be removed from power, that was a big thing, and I have tried to get just one control point there, the nation with the biggest economy, but I failed many times, the factions being too entrenched there, so I was surprised someone managed to cause a de-coup there

The AI in space expand, they build stations, they build mining outposts, they make settlements, they explore. Also the AI does react to military aggression in space (but not perfectly so far in my experience, maybe this changes later in the game if more appropriate space warfare technology is researched), I was the first faction to use spaceships for destroying stations, I just decided ""damn it all"" and went on a rampage, every human station I destroy I get a atrocity point (I am ignoring that however but it does give some penalty of a sort). I managed to destroy around 3, then I started seeing AI fleets at stations to protect themselves, so I then split my fleets, keep one at the station and send one out to lightly-defended space stations to destroy, I have effectively turned the ISS into a military space station with 2 space docks and some military research labs with a active fleet always ready to defend it, I am trying to optimize current spaceship designs with the early-space-warfare tech I posses so that at all my ships can survive a space battle where I have 3 ships and they have one, I am the first player who actually owns a largish-fleet of corvette sized ships, but not the only one who has military ships in space. I am still in the early phases in space warfare but so far they do respond to my threats in space. I will find out how well these responses and reactions are the further I go in the space-side of the game.

In my game now the USA is already in the robotics age, and the rest of the world is still in the information-age because the ""Servants"" faction is heavily rooted there with the aliens indirectly supporting them. I see the USA waging war with many smaller nations, most of them they win the war, but sometimes this backfires, like the war they had with Japan not ending well for the USA, and it ending with a peace treaty

I once had a big research going, I was thinking this is maybe a way I am going to get ahead, dozens of turns passed, then suddenly I was sabotaged 3 times and all the research put into that was lost, I was at that point unaware which agent I had exposed they targeted to sabotage my research, I know now to counter that the agent needs a high security and be protecteded by another agent

THERE'S TWO RACES HERE: THE HANDLE-THE-ALIENS-RACE AND THE SPACE-RACE

It makes it a bit of a race to handle the threat of the aliens, but it doesn't rush you at all or its done in a very subtle way, its easy to forget they are a real threat (but I imagine I will pay the price of thinking that eventually). Also in the midst of all this there's also a space race happening, that's nice.


Some negative-constructive things I will point out about this game, even considering the early access state:

Its a bit pricey, I imagine it should be a bit cheaper, 10-20%, for a early access game, even a good one

Slight UI improvements, it affects me a bit

automating direct-investment-for-nations (by limiting it somehow based on research or something, its a bit unbalanced then if you can invest in welfare in all your nations automatically and end all inequality in most of the nations you control, so maybe some catch to this would be more balanced)

some automation for agents doing the same thing, enough to sate the negative reviewers here who complained about this but not too much.

notifications are a bit ""silent"" (I do see them there on the top mid left but it can be easy to miss that), and should be made more clear, maybe a window pops up after every mission-assignment phase where a player sees every notification that happened but can filter it accordingly to only include certain stuff or relevant stuff.

The tutorial is also very weak  (I presume to be worked on before it comes out of EA) and the ""codex"" - the games version of Civilopedia - could do with looking at Civ to see what an in game reference should look like. The Developers have readily acknowledged this (it is EA not full relese) and are working on the tutorial and references

The game is different, in a good way, and I want it to be good. I think it definitely has the potential and the developers do seem to be very active, so fingers crossed we could end up with a great game, but for now it is still a NO

UPDATED

OKAY so my initial view after 20 hours was a No, and then I posted the above review after 31 hours.

But now I have changed it to a YES.  Yes it can be a little slow and repetitive at times, but this game really is a slow burner that can eventually pull you in and keep you playing for many hours longer than you intended!

Edit: 20 hours into my first run and the pressure has never come off. With games like civ, EU4, XCOM initially you feel very stretched but slowly you get the hang of things and your team becomes powerful enough to fight back; here that's not the case. I've been constantly feeling on edge.
Put more technically, the difficulty curve of those games is harder at the start and easier at the end. So far Terra Invicta has done a great job of keeping the difficulty curve consistent.

And it's not because I don't know what I'm doing. I saw a few youtube videos of the early game before I bought this and I read a few tips on reddit... so great job to the devs for putting together this well balanced system.

Cons: it does need a bit of polish in terms of UX/UI. I still have a hard time spotting the costs of organisations,  and the requirements for federations aren't easily find-able. We also need more information screens showing the state of climate change (with breakdown of who/what is generating the various gases) as well as a way to see which countries are controlled by whom.
I suspect these UX/UI/QOL things will get ironed out during the EA period, since the game itself has been very solid in terms of features and stability (only encountered one or two minor visual and selection bugs).

Hot tip for players: turn councillor is super powerful. You need to investigate an enemy councillor at least three times to get complete info on them, then you can try to turn them (this isn't clearly explained).

Which, landed me later in the game when everyones running out of cap points with having to drop North Korea as I am also in control of Canada and working on 100% control of the US.  I didn't want to abandon the nukes for the Servants to get their hands on.  South Korea is allied to the US as is Japan so even though I would have liked to damage Protectorate and Servants respectively there, I didn't want to drag the US into a fight.  Soooo.... I de-allied, and nuked Beijing.  China, which was not controlled by any faction at this point, doesn't fire nukes back but does declare war, it allies with Servants in United Kingdom and starts fighting North Korea.  I make sure both sides army's are engaged and then hit...  ""abandon nation"".  For me as Resistance this makes sense to de-fang North Korea before it falls into being part of the Servants and Protectorates sweep of the area while at the same time degrading China's capability at the same time.  For North Korea in real life this makes NO SENSE AT ALL.  It picks a fight it is guaranteed to loose against its only ally in the neighborhood.  It has no more nukes to threaten with, and just gets rolled over and absorbed by China (being big believers in Servants/Protectorate) while, after all my public relations campaigns, North Korea exclusively believes in Resistance/Humanity First.",1665189689,1665189689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First 5-10 hours is super streamlined fun, everything up to colonizing Mars is balanced and makes sense...

But everything after is a whirlwind of imbalance, inconsistent, and abuse of game mechanics.
The game suffers from a critical lack of balance that makes it very easy to lose but still continue playing:
The tech tree is a mess, resource generation is all over the place, buildings will take forever to finish, alien bombardments are broken, mission control is impossible to obtain without cheese blah blah blah. Human AI (beside Servants) don't even matter after 2024 so they become a pest to turn off before starting a game. You can beeline countries/tech that let you just curb stomp and own all of Mercury/Mars/Earth Orbits. I do like that US/Europe are basically THE countries to take, but it really limits variety to endgame.

I am having fun playing but I can definitely see numbers need reworked, mechanics need fleshed out that make sense in a game (not reality), and that streamlined beginning fun needs to be extended throughout to the 40-50 hours to end game.

There's a large amount of events and systems that are intentionally hidden from your view to simulate ""real life"" lack of intel, and how humanity doesn't understand the alien's goals, tech, etc., but as a game mechanic it's truly draining to deal with. You can do everything in your power to protect yourself and play safe, but there will be ways for either the aliens or another faction to just fuck you over and you can't do anything about it except roll 1% odds each turn to get it back. For example, if you don't play the alien's buddy faction, there is a hidden mechanic where the aliens will help that faction suddenly steal your control points from you, even if you've defended them and did everything you can to protect it. Afterwards, the alien friendly faction will protect it, and you'll be relegated to mostly rolling 1-5% rolls every turn to try and get it back. Sure, it makes sense for the aliens to do this, but being on the receiving end is just, well, not fun to deal with, especially because for most of the early and mid game you'll be unable to stop this from happening. It's a tax for playing a faction not friendly to the aliens.

The game isn't bad, not by a long shot, but it's tendency to use frustrating and opaque mechanics can just not be fun. I understand the fact that it's a simulation of playing a technologically inferior species facing off against one that is way more advanced, and I truly enjoy it, but the biggest negative of this game has been mentioned previously - the entire game is basically a long term investment in whack a mole against the other factions and the aliens. There are absolutely zero instances of ""Finally, I've achieved x, I can now do y."" throughout the entire early or mid game. You can't ever actually ""solve"" a problem, you can either constantly try to strangle it in its cradle only for it to return in a few months time, or deal with a whole hellscape of issues in your playthrough if you fail to either realize the issue exists or don't stop it in time.

You need to like complex management game with very little guidance and learning by yourself. There is not a lot of wiki or guide available as of yet so some aspects of the game remain a mystery to me. 

That being said, it really fits the context of the game. You are playing as one of the factions that encounter alien life on Earth and you start by knowing absolutely nothing about them. As you research them (as a faction) and learn to play (as a player) the game starts to make sense and you can start making a plan.

I love the complexity, design and style.

However, losing your space assets to them is flat out deflating, discouraging, and I think not the direction the game needs to go.  Once you ""graduate"" to the space mining and space combat, counselors should no longer be part of the equation IMO.  They should remain part of the Earth fight only; the first part of the game.  Eventually, they should be part of the fight to defeat and infiltrate the factions on Earth while your space forces shut them down in the solar system.

There needs to be some way to limit a factions agents, perhaps limit them to fewer agents as the game progresses through infiltration.  Perhaps  assassination and detention limits their recruiting of new agents right away (perhaps for a year?).  I agree with some here that eventually through a combination of open combat and covert actions through your counselors, you need to either neutralize or defeat select factions.  Basically, things on Earth need to come to a head between factions.

In space, combat with the Aliens is both scary, fun, and thrilling when you win or lose.  Again, counselors should have no part here though.  I am having to take a break right now because my hard earned fleet has lost a ship and station to counselors and I just about rage quit.  It is hard enough building space assets as it is (plus defending them!) and losing them to a counselor is just crazy.  Especially when you have marines on board.  Again, get rid of counselors capturing space assets.  I know I am not the only one saying it.

Regardless, I am overall enjoying the game and art.  Zipping  around the solar system is impressive.  Currently, I think I am about mid-game with combating the Aliens around Earth and Mars.  I have captured and destroyed several Alien ships.  I am in the process of studying their ""material"" I think.  I know I am not as far as others but I do have 40 hrs in-game so I think I am far enough through the game to offer at least a small opinion :).

[b]TLDR; big mess of many systems which results in poor flow and frustrating primary gameplay loop. The game is constantly capping progression for fear of letting you run free in the face of an actual overwhelming challenge. Everything is a dice-roll, and you frequently get XCOM-ed badly. Reach new heights of statistical improbability by failing multiple 89% rolls in a row. There's no satisfaction of beating the system, just the vague sense of being a gambling addict. You never feel clever, just lucky. Most frustratingly, these are the mechanical choices that stand —like a psychotic bouncer who fancies your gf— in the way of a genuinely intriguing story. Playing blind and gradually uncovering the existential xeno threat, all while your fellow humans (fools that they are!) work against you, should be a very compelling premise that doesn't deserve to be gatekept behind a system that worries about letting the player roam free and be creative in troubleshooting human extinction.[/b]



[b]It's a game with serious structural issues that boil down to the very moment-to-moment activities imposed on the player. It's just micro and dicerolls with little sense of creatively solving a problem or adapting to shifting situations. This is a problem emerging from the very vision for what the game ought to be.[/b]



Like many I wanted to like Terra Invicta, I had been looking forwards to its release for a long time and hoped it would suck me in. Unfortunately, it suffers from a distinct lack of focus and plays like:

- A character-driven game with samey, cookie-cutter operatives progressing in player-driven optimal ways. There is little emerging narrative or ways for the player to bond with these councillors that supposedly drive your faction's desperate struggle, you just pump their numbers up like cookie-clicker because dammit I need a control point in Kazakhstan

- A 4X space colonisation game where the RNG starting conditions will determine the scale of humanity's expansion by an order of decades. No water on the moon ? You'll have to spend the next 30 years building spaceports big enough to throw you into the asteroid belt repeatedly until you can find some meagre ice to suck on, which is just as well because all your local Terran water is under new Xeno management by then.

- A geopolitical map game with simplistic levers and an artificial hard-cap to how far you might spread you influence across the globe. Nothing is organic here, the game fears you getting ahead of the human and alien threats. If a country is big, it is hard to get into and corrupt/influence, nevermind the backwards logic here, it's just another example of the game railroading progression for fear of letting you run free in the face of an actual overwhelming challenge.

- An RTS that is turn-based, and brutally murders the flow mid-charge when all you wanted to do is wait 4 years for diplomacy lock timers to expire and for Boost to build up. It's the worst of both turn-based and realtime systems combined

- And perhaps most importantly: everything is a dice-roll, and you frequently get XCOM-ed. Reach new heights of statistical improbability by failing multiple 89% rolls in a row. Have RNG screw you out of decades of progress. This is where the legacy of the developers —XCOM modders— shines through.

First off, This game has a LOT of systems. and a load of it is micro management.
You start this game with ""Agents"" the game calls them Councilors? 
You then order them to take control or work towards controlling a Nation.
You roll a %, lower is better.... You win, and now control a part of that nation, you can now affect every aspect of that nation including exploiting the hell out of it.
There is a big tech tree. That comes in tiny slice's....
There are space ships.
You can build a ground army too.....
You can Colonize planets and then get to mico manage them too..... along with there armys....

This game has a Massive pacing issue, and it only gets worse since, i honestly feel it should be turned based until you hit the stars, then let the player choose if they want a more real time setup. 

If they clean up the Ui/Menu's, Let people automate some systems or heck let the ""Agents"" run wild that would be great.

Some points:

Early i find the servants to be too powerful. I would expect them to start out the weakest, and once alien presence increases, so does their power.
Ai will ignore all their faction believes simply to haras the player if they are doing well. Even Humanity first would mainly target me as resistance, leaving the servants etc to do their thing. Ai also seem to completely ignore alien flora (if i do not stop it as academy, no one will?). 
Ai get some automatic hate towards any faction doing generally well, and even if you share most of your earnings, they will hate you (there seems to be no way to reliably improve relations with other factions). As academy I tried to give the resistance as much resources as i could spare, yet 2 weeks later they regard me as enemies (declaring war etc). Aren't they supposed to focus on aliens if i never hurt them? 

Also, build 1 station too many and the aliens will go and destroy all your stations. I believe some form of subterfuge should be possible when using stations, as surely they cannot smell my faction being in charge of stations that are non-military? This would also make the ""take control"" option of space stations much more realistic, as currently it seems to just exist to troll players that get teamed by all factions at the same time (Humanity first destroying my resistance control stations, only to have the servants go and take control of my stations 2 weeks later).

Overal I like the game, but currently it feels like you are vs all AI factions, no matter which factions you pick.

Aliens are really rough on normal difficulty, but from what i can understand, the game is meant to push you in the corner as the aliens land and invade you crap. space combat could be revamped if i'm being honest, and lastly, the other factions are impossible to deal with. I had a run where I had a pair of councilors I used to assassinate enemy councilors, but it really didn't hamper their progress and they pumped out high skilled councilors that easily took my control points and assets. It can be frustrating to basically feel like 1v7 this game. In addition, there are no hard deals in the game, even the non-aggression pact is basically useless as the AI will break it easily and it feels bad and useless to go for it. 

However this game is pretty engaging, part of the struggle is that feeling of being pushed to the edge and you have to do everything you can to try to survive. Not for everybody sure, but a great game nonetheless. For people who have played it and had some gripes about the mid to late game, the looming alien threat of high powered ships and incredibly powerful armies is part of the end-game where you try to fight a battle of attrition as you try to get to your faction's endgame objective. There is a point in the game where it is incredibly frustrating, I don't feel good about it, but I think it is the developer's vision for the endgame as you try to complete your victory condition",1665152447,1665152447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Currently the lack of information about core game mechanics is crippling to the enjoyment of the game. Once the tooltips, interface, notification system, and general information conveyance are cleaned up the game will be much more playable, but I think still not great.

My problem with it is core mechanics. It's trying to be solely a hard sci-fi game, but in doing so has abandoned the fact that a game should be fun. Even with clearer information you'll still need to wait several hours of gameplay time to get your space bases set up, you'll still need to reassign counselors to the same mission in a different country over and over again. You reach skill cap on counselors very early on and then it just become tedious to manage your empire. The Aliens represent a surmountable challenge but it's just such a chore to conquer them.

The game is tedious at the moment, I can't recommend it. I'll come back to it in a year and see how it's doing.

It tickles the part of my brain that loves digging deep into how a system works to figure out what's going wrong, and it's generally forgiving about mistakes - you almost always have time to turn things around as long as you can use what you learned from failure to hone in on what it is you need to do. Also, I think that the pseudo-turn-based nature of it helps me a lot with the kinds of mechanics that I normally forget to use in RTwP strategy games or full RTS.

Who I would recommend this game to in its current state: people who liked Victoria 2, or like Stellaris but wished the ship designer was more in-depth, people who liked the Expanse, people who like experimenting with a lot of things to see what works, people with a lot of patience.

Who I would not recommend this game to in its current state: people who get frustrated with slow/obtuse UI (and yes, I mean slow, the full tech tree takes about 5-10 seconds to load every time, and it is frustrating), people who do not have enough time to play more than like 2 hours a session, people with lower-end PC's, people who prefer a more directed tutorial (this game has what I like to call ""choose your own tutorial"") so that they can launch in being somewhat competent at the game right from the beginning.

Here's what's good about the game: the systems are deeply engaging, trying to figure out how to get something to work reminds me a lot of how learning Vicky 2 went for me, the slow pacing gives the sense that this really is a battle for the future of humanity and every action should be considered and weighed, but also that you do have time to figure things out.

On the other hand the UI can be a bit obtuse and as a result I often found I'd made a big mistake and tanked some aspect of my economy because I took a particular action without reading every sentence of three different tooltips. You'll need to experiment a lot with different ship designs before you find the ones that work best for each role. There are a couple of common-sense QOL features that are just straight-up missing, so sometimes you'll find yourself getting punished for experimenting with things (always triple check your space construction before you place them, you will not get those resources back if you immediately realize you made a mistake, even if no time has passed).

All that being said, I'm still enjoying the hell out of this game. I like the slow-ish pacing, I like the sense of accomplishment I get when I finally design a ship that does what I want it to do in a reasonable amount of time. I like the nitty-gritty of fine-tuning each counselor's stats and org pool. I like the way that the long-term planning required for early and mid-game space race interacts with the short-term action oriented counselor missions, constantly forcing me to revise my schemes to adapt to new situations, because the feeling I get seeing them come into fruition after two, three, even five years of plotting is incredibly rewarding. Watching plans fail, on the other hand, is absolutely crushing, but the amount of time available to me and the arsenal of tools I have at my disposal makes me feel that any challenge is eventually surmountable. 

To sum it all up - I absolutely recommend this game if you like grand strategy, particularly of the kind we got a lot of like 10 years ago, even in its current state. BUT only if you have the patience to deal with some hitches here and there. It's definitely not fully polished yet, but it is more polished than a lot of other early access titles out there and it's a lot of fun.",1665133816,1665133816,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Even when it comes to the space it doesn't have much to do, building combat ships early on is a noob trap, it's a heavy investment that'll become obsolete quickly, plus the other factions don't build much/if any military space assets for the fight to be meaningful or interesting. Attacking the aliens early on is not only a noob trap but literally the worst thing you can do,  
 The aliens will destroy your space assets in retaliation, and they are far too strong to stop, so you are incentivized to do absolutely nothing with warships early on.

This is game I've been waiting for for pretty much ALL MY LIFE!... was a massive fan of XCOM when i was a kid, and seeing The Expanse TV shows has given new life to the sci-fi genre on screen... and now playing this... Oh the depth, the detail! 

This really feels like a paradigm shift in strategy genre... I'm no games historian but this strikes me as a genuinely original game. I don't believe it recycles any of the usual tropes and so it's hard to give it a genre... sometimes it feels like a 'grand strategy', others a 'boardgame', others a space sim, and sometimes just an interactive story.

PRO: 
- Depth of Gameplay... From boardgame-like earth based politics sim to space based 4X & RTS wargame
- Replay-ability... 7 Factions, with completely different objectives & endgames
- Storytelling & World-building... I mean the 2022 Ukraine conflict is represented at game start !!!
- Fidelity to The real... Global Warming, Nuclear Winter, Kessler Syndrome... all possible if things go bad.
- Interesting Mechanics... Clever use of physics to present challenges, eg launch windows
- Sense of Scale... the solar system is HUGE!

CONS:
- Initially Intimidating
- Requires some micromanagement (but not as much as you may think!)
- Needs a better tutorial / codes or offline guides to certain technical aspects
- Still a fair few minor bugs & balance issues (Oct 2022)
- 'Turn-Based Game Crack' - You will spend every free second of your day plotting strategies to come back and enact, and will stay up late at night 'ending turn'

It's literally impossible to get a proper feel for this game within the steam refund period, so please pay attention to both positive and negative reviewiers. 

I've been a 4x lover for a very long time now. The first ever game I played as a Kid was Civilization 2 on my Dad's computer. I've played all of the civ games, stellaris, some paradox games, and RTS games. Strategy is my thing. This game brings a very unique and interesting take on strategy, one that I thoroughly enjoy. The shadow councilor deep state idea where these organizations can form ideologies and spread influence across the globe to get things done is realistic, interesting,  and reads like something out of a novel. I love it! This game does have its flaws though, some of them are very deep. With new mods from the community coming out and active developers I'm sure many will be fixed, but the game is not in a super playable state right now if you aren't already a big strategy lover. It's niche, in other words.

To make things simpler I'm going to break this down into sections based on how the game moves and my thoughts on it, starting with the early game. 

In the very early game you are introduced to your councilors and you start making moves on countries to begin building and later consolidating a power base. The game feels like a very complex game of chess at this point as you try to out-maneuver the AI into key countries that can give you a big advantage later. This is probably the most exciting time of the game in my view, because it feels interesting, challenging, and you have to make sure you flex your strategic abilities to forge a larger plan and execute it without too much disruption.

As time moves on and you enter the period where you get two turns per month, things slow down and start to get boring. As the map fills up and you enter the mid-game though, right before you get into space, that's when things get bog-standard boring and delve into a serious patch of tedium. Pop-ups are endless, and come inconveniently timed in the middle of your turn. Why? Why do I care about Afghanistan and Iran forming some new alliance because the aliens wanted them to, and what am I supposed to do about it while all of my councilors are occupied in other places? The endless barrage of news notifications that pauses your game is just... boring, stupid, unnecessary, and I desperately wish they would get rid of them. The game enters a very defensive phase at this point where interests are consolidated and people are mostly competing over the small fry countries and flipping them randomly and occasionally. Flipping countries with established powerbases like the US is pretty difficult to do, unless you perform a literal invasion, and sometimes even that doesn't work since they can just flip all of them back over unless you defend interests immediately. Sigh.

It's at this point where the game does become interesting again as you move into the early space race and start colonizing the moon and the inner bodies. The aliens become more of a threat and an annoyance, but the game's general inability to take out other factions or otherwise form alliances with them becomes a bit of a sticking point as everyone is moving in their own directions, sometimes coincidentally together, but in most cases it's a bit of a hodge podge mess. Sure, sometimes you can get something out of the other factions, but those who might naturally be comfortable as allies, such as the resistance and perhaps humanity first or the protectorate, or hell, even the academy, can't really team up to accomplish anything. The ship building and space battles are cool though, and impart a sense of realism and fun to the game.

The late and end game gets kind of tedious again. I have a pretty beastly computer but even I still get periods of stuttering as the computer tries to calculate the AI's decisions, and there are sooo sooo many things to consider. So many decisions to make. I get it, I understand, but you also get a touch of boredom after that as... the game feels a bit samey as everyone tries to complete their objectives. Sometimes you're competing with others, sometimes the aliens, it's a giant, mess that can proceed very slowly which is a major detractor of the game. 

Overall, I have enjoyed it up to this point. It's a very dense, complicated game with a lot of mechanics and not a lot of handholding. The game desperately needs some sort of automation or changes to get rid of the serious whack-a-mole feel that the game takes on in the mid-game, the most boring and annoying portion of it, although it never really goes away. The pop-ups need to stop. The space race needs to be a little easier to get to and less tedious to accomplish. Perhaps more phases of the game need to be introduced to help these transitions and cut down on the micromanagement. Put the player more in charge of making interesting decisions instead of just endless shuffling.

Excellent bones though for what I am sure will be a really good game with time! Mods have already been put out that help alleviate some of these problems.",1664917621,1665090666,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

It is quite fun but right now it starts to get a bit tedious after a few in game years. It is not for the faint hearted as the game is a very slow set over decades with each game year taking quite some length of realtime,  hours sometimes if there is stuff to do  less but substantial if you leave your agents on continuous orders. This is not click end turn 24 times to finish zoom through the year.

The Earth side of the game is fun for a time, but once you settle into your shadow rulee over many nations and the world is carved up all the factions are still vying to over throw you and each other. I got obsessed with solving global warming since that adds an inbuilt negative modifier towards national gdp that is hard to combat. That seemed like a lost cause with the other factions doing the opposite. Oddly learning the tech to end oil or the one for commercial fusion power did not seem to contribute much. On the earth side, there was lots I like at first, but after you have settled into the game the faction system becomes an annoyance not a bonus.      

Once you get into space the slowness continues. The early stages are fun from the novelty but after a while there are so many limiters to growth in space that you are waiting long times just to add a new colony or even just a new building in one of them. Money, Boost, Mission Control all these things hold you back with slow growth to increase your income generation. Then there is anti-matter which has so many symbols that the game uses for units of quantity that I never could follow how much I needed, I was earning etc. Did I have a lot or not much at all? Scotty is not born yet to ask him.  

The first few fleet battles against aliens were fun, even when I lost. After a while though the alien tech advantage makes it seem kind of useless to even try to engage them. When you try to blob them, they just zoom away. but you can ignore them and for the most of the time they ignore you too. This is not XCom and it is not a tradtional 4X game either. The aliens seem something of a MacGuffin  for much of the game. Also the real physics for space flight and trajectories went right over my head, Big  number is good, I got that, but the rest, I specialised in statistics for a reason. It is quarter of a century since I studied physics. 

Most of all, I want a space elevator. Just had to add that.    

I do however, actually look forward to seeing  how the game turns out on final release, I do not regret buying it. I got a lot of good time out of it, but never finished it and never quite found my goal in it. Fighting aliens did not seem to be it.

The Dev is pretty much banking on the success of the mod he made to lure people in. Which I'll admit some mods border on flat out game development so I wouldn't say it's an unethical thing.

Simulation, grand strategy, RTS, 4X. If it sounds like the game is he was grabbing every tag possible to lure in as many people as possible even if the tags are mislabels. That's because that's actually the case. 

The first and most Critical mistake. The Game's tutorial is flat out useless. Which is a problem because the game is also not intuitive or user friendly in the slightest. Honestly the tech tree for the game looks more like the Conspiracy theory board from the TV show ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" then any decent tech tree. 

The Tutorial. Is one of those ultra lazy. Pop up text only Tutorials. By that I mean instead of explaining how to do a function. Like say seize control of a Nation, Stabilize a unstable nation, research etc. It's basically a bunch of ""You are here."" Signs with barely any mention of how one action relates to another aspect.  

Such a Tutorial may be eh good enough for a super simple game. But for a game that has several screens for just looking at earth. several menuses and several systems all overlapping etc. It's a big cluster^*#& to make sense of. I will say this to anyone determined to play and learn the game. Look up youtube videos. A random guy can explain how to play better then the game's actual ""How to play."" System AKA a tutorial is. ""This is where you can assign the missions to your councilors."" ME: ""So what does each mission do?"" Game:""And over here is the research."" Me: ""But I saw like a dozen different mission types going to elaborate on those?"" Game:And over hear is the Faction screen which is blank because you haven't met anybody yet. Very important you see this blank screen now.""  

I am not claiming to be a professional at this game. Or even very deep into it. Hell I barely understand it. But What little I do understand I'm relaying to you so you can avoid wasting 40 bucks on a game you'll likely get frustrated and abandon almost immediately.  

Remember how I mentioned those Tags are wrong? The Game is turn based. It is not an RTS. Though it does try very hard to trick you into thinking it's not turn based. ""But there's a time control thing with Fast forward etc."" It's Turn based. It is the same exact system from X-COM. Time passes then a new Turn starts. 

The game auto pauses for each turn. And you have to select orders for everything before the game will let time progress again. The game's objectives will tell you what you should do. But won't explain a lick of the process in actually getting there.  I can't speak for end game but for begin the game you have Agents. Called councilors. Different types of councilors can do different types of missions. No break down on which types do what or anything. That the game just didn't feel was necessary for some reason. Before people remark that the game was going against the grain of overly simplified dumbed down games.  Like how the new X-COM games are dumbed down more restrictive parodies of the original X-COM games. 

I will add not one of those old X-COM games is even a fraction as complex as this game tries to be.  

Honestly in my honest opinion. This game needs a scripted tutorial where you actually play through the actions and various functions. It'd have to be across multiple scenarios. 

I'll also add the white Knight simping for this game in discussions kind prevents any discussion regarding improvements or addressing issues.  Make a criticism of how bad the tutorial is. Any gripe even if intended as positive improvement is meet immediately by hostility on the discussions. Anyone that even implies anything negative about the game is ganged up on. The fan base of the game is not friendly. Just take a look at the discussions for 10 minutes. It'd be hard to argure a case for any kind of improvement and have it seen as feedback. I won't be too harsh on the devs for that one. You can't pick your customers. But IT is a problem. 

For anyone wondering. ""So how fun is it?"" The beginning experience of the game is ultra confusing and boring at the same time. All the crap of the starships, the space stations etc. Is all cherry picked from late mid game and end game.  How do I know that when I haven't reached that point in the game? BECAUSE I SEEN THE DAMN TECH TREE AND GOT A ROUGH IDEA HOW RESEARCH WORKS. 

When you start the game. You have no territory, no soldiers, no army. No spaceships IE you have two randos that you can send on missions. Missions from taking a peak at the first Alien crash site. Fucking with a Country's angry population etc. Your first task upon starting the game is the seize control of multiple nations. Ideally including atleast one really big power country like Russia. The United States China etc. Research isn't a direct thing. It's a ""Suggestion"" IE your guys ""Suggest"" The various nation's research efforts go one way. Your doing this competing against the other Factions too. If your the Faction that suggests the hardest upon the current research's completion you can pick the next one. To be picked for that slot. There are three slots.  

As far as I understand it. You can't directly research a damn thing until you take control of multiple nations that happen to have research labs. And considering how deep into the tech tree all the cool stuff is. And how convoluted gaining territory in the first place is. I'd say 10 hours in of nonstop gameplay you can see your first starship. I am taking a guess based on what I seen and understand so far.  

I'll continue to play and try and figure this mess out. To translate the Beginning experience of the game. Imagine your playing Total War. No armies, no battles. Just Agents but non of those cool lil cinematic that play when your agents do a mission like the older games have.  

My suggestion is either don't buy. Or if your dead set on playing. Watch 20+ youtube videos to understand how to play.

Update. 5 hours in and the gameplay hasn't changed one lick. Perhaps the game gets good eventually but this is more a chore then anything fun. 

I'll be real. I'd advise against buying this game. The TL;DR if you were to apply the Anime standard of ""Give it till the third Episode to give it a fair shot."" This game is demanding you watch 11 Episodes. A ton of time wasted on just figuring out the game. Because the tutorial is so useless. An extremely slow to build up boring new player experience. The problem isn't the game's difficulty. I've enjoyed games I gotten utterly destroyed in. Nor is the problem that it's a strategy game. It's that the game is utterly boring on top of being excessively complex with very poor explaination of the various systems that all overlap with each other.",1664482352,1665073456,False,3,0,0.355891108512878418,0,True,False,True

Pro:
- Interesting Shadowgovernment Gameplay early
- Story/Lore coll although you need to read A LOT
- A lot of interlocking Systems 
- High SciFi Vision of what it would be like if we had to go to space fast
- Tense Back and forth with other Factions.

Con:
- Learningcurve. Nothing is explained anywhere. Need external help.
- Understanding consequences/conditions for certain actions. You dont always know why something works one time, and the next time it isnt even an option
- Menus over all. To many, to clunky, bad tooltips.
- Earlygame never Stops and more Systems are tacked on. WhackAMole Galore.
- Numbers so obstrusive you never can predict if something is worth or not. (maybe comes with experience though)
- AI is obsolete earlygame, and giga annoying mid to lategame. Especially annoying example: I take a controlpoint from one AI Faction, but cant fortify it next round, because AI Faction number 2 takes the point from ME in the same round i aquired it before i got the possibility to react.

Overall its good fun for a view hours, but i cant help to push into the lategame, since midgame is just annoying, with you putting out fires while not making any real progress. BUT this game can develop in a great 4x game if they do this early acces the right way.

Terra Invicta is a perfect marriage of modern geopolitical grand strategy and space 4X that provided solutions to some shortcomings of existing games from both genres. Space exploration and the looming alien threat give the players the long-term purpose for coming out on top in the geopolitical struggles back Earth while the contemporary setting puts the ""sciences"" back in space sci-fi. It's refreshing to see terms like ""delta-V"" and ""ion drive"" being used in a space game other than KSP when most space games nowadays take faster-than-light technology for granted. Although the game is only set in our solar system alone, the simulation of ~350 celestial bodies including asteroids and dwarf planets is enough to make the sandbox feel expansive. What Terra Invicta has already done in EA is already pretty revolutionary, looking forward to what future updates bring.

And for the kind of scope and ambition these guys went for (and by and large, seemed to nail), a lot of minor issues can and are forgiven by me.

after this i couldnt tell you. the first game i did i fought the alien invasion for 20 years against their massive asian nuclear country. the second game i did to try to do better the aliens got china again and i was like ""nah im good, not fighting that stupid slog of a war again."" In my third and current game im doing fantastic. except for the ""sit around and click next turn"" waiting for something to happen. i've gotten rid of all worldly nukes. im prepared for any invasion. my ships can wolf pack the aliens but i still dont have enough DV to do anything more than secure a quick win or 2 that does nothing. if i can persevere through the boredom that comes after the early game i might actually see what the rest of the game is like. but i dont have much hope besides waiting for the next godly expensive tech and pressing ""next turn"" only to tell my councilors to go boost public opinion or ""defend interest"" in the country i've held for 20 years once again.

space combat is alright. its hard to get into. my friends hate it. apparently PD is bugged right now. and in fact there are still plenty of bugs. bugs that make the AI fleets stop in orbit around a disabled ship and dont move for instance. which is why im not currently playing and am writing this review because why not? so yeah. dont shoot out the engines of an alien ship otherwise the Alien ships get stuck on that disabled ship and make a huge doom stack in orbit of your shit. which means when this latest bug to plague my game gets fixed guess where all those ships are going to go? thats right. straight for all my stuff in a massive doom stack i have no hope against. At least my defensive stations arnt going anywhere. if only i could reliably autoresolve those battles tho..

okay thats it. game is fun im addicted. but the game is also slow. and honestly i keep hitting a brick wall after the early game. a brick wall of monotony and boredom waiting for something to happen. or losing my very first game to a bug that destroyed the AI with a moon quake. so yeah. fun? eh. sure ig. worth buying? sure. ill play more after this. frustrating as all hell, riddled with bugs that range from infinite audio, guns not firing, AI getting stuck, armies not behaving the same between the player and AI, or simply deletion of the AI in the first week of the game due to cosmic events? you bet your ass. if i dont lose this game file to this current fleet bug and i manage to finish a play through ill update this review accordingly on what happens. i pray to god the rest of the game gets more interesting. and for the love of all thats good and holy please put in automation for the councilors so i dont have to tell them to do the same thing every 5 seconds. or increase the turn length from 2 weeks to a month or something. please and thanks.

For that alone, this game gets a thumbs up. I've intentionally avoided using guides or looking up information from outside the game because I wanted to work out the mechanics within the game myself and to see how well the game communicates that information, and I recommend that. 

However, this game does have one big flaw in its current state. The UI and information easily available to the player can not hope to keep up with its in depth mechanics. The full tech tree, for instance, feels like a mess. Some things can also seem confusing if you're not yet familiar with the mechanics, like why mission success rates can suddenly drop in the middle of the mission phase (usually due to the enemy defending an interest or the councilor you're targeting moving somewhere safer). The codex is also lacking currently, and the fact that stuff gets added to it as you proceed further is a little weird. There are definitely balance issues too, but in a game like this, that's probably not surprising. 

Overall, I'll probably be playing this game until it does leave early access, and on into the future. I think the way the game plays is actually smart: its structure means that new players are always introduced to only a few mechanics at a time, starting on earth and then into the farther reaches of space, and if you restart to toy more with those earlier mechanics, it's not a big loss. So the foundation for accessibility is actually there.

There are more core game design decisions that pose challenges, as well as decisions of how to convey the story.

Of course the UI and UX is in a horrendous state right now - many important factors are not told to the player, and without the community, this would be incredibly frustrating. If you're not someone who reads text very closely and has a working knowledge of near-future spacecraft, you definitely need to wait a while. This should improve a lot during EA.

Let's start with the story and writing:
There's quite little. Almost insultingly little, considering it's trying to cover an alien invasion. There's no description of  what the aliens actually... do, how they act. It's almost as engaging as watching a chess match. Yeah, you're killing alien-coloured chess pieces, but there's no impact, because there's no character. There's even a point where an alien nation is established. We get two lines of flavour text. Absolutely weak. Might be fixed in EA.

The techs are the most interesting prose, and even that is perfunctory at best. The unlocked technologies are accompanied by Sid Meier's alpha Centauri-style leader quotes, but they're... bad. They're boring, don't really tell us anything interesting about the characters or even the tech, and the voice acting is bearable at best. If you're going to emulate one of the best games ever made, at least put some effort into it. I doubt this part will improve.

The gameplay right now boils down to one word: Tedious. It's just tedious busywork. Progress is incremental and incredibly weak, and huge setbacks happen at the drop of a hat.
You need to defend your control points. It's a recurring feature that after some point is just busywork action tax. 
You need to re-build the stations and mines the aliens inevitable bombed to rubble.
You need to spam the same action over and over on your councillors.
You need to fight the same fight over and over and over again. 90% of the tech tree are irrelevant, because until you have the best possible drive, your ships are utterly useless. Stations defend themselves, and better than any ship can. In fact, your first priority should be to move your ships *backwards* to let the station protect them. Every turn, you do these things 6-10 times. And rinse. And repeat. And despair.

This is the core issue. There's a few things to do in this game, but in the end it's all filler until you've got the endgame techs. Game length needs to be shortened dramatically to make it less of a slog.

1176470,123413484,76561198025388308,0,17,391,0,308,1665090040,"I'm giving this a thumbs-up solely based on potential. Like a lot of reviewers and players on Steam have said, there's the core of an excellent grand strategy/4X game here. However, right now that potential is overshadowed by a fiddly UI, repetitive gameplay loop, and opaque presentation. I think that's pretty normal for a lot of grand strategy games, let alone ones in early access, so I don't want to hold it against Terra Invicta too much just yet. But as of right now it's an experience that's as frustrating as it is compelling. 

To start off with the good: Terra Invicta's ultimate goal (that is, to be Crusader Kings by way of The Expanse) shines through almost immediately. The game begins with a notification that a UFO has crash-landed in a remote area (thanks CO Bradford,) and within a week the world knows that we are no longer alone. By ""the world,"" I mean our world, mere days after I'm writing this. Terra Invicta does its best to model Planet Earth's sociopolitical situation literally at this moment, down to global income inequality, freedom index, and Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. It's astonishingly ambitious. 

What this commitment to realism also means is that we are not at all ready for an alien invasion. As the aliens solidify a beachhead at the far reaches of the Kuiper belt, your faction will be taking its first wobbly steps beyond Earth's atmosphere. The moment you set up your first ""Hab"" in low Earth orbit (think your own version of the ISS,) you'll get what this game is going for. This is a simulation of humanity against impossible odds, toddlers trying to sit at the cosmic adult table. It's a wonderful and compelling backdrop for a game. 

Space is the most fun part of Terra Invicta that I've experienced so far. The solar system map, while confusingly vast and tough to navigate, is stellar (pun intended.) Every body in the solar system is simulated, and a future opportunity for settling bases and resource harvesting in the future. I really like how the early space program is simulated - every nation you control with a space program will contribute ""Boost"" to your inventory. This is an abstracted representation of how much stuff you can shoot beyond Earth's orbit. Your Habs need water and raw materials, and until you can harvest that from space, their needs will be converted to Boost and deducted from your inventory. It's a neat way to simulate establishing little beachheads away from our planet. 

The Earthbound stuff occupying your time is more middling right now. One important thing about Terra Invicta is that you are not a nation - you're a clandestine organization with your own personal goals in relation to the aliens. You might seek to ally with them, exploit them for resources, fight them off, or simply get the fuck off the planet and let them have it. As appropriate for a shadow government/deep state/new world order group, you act through 2-6 proxies that you can recruit over the course of the game. They can act to destablize world governments, solidify your control of the media, corporations and ultimately executive branch of these nations, attack other factions, sway the world's populace to your ideals, and more.  It's pretty cool!

It's also where the game gets clunky, and at the worst of times, repetitive and boring. You see, each of these councilors has missions that they can do once a week (twice a month later in the game), and every week the game will pause to let you make these moves. It's a turn-based system overlayed onto the real-time-with-pause one designed for the rest of the game, and it frustrates as often as it does something interesting. Taking over a nation requires a mission to take a Control Point in that nation, and in the early game it's just a percent chance to succeed. That chance will differ (large nations are more resistant to takeover than small ones) but otherwise it's just click, then wait. If another faction already has control, then you have to do a mission to increase unrest, perhaps sabatoge their control point, then either coup (resetting the points and doling them out to whoever contributed to unrest) or steal the point. There might be more complexity later in the game, but as long as I played it basically just felt like spamming abilities in the right order until something new happened. The UI doesn't help either, often giving you a dropdown of literally every territory in the game to select from to use many of your abilities on, often with no regard for the nations you've been working on the past dozen turns to sway to your side. 

This wouldn't be so bad (every strategy game has some degree of repetition baked in), but there's simply not a lot of feedback the game gives you about what you should be doing otherwise, unless you're already an experienced player. Options simply appear, often with no indication about why they're available. The research tree is vast, but since a lot of research is global among all factions, you tend to get handed an option that you don't have a choice in. You can purchase Orgs for your councilors (Earth Organizations like the FBI or tech corporations) that effectively act as equipment for them, but I wasn't able to figure out what caused them to show up in the marketplace. There's a lot that you just do in the game because there's an option to do so, but no clarity on if it's actual getting you somewhere or not.

There is a ton of obvious potential here, and the game is compelling despite its frustrations. I've followed Pavonis through the development of both Long War mods, and despite their reputations as gluttons for punishment, they're also very aware of what QoL changes players need to interact with the game successfully. I'm hopeful that Terra Invicta will be a brilliantly polished game in 6 months, but I think it bears repeating that there's quite a bit of work to do before that happens. If you don't mind that now, I'd say it's definitely worth your 40 bucks.",1665009967,1665009967,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

However, the simulation of space travel and the solar system can get fairly technical, and the pacing is a slow burn. I'd call it an ""avoid the giant stepping on you while you grow"" type of strategy game. Getting overconfident too early will lead to starting over. This is offset by a frantic geopolitical knife fight between human factions on Earth, which keeps you busy while you very slowly reach the level of tech to challenge the aliens.

Example: In my current game, I've taken over most of the EU, but NATO has dissolved, and Russia has invaded the EU. So, I have a war to manage in Eastern Europe. In space, I've got a moon mine running, and waiting for a Mars mine to come online so I can think about trying to build military ships to patrol in Earth orbit. Which I'm thinking now should be put off for a few years because my tech is too low, and it'll take way more mines in space to build anything effective. It's only 2026, and I've got a long list of R&D to accomplish, while I keep Russia at bay.

As others have noted on the Discussion forum, this is also very much a play-and-learn type of game. You'll figure out basic things in one game and start over to apply them in the next. You have to survive the geopolitical fight for a space program and funding, then you learn how to build space industry and a fleet. There's definitely a multi-game learning curve.

Then you create a deep, complex, and interweaving set of systems for global illuminati vs. illuminati competition against the backdrop of a coming alien invasion on the strategy layer? Sounds like fun? 

Ok now let's add on the fact you can build space stations, build a base on pluto, build a space battleship fleet in the hard sci-fi style of The Expanse, help Ukraine win the war, and research a tech called ""End of America"" that lets you release the CSA, Lakota Nation, Cascadia, and a few other fantasy American nations?

Ok NOW take the combat style from Endless Space but improve it in every way and slap that in for quick space battles that look good and allow you to exercise skill and smart play.

The factions all have different attitudes toward the crash and so different objectives. The Resistance is essentially the faction that represents X-Com, or rather, the collection of nations/etc. that created the X-Com organization. Other organizations want to either serve the aliens, join them, escape them, profit from them, or exterminate every one of them and kill anyone who thought cooperating or surrendering to aliens was a good idea. 

You'll spend years in-game figuring out what the aliens are doing and why before killing your first E.T., however. This isn't a guns-blazing invasion, at least initially, and the first shots fired will be between nations as the 8 factions fight for control of the Earth. Combat, likewise, is very simple, with basic unit models and effects and bars slowly decreasing. It's EU IV, not Stellaris (or even HoI IV).

Speaking of, the scope is much larger than X-Com. While the game starts in 2022, with 2022 technology -- Ukraine is even defending itself from Russian invasion at the start of a new game -- it eventually ends up with fighting the aliens across the solar system. You'll be launching battleships to fight in the Kuiper Belt, even if at the start you have literally no weapons capable of attacking alien space craft.

This game is truly something special. It is the level of scale and depth I have wanted from a game my entire life and this group of glorious devs has provided it. There are so many calculations and simulations happening within this game its mind boggling. In short this is shaping up to be the experience i always wanted from games like Stellaris and Sins of a Solar Empire.

I will be sure to update my review if my thoughts change or if these mechanics start to feel inconsequential.

UPDATE

Still in the same campaign, the year is almost 2040. It has taken me about 60 hours to reach this point. There is so much complexity that keeps getting added to the game as you progress its amazing.

Okay, I've been at this for a while. 

It shouldn't take me 30-40 hours to understand how the game works. I've been on three playthroughs to understand how the AI operates, how the interface works, everything. I love a good complicated 4x. I love Stellaris. But this is just unreasonable in how steep the learning cliff is. 

I've been wanting to get to the game in the part where I can enjoy it, but I've spent so much time playing it trying to understand that I am now way beyond redemption for trying to get my money back. At the time of this writing, this game has *the worst* new player experience I have ever seen.

EVE: ONLINE has a better new player experience than this game.

I'm sure that this game (when you finally get it) is great fun. So what I just did was I clicked on skirmish to try out space combat to see if I would enjoy it. 

I imagine that it's gonna take another four hours for me to really get the hang of that too. I didn't do a scratch and I just used the vanilla setup on both sides.

EDIT: My main gripe is the whack a mole fest. Its borderline masochistic. Getting gang banged by every other faction and then literally one turn later they insta ""defend interests"" to the point you have a 0% chance of a ""crackdown"" or a ""purge"" its frustrating its not fun. It needs more time in the oven and more balancing. Maybe its just the RNG screwing me maybe the game just isnt for me or for you if you hate a random numbers generator determining your fate constantly. When i ""defend interests"" it seems the AI can somehow take all my points but literally LITERALLY a 0% chance if theyre doing the same thing. I just dont get it. Are they starting out with better agents? RNG? I dont know but at the moment its not fun. Im not even a casual theres just no action or reaction its ALL RNG. ALL of it. Just about the entire game.

Losing is fun!!

Update: 
Okay the honeymoon phase has worn off. As expected of a early access game there are issues. I will attempt not re rehash some the game play issues such as station capture, nation unification etc. See others for that. 

My main issue is that I have now reached the mid game ( ~2030 ) at something like +20 hours real world time of game play. I am now kind of stuck, part of me would like to restart a new campaign as I have learned a lot since first playing, however the time investment of another 20 hours is unappealing especially given a lot of repetitive game play. As for moving forward the road looks long and tedious without guaranteed success. I am still not at a place where I feel secure enough in my holdings to branch out much. Having to give the councilors the same yet slightly different maintenance missions every month with little game play change is choresome.

I am really unsure how I feel about it looking like it will take 100+ hours of game play to complete a campaign. Maybe I am just a slow player or maybe this is how the game is meant to be?",1664518168,1664950247,True,1,0,0.503937005996704102,0,True,False,True

It adds heaps of more country interaction to the game it is inspired by and the addition of space combat and exploring other planets is fantastic. but having no base building and on-the-ground turn-based combat is what keeps this game from being the perfect version of X-COM. 

But to me what makes it just a straight-up bad game is the human factions. the only reason for their existence is to have an option for the player to ally with the aliens (which no other X-COM style game has done for good reason) to the point where if you reduce the amount of AI human factions to just two you lose the choice to play as any but Resistance and Compliance.

Other than that they are nothing but roadblocks to your progression in the game. The game already has the Aliens as your enemy, there is no reason to have 1-6 human AI slowing you down at every turn, forcing you to do the same actions over and over and over again. sending an agent to recap a nation control point for the dozenth time is not fun. especially when the other factions are immortal and you can never completely get rid of them.

You may argue that the different factions are necessary to have different play styles but IMO the devs could have saved a vast amount of time by just having options for the player to steer the world toward any of the various ideas the factions espouse. even if you choose Compliance or Alliance they could have had a human resistance force (A X-COM) rise up to resist you.

Eight factions with different goals and varied outlooks each struggle for global supremacy from behind the scenes in an epic battle of wits and intelligence, with perhaps a little bit of muscle thrown in. The nuclear threat is also present, which adds a layer to determining how you deal with your rivals.

Action economy is important and well done in my opinion. You have a set amount of time between phases of the game where you give agents orders, regardless of how quickly the task might get done. Using your limited actions wisely is obviously better than not doing so, but at the same time there's enough breathing room for failure that a streak of bad luck won't kill the game.

The game is in early access and while it's fully featured, the UI is rough and presents information in an overly complex fashion (such as displaying actual dollars of GDP instead of a standardized abstraction). The gameplay is finicky and not at all intuitive. The game's flow can start to get sluggish when you're micromanaging 30 space stations and settlements, and constantly ordering your agents to protect your interests. Retasking your agents around doing the same 3 things can get tedious. The tutorial is lacking, and there is little information on the web about advanced game topics. This game does have its issues.

A complicated game with depths I'm only touching. I expect this will take many weeks if not months of game play, Enjoyable but with frustration at the extreme random opportunities or lack thereof. Game needs some serious balance at the start to enable new players to enjoy game play -  specifically balanced characters and a few affordable organisations.

If you want to get the best of the game you'll have to revisit old saves to try different methods - probably after you've slept.

Hopefully will be a good game for strategy players when some of the bumps are ironed out. Enjoying the story so far but would like to see a bit more depth.


Significant random play issues.

1) Some organisations require a ""Criminal"" to buy them but you won't necessarily have a criminal in your pool of characters.
2) High Persuasion is key to early game play. You may not have any character with high persuasion (At least 7). I've seen all characters in your pool below 5.
3) Money & Influence is key to early game play. You may not have any characters or organisations whereby you can make money or influence.
4) Characters have missions which use character stats. Just because your character has the ability to use a mission doesn't mean it has a value in that stat - making the mission useless. In other words the main stat used by a skill mission is ZERO. Far too often the stats for mission are too low to be of any use.
5) Traits can negatively affect stats in the best places you need to use them. Just because you have high stats doesn't mean you can use them to attempt to win the game.
6) Some missions are significant time sinks. Every month each character (4 in early play) gets to action one mission. Investigators can investigate enemy characters. But it takes many missions for the investigator to build up enough information to use a followup steal organisation mission. That steal organisation mission can cost more money than the organisation is worth. All those months could have been used by another character type to make money, influence or halt the enemy. Redundant pointless game play.
7) Just because you have taken over a country doesn't mean you have control the people within that country - the Elites want more resources than it's possible to give them which leads to instablity which leads to even less resources.

The AI has 7 chances of having good rolls. You have 1.

8) Every month you have the offer of organisations. Don't expect to have any organisations you can buy or be of any use.",1664478638,1664917957,False,1,2,0.379914999008178711,0,True,False,True

gameplay involves worker placement principles similar to great board games: you have 4 councilors you assign a single task each across the map and over a 2 week period they execute them, repeat. there's a whole RPG element to managing the capability of your party of agents. 5 speed play/pause real time model like XCOM or stellaris. as you might imagine, there is a massive technology and engineering tree to traverse. i'm still figuring out fleet combat, but it's got a full UI and is fully insane. the politics between factions could use a spit shine, but i'm still working out what's going on.

I feel like this game is a 'next turn simulator' when it should be a nail-biting alien invasion saga.

The UI is terrible, although I've gotten used to it through sheer force of will. That doesn't make it any better, though.

I'd expect the aliens to play a much bigger role in the game, but so far I feel more like I'm playing Twilight Struggle than XCOM.

Pros: If you like grand strategy games, this is right up your alley. Nothing like making plans for the future and seeing what could be done. Pulling the USA, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, and Central America all into one union is amazing.

Cons: This is a grand strategy game, so a LOT of things are going to be happening all at once. If you focus too much on one thing, you lose sight of others and that can harm you. You can get locked out of winning the game, period. The game, so far, does not seem to be holding back when shutting down stuff. Can't defend your space territory, the AI will destroy it.

If you enjoy 4X and Grand Strategy games, Terra Invicta fills a perfect balance of gameplay between the two ends. Fighting for control in Earth is fun and doesn't get stale even when you own major superpowers. 

The AI is intelligent and, in my experience, doesn't cheat. Neither do the aliens. They play by the same rules that you do and this makes it all the more enjoyable. The AI, at the moment, does enjoy some advantages, especially when it comes to snatching organizations, but this comes mostly from the nature of the AI and not an intentional ""cheat"" from the devs. They always keep you on your toes, even if you smashed them pretty hard in the early game.

Besides that, the space portion of the game is very enjoyable, although I found the tutorials to be particularly bad at giving you some advice on where to take your first steps. Unfortunately, this issue is common throughout the game. A lot of things need some trial and error to figure out what works and you're never truly sure about a lot of things, but IMO that's what makes it great. You're not sure if your ships can contest the aliens, because you truly have no idea what they're capable of and the game doesn't really help. You're not sure if you can create a mining outpost right next to the aliens without angering them and the game never makes it obvious if ti will, but I think that these things make the game even better because it amplifies the ""unknown enemy"" feeling of the game. You're trying to understand the aliens just as much as the factions in the game are and I think I haven't experienced that in a strategy game before.

As of now the game is still in Early Access but it's one of the few gems that truly feels like an already complete title.

However, it is let down by an immensely tedious and frustrating core gameplay loop. turn-after-turn of just playing whack-a-mole with whatever control points the AI is targeting once you've established the places you want to keep, sometimes having nothing else to do as you wait 200-400 days to get your first station at Mars or something before you can really move to the next phase of the game. On top of this, notifications are a mess. The game UI is constantly overlapping, some mouse-over tooltips don't work, some basic QoL like pressing enter to confirm or say yes to things isn't there, it all just reinforces the tedious nature of its current state.

It's worth noting of course that this is Early Access and comes with its share of bugs.

Terra Invicta has been compared to both Stellaris and XCOM, but in truth it isn't even remotely similar to either. Like those two games, though, Invicta is a pioneer in its own right and will be seen in the coming years as the inspiration for many other titles, mark my words.

A word of caution: it is a difficult game to learn and will likely take me a year or more to ""master"". There are so many components to manage in the game, and unlike some grand strategy games, you can't simply ""automate and ignore"" the components you don't understand. It is for this reason that, on first glance, the game seems very slow. You set your agents' missions, perhaps build a few starbases or ships, and then press play to watch half a month go by in real time (able to be sped up in 5 increments up to 24 hours a second).

That's generally where new players start to wonder what else they could be doing in that time, and that's where managing your country's economies and the deeper chess-like aspects of the game come into play. If you don't have an overarching plan that sees several years in the future, you won't do well. You won't ""lose"" per se... I've found that even on standard difficulty it's quite easy to outperform the other factions without much struggle. But you won't be expanding and arming yourself nearly as quickly as you could be.

1176470,123325035,76561198012081413,0,7,2480,0,2480,1664804421,"I cannot recommend this game in its current state. I am aware it is EA, but the company has clearly done a media blitz to push it, as they did with Old World, and $40 is pretty steep for what you're getting. Which is, an extremely interesting concept, with some initially intriguing gameplay, that ultimately leaves you feeling frustrated because of the poor UI and unbalanced gameplay.

I agree with most of the other negative reviews that say the game is grind-y and micromanage-y in a way that is engaging but deeply unsatisfying. That's not to say everything is bad. I like the story and actually think they do a good job of building some flavor in a cogent and realistic manner. Earth is visited by aliens and almost everybody has a belief as to why they're here. Your job as the head of an organization with one of these beliefs is to build political support by quietly taking over countries by assigning actions to your councilors (I feel like these should probably be called agents, but whatever). This works in the early game as there's a mad dash to control the most powerful countries and your councilors' actions feel like they have some weight behind them. Taking control of the US or China feels like an accomplishment in and of itself. By far my most satisfying experience in the game was taking control of France and completing the EU through diplomatic annexation. But getting there was a slog.

The early game is definitely where TI shines. However, even there the micromanagement begins to rear its head. If you are controlling 10 different countries, that means you have 10 different economic settings you need to have for them. Yes, there are templates and defaults, but I didn't really find them to be helpful. Especially as the other factions will be looking to foment discontent. And there are 8 of them. Another review described it as whack-a-mole and I think that feels accurate. Which leads to another issue I have with gameplay, is that it is incredibly difficult to track enemy councilors. You have to commit multiple actions to investigating them, all with their own chance of failing. If you fail they disappear back into the shadows. Maybe you find them again, maybe not. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but should you get to the point where you have multiple Intel points on them and possibly assassinate them there is very little discernable benefit. They just recruit another, stack their orgs back on them, and it's like you accomplished absolutely nothing despite probably using multiple turns to end them.

Councilors might be the best and worst part of the game. Running the gameplay through their actions generally works well. Each councilor can also equip up to 15 different different ""organizations"" which can give stat, resource, additional actions, or passive research and economic bonuses. Setting these orgs up is initially very satisfying. Stacking one councilor with the FBI, CIA, and a powerful company yields an absolute beast of an agent. Later on, you're pulling your hair out spending 15 minutes trying to optimize the stat boosts because attributes are capped at 25 but the game will let you stack 40 Investigation skill onto one character without notifying you. In a grand-strategy game which relies on min-maxing as a core gameplay mechanic that's a huge no-no. The alternative to a notification is the player going in and manually checking each councilor probably twice a year. That's just time consuming, it's not really fun or rewarding. Councilors also progress one point at a time, with no indication of what level they are. Having a leveling system where you get attribute point dumps would feel better controlling the councilors and it would make a huge difference when attacking enemy councilors. You just took out a level 6 enemy councilor after chasing them around the map for 7 turns. Hell yeah! It would also solve the fact the councilor attributes and buffs are poorly displayed. If a councilor is a high level you just know they're worth protecting.

That brings me to the UI. Honestly, it's pretty terrible. And in a game that is designed for complexity, min-maxing, and micromanagement, that is simply unacceptable. Tool-tips are incredibly inconsistent and often very unhelpful. The screens you need to click on and through are not intuitive. Information is either poorly displayed, hard to find, unhelpful or a combination of all three. Poor game design choices like having a project that recreates West and East Germany, or forming a new nation out of 3 unimportant Siberian provinces (seriously, who tf cares. it has absolutely no consequence) clog up an already messy screen. The tech tree is just plain bad. When deciding councilor actions, having a country screen already up (which happens, like, a lot) will automatically place that action in that country very often when you did not intend it and provides little indication it is happening. Notifications are pretty much worthless. And space. Oh God, don't even get me started on space.

Full disclosure. I never actually got that far into the space aspect of the game. Despite making it to the year 2030 (7 years in-game), that's barely enough time to scratch the surface of what is possible. And holy shit, there is so much possible. You can build habitats in orbit. Not only in one or two orbits but in 9 different orbits. What benefits does each orbit confer? Who knows? I'm sure there are huge benefits to different orbits in real life but for the love of god you gotta dumb it down a bit for gameplay. You can also build habitats on the surfaces of celestial bodies. The moon, Mars, and asteroids. Like... 300... different... asteroids. Why? Why are there so many? Why would that be fun? Each habitat requires an additional micromanagement buildout. Each with poorly displayed costs and benefits. Each requiring 500 days (about 45 turns) just to initially set up. More to build the actual modules. And what does the gas station icon mean on all my habitats? I don't know, probably nothing important. Oh, an enemy councilor just stole my entire orbital space station without me having any chance to defend it? The defense module is probably buried 4 levels down on a poorly named research option in the tech tree. 5 years of building up one space station just.. gone. It would literally take you like 20-25 years to build up any sort of substantial fleet. Frankly, I think the aliens get kind of a bad rap. They are at least polite enough to slowly encroach on Earth, giving you time to mount a defense instead of going all out before you are ready.

That's the long of it. The short of it is that this game is an intriguing concept with a solid early game, nightmarish levels of micromanagement as you progress, equally strong and questionable game design choices, and an abysmal UI. I feel kinda bad ripping it like I have but it's just not a fun game right now. I understand it's EA and the world in which we live means games like this will continue to be a thing. But the publisher should absolutely not have put out a media blitz in the grand strategy community like they obviously did. The game is unbalanced, frustrating, and just not fun. Could it become great? Absolutely, and I hope it does. Is it there now? Not even close. And after a friend's review of Old World being kinda the same, and the same media blitz they did for that game I am now extremely wary of this publisher pumping out boring, frustrating, time consuming games that you can't get a refund on built up on massive hype.",1664860562,1664860562,False,5,0,0.536694347858428955,0,True,False,True

THE LONG:

""Game over man, game over! What the f^^k are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?""
-- Private Hudson, Aliens. 

THIS is Terra Invicta, in a nutshell. The aliens are here, and it's up to YOU to figure out what to do about it. Your options are almost endless. The uncertainties equally so. Every nation on earth, every planet and many moons and asteroids in the solar system are the battlefield. It is three games of three-dimensional chess going at once, and half the time you're blindfolded. 

Imagine if, say, XCOM, Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron, EVE and, oh, Geopolitical Simulator and an orbital mechanics simulator got together, and donated their code to a developer who was an avid Expanse fan.  You would get something like Terra Invicta. If this sounds a bit daunting to you, it should.  If this sounds glorious to you, it should. For it IS glorious. Varvatos Vex glorious. 

It's now. An alien spacecraft crashes to earth. That aliens are real is no longer in doubt. Just about everything else is. Who or what are they? Where do they come from? What do they want? Where do we fit in to their plans? What will humanity do?  And therein is the problem. There is no ""single"" humanity. There is a world of nations, and a world of organizations and interests of all kinds that exist within and beyond them, and they are all ""human,"" and represent some portion of humanity.  In Terra Invicta, all these exist -- in detail -- and above them there is the level of you, the player: the shadowy head of a global cabal/conspiracy/organization with one particular answer to the question of ""what shall we do?""  

In Terra Invicta there are seven factions, each pursuing a different strategy in response to the alien arrival. These range from ""the only good alien is a dead alien,"" to ""let's appease these guys and get rich and powerful doing so"" to ""screw you guys, we're leaving and taking our stuff with us.""  No matter which faction and agenda you pursue, to achieve it you will have to take control of nation states, manage them, influence them, direct their policies, draw on their resources and build networks and alliances among them, and to a certain extent, with other factions. This is the first of the great chess games in Terra Invicta -- a global geopolitical simulator that could easily be a complete and completely satisfying game in and of itself. 

To play this game you work through your council -- four to eight key individuals whom you dispatch around the world to investigate alien activity, combat alien threats, gather information on other factions, advise and direct your captive governments, suppress unrest, instigate unrest where you want it instigated, acquire and administer a host of corporations, entities, groups and organizations whose particular resources and abilities are useful to your cause; conduct sabotage and espionage, overthrow governments, seed rebellion and -- well, a lot more. Each has a unique mix of special abilities which you must balance against the others, and which level up through time. Each has their own loyalties which must be assessed and encouraged, or countered when necessary.  You will build armies, and pursue your faction's growth through war, peace, cooperation, calculation, subterfuge and assimilation. You will control national budgets and struggle to find the right balances to keep your nations stable, strong, advancing, secure and most importantly, contributing to your faction exactly what it is you need them to give.  

The second chess game is what you do with what the first chess game gives you.  This includes deciding what, among the many technology trees and the scores and scores of technologies between them, in which to invest. You will want all of them, but you can only invest in a few at a time. You will want to chart a path of development that ultimately leads you to extending humanity's response to the aliens -- through your faction -- into the solar system. The solar system is the board where the second chess game is played, and here is where Terra Invicta becomes more like your standard 4X game.  You will build stations, orbitals, habitats, modules, bases and settlements. You will build shipyards and docks and defenses, mines and research facilities of all kinds, sending out probes and scouting new territory, searching for and exploiting the resources required to build and maintain your growing solar empire, and ultimately, your faction's fleet -- the fleet upon which, in the final game, all depends.  All of this, as well, would be a complete game within itself, fully satisfying and full enough for many, many, many hours of play.

But wait, there's more! The third chess game is your fleet, its ships and the war. War Never Changes. But it does get more complex as technology advances and translates war into a new realm.  Here, that realm is space, and Terra Invicta does not shy away from the technical challenges and the laws of physics which govern (theoretical) combat in space. You will have to choose technologies, balance designs for different purposes, balance ships for the right mixture of delta V, fuel, power, armor, weapons, countermeasures and defenses and specialist tasks. You will have to support, manage and direct ships and task forces not just from simple point A to B, but along multiple options for ""transfer"" -- the shorthand for the grand ballet of physics involved in moving a spaceship between planets and objects in a gravity well, all moving along their own orbits at different paces.  And, when the time comes, you will have to lead ships into battle, choose formations and execute tactics to defeat both rivals and the aliens. 

If all of this sounds immense, and immensely complex, and a bit overwhelming, well, it is.   And herein lies the double-edged sword of Terra Invicta.  If you like this sort of thing, then it's your heaven. If you don't, it's your hell. Make no mistake, this game is demanding. It will demand every bit of your brain, attention and patience. There is always ""more"" -- more than you can keep track of; more than you take in at once; more than you can do with what you have; more going on that you can't see; more choices than you know what to do with; more questions than answers (especially as you learn.) The tutorials only go so far, and the UI, while not quite as Byzantine or deep or dense as EVE's ""Spreadsheets In Space,"" IS multi-layered, sometimes not intuitive, always crowded, and will make many eyes squint at the fine print. The good news is that it's graphically pleasing (zooming in and  out of scale on the solar system map alone is fun) and with experimentation and play, you'll learn it, and there's already an abundance of online material to draw upon -- but again, for some gamers, this is too big an ask. It's also a game that demands a lot from your rig -- older, low end systems will eventually be overwhelmed at some point, and even on mid-level to higher-level systems, load times will creep ever longer towards more gamers' ""screw this"" point.  

I'm 30 hours into the game on my first run, and still figuring things out and nowhere close to an ""end."" And I'm definitely in ""just one more turn"" mode.  And as a last comment, for a game just out, it is extraordinarily smooth and polished. I've not had a single crash or snag. And the developers clearly love this game and the community, and are posting updates in days, not weeks.

The tutorial is completely useless, so I'd recommend watching some gameplay of someone playing it on youtube - you wouldn't be spoiled too much. Find something long and unedited specifically (eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f_XZgcuW1I), and if you like the look of it, it plays exactly how it looks. The UI is..... not great for some things - the main gameplay loop works well, but fleet management is a bit of a disaster

This is a long, slow paced, clunky and very crunchy game which more than anything else makes you *feel* like you're in charge of the defence of earth from the invasion of aliens. Because of that I'm willing to excuse a lot of the issues here - its essentially a full realistic detailed simulation of the invasion of the solar system by aliens, completely with hundreds of bodies, all the planets, real time tactical spaceship combat, a detailed and reasonably fun political simulation, full solar system colonisation, space construction, a decent ship designer, realistic orbital transfers etc etc. This is given to you in a way that is incredibly freeform and leaves you with a gigantic sandbox with one small problem: there's aliens and they're trying to kill us

Tech is particularly satisfying, and was one of the things that was always most disappointing to me about something like stellaris. Researching a new piece of tech is revolutionary in terms of your ability to do something in the game, and this hasn't stopped after 32 hours - I still *need* that next bit of tech to do xyz, and that's an incredible step up compared to every other game. There are almost no +5% to weapon damage modifiers. The way that it works overall is genius in my opinion - there's global research which is the big ideas - fusion, AI, advanced plasma physics, space colonisation, the social consequences of aliens arriving etc, that all factions can contribute to. These all have extremely cool flavour text associated with them. This unlocks faction specific projects, which is what only you research - and these tend to be the actual modules, like lasers, settlement habs, fusion power modules and more efficient engines

I can see why people are annoyed at the councillors in the midgame, and the general obtuseness of the game is a problem - you'll have to google some things, and go ""huh I had no idea that was a mechanic"". There's also definitely some slightly annoying balancing issues around eg hab destruction and space asset seizure, which made me quite annoyed. But none of it is game breakingly bad (so far?), and a lot of this can be mitigated. With some tech, you can make certain actions a lot harder for the enemy factions, and it doesn't seem to be too difficult to kneecap them in the midgame

People compare it to xcom, but its more like a larger scale ck2 mixed with a hard scifi theme, and a competent rts with clunky controls. If you love space, and want to be put in charge of a realistic simulation of what would happen if hostile aliens arrived today and the social/political/military consequences of that - then this game is absolutely amazing. If you don't have a moderate tolerance for clunky UIs, a little too much micro here and there, working around the occasional balance issue, and overall a tremendously slow paced game, then good golly i have no idea how you even made it to this page

Fundamentally it works. It all feels very fresh. There are a lot of mechanics (nearly all of them) that have no direct equivalent in other games, which is part of what makes it so obtuse - nothing is familiar at all. This game is going to be pillaged for ideas like there's no tomorrow by the competition - which doesn't simply exist because this game is incredibly ambitious and mostly succeeds. Thematically its exactly what I wanted from stellaris but never got, and the flavour text and tone is incredibly well done overall",1664821111,1664821111,True,27,0,0.739982724189758301,0,True,False,True

It's an insanely deep game that will require a lot of guide writing from the player-base (I'm not sure a simple tutorial will hack it).

Not obvious things that took me a while to cotton on to (could be useful to potential buyers, or maybe I'm a bit thick):

1.) Try not to micro-manage, even though the game sucks you into doing that. Use those ""permanent assignment"" and ""repeat"" buttons and just have one or 2 active councillors every turn. I was hating the fiddlyness of the game until I learnt to do that. It's a game that has long timescales as opposed to instant results.

2.) In the same vein don't obsessively check the org market every turn, just when the pop-up says it's been refreshed.

3.) To start with, concentrate on one task at a time, don't try and do everything or you will go mad (just like I did).

The above is mostly in response to the negative reviews I've seen of the game. I suspect the reviewers either got mired in the details or were hoping for instant response to player actions. It's very much a ""slow burn"" type game that takes a long time for plans to develop and if you aren't into that sort of game then you won't like it.

starts off with an incredibly fun political Powergrab game that reminds me heavily of Party-Board Games that you play with your friends. 
Do you work together taking over countries making alliances or do you backstab them at the most opportune situation?

But Board Games end after 2 hours, here it is the main priority for some hours. 
Until a different game gets added on top.
Suddenly you expand into space trying to build infrastructure to combat the aliens.
Building satellites and colonies and shipyards around dozens of planetoids preparing your Species for a fight against alien Invaders.
All of that in a fun new scenario in which Humanity is not suddenly on par with space faring Aliens with hundreds of years of advantages.

But still you have to spend 70% of your time managing the political situation on earth.
Regardless how far you expand, the situation on Earth remains in Flux requiring your constant attention executing the same actions turn after turn just to keep status quo.
The loyalty mechanic only adds to this. 
All of these shiny stations and colonies and ships you build? A simple Take Over Operation by a Hostile Counselor and it's now an asset of the enemy. Some 50 hostile Counselors potentially executing these ops, no matter how small the chance, the vital Shipyard you build for 2 years will be taken over by a very unsatisfactory game mechanic.

There are things subtle and not so subtle in the gameplay that left me enraged at how much invisible assistance the AI is both receiving and exploiting to make this game unnecessarily frustrating.  Worse, as others have indicated the tutorial is one of the worst ever created and the overall game play is slow.  

Right now the game designers are definitely working on making adjustments and hopefully they'll look over all the reviews as I've noted that many are very negative.  And its a combination of so many issues.

First, the tutorial is almost unusable.  The UI is not very good and the tutorial does an extremely poor job of showing players all of the possible operations early.  I was trying to build my first orbital station and couldn't figure out how because the tutorial and the codex never said ""go to the orbital view, click on Earth and you'll see a box at the bottom of the screen.""  I had to find that instruction via the wiki that is not in the game.

Second, the AI both is not logical, and it cheats.  I built a small cluster of nations in Asia that I'll admit produced a fair amount of money and boost.  However, I largely tried to ignore/avoid the other factions as I built up and raced to get ships in space (and that is going to be very slow due to the costs.  A small station takes 30 boost or so to make and your first ship is likely to take 440+ if you assemble it on Earth and boost it into orbit.)  But while I'm trying to stay out of the fighting and limiting myself to just 10 or so nations, my control is constantly attacked.  Not just by my direct rival faction, but factions that I should at least be neutral to.  It got to the point where I had a couple of councillers who had the job of re-establishing my fortified control every 6-9 months to prevent constant crackdowns and purges.  Most of African and South America wasn't even controlled, but they kept coming for me.

Third, and this is my issue with prejudices.  Eventually in one game I needed more money and boost so I started trying to control the US.  I soon discovered that the programmers have a huge Euro-centric attitude that has 2 major problems.  First, the US gets completely blasted by people trying to force it into insurrection.  There is a unity/stability level with 0.0 being perfectly peaceful and something above 8 being complete government breakdown.  Once I had 3 of the US control points under my control that unity level went up 2.5 every 2-3 turns, always from other councillers stopping by to incite an insurrection.  I'd fly in 2-3 of my people to bring it down, only for it to jump right back up and keep climbing.   It was an impossible situation and extremely enraging.  Especially since there were no attempts to take control, just to spoil my control.  HOWEVER, on the other side one of the computer factions had control of the EU early and it quickly started folding other nations into it, yet the stability level there never went up.  It was locked in at 0.5.  So that faction quickly became the most powerful in the game thanks to the fact that the AI didn't fight each other... EVER.

There is an idea for a great game here, but the AI is beyond junk and needs a complete overhaul before I'd say it was even tolerable for multiple games.   Add in the level of effort required to get even one ship in orbit and this right now is not a playable game, but more of an interesting exercise in how to annoy most potential fans.",1664811764,1664811764,False,5,0,0.419144481420516968,0,True,False,True

It's probably the best 4x made to date if you're on the market of shadow organization/ world conquest. There are however some little things that could be better.

Here are the Pros:
-Game runs well. I was expecting a lot more slowdown and many more issues but apart from long load times whenever you boot up your save, the game runs well and quick.

-Strategic freedom. You can tackle any situation however you want. Wanna conquer the world? there's a bunch of techs that unite countries into larger mega countries. Wanna stabilize the African continent and create an impregnable mega continent? sure thing. Oh did I mention you can colonize space?

-Fun covert operations. The way you influence the world is through your advisors. It's pretty fun to watch them go about changing the public opinion of certain countries so you can flip them to your side. Or murder an enemy agent. Or steal their tech, ruin their tech progress in one field etc...

The cons:
-This is a long game. I'm at 50 hours and I'm barely starting to get invaded. Most of my tech is tier 2, halfway to tier 3. I lost a ton of progress in one of my saves when I got to the invasion phase. The aliens dropped down. I couldn't deal with their landing ships so I glassed the regions. Cool beans. Except that they went for my space assets. Suddenly I can't leave Earth, any station I build gets instantly shot down. Cool, I have some earlier saves that'll still have me at a decent position. Spent a good 10 hours building my habs, researching platform tech and weaponry and building a fleet of two destroyers so I'm ready for the invasion. Well turns out this time around the aliens declared war on another mostly pacifist faction, take two undefended regions with access to water. Swim all the way to the European union and gobble up France, Benelux and Italy withing 60 days, with nothing I could do on my side. now the Aliens have nukes...Great.

-The AI is all over the place. I capture some of their countries only to find that the AI was running max Spoils. Suddenly, my newly acquired Russia is basically only 28 nukes, three military lvl 3.5 tanks with no navies, lvl 7 inequality and a totalitarian regime. It had, until that point, been run 50/50 by the Protectorate and the Resistance so two factions that would in theory want to try and keep their assets in working order.
In this save, the Resistance has entirely disappeared. They have space assets but I don't know how they are able to pay their upkeep. On Earth they barely have a few small countries in Africa, no major country. The Academy, Initiative and Project Exodus are kinda scattered about fighting over scraps in Europe and India. And, ironically, the Protectorate and the Servants, the two factions I've been endlessly harassing with multiple assassinations, Project sabotages, coups and occupations are the ones thriving.

-The diplomacy system is incredibly obtuse.I tried making the central american federation with Guatemala and the other central american states and couldn't because my ally had two states and the senior state proposing the federation needs to be touching the territory to federate. So now I spent a few months telling my ally that that's my turf. Aaaaaaand I still can't federate. Because some time needs to pass. Ok I'll check back later. When I do I can't federate. Because even though they have no armies some of the states are at war among themselves. Ok then I'll just peace them out. Aaaaaand I need to wait again. Ok now I can federate? nope because they aren't allied. Ok make them allied. Can I federate now? yep, one at a time. Oh and don't forget. if you happen to lose any of these territories you're gonna have to wait again.

-Bit of a pet peeve but. Playing as Humanity First shouldn't I be the priority target for the alien invasion? They went after one of the pacifist factions, wrecked their stuff and got a nation with nukes. I couldn't do a thing because I had to rival the nation where the landed and then declare war on them (which as said before, diplomacy takes time). I am these guy's sworn enemy, I'm at war with their faction, I should have instant declare war on territories they control. I neighbored the territories too and positioned my troops to meet them counting on this fact. I believe that both Humanity First and the Resistance should have options to act in these cases, especially if I have a fleet in low Earth orbit.

-Some basic QoL stuff. Why can't I filter the Technology tree? Yes there's a search bar but I want to see all my Propulsion options in one screen. On the topic of technology, some basic game play explanation would go a long way, something like ""This engine line is the cheaper fuel consumption line with lowered thrust but also lowered weight"".
I'd also like to be able to see and filter known asteroids or planet locations by resource. It's a bit taxing to click the hundreds of rocks in the solar system to find one with higher rare metals output.

Conclusion: While I do have a lo of negative things to say, I very much believe that this is a great game. It really sucks you in but it also sucks your time and you are going to fail at some point if you don't know what's coming. 

It's an amazing management game. Love watching countries grow. Loved watching Mexico become a stable nation and booming economy. You really feel that you're building an economy and strengthening your assets. The subterfuge aspect is super well done, you do feel like a shadow organization pulling the strings of the nations you're in control. But the AI still needs a lot of work. The other factions felt more like they were trying to mess with everyone's plans rather than pursuing their objectives and this is an issue. If by the time the aliens decide to invade you're the only one that's ready then it's game over. And as I already mentioned that a lot of time down the drain. I am putting TI in the shelf for now. It hooked me so much that I entirely neglected my personal duties and it's with great frustration that I'm abandoning that run.",1664810319,1664810319,True,2,0,0.540918171405792236,0,True,False,True

You set yourself a goal or adopt one of 8 Factions goals and play over and over again optimizing countless little screws in a race against the other factions and the alien incursion.

Opening the tech tree will give you nausea, but you quickly realize which screws are the important ones to twist and turn and start getting a grip, then you realize how little you actually know and just how large the scope actually is.

One thing to note is that it's not a very reactive game. All the important things are a slow burn at first, for example developing a nations economic profile to suit your needs, e.g. fixing americas inequality to boost science output or gaining control of nations just to abandon them and exploit for spoils.

It's hard to believe this is an ""Early Access"" game- you can play it to completion and there is SO much stuff here.  If you are a science-nerd and enjoy space stuff there is a lot of cool stuff here.  And that's only after you spend several years advancing 2022 tech to the point where you can explore more of the Solar System.  It's a difficult game but after an initial 5-or-so hour run I had mostly figured out the game so I started a new one and I'm having a blast.  It's not for everyone- if you have a short attention span or don't enjoy micromanagement or hard sci-fi- this might not be for you.  But personally if I was making my perfect game: it would look a lot like this.  Check out some Let's Plays and you'll either think ""Hot Damn I'm buying this"" or ""This is not my cup of tea"".  Also- modding is going to be bit with this game, already heard about people planning to make The Expanse Overhauls where instead of aliens it would be Earth, Mars, and the Belt dealing with each other.  Amazing game and the team is dropping updates nearly everyday.

1. An utter slog of an early game, caused entirely by very little to do. Once you are firmly established, you have very few levers to actually pull, and it becomes a lot of ""next turn, next turn, next turn"" with your councilors assigned to the same set of tasks over and over again. Most players will probably never reach the space part of the game, simply due to lack of patience.
2. The tutorial is abysmal, and so are the tooltips. The game is complex, and it hides a lot of its complexity by denying you access to information. For example: Which technologies give you boost increasing projects? ""Gee, I dunno"" the Game says ""Why don't you go watch a let's play of Terra Invicta and find out."" I can understand wanting to hide spoiler information, but sometimes it is entirely necessary to give players certain pieces of information so they can make useful decisions in the short and long term. It'll probably take you dozens of playthroughs in order to fully figure out this game, and not because you aren't good enough or smart enough. It hides vital information, for no reason other than to be obtuse.

There is a great deal of potential, but it is held back by certain design decisions. I hear a lot of excuses on the forums - ""But they're the long war devs, it is SUPPOSED to be like this"". You want a better version of this game? Go play the ""XCOM Files"" mod for the original XCOM. That actually has an early game with variety, and the devs created an online wiki that doesn't hide anything from you. That's how Terra Invicta should be. 
EDIT 1: At present, and I do mean at present, the online wiki for the game is incomplete; and information online is sparse to say the least. The Devs are aware of it, so this will likely change over time. However, this review is for today and not tomorrow.

The core gameplay loop I could understand from the in-game tutorial, but things like constructing space stations/outposts was a bit confusing. I've been accustomed to bad UIs & tutorials ala Slitherine games, but honestly, Terra Invicta's UI & tutorial is not that bad if you put in the time to read how everything interacts with eachother. The huge amount of detail though makes it easy to get lost or miss certain gameplay mechanics, like orgs.

My only other complaint so far is that I don't have enough time to play this game! It is quite fun, but I've been playing only a few years until 2026, and it's taken me a dozen hours, when I'm understanding that a campaign could last up to 50 years. Not complaining too hard since early game is fun if you like geopolitics, but perhaps more automation in turns or an option to speed up the game further once you've gotten a steady flow to the early game could be nice.

This is a long long long game with a lot of replability for each factions goals.

If your on the fence about the game check out the devs roadmap and track it.  If its not what your looking for but you like the idea now keep an eye on it.

The devs did indicate that the code was written for multiplayer down the road, but I wouldnt expect that until its after Early Access.

I think the big selling point for me was a newtonian physics based game play based on current, plausable and theoretical technology.

I dont think its worth disliking the game simply because this is the only game offering this type of game play and its very addicing if you like it.

It is sad that in this day and age I commend a new game for actually being playable. I am writing this review because the game crashed for the second time this hour and I lost about 15 minutes of play time, so the game is not great. If Steam had a side-ways, "" just ok"", thumb review button, I would use it. If you are thinking about buying it, wait for it to be on sale. This game is a political simulator game, so if that doesn't appeal to you do not buy it.

The paid reviewers can write the good reviews, I will write about what I don't like and what needs to be improved.

1. Too many political points on the map causes 90% of them to be individually unimportant. This is just a time sink and is there to give the AI a chance against the player. The AI can scan every point in the game and out maneuver the player by sheer numbers. 
2. It would be better if you had a small team of people that traveled the globe to do only the most important things. How the game is built now, your counselors spend most of their time doing preventative maintenance tasks, and it is a grind.  Nothing in the game seems to spread naturally, only manually. If I take over the USA with a very high support rating, there is no bleed over into Canada or Mexico. The game does not encourage player to take over an area. The only reason I took over North America was for my sanity and to save myself literally thousands of mouse clicks. No joke, it will save you thousands of mouse clicks to stay in one area.
3. Important worldwide factors are not shown by the UI. I could not figure out why my GDP was randomly dropping, no matter how much I invested in the economy, but I learn the world economy was going down. Is there a screen to show the economy or world pollution? I do not know. I can not find the information or any graphs. I know there is a ""world economy"" in the background because the USA took a 890 billion, with a ""B"", hit to the economy after North Korea nuked Russian, and then Russia launched about 4 nukes in a row. But some how Canada didn't take a bad hit and its per-person income is passing the USA even though it was about 18% behind at the start.
4. Nations should have some memory and world events should take a more realistic pace. When a faction takes over a country it should be hard to declare war. Or, at least there should be pros and cons for the AI and player (maybe that elusive ""world economy"" stat will appear). Early in the game, the UK invaded Venezuela, Russian invaded Nicaragua, the EU invaded Russia (resulting in constant nuclear war), Australia invaded Venezuela, UK invaded Cuba, and Germany invaded Russia (not a EU member in my game). Every turn I sit there and go, ""Huh? What? Why? No! But, that makes no sense!"" A faction taking over a country should not give it instant, 100% control. In real life, if a shadow organization took over the USA (wink, wink) they would get nothing done because of the bureaucrats, historic relations, and national memory. Sure you might be able to invade Iraq, Afghanistan, blockade Cuba, sanction Russia and Venezuela, and have a shadow drug war in Central America, but the hypothetical Shadow Organization would not be able to nuke Germany on day 1 of taking over.

I wanted to like this game. I love games with steep learning curves like HOI4, Stellaris, Xcom etc. In those games you can play and learn from your mistakes. They have ALOT of tool tips and information in the game you can read. 

This game however, just denies you any information on how to actually play. I united North America, had colonies on Mars and the moon, was saving some resources to build atleast like 1 space ship. And then, Aliens invade the planet, take over Russia, declare war on me and then nuke me into oblivion. 

The fact that it takes at MINIMUM 5 HOURS before you are actually able to build your first spaceship is ridiculous. You will spend most of the early game clicking ""Next Turn"" and wondering why your economy is shrinking even though its the only thing you are investing in. 

You will be very lucky if you ever colonize any other planet without a nuclear war destroying the the earth and making your brain implode in frustration.

Which on the surface level, that's what it looks like. But it's not. It's more XCOM then anything else. It's the kind of game that'd I say the best way to describe it, is to pick it up and play it your self.

The game does have a tutorial if you play as the resistance, now it is a text tutorial (meaning you'll do a lot of reading) but it is worth it. However, if you're more of a visual learner, I would recommend the Youtuber PerungamingAU, he has an amazing step by step play through as Humanity First. It's also edited down to cut out all the down time so it's quick too.

Now my thoughts on the game? I love it, this game is so far everything I wanted XCOM to be (outside of tactical combat) the feeling of becoming a shadow organization that slowly takes over the world to lead it to a better future just really sparks that dopamine rush.

My only complaints are about the UI, specifically the way assigning missions and such work, it feels like a mobile game. I wish the game had more right clicking features, say you right click a country and a drop down of options appear etc.

Same goes for building orbitals. Gosh I wish there was an undo feature, the amount of times I accidentally the wrong module and have to waste precious boost and extra construction time to swap it out really irritates me.

There's a game I played called ""They Are Billions"" that has a feature that if time is paused and you delete a building you placed down, you get fully refunded without wasting anything. But, if you accidentally un-pause and construction starts, then you're penalized for messing up. I would love to see that here.

It's very evident that the developers really put a ton of thought into making it as realistic a scenario as possible.  The tech tree feels right, the struggle to understand & address the alien threat is very satisfying.  To me, learning the game is the most interesting part.  Playing the game for the first time really feels like I'm trying to quickly formulate a strategy to wrestle control of as much of the world's resources as possible to push toward my faction's goals.  Each new technology and storyline development forces you to consider new variables, threats, & opportunities in relation to your current approach.

For example, in the beginning of the game I unlocked tech to build a space station in Earth's atmosphere.  Initially, I was puzzled because I didn't know why I would WANT to waste resources on a space station when all of the resources were on the moon/Mars/etc.  Also, my spies were showing that all of the other factions were RACING to get to the moon specifically for the resources there.  So I built a small station and tacked on a small dock in case I wanted to build a ship at some point.  Then I unlocked research lab tech and realized that if I added research modules to a station in Earth's orbit you get a research boost AND additional benefits like buffs to your GDP growth, military buildup, propaganda campaigns, alien activity detection, etc.  I built a bunch of stations to accrue those buffs and it REALLY catapulted me ahead over time.  The freaking AI factions saw this and later got the tech to start STEALING THEM.  I was like no effing way - so I researched space marines and started capturing them back (plus a few more) and arming them with garrisons of marines.  Learning things like this really immerses me into the scenario and provide satisfying potential to set your own goals to further the cause you pick initially.

Great game, watch Perun's playthrough to get a good understanding. Perun also is YouTube's new darling for Defense logistics reports from Ukraine so hes a good communicator of complex info.

Anyways, the start of the game has little to do with the alien invasion. You must choose one of many factions and ally real life nation states to your cause. Everything has been rendered, including the war in Ukraine and Taiwan's special status with the PRC. Space is a big place and any moves you make in that realm are defined by the support you have at home

I personally think that there needs to be changes to the ai and other balancing stuff. Of course I doubt the developers will read this but for the people that want to know some of the problems. And I know that things are due to change.

First of all, there is no indication of why the other factions dislike you, And what I have seen there is no way of improving relations. As humanity, first everyone hates you, even the resistance which have similar goals ish.

Secondly, there are some problems I find in defending outposts, settlements etc. while space stations actively partake in battle with the station defenses if they are built. stations on planets and asteroids aren't really defended against bombardments even if defenses are built. The other thing about space defense is that there seems to be no way to defend stations against chancellors unless you have your own chancellor in that station and actively defend assets and the other defend mission. not even marine barracks seem to help.

Thirdly, Spaceships are really inconsistent with their use of the defense lasers. I had a ship with 3 point defense lasers and none and I mean none of them fired. Other times 1 is enough for the entire fleet.

Lastly, the refuel costs for ships are waaay to high. I finally had built a fleet that can defend/attack alien spaceships so I went and attacked but nope the enemy had more kps and fled. so i go back and refuel bla bla bla. nope i need 20 k water to get 180 kps in other words no i can't attack the alien fleet.

For me, the globe sim and management aspects (regressed in modern X-COMs) were always what made X-COM so attractive and Terra Invicta takes that to next level (on solar system scale) while leaving the repetitive turn-based combat behind ⊂(✰‿✰)つ

It's so damn good I've played it 20 hours on my first session, even though I found other games of this type (Europa Universalis/Crusader Kings) boring to play and I often lose interest in games after 5-10 hours.

Terra Invicta is a deep and complex game, and yet I hit 0 critical bugs, it didn't crash once. Loading times are atrocious, but I don't need to scum save/load, so I forgive that.

Many reviewers cried about lack of guidance/tutorial, but it was always clear to me what I'm supposed to do, and I only consulted online guides at few strategic keypoints where i expected noob traps (such as over-commitment to Luna). Not all tooltips are perfect, but I'm generally happy with the information provided by the game interface as well as by available management features.

I recommend this one, but with the caveat that you have to be prepared to spend probably 20 hours really learning the game before you'll start to enjoy it.

Caveats, because this is early access for a reason,mostly because the UI still needs a lot of love. It's annoying to figure out how to see all the information in useful formats or find the menus to make particular choices. The learning curve is steep even with my Civ / Rimworld experience. On the space strategy layer, I needed to figure out for myself that delta-V is conceptually fuel / how far the ship can go - if you don't have enough delta-V, you aren't going to get to Mars. There is a in-game calculator built in to the ship design menu, which helps.

There's also a tactical space combat layer, which I've not even gotten into. I'm worried it will be bit much, since it seems to be aiming for the tactical realism of Total War in 3 dimensions. Which is a cool idea, but Total War doesn't have nearly the strategic layer this game is aiming for.

TL;DR: Rough around the edges, clunky ui, but very playable and engaging

Terra Invicta is a game about aliens coming to our solar system and humanities reaction to it. You play as one of 8 factions representing the different reactions to this first contact and your objective in the game is related to your faction. Some want to fight alien invasion (classic Independence Day style resistance movement), others want to submit to them, some want to escape the solar system to get away from them etc. The other factions are your frenemies throughout the rest of the game. 

But how does it play? The game is, broadly speaking, broken up into 2 parts. In the beginning you are trying to gain control of various nation states of the world in an espionage heavy way. Since you play as an illuminati-style secret society/ ideology with no defined borders or headquarters, you play through agents that are aligned with you that you can send on different tasks throughout the world in order to gain more power for your faction and to hinder other factions. For example you might be couping a country to gain access to its resources, attempting to arrest an agent of another faction, spreading propaganda for your cause etc all on one turn. This feels very similar to games like Twilight Struggle and other cold-war espionage games. And while this is happening the aliens are doing mysterious things on Earth and in orbit which you've gotta keep an eye on.

Once you gain enough power and resources to send material into space the game evolves into its second phase. You begin to prospect different planetary bodies for resources, found orbital stations, and found outposts on other worlds to get their resources. You cant get everything you need on Earth to create a space navy (at least not cheaply) so you need to mine and defend outposts all over the solar system so that you have the resources needed to have a presence in space.

The space naval system is very hard sci-fi; ships have a limited amount of fuel (noted in kps/deltaV for you ksp fans) which is used both to transfer between different stellar bodies AND maneuver in combat. If you use all your fuel in combat you can be stuck floating in space and vice versa. In order to keep your navy operational all over the system you NEED supply depots to refuel/resupply. Consider that it can take 2+ years for a ship to travel between just Earth and Mars (especially if you are trying to save fuel with a good transfer window) and this process can become quite complex. 

So whats the bad news? First off the game is very early access; menus are clunky/intuitive, balance/ pacing feel very strange (overall the game is very slow, expect to spend roughly 1 IRL hour per ingame year. Latest I have gotten is just before 2040, which feels about at the midgame), the tech tree lags the game when its open for some reason, the perspective on different astral bodies in the solar system mode is impossible to visually gauge relative distance/position to one another (similar to looking at a constellation map all bodies all appear to be on a flat dome), and other associated QoL gripes. 

With the above complaining over, what are the best parts of the game? 
- The espionage system is VERY fun, honestly it could be an entire game on its own if you took the aliens out
- The space combat is very cool. Very steep learning curve for creating an effective space navy
- Space logistics is deeply engaging. Having the right ships, in the right place, at the right time, with the right stuff, will be an enduring challenge in this game
- The writing. Every faction has unique flavor text for alien encounters and every tech has some voice acting and a ton of writing associated with it that helps the world come alive",1664690491,1664690491,True,144,0,0.922677993774414063,0,True,False,True

however, While i think it is objectively a good game. maybe even a great game, after giving it nigh on 15 hours so far I can't say it's one that i actually enjoy personally. Despite this i can see the good, i can see the quality, and that's why i'm still recommending it.

the first thing you should know is that the game is ridiculously slow right up until the point that it isn't, and at that point it's so fast that barely anything is makes much sense. And i think that's where I personally fall off. not that it's slow, or that its complicated, or complex: I play 4X and paradox games all the time that doesn't bother me; no what bothered me is how convoluted the information was, the fact that key events would trickle on the news feed that would get lost among the 100 useless things., How diplomacy honestly seems nonexistent, and strange limitations seem to hinder you from doing what you want ( Like why are the federations predetermined? why is some diplomatic actions locked behind a tech tree? why are most of the factions just really the same thing?)

the game feels like infinity trapped in a mason jar. it feels like a paradox game one second, and a cheap board game the next.

I have enjoyed most of my time with the game, and for the most part I agree that it has immense potential. However the game currently has too many problems to overcome for me to really seriously recommend it to others.

My main issues, in no particular order, are as follows:

1) The Tech Tree is abysmal. Trying to plot a course from tech to tech without a detailed guide is like trying to cross a minefield blindfolded and drunk. There's not a lot to really help you along short of sitting down for a few hours just to read through the tech trees. The worst part is that most of the technologies feel pointless. I've had the tech to build space corvettes for over a year but still can't actually build anything because I'm missing some other technology the game refuses to tell me about. Many of the technologies could be combined and streamlined and it would make this aspect of the game feel more rewarding and less confusing while also allowing for certain advancements to happen in a more logical order.

2) The political side of the game is honestly tedious, opaque, and frustrating. Not being able to directly perform most actions makes getting the results you want feel more frustrating than they really should be. On top of this pretty much every AI faction feels like they are out to cut your throat regardless of their end goals, even worse, there's little sense of tension because there's never a point where you or any of the AI can feel like they are secure. More often than not having a control point or station taken from you just makes you groan in annoyance than feel like you've been bested by some great feat of espionage. On the flip side your own actions on the political side of things can feel incredibly random, with little information available to you and no way to gain a real sense of the politics or goals of the AI factions. 

Having better ways (either missions or game settings) to have better visibility of the AI's plans would greatly help the political side of things. Additionally giving players more direct control of at least their interactions with the AI factions, especially for diplomacy would give the political game far more interesting, and more manageable. I do think that the ability of councilors to take control of space stations and Habs should be removed and left in the realm of ship-based marines and other sorts of direct action, they are too difficult to otherwise manage.

Armies feel mostly pointless, and could simply be abstracted out quite easily. You can use them to take over other countries by force, but half the time it's faster and easier to just use councilors to do the same. You can eventually also fight aliens with them, but they don't seem to be required to fight them either.

As an additional, separate point, Organizations feel flavorless and pointless. It rarely feels advantageous to take some of the incredibly expensive ones over a significantly cheaper one that provides only marginally fewer bonuses. It would be nice if organizations felt more substantial and provided more concrete benefits beyond a few basic stat increases and a few mission types.

3) The story desperately needs work. There are plenty of screens that provide flavor text, which mostly ends up being the same thing over and over again, usually something vague and flavorless. This is especially bad for anything related to the aliens, I'm pretty sure just about every investigation you do has the same ""Yep, here be aliens, enjoy this minor research boost!"" text on it which just makes the whole thing feel weightless. As a counterpoint, the research screens are overflowing with quotes and flavor text and lines read out loud, none of which actually seems to tell you how to actually implement what you just researched. On top of that the line readings are usually incredibly long and completely irrelevant. I believe when researching Lasers early on some random lady sings an entire verse from ""This Little Light of Mine"", it's silly and is clearly meant to imitate the same function in other strategy titles, but the lines are poorly chosen.

4) Finally, before I rant for far too long, the User Experience is just awful. Hunting for information is either tedious or impossible with key information being hidden three menus deep off of a sub-menu. Tool-tips are incredibly verbose but rarely tell you anything really informative, it leads to a constant feeling of disorientation even well into the game. The game also rarely provides (or fails to explain) quick and easy ways to interact with items. For example I can bring up a list of all of my nations, but I don't appear to be able to interact with that list. Resources seem to be measured annually, monthly, and daily for no reason and the UI changes which it references with little rhyme or reason. For example, organization income/costs are measured monthly, while the UI for resources as a whole is measured daily. You can order a long-range probe to a distant planet or asteroid that will take a year or more to arrive, but I don't for the life of me know where to go to get a status update on the probe before it arrives. The notifications bar is so cluttered and full that it may as well be useless most of the time, it seems to provide notifications for things that provide a pop-up anyways but don't clear themselves when the main pop-up is closed. Some information is only provided in the bar, but with the rest of the clutter it is easily missed and often horribly out of date if it ever is found.



In conclusion, despite the many issues I have above, there's clearly a good, fun game here. The concepts are amazing, but the execution needs a lot of polish. Much of the game could really use an editor to go through and cut out or combine extraneous bits, especially in the tedious early game politics sections. The game also desperately needs a UI overhaul to make everything more readable and useful. I also think the space side of the gameplay should really get going more rapidly, players should have to take direct control of the launches to the moon, or mars, or whichever other body they are travelling to instead of it being automated. Start us off with very basic interplanetary ships that are unarmed and vulnerable but at least are interactive. But constantly being teased with new ship parts you can't use because you missed the hidden Turbo Encabulator tech or because you haven't put in enough points to pick the next global research item is just silly. Finally, the political side of things could use some more direct control functions to make this section more involving for the player.

TLDR: It's a fun game with a lot of potential, but it needs a lot of work right now to reach anywhere near that potential.

But this game has promise and once you start understanding how things connect and start unlocking space it's quite an engaging game.

Combine the frankly horrible UI with this and the frankly absurdly poor resource economy (I had .03 monthly income of influence starting out and most missions and events need 12-50) and you have a terribly frustrating and unintuitive game.

The good:

1. The game seems very stable and there were no game breaking bugs in my playthrough.
2. The role-playing aspect of the game is strong. I love the idea of steering my faction towards their own unique victory, or, in the case of the Servants, betraying everybody to the alien menace (those nations couldn't really govern themselves properly anyway, could they?)
3. The game feels large with the ability to scroll out into space and build habs/spaceships to defend the skies.

The bad:

1. The tech tree is a mess and it's impossible to know in many cases which tech is better than another when attempting to put spaceships together. It can be really hard to figure out which one to choose because the tech unlocks are gated behind a secondary global research system so the path forward is obfuscated.
2. There are many long periods where you are just passing time, waiting for something interesting to happen, and these can last far longer than they should, with your councilors doing the same missions over and over.
3. It takes too many repetitious clicks to assign councilors to the same missions in perpetuity once they've been moved to another country.
4. The end game can devolve into endless crackdown and purge attempts every time you assign your councilors, and the enemy AI likes assassinating your councilors, which makes for a terribly annoying time. Save scumming can be the only way to get through it, which just smacks of bad design to me.
5. Although a lot of time and effort was put into implementing space battles, getting to the point where you can build and maintain a fleet takes so long you kind of wonder why it was even put into the game. Did the DEVs spend most of their time and effort on systems that aren't going to see that much use?
6. The aliens lack a lot of flavor, and there aren't a lot of events to get to know them better.
7. Even though an event system is implemented, it's used so rarely that one wonders whether that was a feature which hasn't been fleshed out yet.
8. The dice roll system for success/failure of your councilors feels really bad. There's nothing worse than failing a roll by 0.1 of a percent. I think abstracting this away might be better because I don't really want to know how close I was to success or failure.

I'm still learning a TON of things. It's hard to understand what your priorities are and when you should be targeting getting your first fleet, or what your nations should be focusing on (military? science? economy? all of those things? global warming?)

Technology is very interesting. Shared global tech tree and individual projects to research various things that enhance just your faction or unlock a technology like ship engines for your faction. Unlocking projects isn't necessarily instant after a tech tree unlock makes them available, and you can steal the ""unlock"" from other factions, but still need to then do the research which can take a very, very long time.

But then there's a space component, including space colonization which I haven't even started to look at. Space combat seems to be the meat of the combat in this game - 13 hours in and none my earth factions have a single ship.

So far very early game (2022-2023): understanding the basics

5 hours in(2024): focusing on getting a solid hold in one of the major countries and letting go of all the minor ones you started with. USA/China/India/Russia - there's a tech for the dissolution of these countries though. Maybe start a basic space base.

10 hours in (2025-'26): Espionage and stealing all your neighbors organizations to buff up your council members. Maybe exploring who will replace an aging councilor. Building more space bases. Starting to look at the next steps of space.

15 hours in (2027+) Space warfare? alien invasion? Just getting to this point. LOTS of alien ships and bases keep getting discovered way away from earth. Most of them look big and scary. 


Below are some criticisms. Very few bugs. Most are polish related. Most or all of this may just be ignorance, and due to that i'm still giving this game a huge thumbs up. 

-Single CTD 2 hours in for me, none since in 13 hours. 

-Lots of tooltip and display bugs that i'm sure will get ironed out. 

-Very hard to see notifications and keep them filtered in a meaningful way. N key shows text for notifications but they need more customization.

-Very hard to determine worthwhile techs. The tech tree is massive and easy to look at a single tree, but very hard to understand what the implications will be of unlocking a tech. 

-Very hard to determine the pacing of this game. Do you focus on projects for you, or focus on global research for humanity? Do you fight other factions for resources or just go your own way? 

-Hard to tell replayability. Due to extremely long campaign times i'm guessing very few players will play till the end of this game, but I could be wrong.

-Automation is very annoying and little to none. Would be nice to set councilors to do something automatically based on priority. E.g. ""hostile takeover an org if one is available at 3* or with organization stat"" and ""automatically investigate the first two 'levels' of enemy councilors"". Today you can just set a single job to repeat which is not enough.

-Would be nice for a simple turn based mode. Waiting two weeks and watching things spin while you realistically have little to no practical agency is useless. Maybe make it real time for space battles but turn based for strategic mode? Really wish there was a ""process as fast as possible"" speed.

I've reached a point in the campaign where it feels the focus should now be more on space development, but the political layer has long outstayed its welcome and will continue to do so indefinitely.

I think this deserves a thumbs-up because I anticipate things can be improved (and pretty rapidly), but there's a lingering fear in my mind that the devs might fall into a sunk cost fallacy and think the council system as it exists currently needs to remain the primary component of the game throughout the entire campaign.

Honestly there's nothing really quite like it, but if I had to compare it'd be somewhat like Crusader Kings, Modern day aliens edition, with space colonisation and fleet actions tacked on.

The Good:
Unique setting, very unlike most other 4X counterparts.
Pretty stunning graphics for a ""map game""
Writing on the various story elements and techs are pretty immersive, and the voice acting adds character.

The ""Bad"" (read: nitpicks)
Game could do with some more explaning and a more hands on tutorial. A lot of the deeper systems at play aren't introduced well to the player.
Pacing, particularly from the early to midgame, feels a bit off, The frantic scramble for power eventually boils down to using your between 4 to 6 turns every 2 weeks to combat the bombined coucils of the other factions and the aliens. You do 6 actions that help you, they do roughly 40 to undermine you.
Lastly the game could potentially advise the player a bit better on when the time to take to space is. Without any pointers I apparently missed all of the mad scrambles for space resources, leaving me a powerhouse back on earth but with nothing to my name elsewhere.

Final verdict:
It's just good. If you're at all a fan of 4X titles, and willing to overcome this games learning curve, it's hard to not reccomend this title. Can't wait to see the potential once more patches and balances come in.

Also please give me back my power European Union, it was so much fun to form. I get that the cooldowns are there for balance, but damn I haven't managed to merge Italy for 4 years now due to constant meddling from the Servants.",1664648049,1664648049,True,2,0,0.52764362096786499,0,True,False,True

And somehow I don't mind, because this game has the potential to be a a massive leap for the grand strategy genre. The intricate simulation of the solar system inspires a wonderful sense of possibility, and the presentation is stunning, with a jaw-dropping seamless zoom from terran surface to a voidscape of hundreds of individually modeled asteroids, moons and planets.

The key word there though is potential. As of right now, the game suffers from major issues that make it pretty frustrating to play, to the point that I think I will wait for a more polished release. The issues that I've seen in my brief experience with the game are [b] the way it presents data [/b] and [b] UI performance [/b]

[b] Data Presentation: [/b] There are numerous areas where it's hard to tell what is going on, whether it's in terms of the situation of an individual nation, or the overall big picture of international politics. As an example, I had control over the US and started focusing on some other areas of the planet, and in just a few agent assignment turns, when I clicked on the US again it was in a state of [i]Unrest 10.0: Civil War[/i], and a few days later a coup purged all my control over the nation. I feel like there really should be warning that something dangerous like this is going on (you do sometimes get advisor hints along the lines of ""hey this place is vulnerable"", but they are inconsistent and only appear one at a time; it's not a thorough synthesis of the geopolitical situation). Not to mention the total lack of flavour - there were no special events, no news headlines, etc. [b]I'm not saying the game should attempt to directly spell out the systems' emergent storytelling, but as is you could easily miss Word War 3 happening[/b]. I really wish the game had a monthly newspaper or intelligence report that would give you the synthesis of major global events, which countries are doing well economically, etc.

For a couple more examples of poor data presentation:
[list]
    [*]When the US was in turmoil its science output was clearly much lower than before, but there was no indication what it would have been otherwise, no ""-75%: low stability"" tooltip.
    [*]I had Japan declare war on Ireland, and my Germany was forced to join as an ally. Soon after, India joined on the side of Japan. I had hoped that my control over Russia would act as a deterrent, but I found I couldn't make it join the war despite having established an alliance with Germany. There was no information why the war was happening, what it would take to obtain peace, which countries could and couldn't join. A Paradox-style warscore would have been nice. I know it's gamey, but without the game's underlying numbers being visible it all feels like a guessing game.
    [*]Speaking of war, I have no idea what's going on in combat between land armies - they have an abstract tech score and a %health and the health just sort of goes down without feedback, but also you can just retreat at any point and wait for the occupation progress to wear down the enemy, and also sometimes armies can cross the ocean which I guess has to do with navies but I'm having trouble finding where those navies are?
[/list] 

[b]UI Performance:[/b] The above issues are exacerbated by abysmal UI performance. Every time you click on a menu such as the tech tree, the list of nations, the faction intel, etc, the game freezes for seconds at a time. This is really unacceptable in such a complex game - trying to make informed decisions straight up feels like a chore. The US civil war situation could have been prevented if I occasionally looked on the nation list menu, but the UI lag makes that impractical. And the beautiful seamless zoom is also ruined by the game stuttering every time you zoom in and out.

So yeah, I don't think I'll play much more until these issues are solved. I admit, it's kinda hypocritical for me to stamp this review with a RECOMMEND. But Terra Invicta has so much potential, and is so inspiring, that I really really hope the devs can take it in the right direction. In a couple years it might easily go toe to toe with the most legendary games of the genre, such as Alpha Centauri (which is clearly being paid homage to every time a tech is invented).",1664647406,1664647430,True,2,0,0.522742807865142822,0,True,False,True

Pros
-super in depth yet believable tech tree
-nation/superstate building is fun if a little time consuming
-custom designed ships and habitats
-huge modeled solar system with orbits, transfer periods, random events, colony building etc
-ability to give ai control over certain ships in large scale fleet battles
-amusing moments (at one point i had North Korea request an alliance with South Korea)
-custom councilors give your agents a personal feel

Cons
-way to many enemy agents if you play with all 8 factions at one point i had 6 different enemy councilors trying to perform actions in Paris (not sure how to mitigate this but this is currently my biggest gripe with the game) maybe make it so detain missions last a year instead of a month which would also make it worth doing the extract mission.
-Random events are super unforgiving and the 4 choices you get for them are still entirely rng (a mechanic to spend resources to increase the odds would feel a lot better than randomly losing hab modules with no ability to prevent it)
-waiting 180 days to consolidate executive control after my crappy 1 cp African nation gets sniped with 20 days left even with defend interests and a councilor constantly surveying the location and my other agents assassinating anyone that came close made me want to pull my hair out.

In summary the game is a super enjoyable hard sci-fi look at what human colonization into the solar system would look like. There's a ton of mechanics to get into and this probably isn't aimed at someone wanting to piddle around for an hour after work. I'm reminded of eve online where at a certain point the game becomes spreadsheets in space. Now i enjoy that but if you just want a casual shoot aliens game this isn't it.

If a dev happens to see this please look at making detain missions last a lot longer (atleast 6 months preferably a year) currently you just wait 2 mission cycles and it's done so why even waste one to extract someone. And also give us more control over random events relating to stations and habitats. losing multiple modules to a smuggling ring? with no way to prevent it isn't engaging it's frustrating. you want to give the players control over the gameplay experience not take it away.

-Graphics are good. Better graphics are not needed in a tactical simulation.

-I do have a lot of fun even tho the game is very challenging

But sadly I also got a lot of negative points :
1.)
The interface for ""what changed"" is pretty simular to the one of Anno1800. This is not a bad thing but if your game  got more than 4 countries this is a desaster: 
Every country does something, every Agent does something, every Alien does something, Values change, Controll Points change, etc...  This means after one skip to the next operation phase I get about 900 Messages pop up on the left side of my screen. In Anno 1800 you get a warning because your trade route takes to long. Here I get ""head up's"" for everything. Means 900 Notifcations for half a month ingame time. 

2.)
The notification PopUps that pause your game : I do not care at all about the fact that one country declared war on another, they are back to peace again, aliens are moving. Why do I get notified? I cant do shit about it until the next operation phase anway, so why pause my game every second?. Please change it that you can 1. Disable certain popups completely and 2. Make it that you get the Notifications at the begining of your ""Turn"" like every other ""round based game"" does it since their existence. Please dont be special. Just use the running system.

3.)
-The Game is pretty balanced until its not at all anymore. The first 5 ingame years you can do stuff relatively unbothered. Doesnt mean you dont get bothered at all but it means that you are actually able to achieve things if you keep an eye on enemy movement. Not easy but doable. Now in Year 2027 The US and Russia decided to nuke themselves to irrelevance and now my ""Unified Europe"" is the arch-enemy Nr 1. for everyone. Wich leads to the following.
 I got average 14+ enemy Agents on my teritorry sabotaging me in any possible way. Can I minimize the damages they do? Yes, Im actually pretty effective doing ""counter-propaganda"" and at keeping the revolts to a minimum. But it doesnt stop. Im at year 2028 right now and wasnt able to play the game for an entire Ingame year. The AI isnt doing anything anymore besides trying to sabotage me. Their agents are not reinforcing their interest in their countries anymore. They do nothing but leaving all their diffrences aside to try and bother me. Literally the entire world is free to grab. If I only could use my agents for something else but defence. This needs to change ASAP. The game has literally no gameplay anymore at this point. The ""Kill Agent"" Option is irrelevant because even with maxed out bonuses my top agents are not able to kill theirs. Enemy Agents who stay to long in ""enemy teritorry"" should get hefty debufs if they are not in their homecountry. Basically Do a Mission in hostile teritorry and gtfo or loose your Agent.

Because of the last Problem I can't currently recomend the game at all.

If you've played XCOM and thought ""But we've only won a skirmish, they're still in space and we aren't, how can Earth survive long term?"", this game is how you solve that problem. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to play as the Illuminati, this game answers that for you.

Terra Invicta is a very fun, very deep game, comparable in level of detail and learning curve to games like Hearts of Iron IV and Children of a Dead Earth (in a lot of ways, it's basically those two games glued together while dealing with XCOM's alien invasion). It's polished for an indie title of this scale, but as I write this (three days after release in Early Access) there are many bugs and performance issues, which will hopefully be improved.

My only major complaint about the game's balance is that it's not like Hearts of Iron IV, Civilisation, Stellaris etc where different ethics and modes of governance have different strengths and weaknesses; in Terra Invicta, every governance method other than Western-style liberal democracy is a straight up weakness, any given nation is automatically much stronger if it's democratic. I consider this to be the most major weakness of the game in terms of design decisions which affect roleplay. I think I understand why the developers did it this way, maybe it was intended as a political message, but be aware if you're going into this with experience in other 4X games where you get to roleplay your ethics and gain unique advantages, this game makes it very clear that Western liberal democracies are intended/preferred/superior etc. No communist revolution against the aliens here. Another balance issue is the difficulty level - even with everything as easy as possible, it still seems almost impossible to actually defeat the aliens. I'm confident this will get patched soon though.

Despite these issues, it's very fun to play and I would highly recommend it. I intend to revisit this review a year from now and see how the game has developed in its first year of Early Access, but the devs have very much earned my trust with what I've played so far. Well worth the money, but definitely look up the first few months of play on YouTube first to make sure you understand the complexity and learning curve you're getting into.

HOWEVER, the eternal early game is god awful once the novelty of it is gone. Yes I'm a shadow government despite controlling the entirety of the EU, North America, China and most of Africa. Also the other shadow governments are impossible to knock out. They're still there, being annoying, somehow overthrowing one of my Control Points every ""turn"" and it becomes a tedious game of one of my ops assassinating every enemy op I can find knowing that they're going to be replaced in a turn or two but maybe I'll be able to control a nation for 2 turns MAYBE! There should either be a way to create a stronghold Nation, or carry out an op against a faction leader to remove the faction from the game. I don't think its fun to be in that early ""turn phase"" for so long. Or create a way to absorb your ""like-minded"" faction so you can have more ops to gain an advantage. Maybe these are mechanics and the game just failed to explain them in the Tutorial. This is all just thoughts from my first ""trial run"". I'll update it if I ever get to finishing this run or end up losing from the endless harassment of the other factions being an endless wave regardless of how many of their agents I kill.

I have bias.  I've been wanting a game that captures elements of The Expanse for so long.  There's a few games that capture the tactical space battles: Children of a Dead Earth stands alone for the simulation of orbital mechanics in combat -- Nebulous Fleet Command captures the EW and gunnery components in a brilliant way.  Though, effectively no other notable game, that I'm aware of, has a strategy/4X setting in the full solar system.  So many games include warp or hyperspace technology and throw you into a large galaxy setting; but the reality is the solar system is massive and diverse enough to be a great setting for 4X gameplay.

Now enters Terra Invicta with a map that includes most major solar system bodies and some physics elements of space travel as well.   There are orbits, lagrange points, and delta-v calculations.   Your spacecraft has mass, heat, thrust, and power concerns as you design it.  These elements have been sorely missing from other sci fi 4X games.

Yet it doesn't just give you a space based strategy setting;  much of the game actually takes place on Earth, with a setting of the modern geopolitical landscape (accuracy is subjective here, but the game starts with Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, serious political division in the USA, and a number of other conflicts/issues modeled in from the current real world).   The strategy and gameplay include common geopolitical actions, concepts, and consequences in the modeling of its mechanics.   For better or worse, the players don't control nations in a traditional gaming sense -- they are rather outsider interest groups that win influence over the core pillars of nation states, enabling the ability to guide these nations and siphon their resources for the players actual goals (which ultimately include the exoplanetary operations).

Strangely they built these mechanics and systems only to throw you into a scenario of fighting an alien invasion.  It certainly works for the game, but I'll be interested to see if the devs or mods use this game to create scenarios that are more realistic or at least non-alien in nature.   Ultimately, you can think of this as XCOM but with geopolitical/space expansion strategy instead of turn based RPG-style ground tactics.  The theme is enjoyable, but I hope for more usage of this core system in other theme applications.

Now for the negative, setting aside my bias of excitement for something that captures some elements of The Expanse.  The gameplay loop is very problematic.  The core gameplay that you as the player are doing 90% of the time is assigning your councilors/agents on missions, the basis of your effects in the game world.  This can be extremely repetitive and mundane considering how long a campaign/playthrough can take (10, 20, 50 in game years?).  While there is likely a deep strategy layer that I haven't quite figured out yet (since I seem to lose a lot right now), there are many times where I feel like I'm just biding time with my agents instead of accomplishing anything of note.   OK, I grabbed enough countries that I'm out of management points, so... what now?  Chances are so low of me achieving anything of note to disrupt my enemies' operations, so what's the point?  I can influence some of my nations resource allocations, but the gains/loss of such are fractions -- ie. multiple game years to achieve 0.005 gain in a stat that has whole numbers? 

It may be that the strategy is deep and with such long term significance that it is not immediately evident, but gameplay begins to feel like the player has little agency in the face of the alien threat and the tools we do have for the first portion of the game are mind numbingly repetitive.    It also takes a significant amount of time to get far in a playthrough due to the amount of clicking of interfaces/assigning agents every round.  When things go belly up in a playthrough, it's a massive blow to the players' time.  

Example: through a concerted effort of public support and diplomacy, I gained control of Russia and the US -- notable powerhouses in the world -- this took the better part of 5 hrs and 1-2 years in-game.  Suddenly, two enemy factions waltzed in and yanked control from me.  I'm left wondering what I even achieved in-game during those many hours.  

I believe there's still many layers and system to the game that I don't understand yet that is the cause of my loss there.  However, the problematic part for the review here is that I'm not sure if the gameplay loop, as is, feels rewarding and worthwhile.   This could be mitigated by a system that allows me to auto-pilot my councilors by giving certain direction or focus; or less pop up notifications; less 'HEY stop and think about this' events; and maybe more tools/methods to affect change, even in the early game.

Gameplay loop concerns aside, I still am greatly enjoying this game, but as I noted -- I have some bias.  If you have the patience and interest to learn a complex 4X system that stands out clearly from the rest, then definitely give this one a try.

This is a LONG game. Like, holy shit, long. There are some elements that can be quite frustrating at times. The AI's motives aren't always logical, other times it appears to have prescience as well as a frustrating ability to take over areas that you could not take were the roles reversed. You will mostly be using your Counselors to move about the planet putting out brushfires and/or taking control over regions; or preventing the AI from taking over certain areas. There is a ""story"" that you can follow, or you can do your own thing. Eventually you will be forced to return to the plot of the story to advance certain triggers in the game. At 14 hours, I have yet to even land on the moon, so I expect that driving the alien menace out of the Sol System will take months.

It's as if the game can't decide if it's turn-based or not, is the best way I can put it.

The orbital and earth layers fight for the lion's share of your limited attention, making the game feel a lot more complicated than it really is.

honestly, the game should just have been straight-up turn-based, I think it would have enforced more rigid design and brought everything together in a more cohesive manner

- Not multiplayer. Not a real drawback, but the idea of cooperating with a friend against alien invasion in grand strategy is rather appealing. Sort of a missed opportunity.

Not because the game is bad. The game is great. But so far, I have come across 2 big bugs that have made me lose hours of progress.

Firstly, after 5 or so hours, all my keyboard inputs stopped working. This is more of an inconvenience sure, but a pain nonetheless. So I restarted (I needed to anyway, I have no idea what I'm doing and my first run was dire). Secondly, and this has happened to me twice now, my game crashes and will refuse to load my most recent save without further crashes. I've had to roll back one or two saves. In all, out of the 40 odd hours I've played, I must have lost 6-7 hours of that. Bear this in mind. It is early access.

With that out if the way, I must stress just how fantastic this game is. Its a Sci fi grand strategy with all the trappings that come with it. A current start position means technologically, you have a ways to go. And progress is slow at first. You'll begin by clambering around Earth, trying to establish a base of operations by controlling various aspects of earth's nations. So far Ive grabbed the US, Canada, the UK and Russia. You can only control a certain number of national institutions at a time before levelling up the councillors in your faction, so chose wisely where you want to start. From there, you guide your nation in the direction you want to focus on. You'll be juggling the economy, social conditions, space programs, military funding, tech and more, whilst outcompeting the other 7 factions on the planet with you, all with different ideologies on how to deal with an alien threat. The AI is very good and had lead to some very tense moments when it had come to intrigue and political machinations. 

Once established, you head to space, set up mines on the moon, command centres,research facilities and shipyards in orbit before reaching further into the solar system and dealing with what is out there. Again, other competing factions in tow. That's pretty much where I am now. The game does however suffer from a lack of events but I'm hoping over time more are added in via updates and mods. I'm at a turning point in my game where my extreme opposite faction is in control of China, has access to nukes and I'm venturing out into the solar system, spreading myself very thin whilst simultaneously destroying every alien back on earth in sight. The space battles, I've not experienced so much. Just one or two small skirmishes but again, what's there seems good. Especially considering you design the ships, and the weaponry, drives, armour, power plants and more are all chosen by you and determined by your technology and research choices. It's very important to stay competitive.

It can be slow and it can be buggy, but what is here is great for an EA title. It needs more flavour, a better soundtrack, less bugs and a bit more polish to things like the UI. But for what it does have to offer, it delivers very well indeed.",1664569362,1664569362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You can play as any faction in the game currently, except for the Xenos themselves. This gives a wide level of replayability. I've also found that once you put in an amount of time (after about 30 hours for me) that you get used to how things work, and the turns start to flow much, much quicker at that point.

The main departure from previous XCOM titles is that this game is nearly exclusively in the strategic layer, with seemingly only ship combat in a tactical sense.

After playing 100+ hours on the demo and 50+ on this release I am still struggling to understand all dependencies and mechanics. Watch some videos and check the discord as that can be really helpful.

But for me that is not a downside for a game like this and part of the fun for me is to figure some of the mechanics out by myself and experiment.

The only downside I can see might be the actual space battles. Havent reached that level in the EA yet but in the demo it was a bit too complex for me to be honest. I appreciate the idea and the freedom they put into this but to me it feels like that this could be a full in game in itself. The complexity of controls with all axes / movement didnt feel intuitive to me but will see if there are any changes from the demo shortly in EA.

But I am sure with some good videos around this and more practice it will get easier and I can see the battle simulation as a massive positive side effect as it adds yet another layer of complexity.

Summary:

Be ready to sink a lot of time into this but in my opinion it's absolutely worth it and compared to other EA this game is actually well developed and besides some smaller bugs and cosmetics ready to play. Yes, the devs will make changes and yes, they will tweak and re-balance certain aspects but the overall functionality is there.

- Very smooth zoom scale from system wide all the way down to ship size
- Nice balance between ability to micro manage + not having to do that if you don't want to.
- GLOBAL RESEARCH?!!?! That's REALLY cool.
- Brilliant idea for factions + how public support moves between ideologies
- Big list for economic presets for CPs.

The Bad:
- UI not intuitive, It's difficult to figure out what you can and can not do for a while until you get about 5-10 hours in. Even if you unlock something, it's not immediately clear how to do that thing.
- Codex (in game help wiki) is barren, and non descriptive/helpful. This needs to be fleshed out further IMHO.
- Tooltips missing in some instances.
- Tutorial not that helpful, and you can accidentally end up outside of the tutorial while using it. It's a bit easier to learn by just playing a few hours. 
- Tutorial is limited to one faction.
- Game events display logos are a bit messy. Would be great if it had toggle messages feature, pause on event, go-to event.
- Reloading save floods screen with events you missed. Messy and takes time to clear. Clear all button?
- Inter-faction diplomacy lacking.
- You'll think you'll have a handle on the game, but then never know you unlocked an option so never utilize it.

- Needs more faction customization.
- No ability to create your own federations (unless I'm missing something) LET ME UNIFY THE MIDDLE EAST GOSH DERN IT.

Check back in later, but their roadmap is very sparse and makes me think this is almost feature complete. Voiceover is of mixed quality, writing isn't the best, and the 3d graphics are atrocious shrek rejects in contrast to the actually quite good 2d artwork. 

Odd gameplay design decisions seem to run counter to eachother, like the mechanics favouring stagnant politics where countries don't often change hands, while the tech tree seems filled with techs that let you break nations up or otherwise hurt your own interests. 

The game also can't decide on wether you're a shadowy illuminati-style organization or a group of lobbyists, and despite offering you the choice to be either at the start of the campaign nothing changes in the actual game to reflect your choice. Choosing to go public gives the other factions ""information"" on you, but the actual effects of this seem to be nil as the AI already seems to know your every move regardless. Staying secret is simply the worse of the three choices.

The space RTS portion of the game is clunky at best. Space, in general, feels underutilized, with habs having little purpose other than mining or research. Watch this space: this may change during development, though the developers' words on it have been shaky at best. 

This is not a 4x video game, it's a rather simplistic 4x board game that throws numbers in your face to give the illusion of depth.

A lot of bugs, things that need to be fixed, improved, expanded on, refined... its a bit of a mess in general... not really sure what the target was but I dont think this hits the mark.

Assuming you can navigate the horrible UI and unexplained, convoluted mechanics, you might have 20 hours of enjoyment at the very least with the scramble for territory at the start of the game, which is quite interesting, along with a little war mongering and politicising and a bit of espionage, but thats about it, it plateaus quickly.

I cant put a fine enough point on how it just seems like this is an incredibly complex game, only for complexities sake, and maybe even maliciously to hide just how shallow it is, which maybe is a time value proposition really, if it were a faster paced game it might not feel so shallow, IDK, Im disappointed after sinking dozens of hours into learning the game.",1664270473,1664512967,False,0,0,0.520402431488037109,0,True,False,True

From a fresh studio in a niche indie market, it's a lot to ask for an early access product. That said, now that I've dived in and started playing, I'm having a whole lot of fun. This is a game whose development I've watched closely for years now, I had very high hopes but measured expectations, for a game with so many complex systems I was expecting a buggy mess on ea release, frankly. I'm glad to say though that this is actually a highly polished early access game thus far. and even though I'm still early into it, I can tell I will get a ton of replay value out of it. To make things better, Terra Invicta has been made with modding and modabilty in mind, with workshop access from day one, which is quite impressive and bodes very well for the future of this game. I'm still very much discovering and enjoying the vanilla experience, but to think of how many interesting permutations and playstyles I can experiment with just in the vanilla game, and to add to that the possibility of future overhauls which might radically change the way you play the game, Terra Invicta looks like it will give the very best of Paradox games a run for their money in terms of replayability. 

The game has a lot of moving parts and will present a steep learning curve. Even if you're experienced with other 4X and grand strategy games in the vein of HoI, Victoria, or CK, you will still have a lot of new systems to learn, though that prior experience will help you pick it up quicker just by playing the game and reading tooltips. If you're new to the genre, don't despair, there's already several quality tutorials and guided playthroughs you can watch on YouTube which will help you come to grips with how to play the game. There have been complaints about the UI, but aside from the occasional peculiarity I really don't find it bad at all, though that could just be from experience with these types of games.  To a player new to the genre though I would recommend hovering your mouse over just about everything, even if it doesn't look like a button, it probably is, and it probably does something useful for you, so just get used to exploring the UI and familiarizing yourself with it. 

Aside from the learning curve, it's too early in my playthrough for me to talk about difficulty, I honestly don't know whether I'm doing well or horribly (I feel like I'm doing well, but that could very well be deceptive in a game with this kind of scope). I'm playing my first game on normal difficulty with the recommended ""Resistance"" faction in order to learn the games systems, this gives you a very basic tutorial and will hopefully not be too challenging for someone familiar with the genre. You can always play on easy as well, and I'd recommend that if you're brand new to this type of game. 

As for the game design itself, I’m very impressed with overall atmosphere of the game, it’s got a ton of character and flavor coming from every interaction. To my surprise, even in early access the games massive tech tree comes with unique flavor text for each research, and not just like a pithy quote like in Civilization, but a whole description of what the thing you researched does (of course along with the genre appropriate pithy quote ala Civ and Civ:BE). There are many unique events and discoveries to be made along the way, and the game feels like its constantly progressing and growing in scope into some kind of cinematic climax, but the ends are all up to you as the leader of your faction. This is the kind of thing I love in a game like this, just getting pulled into the world and the lore, the science and the pseudo-science, the competing ideologies of the factions set against the backdrop of actual competing nations, the race to space and to the colonize the solar system, all while surviving and perhaps overcoming an alien invasion not just of Earth but of the whole solar system. It’s all so fun and interesting if you give into the storytelling that happens just by playing the game, such that win or lose in this first playthrough I know I’ll be eager to go back in again and try things differently, to see what different outcomes there are, and whether I can change the course of things for the better. 
So far I’m really impressed and am happy to give this game and the developers a well deserved thumbs up on Terra Invicta, the future is bright for this game and I can’t wait to see what’s next in store for us as development continues.

You struggle for control in the face of an alien invasion across the face of the Earth and the entire solar system, against human actors and extraterrestrial, by cloak and dagger, the sword and science.

Bad (IMPROVEMENT): The only thing that I can say the game could really use is dedicated tutorial missions with clear cut goals, the game's current weakness is that to a new player (yes even you fellow paradox fans) it is very complicated and very unexplained, most of what you're gonna know at time of this review will come from Youtube.",1664418152,1664502505,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Pick a faction and compete or  cooperate with 6 other factions as you navigate geopolitics and eventually the colonization and exploitation of space to respond to alien invaders. The playable factions all have different goals throughout the course of the game, from resisting the alien invaders, to appeasing and out right exodus of the earth itself.

 Early game will mostly focus on securing influence and control over nations while defending and removing the influence of others by recruiting ""Councilors"". Councilors are operatives that come with different skillets and access to different organizations, which can be used to modify their skills and active abilities. 

Geopolitics in the game focus on controlling all aspects of the nations you influence through the use of improvement points; these allow you to set how much of your GDP goes to each aspect, such as military, education, and ""boost"", which you will need for the next part of the game. 

After researching the required projects, you can then build space stations and outposts  around the earth, moon and beyond. The game can model the entire solar system on full settings, giving you plenty of moons and asteroids in addition to the planets that you can probe, colonize and exploit. The aliens can do this as well; depending on tech you research, you will be given notice of their bases and outposts throughout the solar system.


The game has a very steep learning curve; there is a lot to balance between making sure your councilors are safe (and loyal to you), the competition to dictate global research, as well as keeping your controlled nations safe and happy while alien abductions occur. Once it clicks, the game has the classic ""one more turn feel"" that keeps you playing well beyond what you expected. This is well worth the price as it has delivered a fully functional game, and will only get better throughout early access.

Cons:
no real diplomacy between factions.  it doesn't matter how much you align with another faction (rebels and humanity first should align fairly closely), they will always be your enemies.
necessitates the need to ""protect"" your assets.  on that point, ai is predictable and will always try and go after any unprotected assets no matter what.
tech is kind of funny.  you research for the whole world in 3 slots, but you research for yourself in one (with 2 being unlockable). 
the bonuses you get for being #1 for the world unlocks seem low.  It's not as if you have a lot of tech to spare for a long long time, and even end game it's not something you can easily raise.  why would you help unlock world techs? just let someone else do it.
Also with techs, you have an absurd amount of techs that do very little diff from one another.  All the drive techs are mostly garbage with only a few worth getting.  I know, realism or something with iterative designs but all that research for something you will probably never use because it's outdated before it even gets used?
ai is keen on space materials and will build them up as soon as possible sometimes leaving you with very little sites left.
the pacing is off atm. the game is set up for a very long sessions.  great.  but as soon as the alien faction gets a foothold it's basically game over.  you can't fight them with their absurd bonuses while also fighting off every other faction.
crashes after space battles randomly.
space battles need a bit of help.  no matter the armor ships get blown up in 1-3 missile hits. pd can't keep up with aliens since they fire 3-4 missiles per every one of yours.
ai controlled combat focuses on rotating your ship in whacky orientations making the nose/forward cannons typically doing minimal damage
no automated tier 3 space hub?
space ships and bases can be stolen easily by the enemy factions (how?) this is super frustrating.  it doesn't matter if you have marines on them, they can somehow board ships and just make them revolt.
direct investment needs truckloads of money.  you can earn something like maybe 20 a day end game.  the US will take 181k to max boost (200) 1 category.  Like if you max out boost for 1 year you might get an addition .1 boost.
control points put a hard cap on available countries to control.  If you go over this, it's basically suicide as you'll starve out of influence which is a critical resource. there are techs to raise it but it's very costly.
antimatter is rough to farm.  (as far as i know) you'll want to build a base in low orbit of Jupiter.  However, without fail, aliens will always attack it 3 months prior to it being build.  It also takes anywhere from 3-5 years to build the base.  you need anitmatter to build end game ships.  so you have a issue with not being able to build anything to defend the base that creates the stuff you need to build ships with.
there's also an issue with bases that are being build.  for example, the base build in low orbit jupiter will have a presence on day 1, meaning aliens can attack it immediately if they want to.  this makes no sense.  it would make more sense if it was empty until delivered.  that way it might be possible to use base defenses to defend a base that's under construction if it's put together fast.
aerobreaking is in i think, but gravity boosts aren't?
early/mid game ships are too slow to intercept aliens orbiting the earth.  it'll take weeks to move in the same orbit to intercept.  aliens will (for some reason) crash their ship into earth before you make it to them.
no way to cancel orders of ships.  If i have an end game ship that can cruise at 2g and i want to intercept an alien ship coming from a distance away, i can intercept them once, then i'm in for a long ride from where they came from.  i cannot tell them to redirect to another planet/base.
intercepting in low earth orbit is broken? Can only chase for a small delta v when i have 6k delta v.  meaning dodging while bombarding is what the ai does all the time and there's no way to force a fight.
there's no way to refuel i believe? if you use all your delta v chasing someone, you're dead in the water even if you're next to a starbase.  no tankers or way to share fuel is awkward.
for all the realism, resources are insta transported? actually, please never change this.
It is a great game to play.  xcom married with (insert your favorite grand strategy game here) is a great concept.  The fact you can start mining ceres is awesome.",1664493468,1664493468,True,1,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

I say this as someone with thousands of hours in games like Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron 3, and Command Modern Operations.

Issues I had with the game after 8 hours

-Glacial pacing, after 8 hours on fastest speed I had yet to do anything besides build infrastructure on earth
-Extremely opaque system interactions. Trying to nudge your country in a direction doesn't always work
-Many ""trap"" interactions that get you stuck in negative feedback loops where the way out is not clear (examples I ran into include boost capability and influence)
-Very ""busy work"" intensive just to maintain your position. ""Protecting control points"" only protects 2 at a time, you have to click this button every couple of turns, you can't just assign an agent to protect every point you have like the AI can manage.
-Non-interactive UI. Do you want to give up a control point to fix your admin cap issues? Too bad, you can't right click abandon on the control point icon like in say, a paradox game. The only way to do so is to press the abandon country submenu under the country window. That doesn't even abandon, only disables for 6 months and if the AI hasn't taken it from you in that time you have to do it again
-Unclear progression, which leads to extremely slow progression. Which means high probability of soft locking yourself if you fall behind the Alien power curve, leading to a campaign over. This wouldn't be that big of an issue if not the fact that it took hours to get to that point and the choices to fix the campaign were also hours ago.
-You can not shut down other factions permanently. Once you get powerful enough, they will constantly bombard you with annoying shit to bring you down. This lasts until the end of the game.

I would say that out of the 20 hours I've played, only about 20-30 minutes was making meaningful decisions, the other 19.5 hours was playing an elaborate cookie clicker skin because there was no thought involved with the actions taken during that time, and 15 hours is battling the AI trying to undo my progress.

I've played more than the refund time limit, at this point I'm going to drop the game and come back in a few months to see if the devs made the game any more playable.

The developers have already put a lot of what I would have actually complained about (UI issues, lack of historical economic data, ect) on their roadmap. 

Something important to realize is that even though this is EA, it is mostly mechanically complete. You can play through an entire game. There aren't any real technical issues I've seen, I haven't had a crash or anything like that. That's already better than 99% of the early access games I've played. You don't have to wait until early access is over to play this game.

One thing that is particularly nice is this game can be replayed with the different factions, and they aren't merely cosmetic, they have different goals and events in the game. Even playing with the same faction though, it is doubtful that your game will go exactly the same.

I think the best aspect of this game though is its ambition. It is a very big game, and also a time eater. It takes a long time to establish yourself in geopolitics, a long time to establish yourself in space, a long time to get a space army set up, and you really feel a sense of accomplishment when your plans come together. The devs are also going to add in new scenarios though, some of which seem like they'll offer quicker onboarding, but also some will have new mechanics apparently.

The actual tutorial for the game is one faction only, and was clearly an afterthought. It explains each UI element once, many of them only very surface level. It then makes you basically do each available action once, without any context or furthering information at all. As a result, it will generally give a wrong impression of your priorities and you'll prolly restart a bunch of times, most likely after trying to extract actually useful information from the forums.

Let me give you a few examples. The game starts out as a political simulator (The actual spaceship combat takes literal hours to get to, haven't done so yet), you try to get Control Points in different nations, to steer them towards whatever end goal your faction has. These goals range from various degrees of resistance, over to getting the fk off earth, to preparing sufficient lube so that you can ask your new alien overlords to be gentle.

You have a number of agents, initially 2, that have a bunch of active and passive stats, and each has access to a limited amount of actions. And already the game does not explain what you'd actually want, it just tells you to hire more guys. Oh you reached the cap already, having spent one of the more limited and precious ressources in the early game? And now you're missing one, two or even a bunch of actions that turn out to be critical? Welp, restart it is.

Once you've got your claws into one of the bigger nations, the next step would be to build it up. You can assign a set of priorities, and there are a bunch of them. There are things like economy, military, unity, funds, spoils etc. etc. And while the games tooltips tell you WHAT they are, they don't tell you anything about the greater context. And we are talking about the sort of thing that is supposed to slowly change over the course of ingame years. Is it actually worth trying to build up smaller countries? If yes, which priority serves that end best? No idea, either trial and error for hours on end, or just hope some good samaritan makes a guide for it.

Finally, there is the space race. I don't know if there is a faction that ignores that part of the game entirely, but its certainly a major part on a lot of them. The idea is that you are meant to push your countries to generate ""Boost"", which is the ressource used to shoot stuff into space. And then slowly start spreading out across the solar system. The emphasis is on ""slow"". It takes hours to even reach a point where you are mining the moon, and then a good bit longer before you can make some noises towards making actual spacecraft.

And this is where the whole ""Figure it out yourself"" breaks the games back. The addition of space assets, fleets and such would presumably add another, at that point much needed, layer to the game. But you will very often run into the aforementioned ""Turns out I played it all wrong and gotta restart"" moment, before even getting there. And the early game tends to be pretty samey, I'm assuming the factions major differences only really start coming in at the midgame, and that means hours on hours of more of the same to even get there.

I want to like the game, I really do. I'm still smashing at it face first, and some of it clicks as I go along. But I can't recommend it in good faith unless A) You are fine fighting a game in a bare knuckle cage match for the fun to come out or B) they overhault it to be profoundly more transparent than it currently is.",1664481805,1664481805,False,5,0,0.531007766723632813,0,True,False,True

I recommend you to play at the easiest difficulty to avoid butthurt and frustration. It's early access after all, have fun and just roleplay your faction.

Now about issues.

-UI is horrible. It should be reworked, sensitivity and zoom of camera should be adjusted, game does not utilizes right mouse button at all, constant jumps to a counselor when i select him. Why? Maybe i just want to select him to do something in India, do not takey camera to north america where he is located, please.

-Lack of automation options. It would be nice to ""program"" your counselors to do actions at earth by themselves according to priority list that you've set up. Sometimes i just want to focus at space when when i have everything at earth set up. Sure, you can put them at permanent employment for advice, but what if i want them to kill alien lifeforms and investigate alien activity by themselves without my intervention? This kind of stuff.

The good:  It's a really well-done geopolitical strategy game with aliens.  And space combat.  And stuff.  So much stuff.

The bad:  Too much stuff that does too little.  A whole bunch of stuff that while not just out-of-the-blue feels like out-of-the-blue because until you research a bunch of tech, you can't figure out what's going on.  And stuff you'll get that is absolutely useless and a waste of time (early space ship design comes to mind, but it's not the only thing).  There are also some pretty serious balance issues, but that's not that surprising in an Early Access game.

The ugly: I have this crazy dream where game devs actually spend a few bucks doing usability testing on their software.  I know. I know.  I'm jousting at even crazier windmills than ol' Mr. Quixote, but still, I'm gonna dream that impossible dream.   But ya, the user interface is just terrible.  Sure, once you figure out where stuff is, and so on...you'll still end up wasting time because there isn't any good way to know whether some of the hidden cooldowns or check-flags have been triggered before you try to do something (*cough*unification*cough*).

The pros:

I enjoy how grand and detailed the sol system map is. You get an amazing sense of scale in space and the technology to traverse said astronomical distances is realistic enough to take on the tale of humanity's future with aliens without abusing suspension of disbelief.

Every decision feels weighty, even the mundane council missions. Do you set up a control point in a nation to build political influence or focus on ops to quell the xeno incursion? That and hundreds of other micromanaging orbital systems and economies. 

You have a calendar to remember about, and it's not just a metric for research progress and political alliances. You can use time to plan out your launch windows, which will save you valuable exploratory resources since each object in space moves around in orbit realistically.

Each faction has their own goals on how to react to extraterrestrial life and this in turn lends itself well to the adaptation of different play strategies. 

The cons:

Optimization upon startup, loading a save feels like it takes ages. Once playing the game it's smooth as butter though.

Some balance issues, which are being resolved as we speak with rolling patches from the based devs.

After two and a half hours at max speed, I basically just got a habitat or two set up. Most of my time was composed of setting my councilors to do the same missions over and over and over and over again. The aliens did absolutely nothing. They crashed a few times, and I burned down some plants, and that was about it. The vast majority of the game is spent tard-wrangling the other AI factions as they repeatedly assault your control over other nations. Not even the espionage/diplomacy/influence part of the game is particularly engaging. You tell your people to protect it and it's protected, until you forget about it, the bonus runs out, and they take it from you. It's practically impossible to take over an AI's nation as even at 90% public support, as the AI will pretty much maintain 'Defend Interests' on all of their nations worth taking. Which prevents crackdowns and purges entirely. It can't be countered or prevented. While you can do the same, the AI maintains it perfectly. Defend Interests should at least have a chance at failing, and require a high-ish public opinion to succeed.

There's a lot of potential here? But it's slow paced and not in a good way. You're just asked to do the same trivial tasks repeatedly for an hour for a 1-5% bonus. The habitat stuff is fun, and I like the idea? But Terra Invicta right now feels like an espionage/diplomacy minigame with massive time bloat. I would love to say it's just unfinished and needs more time in the oven but I honestly can't say that will be enough. Almost all the game seems to be based on the diplomacy/espionage stuff, and the fact that even that doesn't feel particularly well done doesn't give me much hope.

Again, love the idea, I'd love for it to get better, but right now it just feels...bleh. Contrary to popular opinion, this is NOT a complex game. It's just an extremely slow one.

The UI is awful, important information is buried, lots of other numbers are everywhere, but who knows what they mean or how to change them. You know your tech tree is ridiculous when it has a search feature (that also doesn't work half the time?). It took me nearly 3 in-game years to figure out how to build a space station (hint: zoom out a lot until a brand new button appears). Granted it's early access and all this is definitely fixable, so here's hoping it gets better.

The real kicker though is that the game just ends up feeling like a time waster. You spend 99% of the game advancing time at max speed, watching things rapidly spin around other things. That's it. You can't actually DO anything in the game. You tell your operatives, stations, or ships what to do, then just advance time and wait for them to do it. In my longest play I'm 9 game-years in, that took almost 10 real hours, and I can finally build ships with 7 attack power. Alien ships have like 350-700 attack power. It'll take 20 game-years to have the technologies I need to even attempt to build a fleet that can stand up to 1 alien ship. That's another 10 real hours of watching the earth spin while fighting over the same control point in France for the 1 billionth time. No thanks.

I still haven't built a ship, but that's only a few months away now that I have mining established. I've had direct and meaningful conflict with other factions, am continuing to press for control and stability on earth, and have learned a lot about the aliens. Some people say the game is grindy, and it is in the sense you have to do a lot to get anywhere, but I feel like what I'm doing actually matters. Like if I wasn't constantly moving my agents with a plan I wouldn't be doing anything. If you have any interest in grand strategy games, pick it up, I don't think you'll regret it.

I played the demo back when it came out, so I went into the game knowing a bit about the basics of the game. For those just getting into it at the start, it is a bit of a wall to get over before you understand things. However, once you get the basics, things kind of fall into place well. 

I'll likely update this as I go through the game, but at this point (5.5 hours in) I've learned what the factions want, launched my first station, gained control of a few areas, and established a good group of operatives and organizations to fit with the style I'm going for. The aliens are just starting to send more ships, so I expect I'll need to begin defending myself soon. 

Overall, I enjoy the main loop of the game, balancing everything to make sure I can do whatever I need as it comes up.

One bit of advice I figured out quickly, don't bother trying to figure the tech tree out now. The thing looks like a conspiracy theorists string board, you cannot piece it together. Luckily you really don't need to, since a large portion of the tech is researched globally, so at the very least the A.I isn't getting any farther ahead because you don't know the perfect route to take yet.",1664262879,1664464193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is a massive Paradox-esque strategy game, grand in all the meaning of the word. It is slow, deep, wide and requires planning and thinking, having quite the steep learning curve. Expect multiple restarts, but if you're into this kind of games you wont mind.

That said, this game has a level of depth, ambition, and sincerity that I find tons of modern games lacking nowadays.

It's impressive and enthralling to the nth degree so long as you can push past the learning wall, which I firmly believe is just a UX issue.

I literally tested out seeing how long a space battle would go for to get a rough idea and starting out I set it to AI control and set the speed to max... they basically just do flybys on each other then back burn and go back. The timer hit 83 minutes before they were about to do their second pass at each other. EIGHTY THREE MINUTES REAL TIME for THAT are you kidding me? I am glad I didn't actually fight the battle and decided to test it first.

This game just seems to make everything take ridiculously long and after this suffice to say I am done with it. The time sink is not worth it now as I can see the space battles are even worse than the rinse and repeat stuff you do on earth.

I truly hope they are able to improve the experience because there is some great stuff there but its hidden behind colossal walls of overly complicated, time wasting and experience destroying game mechanics that drag the game out so long that you just loose interest.

All in all I played about 15 hrs in the save I am in, I didn't really fight the aliens at all just back and forth with the AI taking territories and building space stations and stuff in a sort of cold war space race that was about as entertaining as a point and click adventure but where you only click the same buttons over and over again to get the same results over and over again to then click the buttons over and over again.... suffice to say by now I honestly don't care about whats happening the game at all anymore and just over the fact that everything in this game is a super duper long end goal that would take dozens of hours to finish even a single game (all whilst doing the same things over and over and over again for the most part)

__________________________________________________________________________

The game has a lot in it but sadly I dont think I could be bothered to play long enough to see it. the game simply takes WAAAAY too long to go anywhere, by far the slowest pace grand stratergy I have ever played and I see myself atm just sitting there ""waiting for the fun part to arrive"" and after 10 hrs it still hasen't and I don't think im even close.  If they manage to improve the massive time sync then I would come back to it but for now there is just simply too much rinse and repeat to get there.

On top of this I feel like some parts of it are simply require too much micro-management to keep the gaming flowing and entertaining.

I think the first thing that needs a balance change for sure is securing control points... its too easy to not realise your points arnt being secured and ones that are secured are basically impossible to take over making it just a simple matter of having to constantly check to see if they are protected as the player and if you're trying to take one from the AI you basically just keep up'ing unrest until you can take it or coup it... its the most lackluster cat and mouse game ever.

I expect most people will play through the early game, barely get a small space station up (if that), quit, and never come back.  The early game is slow, methodical, and not all that exciting or engaging at first.  It's not immediately clear which countries you should take or what to prioritize for research.  The game really shines after that initial land grab and you start venturing into the solar system.  It's just unfortunate that you have to slog through several hours of important (vitally so) set up.  It's not bad once you understand what you should be going for but that first campaign is rough.  I would highly recommend doing a test campaign for learning the ropes before sitting down and running a serious one.  

My only other complaint is the UI.  Assigning agents to missions is tedious and sometimes obnoxious.  Please figure out a better way for this, I find myself assigning people to wrong regions constantly.

This is something you do in the first 30 minutes of the game, the equivalent of settling a city in Civilization.

Now, this is NOT X-Com. Yes, it's by the Long War mod devs, but its not X-Com.
So if you loved X-Com, you may not like this.
This is more like Shadow Empire + Victoria (due to population opinion and social management) + X-Com's strategy overlay + Nexus The Jupiter Incident (in the space combat).

So just know what you're getting into, this is one of those games that takes ages to play, and takes a long time to comprehend. If you liked Shadow Empire, Paradox games, etc, then you will like this.
If you come to this just as an X-Com fan, you may not like the complexity on offer and lack of tactical combat missions.

I am still very early in this, but i like what i see and i can see that it has an enormous scope.
That is very much Long War about this, the sensation that you have a real life month of gameplay in each session ahead of you. 

The UI is very bland and early access looking.
I'm not expecting floral decorated parchment textures, but i am expecting something more than the over-done bland flat UI we've seen in so many games, precisely because it takes no effort in terms of design or art.
Just anything would be nice, a 3 pixel border around the windows that reflect some sort of art.

Same applies to the Earth texture itself, it is extremely odd, with a reddish Khorne-infested Sahara desert for some reason, and extremely dim terrain overall (even while in ""Terrain"" mapmode).
It does not look like or feel like Earth, it's a permanently dark blurry sphere with equally blurry nation outlines.
There are an enormous variety of 16k full Earth textures on the internet, copyright free, so i dont understand why Earth looks so bad ingame.
Some sort of cloud layer would be nice too, rotating with the day/night cycle.

One of the main complaints people are having is that the game is too complicated. To this, I say: obviously! Terra Invicta has the spirit of the Long War mods that cobbled Pavonis together in the first place.

There's a lot of care shown in the game, and I'm looking forward to where the game goes. And oh, yes, there are seven distinct factions.

A couple caveats as to whether this game will appeal to you: 

- It is a complex simulation and has a steep learning curve. At the time of this writing (mid-2022), the explanations for all mechanisms aren't all in place, so some experimentation and mistakes will likely be required. That won't appeal to some people (which is fine

- The graphic quality is decent and functional (and far better than they need to be), but they won't be winning beauty awards. 

- The UI needs some polish; all the information is there, but some of the interactions feel a bit clunky.

Bugs, UX problems, annoyingly poor performance, balance issues, poor onboarding for new players, too much text in some places and too little in others, not enough tools to handle the micromanagement, and I can understand why many people call the early-game boring.

It's also one of those rare truly ambitious games that really tries something new, pushes the envelope, and succeeds in its ambition. Yeah, if you want a smooth ride then wait. This really is Early Access, it's still noticeably early, it will still take much time for Terra Invicta to iron out as many of its faults as the developers can afford to. But if you want to play something deep and smart and fascinating and nevermind a hundred little issues, then there is already a marvelous and fully playable game here.

I bought it happy merely to support Pavonis, but now I'm actually happy to play the game. This is not just a breath of fresh air; it's a strong wind that promises you let you sail far.

Here are some of the principal problems the game suffers from at present:
- Councillors start out interesting, with their various jobs, stats and perks, but if you keep them for long enough then they'll all be stuffed full of organizations which can give them any stats and abilities you desire. After some time, all councillors start looking the same.
- Performance is fine...until you move the view. Showing new things can take a second of stuttering. And god help you if you decide to switch from Earth to some other body! The view doesn't just switch, but it zooms out and in dramatically, showing you everything on the way, which is a very rough ride for your frame rate.
- Menu performance also isn't that good. Whether it's regions of earth or asteroids in the solar system, displaying all those hundreds always takes a while. You can play with a smaller solar system, but that only helps a little.
- Micromanagement is nightmare that urgently needs more UX support. Control points that become vulnerable, councillors who have enough XP to level up, unrest rising in your holdings, nations becoming able to join federations or unify with one another, and a dozen other things that need to be checked very regularly or kept track of on paper because the game will at the most give you occasional and irregular pop-up tips (that even disappear after a few seconds!) to remind you of these things. At the very least the game might need some kind of built-in notepad and alarm clock system in which you can set up reminders for these things.
- You won't hear about an enemy army invading one of your regions until it's fully occupied.
- There are no queue systems for research, construction, councillor assignments, etc. I realize this isn't entirely trivial, since a lot can change very quickly and make earlier intentions moot, but it might help lighten the micromanagement load.
- Some of the factions are a little or even very cartoonish. Now, reality is full of crazy things, so it's not entirely unbelievable, but it still feels more like the writers couldn't really get into any but their own mindsets. To be blunt, the writing isn't on the level of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, even if the tech quotes seem to emulate or at least pay homage to it. It's still decent-to-good, but a little disappointing every time you notice that a writer just shrugged and made ridiculous what he personally did not like.
- The space battle UI is a little ugly.
- The game really needs more and better tooltips.
- It's very hard to keep track of what your competitors are doing. Part of that is intentional, of course - councillors are acting in secret, you're not meant to be able to observe them all the time. But another part is there just not being any UX to, say, tell you at a glance which factions are in control of which nations to what a degree, how much economic or scientific or military power they command, or how their space colonization is going. You can put a filter over the globe overlay, you can check nations or stations one by one, or have all the information from an entire category dumped on you in a giant list, but all of these require a lot of manual sifting and calculating to get a high-level strategic overview. There's also a menu that displays the exact incomes of all factions, all of their techs and then some, but again the presentation doesn't really help to identify threats or opportunities. I don't really have any idea on how to improve on this; I just often feel like I need to spend an IRL day to sort out all the information if I don't want to just go ahead blind.
- There are some inconsistencies in the UI. Sometimes you can rename a hab or station, sometimes you can not. Sometimes you can fast-forward x5, sometimes only x2.
- Some text in the UI is just placeholder strings.
- As in all strategy games, the various AI factions don't really band together to take down the leading faction, which means that once the player manages to consolidate his power they have largely uncontested hegemony. Now, Realm Divide à la Total War may be a too crude a tool for a game like this, but something more subtle in a similar vein might be necessary.
- Managing orgs is a mess; it seems impossible to get a handle on which ones are there, what you want, who can get them and when you want to get rid of them. This is one of the few places in the game that might need some simplification, or at least more UX support to help the player get an overview.

And here are some of the highlights:
- For how complex the game is, it works very well. So far there's been nothing outright broken that I saw.
- The seven different factions are distinct enough to make playing them all interesting, if only to see their different points of view. And it's not like with the Endless 4X games, where faction differences are an excuse to have an underdeveloped core gameplay loop - all of the factions play by the same rules in Terra Invicta.
- The writing, plot, setting and gameplay flow are unusually grounded and believable, for media in general and especially for a game. This kind of marriage of hard sci-fi and large-scale strategy game is, as far as I know, practically unheard of. This alone is worth the price of admission, in my opinion - this is a very well thought-out experience. 
- Starting out as a little conspiracy (which, to be fair, is unrealistically effective at subverting entire nations in the span of mere weeks) and working you way up towards becoming first a local, then a regional terrestrial power, then slowly branching out into space foothold by little foothold, requiring technological and economic advancements to be able to do more or go further, all the while securing your power base on earth so you don't get cut off at the stem, until space becomes a busy place and you're actually a superpower vying with others for the most valuable pieces of the solar system, all of this is great. Really. Terra Invicta has you very slowly work every bit of power you gain, and it unfolds gradually and beautifully with new options and possibilities around every corner. The game truly grows as you play.
- There's a similar arc regarding first hearing of the aliens, then observing some of their activities from a distance, then...well, let's not spoiler. It's nice, really. There's so much to the game, and it's all tied together very well.
- The voice acting is pretty good. It can get a little repetitive with the councillors' barks after a while, and some of the tech quote narrations are slightly off the mark, but overall the quality is high.
- The visual design is good. Maybe nothing amazing to blow you away with artistic wonder, but it's very clean, readable and works well to convey the tone of the game and the information you need to see.
- Even if it's hell on performance, the scale and complexity of the game are impressive.

It is big and complex. There are tooltips and tutorial messages everywhere. Someone said it was XCOM meets Crusader Kings 3. That description fits, but for complexity it is much more CK3 than XCOM.

The tech tree is massive. I haven't really as much planned ahead as much as tried to roleplay my actions.

Watching some YouTube videos to understand components is probably required to get what's going on. I recommend YouTube channel PerunGamingAU's playthroughs. quill18 and PotatoMcWhisky also have some videos I've enjoyed.

I have no idea if the end game is any good. I don't think I'll get to it for months. I expect to struggle and lose. I'm intentionally ignoring some mechanics right now while I try to master others.

But the game is amazing in its ambition. Representing a global response to an alien invasion in a realistic and comprehensive way. If XCOM were a film, it would be GI Joe. If Terra Invicta were a film, it would be the entire Expanse TV series, but set starting today with the Epstein Drive 200 years away and colonizing Mars is just a dream.

I know this review is being done at 5 hours, but I feel I need to give my thoughts at this point in time as the words EARLY ACCESS pervade a great deal of potential. The following are key points that I would like to point out as good and what can be improved.

1. No Bugs - There's a great deal of information and mechanics that are so multitudinous that I wouldn't be able to identify a bug easily among them. Only from what I've done thus far have I experienced no bugs which is a great sign!

2. Spreadsheets - I came into this game thinking the main mechanic was advancing human tech and mobilizing the world to build space ships to fight aliens. BOY was I half wrong. It's that, and then an entire OTHER game as well. Before the space fighting starts, we have a simulation of the world's governmental existence; GDP, unity, unrest, literacy, inequality, military, politics, and other factors that I can't remember off the top of my head. The goal is to generate influence whilst pitted against other factions of differing ideologies to take control of countries and have them help your organization generate money, direct research, and ultimately be the launching point for inter-solar travel to fight (or attempt to befriend) the aliens. It's such a cool concept, but I can tell that if I were a man of less tenacity, I would've given up on it due to the sheer complexity of everything. I only played the tutorial for like 10 minutes and thought, ""yeah, I got this."" My hubris... I trudged through the game at a pace, reached my cap of how many countries I'm allowed to control, and only about 3 hours in did I realize the countries I control can change how they invest their money into themselves. I earned like thousands of dollars every couple weeks which I invested directly into my strongest countries (Australia in my case). It's just a massive amount of mechanics that I believe could be streamlined. I'm not saying they should go away, but they should definitely be better represented. Like, why should I reduce inequality? (aside from the humanitarian reason of course) Why is my GDP decreasing despite my investing into it? How do I increase the popularity of my ideology in countries I control? I already answered the third question here, but I literally just found out about how to do it near the end of my last play session. I'm not knocking this game for my ignorance, but there are so many things that I wish I better understood. Maybe I should continue the tutorial lol. But based on how long it took me to get to where I'm currently at in my scenario, I suspect it would be an entire campaign to learn the entirety of the game...

3. Don't expect to fight the aliens anytime soon - 2 in-game years (5 hours) into my scenario and I have yet to build a space station or engage aliens in battle. This is a grand strategy overall. It's not just shooting aliens. It's a simulation of how humanity might react to the existence of aliens and organizations that rise to try and lead humanity against them. 

In conclusion - I didn't really proof-read what I said above, but I know it might sound somewhat ranty. I like this game, and it has a lot of potential. It just needs time to be perfected. Don't sleep on this one!",1664375707,1664375707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. Gameplay is VERY slow.  The entire ""mission phase"" aspect does not pair will with the real time aspect of the game.  It feels extremely repetitive and there isn't much to do once you have assigned your agents tasks.  It seems to me like the devs can't decide if the game should be real time or turn based.

3.  Core Game mechanics are not meaningful.  You are penalized for having too many regions under your control but you would be hard pressed to win without simply ignoring that restriction.

It takes far too long to load games - over a minute on an SSD, and you'll be loading a lot. 

the % chance to succeed is the core gameplay mechanic and it is broken. This is another one of those ""90% chance is a miss"" type simulatiors, and since this is the only mechanic the game uses you will nonsensically  fail at crucial moments where failure isnt an option.

This is worse than Xcom - because at least there you could use good placement or alternatives attacks to compensate, here you there is no other alternative - the entire outcome of every strategy hinges on
a dice roll, and here the chance of success is actually nowhere near what is actually displayed to you.

Summary: Little buggy, performance issue and 2 crashes but a fun-filled strategy game with mystery, politics and action which i am continuing to love 20 hours in while writing this. 

This game has been on my radar for around 3-4 months and after reading about the premise and setting of the game this is a strategy game I have been waiting for. Political, sci-fi, action based strategy is something i needed to get away from the typical strategy format. So once i saw it was being released this week, after work i happily paid the £30+ price tag to try it and I do not regret buying it early access at all. 

YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME IF ENJOY: 

- Political strategy, taking over countries and deciding what they should focus there efforts on being, building an army, producing fuel or growing the economy is something that's so easily accessible and deep in this game. The game will go into current issues, such are the Russian and Ukraine war, if you felt the need too you could manipulate Russia too stop this war. 

- Mystery, the mystery surrounding the aliens that are slowly invading earth keeps you going with the story, finding out the biology of the aliens, there purpose and how they are invading earth through un-human means captivated me from the start.

- Growing threat, the threat of aliens become more and more apparent as you realise how technologically stronger they are than you, so keeps level of urgency, but its the other institutes you are rivalled with that makes you wanna get ahead. Once i saw the servants had a moon base ... I wanted a better moon base. 

YOU WILL HATE THIS GAME IF YOU 

are a b#@%£ (joke) 

- If you prefer all out war strategy games with forever combat and action this is not the game for you. Sometimes you spend many months sitting around making sure that your countries under your control are defended. 

- If you have troubles processing a lot of information, this game floods you with info from the get-go and is overwhelming for even experienced strategy game players. If those sort of games turn you off instantly, dont buy this. 

- You like large maps, although this game has our entire solar system and is considered a grand strategy I cant help but feel this could be bigger such as moving too new solar systems and going too the alien planets (might be a future update) but this game is purely about defending earth and not attacking the aliens. So what could be a large galaxy trying to find the location of the aliens is for now just our solar system. 

Conclusion: 
This is currently my strategy game of the year and im only 20 hours in while currently writing this, I cant wait too see what happens in future updates and I find it hard to believe such a well polished game with a truck load of mechanics is considered early access. Although I have found bugs and my game has crashed twice and had massive performance drops, thats too be expected with such a large ambitious indie game. I will continue to play and update mt review if my opinion changes.",1664367299,1664367299,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

I greatly enjoy the core game loop of espionage, longer term planning, and gradual consolidation and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy planning their long-term strategy as opposed to twitch-fire rapid response to every crisis.

Having said that, the game is coming out at a hefty price tag. And what the game is delivering is brushing up against not being value for money. There are a number of under-baked and poorly implemented systems and design choices that permeate the entire thing that might be fine in a A$30 game but which probably should be sorted for a game claiming a price premium but still delivering on a few amateur mistakes.

Finally, without being an exhaustive list, the unbalance is pretty severe and design changes between the original demo and this current iteration show that some things are getting worse. Admin is disgustingly unbalanced by providing GDP boost to advise missions, giving control point cap, AND allowing ownership of 'organisations' which can easily be worth 3 or 4 stat points plus other benefits to many other stats. Further, the changes to control points has limited the reach of each faction including the enemies such that they are not trying to tread on each other's toes much due to strained cap limits.

I'm not being paid to write a design document here so I won't spend more time harping on about the shortcomings or how to solve them in my opinion but the game is very good but indications are it has slid backwards in some areas and I worry the developers are simply going to patch nerf the new 'meta' every week in some misguided attempt to create artificial difficulty by sapping the fun of alternate strategies.

Terra Invicta is refreshing in that the game makes no attempt to hold your hand.

I think most of the negative reviews are from people struggling to understand both the interface and the mechanics.   And that is a fair criticism; learning the game is an education in itself.   It's not simple, and not always intuitive, and even in the tutorial the hand-holding is almost non-existent.  That's going to make this game unappealing for a lot of people just because learning to play is almost like scaling a wall.  But the more you get into it and pick it up, the more it draws you in and the more interested in playing you become.  

The early game is going to revolve around establishing a power base.  You need to choose where to set up shop, what territories to go for based on your needs.  There is a lot of factors to take into consideration when deciding your next moves.  Demographics, economics, and also practical matters, such as ""Will I have access to a space program?""  If you don't, then getting into space is going to present a tremendous obstacle for you.  Also,  you need to consider your goals and needs when putting your team together.   You're the brains of the outfit, but your councilors are your hands, ears, eyes, and mouths.   They all have different capabilities, strengths, and vulnerabilities.   Loyalty might also be cause for concern at some point.   You may have to make some hard choices down the road if that comes into play.  

There's also the other perplexing issue of the RNG dice rolls.  You'll have situations where you have like a 92% chance of succeeding, and somehow the game still finds a way for you to fail the roll.  For those cases, I'd like you all to remember an old saying from this game's spiritual grandfather:  ""That's X-com, baby!""

Its has a little 'visual' effect like the first 90's xcom, world spinning, but the game isn't about shooting aliens in squads tho.  It is a higher level Admin of your faction trying to keep the world from falling apart, and build it up enough to get into space.   That's the first 10ish hours,  then the ?2nd? phase of expanding your orbital ability,  2.5 phase sending out probes and mining outposts,  that is next 10 hours, while also having to balance the world to keep it still spinning.  3rd phase? ships and fighting?  maybe other human factions but the Aliens transports are x10 to x20 the power of the first 'ship' you could make, and it would be very difficult to amass enough with all the world issues and command limits.

WARNING:  The game is not ""easy"" to play, nor is the tutorial great.  You will spend the first hour or so feeling quite lost unless you watch some Youtube videos first or something.  I am on around my 3rd attempt, and the game seems to be going well, so it isn't impossible to learn.  I have the US/Canada/Mexico on lockdown as mine, and them am slowly working on figuring out the rest of the game systems.

Anyway, the graphics aren't bad, the game mechanics are very detailed and interesting, and setting is fun and inventive one that is pulling a bit from X-com and a bit from SM's Alpha Centauri and a bit for the paradox style grand strategy games.  And the different factions with completely different goals is brilliant.  IT should really expand the replayability.

I would STRONGLY recommend this game if you like any of those three types of games, and very strongly recommend it if you like all three.

There are some minor bugs, and the game definitely needs a bit more polishing particularly around ease of use, tool tips, and explaining how the various systems fit together and how important they are.  For example you can ""investigate your rivals agents, and interrogate them, does this matter at all, is it balanced, are you better off just focusing on your own stuff and ignoring them, who knows?!?!?!?.  I doubt all of that is really well balanced currently.  Its also not clear why say when you build up your support in rather stable well functioning countries, it can erode quite quickly even without apparent enemy action.  Is this to be expected?  Is trying to be at 50% support a fools errand?  Who knows, once again.

But the game is pretty interesting and fun and really has the potential to be great and an all time memorable one if the developers have the resources and time to stitch it all together and balance it all, while working on legibility and ease-of-use some.  There are not too many bugs, just a few tools tips that were working, but were later broken.  Also the tutorial goal to launch a probe didn't fire when I launched a probe.  

But overall the games, works, has lots of content, and looks like it will be worth many many dozens of hours of play if not hundreds.

So buy this game if you are interested.  But I would caution anyone who doesn't like having to work at games a bit and figure them out.  There will be some of that here, so if that isn't your thing maybe wait until long after full release when there are amazing Youtube walkthroughs and guides and such.",1664328803,1664328803,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Okay, that's enough form my Pavonis Interactive ultra-fanboy spirit.

Let me tell you a story related to Pavonis to put you into context of this review:

Almost 10 years ago; i played XCOM: Enemy Unknown while loving X-COM and knowing the franchise as a good one, i played a pirate copy; and loved it absolutely. In 2015 on my 21st birthday when i had use of Steam and stopped pirated games, i found out about Long War, and wow... i was like... ""What is that?"". I then read that you need an original Steam copy of the game to play that mod, which i did bought with the money i received as a birthday gift, played the mod... AND FUCKING LOVED IT!

Then, i didn't only saw  that it was English-only, but also that Johnny was ""hiring"" people to be junior contributors to ""work"" as translators for different languages. Localization was easy to edit, so no programming knowledge needed. I immediately asked for the ""job"", and they hired me along with two other guys. We didn't get along, and the ""job"" was kinda a disaster, but then the other two guys quitted, and by doing it solo, i prevailed! I then translated the whole mod, to the last word, to Spanish, and people loved it! Johnny was so happy that he paid me U$D 10 and allowed me to be part of his new game developing company, Long War Studios, later known as... Pavonis Interactive. I then promised Johnny to give all my suport  to the gam upon knowing he was gonna make this masterpiece. Sure, i couldn't be a backer on his Kickstarter or anything else, but i immediately bought the game upon it's release today Monday, September 26th. Argentine pesos' price got me by surprise, i miscalculated that 40 dollars were gonna be around AR$ 500 since Hearts of Iron 4 was at the same American price and wasn't Early Access like this one, but i did it for Johnny, loaded more money, and got the game like bear with honey! (Lmao i suck as a rapper xD)

TL;DR. Sorry, got carried away. Onto the review!

I played the demo for FOUR hours... and loved it! Promising! For a demo, it was pretty complete. The only thing i hated, and it is why i love this no matter what, is that the demo had no save feature, which made me start all over again if i wanted it play another day.

The game, for Early Access, is pretty complete, with a lot of promised content. Awesome... more than HoI4

Oh yeah, i am so daring with it, i am bold enough to say that it is sure this game will hoard all attention from the new ""By Blood Alone"" DLC of HoI4

Do believe me, despite the big price (U$D 40 = AR$ 2000, AR$ 1800 with 10% off!), it is a good experience, just started my game, played for a bit and left it to write this review BECAUSE I AM SO SURE ABOUT ITS AWESOMENESS! (And also... because i was visiting my nephews far away, and had only a crappy laptop (Load time... about 45 minutes) and a 1MB/s inernet (That made me download the game for HOURS!) so i couldn't play much, but i already know how to play thanks to the demo).

Did i already said this is better han Hearts of Iron ? Well, imagine... playing it with the goal of conquering the entire world as one single country, and you do it and... that's it, The End! WELL NO! On Terra Invicta, your objective, regardless of the faction you play as (Well, not quite so, there are some others with other goals), is to control all the world AND build a spaceship and battle aliens and control other planets and that. Can you do tht on Hearts of Iron 4? NO!

Basically, one fraction of the game is like Hearts of Iron 4 , and the other... well... it's... well, i dunno with  which game to compate, but it is awesome!

That being said... Terra Invicta gives us signs that Pavonis Interactive is a growing game developing company that has the enire potential of the world, and I SWEAR IT IS LIKE THIS!

And OMG IT HAD ACHIEVEMENTS! Achievements that make it better! Jesus Friggin' Christ, I thought it wasn't gonna have them! Real genius! Big sale!

TL;DR, just... buy and play, you'll never regret it. Worth every cent.

It's VERY large in scope. You start the game off on Earth in the year 2022, and an alien ship has crashed on Earth, humanity is no longer alone. There are several factions that you can play as that have differing viewpoints on how to deal with the aliens. These groups range from just resisting them, eradicating them and all who support them, making them see us as equals, appeasing them, or flat out bowing the knee to them. These factions can do things like direct global research towards stuff in the tech tree, control nations from the shadows X-Files / Illuminati Style, and even cause nations to break apart or form Great Nations that span entire continents. 

But that's just what happens on Earth. You'll eventually have to go to space, and you can build outposts, fight the aliens, build ships and stations, all that good stuff. It kind of goes from ""X-Files"" in the Early Game to ""The Expanse"" in late game. 

Oh and I almost forgot, there are new starting scenarios coming too, mainly a Cold War Era Starting Scenario. It's not in yet but they are planning it for full release. Right now it just starts in 2022, with the world and it's nations as it is as of September 2022.

It starts with an illuminati style fight over the worlds nations between the different ideological factions, grows to include to solar system colonization and travel simulator, and all the while playing a hidden, and then overt war against the alien infiltration forces in all battle spaces.

You will fight for supremacy on mars, take over Servant colonies with orbital drop assaults with your space marine forces from your space fleets, deal with kessler syndrome in earth orbit from all the space debris, interdict alien assault landings on earth with orbital railgun attacks as their armies debark their massive landing ships, and play a ruthless cat and mouse game with other agents, as you steal their secrets, sabotage their plans, assassinate their operatives all the while protecting your own.

Marshalling the resources of the world while interaction with the other factions, and (depending on faction) protecting against the alien onslaught, and hopefully finally blowing them all the way back to the the depths of space they came from.

Ignore all the negative reviews that complain about some political representation whine - the devs have done a very good job to represent the actual current state of the world, and having systems to very accurately approximate interactions, economies and research.

Furthermore, the game has progressed very well since the early published demo, with vast QOL improvements in the 3 months since.

The game is already enjoyable now, and I believe will only become better as the devs fix more bugs, add more QOL updates, and continue to expand the game scenarios and other functions.

For the point above I'd only recommend the game (at this point in time during EA) to a) hardcore 4x fans, b) people that have the time and patience to learn the mechanics and c) people that played the demo, enjoyed it and want to support the devs.

In these few hours of gameplay I'm only 3 years into the game with 1 station in low orbit of Earth and Moon and 1 moon base. Nowhere near early-mid game, it still feels early game, but despite that I feel like I need to bring some criticism for the devs / bad points of the game for potential buyers.

1. The Tutorial needs an overhaul. The current tutorial tries its best to explain things but its still severely lackluster and I found it easier to just experiment and learn as I go than read what the devs have put in. This game needs to hold your hand whenever you do something new for the first time. And I don't mean a text pop up explaining things, the game needs to guide you visually on what you must do each step of the way (again, for the first time).

Alternatively you can also give the choice to the player on how hand-holdy your tutorial is, for example like Total War Warhammer does it (nothing, minimal, medium or what I like to call ""this is my first rodeo, walk me through each step"").

2. The UI needs a rework. This works hand in hand with the tutorial I mentioned above, there is a lot of mouse hovering over things to get tooltips to understand what you need to do but this is where it fails. Take Nation Priorities, there's a massive list of priorities you can choose from and each influence a certain aspect of the nation. The only way to see what each priority influences what is by selecting each and every one of them and then choosing. This becomes tedious when you forget (and you will) what they do later down the line. 

There is a Codex in the game and there is an entry for Priorities (and Economy) but why the devs haven't added each priority in the codex to let us know what they influence is a mystery to me. At the same time, this is why the UI needs an overhaul, why not have the changes appear as you mouse over each priority rather than selecting it?

Other than that in these few hours I've played I've not ran into any bugs or crashes and being still early in the game I've not noticed any performance issues, so I cannot comment on that yet. 

But, like I said in the beginning this is the type of game I always wanted from the 4x genre (so my end opinion is rather biased), its innovative and I applaud the devs for undertaking this. The sheer scale of things happening at the same time once you get a foothold and start unlocking tech just gives you that ""one more round"" feel you get from Civilization games (even though this game is not turn based). 

And to top it off, the solar system is massive (if you chose it to be massive) and I've yet to even scratch the surface of it, just zooming out and seeing the potential targets I can exploit gives me great joy.",1664276531,1664276695,True,2,0,0.544025182723999023,0,True,False,True

Why is that warning there? Because this game is slow-paced. Yes, not a lot will be happening for a good portion while you wait for the mission phase. Yes, you'll be waiting on resources to be able to launch things.

This isn't Stellaris - you're constantly managing resources, and (Unless you did what I did and accidentally ended up with $400 a day at one point... still not entirely sure what I did, but it made things awesome) unlike Stellaris, where diplomacy boils down to 'Do I like You? No? Can I easily conquer you', you've got a plethora of options to choose from.

YES, you can roll a critical failure and reset your entire popular opinion in a country - that's part of a weighted RNG. Weighted RNG is the best way to describe the back-end sort of RPG mechanics you have. 95%+ does not mean complete success (100% does, though, and that makes me happy as an OG XCOM fan), but neither does 23%. Your skill factors in somewhat, but it's like a (+X) in Dungeons and Dragons - if you roll a fail regardless, unless you're basically a GOD at it, you will fail. 

I take to these sorts of games very quickly, but I'm also a huge sucker for logistics and management simulators (I play the ORIGINAL XCOM games from the 90s, that should tell you something). This game is not for everyone, and is very much a NICHE title. 

However, Pavonis has a solid foundation for a game, and that makes me happy.

Something that several other people have mentioned - the tech tree.

The Tech Tree is wonky, to be honest. You get ship parts you can't use well before you're even able to consider designing an interplanetary warship. Resources like Water don't seem to be well explained exactly where to get them (I'm ASSUMING Asteroid Mining, but I've not found that yet), and you will often have TOO MUCH CHOICE to start out. Keep in mind, though - your propellant tanks, instead of being Fuel, are what your Delta-V setup is derived from.

Various other things are not as well explained, but this is Early Access - I did unfortunately keep up with Space Engineers right up until it hit '1.0.' This, however, is far more fleshed out  in Early Access than SE after God only knows how many years.

Anyways, despite a bit of a rocky launch, the unfortunate aspect of the Tutorial not ACTUALLY talking about controls and such (I had to puzzle my way through before I eventually hit the right button - I try to puzzle it before I look at keybinds), yes I can recommend this, but only to the sorts of people who are into this type of game like I am.

This will never be like HOI4 or Stellaris - please stop hounding the developers to make it an unfortunate crapshoot like a lot of Paradox titles. This game has a much more in-depth system, and you have much more fine-tuned control right  out of the gate, if you're willing to learn the systems.

And remember, the CODEX is your friend - it explains most of the mechanics. The rest... are learned through play.",1664263838,1664263838,True,70,0,0.790119946002960205,0,True,False,True

I haven't played a lot so far but I can tell you that this is game feels incomplete. The grand strategy part looks awesome, its complex and challenging - its exactly what I've always wanted to have in an X-Com game. But ... its missing the other part that I totally loved about the X-com games : the turn based tactical battles vs the aliens.

Now I didn't know what to expect from this but I can only go with what I got, which is a rather pricey game which isn't delivering very well. 

It needs more work before being released, (Yes I understand early access but there are layers to that) it needs a much stronger tutorial and intro I've got no idea what's going on anywhere or even what we're supposed to be doing precisely, I got to choose a faction based on name and that's it, there's no overview on strengths and weaknesses and overarching goals for said faction. I get that it's going to be one of those incredibly indepth strategy experiences which isn't everyone's cup of tea. If you include a system which is over the top in complexity with no explanations on that complexity then you should really find a way to build up to managing that complexity not just dump the player straight in with a 'figure it out'  maybe you'll like it eventually approach. 

I guess I was expecting something like XCOM but with just much more of everything and if that's what you're expecting too then don't buy it because damn it's just not that. It appears to be a pure strategy interface with very clunky controls a massively confusing/irritating UI. Yes I'm sure they are going to/planning to improve it but they charged a full release price for something which is anything but. 

From what I've seen so far It should be around a quarter of the asking price especially for it's state of early access.

Before you think I'm a ""filthy casual"" - I play Stellaris, HOI, and spend 30 minutes before even taking off in flight sims. I WAS EXCITED FOR THIS ever since the demo and played that until the end. And yes I know this is early access. This is a review on the current state and my experience.

I have played for 9.1 hours, and the majority of that was just the same old repetition back and fourth of increasing public opinion, increasing stability as you undo all the AI agent actions because to get more agents it's a late-mid game 200,000 *collective research* item (THEN the actual tech as *faction research* since the 200,000 just *unlocked* it). You won't experience this immediately, but you will eventually.

The balance is off. The EU forms much earlier than any other ""Great Nation"" (basically just one big giant continent country). Canada + USA + Mexico and other Great Nations are locked behind a 25,000 research tech. So until then you're stuck just playing wack a mole with the AI. Not to mention how the AI magically will fly in and capture a point you just took back a day before, in the same turn/week.

BUT NOW THERE'S ENEMY AGENTS IN YOUR CAPITAL! No problem! Your own top agents are already there and you've got the home advantage. WRONG - You will spend the same amount of Special Ops points in your capital to detain an agent as you would in a foreign territory (maybe there's a difference, if there is, then it's basically non-existent).  And now the next problem:

It's basically impossible to ""eliminate"" an agent without detaining them first. The Espionage skill is just for Eliminating, not Detaining. So when you do have an enemy agent captured, you'll STILL have to spend Special Ops points when you tell your level 10 Espionage Super Spy to take them out - OR ELSE HE WILL FAIL. Yes, your super spy can't deal with a tied up agent unless you spend the very same points it took to capture them in the first place.

So, just eliminate other factions right? I tried that. I didn't even flip a control point yet. A few turns later I had all my control points under attack by AI that were never there before and had no business being in North America except to make me deal with them.

WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID, I could tolerate if it just wasn't so SLOW. Your agent completes their task and there's still many days left in the week, what if they went and did something else? No. Skip to the end of the week? No. You have to wait until the week is over. It's the result of equation: RTS + Turn Based = 

I'm used to long games. But there's no progression for a ridiculous amount of time and no point to do anything with the aliens or space during this period while you try not to drown in constant harassment from enemy agents and trying to research your way out of the the tiny cap limits.

The balance will probably change, which is good. Others on discord make similar points and the developers are receptive.

And I just noticed - a lot of the reviews have 150+ hours, some even over 1,000. The game has been out for less than 24 hours, so these reviews must be from experienced closed alpha/beta players. That doesn't make them wrong - but you should be aware of that.

For $40 just hang on, it needs more time to get ironed out.

Its early access, but mostly feature complete, with a dedicated dev team that has made significant changes since the demo version a few months ago, and is very interactive with the community. 

The game has some really interesting ideas. For instance rather than playing a nation, the player controls an ideological faction. Ideas cant be killed off, they always find roots in new influential people and new institutions. The player controls a council of the handful of most influential people who subscribe to that ideology, and these characters have rather traditional rpg style stats, gaining xp to spend on increased attributes and feats. Rather than ""gear"" you equip organizations and institutions to them, buffing their skills and abilities. The game pauses twice per month, giving you time to assign 1 mission per character around the world, the missions available vary depending on character class, background, skills, etc. You fight among 7 other human ideological positions and the aliens over control of nations, territory on the moon, planets, comets and asteroids. 

The space battles are on the realistic side of the scale, think perhaps the expanse tv show. You will need to consider delta v, launch windows, etc.  The designs are fun, with lots of parts, however their design philosophy was to include nearly all current theoretical and in-use rocket,fuel types, and parts. meaning there is a ton of objectively better or worse parts, and no real way to know which will be useful to you before you research them.

The research tree is fun, with an absurd amount of stuff in it. Another cool unique aspect is that most technologies are researched by humanity itself, with all factions contributing and unlocking things together. The faction that contributed the most gets to choose the next tech to be researched. A faction may choose not to contribute much at all, focusing on their own private technologies and engineering projects. but that is at the expense of all of humanities tech tree progress.

There is a strong focus on logistics, space exploration and industrialization, economic development or exploitation, and political tensions and federations. You will spend a lot of time micromanaging economic pips of territories, micromanaging national policies, annexing regions etc. Over time you can slowly consolidate your territories in to larger federations, meaning less and less micromanaging small territories, but at the same time, space (and war) will take more and more of your focus. 

My write up here isn't really a review, more just my thought on why I enjoy the game and who else it may be suited to. This is not a perfect game, its slow, has somewhat obtuse ui, and a bucketful of mechanics that nearly any other developer would never have touched with a ten foot pole. These things don't bother me.

Firstly the game's scope is incredible and secondly developer response to criticism is genuine. It is wonderfully complex but simultaneously quite obtuse and some UI elements that could have some improvement. 

Firstly battle/conflict needs to have expanded tooltips on how it works, particularly what factors contribute to occupation. I might have missed it, but it isn't apparent to me what factors contribute to occupation score.
Secondly the tech advancement UI (when you've newly researched a technology) could be cleaned up, perhaps using different colored fonts to show what techs a newly unlocked tech leads to as well as separating the quote/VO from the general description of the tech.
Thirdly the news bar could be improved so that the player can choose which events they deem critical, perhaps highlighting them, while also allowing the player to customize which events are displayed there in the first place. It is very cluttered at present.
UI performance feels sluggish at times, I don't have an insane PC and I am running this through Proton but I have noticed the biggest frame drops (from an otherwise smooth 60) come from UI interaction.

So far it is incredible for an early access release, the core game is already implemented and this is the polishing phase. I am surprised by the complexity when I shouldn't be, as the devs are those responsible for the XCOM Long war mod.",1664247093,1664247093,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its Early Access, but already showing a great deal of progress since the demo (which I played the hell out of).

The biggest downside at the moment is the UI. It is very reflective of the complexity of the game. Whereas a great UI should simplify complexity on the face, and allow you to easily dive into the detailed versions. More hover-over tool tips would be great.

I haven't gotten to trying out the space combat yet, but I found it pretty intimidating to try and interact with in the demo.

Good game, that I would definitely recommend to anyone who is into the style, setting and complexity. But with a steep learning curve. Things are going to happen that you don't understand what has caused it. Unknown unknowns.

The gameplay tries a lot of pretty novel stuff, like realistic timescale for engagements in space, building etc.
This game has also quite a bit of managerial complexity, which i like.
The game ran smooth, mostly without glitches.

Having said that, this is not polished enough to be enjoyable, it lacks a ton of tooltips.
It does not specify a lot of what value does what, so i was basically guessing.
The Ui makes little sense in a lot of cases, as well as there were buttons i didnt realise i could press for over 2+ hours ingame, that drastically changed things.
The time scales are...well huge, after 9 hours on max speed, i barely felt like i got anywhere.
This is not a game where you holding territory becomes the most important thing, but instead your operatives and how you cultivate them is key, since you can overthrow governments, as can your enemy, turning it to a game of whackamole. (so dont think HoI4, or Xcom).

Overall, i must say that for this price, and at this stage i would not recommend you buying the game. 
Having said that i will give it a positive review since i see potential here.
Just hold off till its more polished.

The political aspect with all the factions fighting for influence over the different nations of the works is very cool.

The UI and tutorial definitely leave a lot to be desired. The UI does a very poor job of explaining what things do in most cases. The tutorial tries to explain what things do but doesn't really guide you in how to utilize the information. I think having a stricter tutorial mode that holds your hand and forces certain set decisions and explains to the player why that was the right or wrong move and why you should have done it would be better. Normally I am not in favor of tutorials like that, but in a game with this many systems and depth, it seems almost necessary as once you unpause, you're on your own and things are just going. A dedicated tutorial mode that jumped you through different stages of the game and went into more depth would work very well for this game.

Overall, with my current time played in the release version and many many hours spent in the demo, I would definitely recommend this game, at this price point, to anyone that is a fan of deep grand strategy games.

Some features are still unclear to me, so I'll have to update my review later.  I've restarted three times to get a feel for the early game, and noticed that with some games I could take control points that belong to other factions and in other saves I couldn't.  I can't figure out what the difference was between them, as all saves had the mission available for open control points.

My only other complaints are 1) that the AI seems to build potential and the blindside you in a frenzy of actions.  It seems nearly impossible to prepare for.  And 2) that the United States is god tier powerful despite having the worst stability of the entire Western world -- it seems like a meme version of the nation.

If you're used to games like, say, Hearts of Iron 3, which is infamous for being inaccessible to new players, then you might jump into this one and be fine.

If you're not, however, then this one might just be a wall of frustration.

The concept of the game is that humanity has made first contact with aliens, that have crash landed on the planet. You take charge of a faction, and work to politically take control of nations behind the scenes, so you can unify Earth to either kick alien butt, or bend over and hand them the lubricant as your new overlords.

To do this, you initially get two (random) agents, who have various stats and strengths, and you send them out to take over 'control points' of various countries. Once you take control of a point, you get to direct the country's economic output ~ be prepared to look at pop ups telling you that 1 point in the Military will suppress unrest by 0.00000035%, and unrest goes up by 0.25% per turn, so lol, you do you as you try and figure out if that's worth mitigating at all.

And herein is the problem with this game, it is just trivial stats hidden in mouse-over pop ups, the UI/UX elements are poor, the tutorial is flimsy, even on the forums right now, from the developers to other players the advice is; ""Check out the (poorly written atm) wiki tutorial"" or ""Watch videos and streamers.""

No. That's lazy game design, the tutorial and general aims of a game should be telegraphed quite clearly within the game itself. Handing players off to watch streamers to learn the mechanics of the game is like how politicians hand off critical social issues to charity, it's passing the buck, shirking responsibility, and that's annoying as hell, which is why I'm not recommending the game at all.

Fix the UI up, make the tutorial more clearer, more concise, and guide the player a little more (especially on the first run) and they may be on course to take off their training wheels on their second/third playthrough, but at the moment, it's sort of like the guy who tested his parachute by jumping off the Eiffel Tower, (spoiler alert: he died), it's just not that fun.

So, for now, I don't recommend this at all, I'll keep at it for a bit, because there is a lot of potential somewhere in the mess of information this game throws at me, but without some solid changes to the introduction of the game and tutorial, I'm unsure if I'll switch to recommending this at the moment.",1664227200,1664227212,False,395,11,0.832299113273620605,0,True,False,True

I'm going to be clear, this game needs you to pay at least a bit of attention, it will not be quick. If you want a quick strategy game, look elsewhere.

I can't really explain the game without describing my demo playthrough. I picked up the game with the intent to break it, I grabbed Guatemala (don't ask) early on and set out to slowly grow it. As I was waiting and harvesting I spotted that Canada was open and up for grabs! I lined up my 2 diplomatically inclined councillors and swept in, in a single mission cycle I had control of canada. With this I now focused on growing a military and most importantly space race points! Researching the deep system research revealed the depth and breadth of the alien presence, my neighbours the academy were devastated as their cause was made to look a bit naive. And as a result their control points in the US were laid bare, my hardened commando swept in and began overturning their control. Whilst I was doing this the Alien lovers were flipping South and Central America (barring the mighty bastion of Guatemala), the USA is famous for having at least a modest army. So using this I bulldoze through Central America. Now using these resources I began setting up a station with the intent of colonising the moon, a war broke out between Iran and China and the exchange of Nukes began heating the planet. Meanwhile the aliens began appearing in greater and more titanic numbers. My forces in central america were devastated by a rampaging... umm... thing. The world teetered on a precipice and that is where the demo ended for me. I am completely obsessed right now, the amount of moving parts is remarkable. I look forward to exploring it and seeing how the developers grow the game. Brilliant.

I have only played 3 hours so far, but I did not regret buying this game at all. To be fair, Terra Invicta is far from finished, but there are good reasons why you should buy this game. I can only hope that the developers bear though the first phase of early access game in order to create something truly ""grand"". It has been too long since anyone properly challenged Paradox Interactive which has grown big and lazy. 

Here are the main reasons why I had this game on my radar for a long time:

1. Great premise and setting.
2. Very original conception and game mechanics.
3. Developed by a small studio.
4. Visible sign that the developers have spent a lot of time and passion into this game. 
5. One of the few games that challenges bigger studios in the ""grand"" strategy genre. 
6. After 3 hours of gameplay I have experienced no major bugs. 

Of course, if you are short on money, I can only give you fair warnings which can be applied to all Early Access games:
1. It is very complicated.
2. There is a lot of need for re-balancing and polishing. I think it will take at least 6 months until the true potential of this game can come out. With Paradox games, the studio will have a lot of money and support to do that, with smaller developes that is always uncertain.
3. Some instructions and mechanics in this game seems to be counterintuitive, and the UI needs a lot of work to be streamlined.
4. The Tutorial is confusing and unclear, and could scare some players off. 
5. Apprently the Chinese localization is not very good, so for now one should be playing it in English.
