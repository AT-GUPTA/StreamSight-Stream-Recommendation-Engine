Thousands and millions of wasted gamehours. And euros. ~~

- Proud owner of the #1 Battlemage (EU) ages ago :))


<There could be more things in this review but ill just put the things that come first in my mind>


Positive:

+ Region combining added more players and motivation into it. Noice.
+ Overall, I feel like the game is going into right direction, since you dont need years of playtime (or 5000â‚¬) to make a high end character. 

~ Quick example about playtime: 
Pre Big Bang update in 8 hours of pure grinding you got to lvl 30.
Now pure grinding of 8 hours will get you to lvl 130. But it will get a lot slower after that ye.
~ Quick example about high end characters / money waste: 
You used to need literally hundreds of euros to scroll and cube a high tier weapon(/item)
Now you dont need the scrolls (Reboot) and can get the cubes with mesos (Reboot also)


Negative:

- Probably no player will keep playing or understand the greatness of this 2D Anime MMORPG if they have never played it before (back in the days). I just feel like it xDD come on look at this game....",1486998310,1505411657,True,4,0,0.532102704048156738,0,True,False,False

The reason I have only 0.1 hours is because I use the game launcher.

The game has lost so much ever since I came back to it. I remember back in the days when party questing was live, I was always looking forward to party questing with other people but now they took the fun out of it. In party quest areas, you may find like 1 or 2 peeps, that is not enough to get you into one, and they may be 80% be afk They may try to attract you to the game by putting up events but it really is not worth it. Try another game. Plus Game Masters look investigater and suspend/ban legit players who report real hackers and let the hackers roam while they put the legit players on the ground for a month. It is just absurd, they are taking the very incentive that makes us report hackers, to get them banned. The community is pretty much dead as well. If you are looking to play, don't, you will just be wasting your time as have I.

-I got banned for no reason. I was not using any illegal programs nor was I violating any policy. I have been playing all day and suiciding on purpose to not over level so I could play with someone while I look for some equipments. I am greatly disatisfied with this suspension as there are real hackers that I see on the server and I am always reporting them when I see them, but instead, I am the one that gets falsely accused by the program. This is unfair not just to me but the whole community as well. People who do not use illegal programs, such as myself, getting banned while the real ones stay botting or w.e., this is to be not treaded lightly.
     Their customer service is not implemented well, when asked to provide information on why I was banned, all I got was ""I understand that this is very upsetting, but any evidence obtained by Nexon is proprietary and we will not be able to release that information."" and they would change the subject towards abiding the Terms of Services before playing the game. These gamemasters would keep saying that they had checked their evidence and would pass judgement on me by banning me but when they are asked to provide the evidence, they would avoid it (I believe they randomly ban people, that is why they do not hand out proof on why people get banned). Every response mentioned insisted that I should have read the Terms of Services and that I should commit to the agreement before I play. As to my knowledge, I have never broken any of those rules, I have gone through the list that they gave me multiple times and still unable to acknowledge the ban because I have never broke any of thoe terms and conducts they have provided. In addition, my time and effort put into leveling up my characters as fast as possible is labeled as leveling exploit (I was leveling so fast because I was strong and using the 1.5x/2x they gave us and the buffs that came with the event). I basically got banned for leveling up too fast, and when I tried to appeal, they ignored my requests and gave me no proof; I bet they did not want to admit that they banned the wrong person. In conclusion, I realized that they do not give a rat's ass about what we have to say. If these Gamemasters were judges, I am pretty sure they would pass the wrong judgements upon people such as letting the bad ones stay in society; meanwhile, caging the good ones in jail.

Maplestory has been around forever, bless its heart, but I just can't recommend this game. I could barely recommend it when it came out, and only because there wasn't much to choose from. For starters, they delete your characters after a time. I think this is the third time I have re-downloaded the game, played a bit, and come back to find everything gone.

It has serious scaling and lag issues. We have much better computers these days but still, Maplestory continues to run shittily and at a low resolution. The soundtracks are too repetitive. 

It has some serious frustrating issues with gameplay, like having to use the mouse to interact with NPCs when everything else is strictly keyboard controls. Monsters spawn right on top of you and without delay, picking up items is irritating, and the controls feel laggy. Going from town to monster-fighting areas is near infuriating. The number of keyboard bindings is dizzying for a game that feels like simple hack-n-slash.

Pros
-Mechanics are pretty fun
-Animations mostly look great
-Music is excellent and nostalgic
-Unique mob designs
-Variety of classes
Cons
-Extremely Repetitive (Even if you come into it expecting to grind for hours, its still feels repetitive)
-Inconsistent servers with re-occuring maintenances
-Only a couple of servers are populated
-Pay to win system on standard servers
-Insanely annoying and frustrating upgrade system.
-Must dedicate a lot of time to even have access to the fun content of the game 
-Unrewarding levelling system

I know that change is needed for games to progress, but so many changes killed the game.

Pros:
- if you're a fan of mario style games or platformers and like to see big numbers when you hit monster, then try out this game
- it's not a grindy game anymore, *sadly* (at least not from lvl 1-200)
- amazing map BGM's
- a lot of friendly people still and so on

Cons:
- p2w
- bugs, bugs and yes, more bugs! ""yay!""
- gets a bit grindy past 200 and gets a lot grindy past 200 if you didn't pay a lot of real money into it
- the company NEXON America, doesn't care about their customers/players

I could go on forever with the cons and some more pros, but I'll stop here. If you're a new player, I suggest you try this game, but it won't feel ""magical"" anymore.

The steam version of this game seems to have a lot of issues regarding starting the game, on most occasions I have to start my game up about 5 or so times before it finally decides it either doesn't want to crash or it actually wants to connect me to the servers.

Aside from that this game is quite enjoyable. Early game progression is rather fast and you level up relatively quickly, but for me once you start reaching into the 80s it gets a bit tedious. The game can be excessively grindy and it feels like most of your time slaughtering the same enemy 200 times is wasted when you're only given a couple thousand exp. 

Even though the game can be overly grindy it makes up for it with its constant events. A lot of the events in Maplestory stem from special item drops that can be opened to give some sort of special currency, consumables, or trait boosting items. This adds a little extra value from grinding and you're usually able to buy pretty cool cosmetic items or chairs with the special currency.

I'd also like to add that this game is a lot more fun with people you can talk to or a group of in-game friends. The boss party match making isn't very good and more often than not if you are able to be thrown into a party its with one other person and they leave it just to solo the boss anyway.

Party dungeons or themed quests don't have a matchmaking system and as of right now I have a hard time finding anyone willing to party up on my lower level characters.

Back then, spending money in this game didn't provide much besides character looks like hair changes, skin color changes, eye changes, hair color changes, etc. Now if you want to have the best item in the game you have to fork over tons of money in HOPES of getting the right stats for an item. The game has constantly been changing, which is nice, but for veterans who quit and wish to come back, they really see the difference. I myself used to play this game before pirates were out. Even during that time period, I felt like there was never enough people to play because the world was so large and people were constantly doing their own thing trying to do whatever quest they thought they had to do, making it hard to find memebers for certain level party quests. I bet even now it's still a huge problem. People also realize how pay to win this game is. Only people who are dumping hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, into this game are still around because they have spent so much time and money in this game. Nexon constantly wants to provide ""support"" by doing maintanence, but they either do nothing or add more bugs somehow. Crashing was very uncommon in the early days of this game, and when I played this last year I crashed trying to log in, trying to select a server, and after I finally got in, I crashed just play the game. How does this even happen? Maplestory was, and most likely is probably, one of my favorite MMORPGs because it was a cute styled game with very simple mechanics but also much to do. Now all you have is a company who doesn't truly care for their game, begging for money by making everything hard to do without certain items which you can obtain easier/only with real money.
