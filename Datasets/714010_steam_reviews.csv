After all these years the game is still inconsisted as hell. Random in this game is a disaster. After you hit slowly moving large target you can get super-fast super-small target which instantly disappears making you lose score. With all that random bs game counts all the stats together and even dares to give you some suggestions like ""your aim is bad bro, git gud"". Leaderboards are also just thrown together still for all sorts of different stuff ;) It's even shared for different settings (e.g. with recoil both enabled and disabled).
By playing Aim Lab you'll actually learn how to play Aim Lab (and nothing more). This is self-contained game with its own weapon and enemies mechanics. It has nothing to do with modern shooter games. Personally I'd like to see realistic bots (not poorly scripted ones that move depending on your cursor), magazine size limit and weapon recoil, more realistic scenarios to train for more sophisticated games like maybe Apex Legends: crouching and sliding enemies (which should change target shape and speed), ballistics for bullets (for games like Battlefield).
Targets should not be freakin spheres! Shooting spheres won't help much in landing headshots in real games. So more realistic bots should be implemented and score should be calculated depending on damage done depending on where your bullets land: limbs, body or head.
 
Also game wants you to create separate account, though it could just authorize you with your steam id.

In terms of the ""AI"", don't put too much expectation on that, since it is really basic and it seems to me they just collect your past training data and average those data in AI training mode.

Playing many games competitively such as Rainbow Six Siege, Overwatch, CSGO, and other fps such as battlefields, I need better mouse control, and this game helped me a very large amount, more than I expected honestly. I had tried other online programs that never helped until I bought this. Literally in the first day my numbers shot up, and in one day my reaction speed has increased from 1.2 seconds to about .4 seconds. And although it is in beta and is rather unfinished (only as of now), its still a good investment, plus the team working on it actively listens to the community, doing hot patches and updates fixing bugs, which I only encountered two of in the first place. I highly recomend this for people who struggle with mouse control, snapping, reaction speed, and even placing targets. The UI is easy to manuever, the game looks great, and it feels it. Also to add, the data graphing and recording is displayed very well, its easy to read, and shows progress from your first time playing a mode to the most recent.

it's the same but more options and for damn free!

About the Aimlab:
From watching the trailer i expected a lot more from this game/trainer, but it seems you guy's have invested more into the promotion video then in the game itself.

- You can set the sensitivity & FOV for your selected game but the FOV is always set vertical even if the selected game uses horizontal! 
So when you select a game like overwatch (which uses a horizontal FOV) it's not possible to set the right FOV unless you know the vertical FOV responding with the used horizontal FOV from overwatch (which i doubt anyone just knows)
This means that everytime you shoot a bullet with a different FOV than the one you use in Overwatch you actually break down your build up muscle memory and aim instead of improving it!

- Only 1 basic handgun
- No hitsounds
- No projectiles
- No recoil paterns
- No spread paterns
- No scopes
- Bad quality GFX even when set to ultra
- Crosshair customization bugs, crosshair lines are very hard to line up with each other and NO BLACK OUTLINE so it becomes hard to see when flying over objects with somehow the same color.
- A lot of sound bugs
- Penta-kill mode is a rip from Aimhero and is totally useless.
- AI mode is a joke, the enemies are zombies that are just wandering around or do i have to say floating because they aren't running from what i can see. And occasionally shooting a bullet with gfx like Duke Nukem 3D which is a 22 year old game.

And i can go on and on, buttom line is. This is a RIP-OFF and doesn't come close to the things they promissed!
I'm gonna ask my money back!

It claims to support Overwatch, CS:GO etc. sensitivity scales except it offers no method for converting ADS sensitivity of those games, only hip fire. There's a random ""ADS sensitivity"" field asking for a number without any means of properly converting ADS sensitivity from games it claims to support. 

For example. If you use Relative Zoom Sensitivity 38 in Overwatch as your ADS modifier you can't convert that to match the sensitivity of the Aim Lab pistol, rifle or sniper in ADS.

End result is that Aim Lab will RUIN your aim because you will be playing it with a mismatched sensitivity and destroy your muscle memory. Stay away from this one, does more harm than good.",1518358279,1518358279,False,3,0,0.514230191707611084,1,True,False,True
