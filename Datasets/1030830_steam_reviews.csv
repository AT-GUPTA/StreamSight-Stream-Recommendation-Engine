[quote][b]""Forget about loyalty. It's a luxury you can't afford in this line of work."" - Vito Scaletta[/b][/quote]

Mafia II: Definitive Edition throws you headfirst into the world of organized crime in 1940s America. You take on the role of Vito Scaletta, a young Italian-American man who gets entangled with the mob after a chance encounter. The story follows Vito's rise through the ranks of the family, navigating a world of violence, betrayal, and the allure of easy money.

[h2]Story: A Gripping Gangster Tale[/h2]

Mafia II's narrative is a rollercoaster ride of action, suspense, and emotional gut punches. The characters, from the hot-headed Joe Barbaro to the stoic Leo Galante, are well-developed and memorable, each with their own motivations and flaws. The dialogue is sharp and witty, peppered with profanity that feels true to the era and the characters' world. While the story might not break new ground, it's a well-told gangster tale that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Don't expect choices with branching paths, but the consequences of your actions play out in subtle ways, adding a layer of weight to your decisions.

[h2] Gameplay: A Familiar Sandbox with a Fresh Coat of Paint[/h2]

The core gameplay of Mafia II: Definitive Edition is a familiar mix of driving, shooting, and exploration. You'll spend your time cruising the streets of Empire Bay, a fictional city inspired by New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, completing missions for the mob. The combat is satisfyingly brutal, with a focus on headshots and taking cover. While the mission design might feel slightly repetitive at times, especially escort and chase sequences, the story and characters keep things interesting.

The Definitive Edition shines in its visual overhaul. The game looks great, with detailed environments, character models, and lighting effects, but it's not the overhaul we saw in Mafia 1: DE. The city feels alive, bustling with activity and capturing the atmosphere of the era. The soundtrack is another highlight, featuring a mix of licensed classics and original scores that perfectly complement the story and setting.

[h2]Sound: Setting the Mood[/h2]

The sound design is equally impressive, with the crackle of gunfire, the roar of engines, and the ambient sounds of the city creating a truly immersive experience. The voice acting is top-notch, with each character delivering their lines with conviction. The soundtrack is a mix of licensed classics from the era, like ""In the Mood"" by Glenn Miller, and original scores that perfectly set the mood for the story's different moments.

[h2]Overall: A Must-Play for Mob Movie Buffs and Action Fans Alike[/h2]

Mafia II: Definitive Edition is a fantastic remaster that breathes new life into a classic game. The story is still gripping, the characters are memorable, and the gameplay, while familiar, is still enjoyable. The visuals and sound design are top-notch, creating a truly immersive experience. Whether you're a fan of the original game or a newcomer to the world of Mafia, this Definitive Edition is definitely worth checking out.

[b]In short, Mafia II: Definitive Edition is a visually stunning, narratively engaging, and action-packed remake of a classic crime story. Fans of the genre and newcomers alike will find plenty to enjoy in this timeless tale.[/b]",1708785149,1708785161,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Having never played any of the Mafia Trilogy games when they first came out, the bundle was appealing and I decided to dive in to the franchise. While Mafia 1 DE is a far better remaster, Mafia 2 DE is a step back in nearly all aspects. The story is one of the few bright spots, however, it's very short. I was able to finish the main story on hard mode in about 15 hours and that was even including gathering some of the collectibles, exploring the City, and achievement hunting. It's a very short story and not worth the dollar value per hour of entertainment in my book. 

The game also shows its age in other aspects. The lighting in certain levels was really bad and made some missions artificially more difficult as I struggled to see enemies in darker situations. The take cover, shoot at enemies, and do it over again combat style does get old especially late game. Pacing is also a weak point at times and the end of mission  ""drive to your house"" portion gets old considering you're usually driving across the map just to sleep in your bed so the next mission will start.  The world also seems a bit empty, even for it's time when you consider GTA4 released in 2008 and this game originally released in 2010. Overall though, if you can scoop this on a sale, I do recommend playing it to experience the story.

Mafia II Definitive Edition brings back the classic mobster tale with upgraded visuals and all the extras. Stepping into the shoes of Vito Scaletta, players get a taste of the 1940s and 50s underworld, complete with a gripping story and authentic atmosphere.

The game nails the nostalgic vibes with attention to detail in graphics, character design, and a killer soundtrack. Vito's journey through the crime world is immersive and engaging, thanks to solid character development and voice acting.

However, a couple of hiccups may bother some players. The saving system can be a pain. Also, the realistic driving, while cool for some, can feel a bit too much for those looking for a smoother ride.

As a warning for those of you who experienced the original ,everything from story to music and collectibles remains untouched so if you'll be disappointed if you wished for new content.

For me this was a chance to revisit Empire Bay again, to step in the shoes of Vito Scarletta and experience his transformation from an ordinary poor kid to a crime boss. In the early years his father decided to move in America to escape poverty but as it turned out the plan didn't work so well. Vito and Joey Barbaro become best friends in a world where poverty made them choose to attempt small heists like the jewelry shop rob. Unfortunately Vito is caught and offered a choice to avoid prison and enlist in the army and this is how his transformation process begins. On his return he had a choice to respect his mother will and live a lawful life or follow his buddy steps and become involved with the mafia. However doing slave labour work like his father did for the same man at the docks and discovering a 2000 dollars debt his family had for a loan shark was the trigger Vito needed to make his choice.

This was just the introduction for a great story which follows Vito Scarletta and his rise through the ranks of criminal organizations,his struggle for a better life and a beautiful friendship with Joey Barbaro.  Speaking of Joey, he is so great that the game has a dlc where you can play as him. In Joey 's Adventures i had a lot of fun engaging in various missions and activities,set in the time Vito was in prison. 

I had a great time driving around ,listening to music on the radio and somehow the game successfully captures the atmosphere of the 1940's and 1950's in the fictional city of Empire Bay(inspired by real life locations like New York ). 

In a nutshell mafia 2 is one of the best games ever made from my perspective,i strongly recommend playing this if you never did before. 

Pros:
-Story 
-Voice acting and music
-atmosphere
-great dlcs
-great driving 

Cons:
-for a definitive edition the improvements in graphics are not enough

Another thing is - despite the popular opinion I find the second Mafia significantly worse than the first one.
I have played only Definitive Editions so obviously I won't compare the technical differences of the 3 Mafias (even though the fact I had to try many different compositions of graphical settings to avoid annoying graphical bugs in the Mafia 2:DE shouldn't be left unnoticed)

The reason I find Mafia 2 worse is Vito. He is pretty much less talented, more bad-boyish, square-jawed and scarred Tommy from Mafia 1. There is no big story about him, he wants to get money, he wants to get cars. He is just a thug who happens to be Italian so he joins the mafia. The game is much less cinematic and story-driven. Pretty much a violence simulator with average shooting mechanics and below-average driving mechanics.

The big plus is the radio tracklist - makes you wanna advance to listen to different set of songs :)",1706557234,1708036940,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before I say anything else, the game is poorly optimized for dual monitors.  I usually play my games on one monitor and have another one to alt-tab into for research or other stuff.  This game cannot fathom dual monitors and the display settings will be hosed.  I had to disable my second monitor, start the game, then re-enable the second monitor and it worked.  Bit of a lousy workaround, if you ask me.

My first dislike was the main character.  I did not find him easy to like or to get behind at all.  He gets in trouble with his friend, serves in the army instead of going to jail, gets back, his happy family isn't good enough for him and he immediately turns to crime again, putting his mom and sister in danger like he didn't learn anything from before.  Could have easily written this idiot better.

The gameplay is what you would expect.  Gang-related shootouts, intimidation, car theft, etc.  Lots of cars to drive, lots of weapons.  All of this is good, but that's about it.

Then, there's the additional content.  If I could review those separately, I would downvote all of them.  Jimmy's Betrayal and Jimmy's Vendetta are just empty shells of a game where you're sent to an arbitrary part of the map to start the mission, after which you're sent somewhere else to do the mission, then you're sent somewhere to end the mission.  I spent 90% of my time driving.  Just wasn't fun.

Joe's Adventures has a little more personality to it, but it was buggy.  I can usually work with buggy, but one mission bugged so much that I couldn't even complete it.  None of the solutions I researched worked.

As I said at the beginning, for those of you who would like a GTA-style action game, this will deliver.  Just play the base game, though.  Don't bother with any of the additional content.",1707968141,1707968141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only improvement it has over the original is the textures. The animations are broken in some cutscenes, the impressive physics the original had when wearing coats, gone, the AI is broken in some moments and the dialog was broken too, as if they were having two dialogues at the same time, with a slight delay on the other. Small objects and some particle effects are completely broken, flickering around. 

Thankfully I don't remember having to pay for the definitive edition separately and the original is still available, included for free when buying this, so kudos to them for that. But the original is even less stable on modern systems and we can be sure they're not updating that one any more.

It's a shame, for once I see Hangar 13 as developers that genuinely care about their fan-base, unlike most companies under Take-Two, judging by the additions they later put into Mafia III after feedback and giving us a full-on remake on a beloved, outdated game from 2002.

This game does nothing but cause me frustration with mediocre shooting game-play, and shit NPCs that refuse to aid in combat. Not only that, but the hit boxes are so damn f*cked, when you get behind cover- which sucks because you NEED cover. Without cover, you die and you're sent ALL the back to do most of the mission all over again. I understand this is an old game, but there's nothing ""definitive"" about it. I guess the graphics have a little more life to them compared to the original one, but this game truly drives me insane. I can't wait to beat it because I'm deleting it as soon as humanly possible. Thank you for reading, 

edit; After finally finishing this game, It's safe to say I'll be lowering my rating. It only drove me closer to insanity, just to break my heart at the very end. Was going to give Joe's DLC a try, but the game started it's bugginess and that's when I had the epiphany. The epiphany that told me the story was over...and that I could move on. So that's what I did.

I ran it it an R7 3700x, with a 3070, and 32 GB of RAM at 1080p, aimed at 60 FPS. My machine should be able to handle way more than this game.

Unfortunately, the gold with Mafia DE has been shat upon by this.

The stealth is broken. Corner takedowns were removed, and often you don't get the prompt to take someone down, and you just punch them in the head, alerting everyone. This is an absolute downgrade from the last game.

The combat is the least enjoyable part of the game. With Aim Assist on, you will always aim nowhere near what you were trying for when you look down sights. Aiming out of cover is sluggish. Someone also decided to lock the sprint function out of combat in a cover based shooter.

Kudos to the devs for changing the speed limiter to the A button, allowing it to be a more functional E brake. The GPS is a downgrade from the last game, where signs showed you where to turn. Looking at the mini map is a distraction. You have the option to turn traffic laws off, and not need a speed limiter....except the laws come back on during missions. A whole function wasted because it doesn't work right.

The characters are great. Very well written. My only problem is all Vito's friends are pussies, and continually tell me to slow down (I thought wise guys were supposed to be tough lol.) The scenery, story, voice work, and back drop are all an awesome set piece. The music really shines in this game. The series tends to nail all of this. The only real problem in the story was not getting to meet Joe's sister. He always tells me I shoot like her, and I was popping headshots off. I really could've used her help.

The DLC wasn't very enjoyable. It was either GTA style games where you always have a timer, and a wanted level...or it was Mafia 2 cut content with a timer. It's not what I look for in this series.",1684184386,1706548679,True,0,0,0.501742184162139893,0,True,False,False

Was generally enjoying the game up until chapter 14 - part 6,[spoiler] in which you are tasked with heading to Bruno's place to pay back a loan.[/spoiler]
The game requires that you reach a certain cash amount,[spoiler] and you may need to rob stores/ crush cars to supplement the chunk of cash given to you by Joe.[/spoiler] Upon arriving, the door to the office will glow and allow you entry (Implying you have the required funds). In this instance, that was not the case. The door was [i] not [/i] glowing and could not be opened, rendering the game softlocked.
 Only solution is to restart the entire chapter, but even then there's about a 50/50 chance of the same glitch occurring. Mind you, it's a decently long (and slightly annoying) chapter.
I can forgive the minor hiccups, AI, and visual bugs up to this point, but this crossed a certain line for me.

More diverse missions with more different objectives. Story is probably better but because all characters have less personality than in the first game, the impact of the story is lessened by a lot.

One of the standout features of Mafia 2 is its rich and engaging dialogue. The characters' conversations are not just filler; they add depth to the narrative, making the story more captivating and the characters more relatable.The open world in Mafia 2 offers a significant improvement over its predecessor. The city feels alive, with pedestrians going about their business, traffic bustling through the streets, and an array of hidden gems waiting to be discovered. Visually, Mafia 2 showcases noticeable advancements compared to its predecessor. 

However, despite all its strengths, it's important to address the elephant in the room: the abundance of bugs. Having to restart missions due to cars getting stuck during tailing sequences, or characters like Joe becoming immobilised and unable to initiate critical cut scenes, can be a source of annoyance. Furthermore, the reappearance of old mission objectives for no apparent reason can disrupt the flow of the game play.

In conclusion, Mafia 2 is a captivating and enjoyable game that successfully captures the essence of a 1940s and '50s-inspired crime drama, shame about the abundance of bugs.

No. But very good and well worth the bit I spent to get all three Mafia games in the Definitive, including DLC's. Hours and hours of satisfying gameplay. I'd played these all in the past, but it was so long ago, I can't even remember if I had a controller for the driving function. I have a midrange setup with an RTX 2070 video card. The game looks nice. My monitor is 60hz, so I'm not trying to push anything crazy and I wonder if that's where some people are having issues. Asking an old game to do too much, graphic-wise? My settings are 2560X1080@60hz and most everything else is maxed out. The glitches I've seen are not graphic errors. They are glitches that either prevent you from doing an action or as some people have previously mentioned, there's a map glitch that will always show your best friend's house as a mission item where you are supposed to go sleep on the couch. If you try it, it won't let you after a certain point, so it's an annoyance that you live with. My recommendation would be in the first chapter, when it tells you to go to bed, don't go exploring, just go to bed, lol. This game is well worth the little bit it costs nowadays.

The story is decent at best and less than shit at worst. Joe is the most annoying hang on ive ever had causing me to restart multiple times. Vito has little to no depth. Every single npc except leo and greco are obviously out to get you from the start of the game. Unlike the def edi of the first game this game seems to only have graphics updates. Ive never played the non def edi of this game but all my research shows that they seem to have left most bugs and issues untouched which is annoying every time you run a red light with a npc in your car. The wanted mechanic is the most annoying fucking mechanic with cops getting mad at you from entirely different street levels causing you to be wanted for prolonged periods of time that leave you better off just restarting the last checkpoint. Realism in games is only ok to a certain extent as you actually have to buy gas and if you are going remotely fast any crash will kill you not just injure.

Spoiler free review:- Compared to Mafia 1 I liked vitos story a lot better since it was explained thoroughly instead of its and bits like mafia 1 (tommy just recounts the major events in his life in mafia 1 in the bar to the officer) . Whereas in 2 it basically brings you upto the events which happened all throughout vitos journey from top to bottom, His childhood, his mafia life and where he currently stands. Mafia 2 is also more emotional story wise and darker. It also elaborated on unanswered questions from mafia 1 as to what happened to tommy? What happened in his trial? (its all in the loading screen messages) Overall 2 also teaches us that everything in the world of mafia has a price and once you take that oath their ain't going back to the life before. Mafia 2 is also a linear story, it does have some free roam objectives unlike 1 but they are still meh (you can upgrade your cars a big plus). Definitely a must play if you are also a fan of yakuza and sleeping dogs.",1705188401,1705188401,True,15,0,0.691697418689727783,0,True,False,False

NPCs run into strange behaviors, like running around as you drive straight. In certain cutscenes, such as our first meeting with Joe, NPCs stick to the road, blocking our path. Now, let's talk about bugs, my favorite part. Sometimes you can drive through objects, Vito doesn't enter the animation at the right time, and you might hear the same dialogue twice simultaneously.

I played it as a teen and liked it (I‚Äôve to mentioned that I haven‚Äôt yet played GTA IV at that time). Looking back at it now, it‚Äôs clear that the game was slightly unfinished and cut, you were introduced to a very lively world in first chapter, but soon all details would disappear and leave you in empty decorations. Also, this game was made by Czech studio in mid-2000s and encounter design is extremely dated ‚Äì enemies stand behind corners ready to one-shot you, see you through stairs and shoot through walls, sometimes also not taking any damage from your bullets. So, while the game, it‚Äôs music, driving, story and atmosphere are very charming, combat is frustrating half of the time. 
But here we have definitive edition and it doesn‚Äôt look all that good. There is still plenty of bugs from the original and some animations are now messed up as well. It looks a bit sharper, but still like a very old game, plus now there are some visual artefacts. DLC content is very unnecessary and low quality, I guess no one would be playing it now. 
Should you buy it? Only if you really want to get back into Mafia 2 and this is your only option.",1704718862,1704718862,False,2,0,0.511111140251159668,0,True,False,False
1030830,155516050,76561198378446264,19,9,140,0,28,1704903092,"""Mafia II: Definitive Edition"" falls disappointingly short of expectations, particularly when compared to its predecessor. The graphics are a glaring disappointment, resembling a parody when juxtaposed with the visual excellence of the first game. Character movement further compounds the letdown, awkwardly reminiscent of the clunky animation seen in ""Alan Wake"" before its much-needed remaster. 

Adding to the dismay, the characters in ""Mafia II: Definitive Edition"" appear cartoonish, their movements unnatural and detached from any semblance of realism. This departure from the lifelike portrayals seen in the first installment only serves to diminish the immersive quality of the game.

So far, equally disheartening is the plot, which fails to measure up to the compelling narrative of ""Mafia I: Definitive Edition."" The story lacks the excitement and intrigue that captivated me in the original game, leaving a void where the anticipation for a gripping tale once stood. Nevertheless, I will continue playing the game with the expectation that my perspective might undergo a positive shift.

Either way, to compound the frustration, the controls have undergone alterations from the first game, introducing a level of inconvenience and discomfort for players familiar with the intuitive setup of the initial installment. 

Overall, ""Mafia II: Definitive Edition"" pales in comparison to its predecessor, marred by lackluster graphics, unnatural character animations, a lackluster plot, and questionable control changes that contribute to an overall unsatisfactory gaming experience. The intention behind the remastered version is supposed to give the game the appearance of a 2020 release rather than one from 2012.",1704668655,1704668812,False,3,0,0.509127795696258545,0,True,False,False

Also the graphics does not seem to be an improvement from the original. I could see why people liked Vito than Tommy as his character was more defined as a mafia character.

I will say, however, that at various points throughout the game (mostly in cutscenes or when driving a vehicle), some bits and pieces of the dialogue between Vito and whatever character he's speaking with are very glitchy and that was a bit annoying, probably my biggest complaint of the game as it happened fairly often. Whether that flaw existed in the original version of the game also, or only exists in the definitive edition, I do not know, but that was clearly overlooked by the devs and should have been fixed at some point.

While I think that Mafia is the best of the three games. Mafia II offers a charm that is difficult to come by with games that are released today. I especially enjoyed the time jump to 1951 and getting to hear music that I grew up listening to through movies set in the 50's or my grandmother or my mother playing rock n' roll from the 50's. With innovative mechanics for its time, and a map small but one that doesn't feel like it is small. A decent enough story with memorable characters, especially Joe. The variety of cars was nice too. The game isn't too long either, which is a nice change of pace in an industry that is over-saturated with games that can easily span for hundreds of hours, unless you basically rush the experience.

Some issues that I had was that the gameplay does feel dated. The shooting mechanics are simple but feel rather stiff and there is a lot of shooting in this game. Driving feels dated but is actually a lot of fun! I felt that the sound design was pretty good! The cars, the music, VOs... the only thing to really suffer sound wise was the guns. Of which for a game like there was a good variety, but would have liked to see some more rifles. One issue that I had is that the M1 Garand doesn't make its famous PING sound when the enbloc clip ejects. My biggest disappointment with Mafia II is that it didn't get the same make over as Mafia Definitive Edition. 

Overall a fun experience for Mafia fans and those who have never played Mafia (I do recommend starting with Mafia)",1703755179,1703755179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was excited for this after the first mafia, which was incredibly good. 

I did enjoying this game, however it did get boring at times. the driving felt like more of a chore in this second game than it did the first. I also encountered many visual and audio bugs throughout the game and cut scenes. The visual bugs were funny, but the audio ones really got on my nerves lol. Some of the quest directives aren't the most specific, which was only a minor issue. 

The story was relatively good. The ending tore my heart in half and put it in a blender. Although the story didn't have me on the edge of my seat like the first game,  it did very well at making each character likeable to an extent. As somebody who disliked the secondary protagonist for the entire first half of the game, the story progression really spun that around for me.

Overall. 6.8/10. not quite a 7, but its still a game with interesting story and likeable characters. would recommend for people who enjoyed the first game.",1703745538,1703745538,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Mafia II brilliantly depicts the post-war years. A living city, people, beautiful cars. There are tons of details here. Mafia is not a sanbox, the open city is only a background, but we can move around it with impunity, which is a great advantage. I recommend everyone to experience this beautiful gangster adventure. Additionally, DLC for the game and a free ride mode will provide an additional few hours of great gameplay.

In fact, the story and characters fall short of the first game, and the ending is unfulfilling. Perhaps it was their intention for the third game - I'll see soon enough. Overall it feels like this game is someone serving you skim milk when you asked for whole milk. It's a step down from its predecessor which is surprising given they received a definitive edition all around the same time.

There is no way to skip drive or use a taxi to take you to waypoints so you spend the majority of this game playing as a driving sim. The collectibles are the fluff to waste your life and time if you'll allow them to. There's a handful of guns with boring combat that's nothing to write home about. The graphics are poor relative to its predecessor. The steam from the sewer grates in winter, the lighting on dark nights, even the character models are generally flat and disappointing. The addition of money is a comical waste with adding gas stations, which I've never used, to gun shops that let you stock the gun you like if you haven't picked it up for the millionth time. If you want to throw your money at something, buy some clothes or change the rims or paint on your cars. Inevitably they will wipe everything you've bought and your money repeatedly anyways. Every day you're woken up with a phone call or doorball and get out of bed, address it, and put on one of your redundant outfits. Between the life-wasting driving and the bland combat you'll eventually get to consume a somewhat entertaining plot and narrative that doesn't run particularly deep and again feels a step down from its predecessor. At least there are three radio stations to choose from and you will have to change your radio settings every time you get in a car because nothing remembers your settings. Throw in some police to spice up your life but they only care if you're speeding or get into an intense collision. Then they'll make a show about chasing you but realize you're too fast or already gone and then you move on. If you scratch a car, drive in oncoming traffic, run red lights, swerve between cars, they're all good. Just don't drive through a fence. That's their line.

Overall, if you're playing the series and want all the stories, go for it. That's why I'm playing this and will finish it. But boy, I hope the third one is back to winning ways because this was a dreadful attempt at a sequel and a major letdown.

TL;DR Play it if you are trying to get the whole picture from a narrative perspective for the trilogy. But the game, as a game, isn't worth your time or money. Hard pass.",1702843346,1702906212,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Immersive Storytelling:

At the heart of this experience it's a storytelling triumph. Vito Scaletta's journey from a war-torn soldier to a rising figure in the Mafia is a nuanced exploration of loyalty, ambition, and the consequences of life-altering decisions. The narrative spans years, allowing players to witness the evolution of characters and the transformation of the city itself.

Timeless Setting, Modernized:

Mafia II Definitive Edition flawlessly recreates the post-World War II era, presenting a meticulously detailed world that feels both authentic and evocative. From the classic cars to the carefully curated soundtrack, every element contributes to the immersive atmosphere. The Definitive Edition enhances this setting with updated graphics a bit here and there yet don't have high hopes to see something next get on that regard.

Character Depth and Emotional Resonance:

One of the defining strengths of Mafia II has always been its well-developed characters. Vito Scaletta's journey is more than a rise through criminal ranks; it's a deeply personal exploration of his motivations, friendships, and the moral quandaries that define his choices. The supporting cast is equally rich in detail, contributing to a narrative that evokes genuine emotional investment.


The Nostalgia Reimagined:

For those returning to Mafia II, the Definitive Edition is a nostalgic journey made fresh. The familiar beats of the original story resonate, but the enhanced visuals that even if they are not much is decent, refined gameplay, and quality-of-life improvements make it an experience that transcends mere nostalgia. It's a reunion with an old friend, albeit one who has undergone a thoughtful makeover.

In Conclusion:

Mafia II Definitive Edition is more than a game; it's an immersive cinematic experience that stands the test of time. With a narrative that remains as compelling as it was a decade ago, visuals that bring Empire Bay to new life, and characters whose stories resonate on a deeply human level, this edition is a triumph of revitalization. Whether you're revisiting Vito's world or stepping into it for the first time, Mafia II Definitive Edition is an invitation to a world where crime, loyalty, and consequence collide in a masterfully crafted symphony of storytelling.

The gameplay is fine, if repetitive, but it's the story that really falls flat. Everyone is a racist prick and unlike Mafia 3 the racism is often portrayed as correct. Vito and his fat best friend will say racial slurs about chinese people and say they cant be trusted and then there will be several missions of the chinese betraying you. Even if you're a hardcore twitter blue subscriber and see Vito's racism as a good thing I cant imagine you'll like the miserable prick. Vito has no agency as he's drug around by his nose through mission after mission, Vito has no personality to speak of other than Italian stereotype, and the game itself has no ending. It's an ending that makes the Soprano's ending look like a fucking masterpiece because it just ends with no conclusion whatsoever.

So, I grabbed the Mafia Trilogy during the Steam Autumn sale, and let me tell you, Mafia Definitive Edition's remastered graphics blew me away. Seriously, they're on another level and really amp up the whole gaming vibe.

But, here's the twist. When I jumped into Mafia II Definitive Edition, it was a bit of a letdown. The graphics and lighting felt kind of meh compared to the first game. Anyone else notice this?

In my book, Mafia II Definitive Edition could use a graphic boost to match Mafia Definitive Edition's awesomeness. I mean, the characters, objects, vehicles, roads, and even the plants in Mafia Definitive Edition are jaw-dropping, while Mafia II Definitive Edition falls a bit short in that department.

Now, I'm itching to check out Mafia III Definitive Edition and see if it keeps up the trend. Any thoughts or experiences with that one?

Overall it's a pretty good game, the story is engaging, Graphics are lovely, the combat is decent enough, especially if you like lethal gunfights, and grabbing it on the sale as part of the trilogy made it a fantastic deal. It does however have some problems, so I'd like to outline my opinions below.

Pros:
-There's a good array of cars and guns, all in lovely detail. Also depending on the year new guns and cars will pop up. Its mostly Pistols, SMGs and Rifles, plus a single shotgun, but they have a decent variety. Also the cars can be tuned up and some have fantastic custom paint jobs
-The combat is pretty good in most aspects, Its lethal, you'll only take 2-3 shots before you die so cover is vital in most scenarios, but there's also ample opportunities to grab your machine-gun, walk-forward mowing people down, going brrrr. Hp only regenerates to 2/3s of max, you have to eat/drink to get it back up, but lose it in a single shot so i rarely bothered.
-The AI in combat understands cover and doesn't just stand there, It also advances if you stay in place, and will try to fire or move as you reload
-It kept the mafia/gangster aesthetic very well, the clothing, outfits and cars all feel in place.
-Lovely graphics, especially cutscenes, you can see where the DE touchups shine.
-Love the music, If you like the radio in fallout, you'll like the radio in Mafia II. The radio also regularly comments on your exploits.
-Characters were well done, I felt attached to a few of them, especially your bestfriend, and invested in what happens.
-Only ever encountered one or two bugs
-Don't feel like paying for it? Steal it! Clothes stores, Food Joints and gunshops can all be held-up and robbed to steal their inventory if you don't want to pay for it. Though holding up certain stores may require a gunfight.

Now comes the issues, and this game has a few, some which may be controversial.

Cons:
-Open-world in name only, there's no side missions, mini-games or side content beyond robbing stores, scrapping cars or fighting the police. 99% of the content is missions and going from mission to mission.
-In combat the AI will sometimes pull some stunts, like shooting you while on the floor, or spawning and gunning you while running to cover, very often i'd have an AI spawn or pop out of a corner and oneshot me and i'm wondering ""where the hell...?"" Also Grenades and Molotovs never flt that useful, At least when I was throwing them, not the enemy...
-Bugs: They do exist, I encountered one where during an emotional cutscene Joe failed to render, and was invisible, sort of ruining the moment, Another where dialogue repeated during chapter 14, often overlapping on itself, and also a bug preventing progress on chapter 14 if i'd robbed any stores during it, which the game advises you do to collect money. This required restarting the entire chapter and earning money via scrap instead
-This may be the most controversial one, but it really annoyed me. at least 3 times during the campaign, especially after a mission with a big payout, something will happen to your character and the game will take all your guns, Money and once even purchased clothes. This is a neat plot-trick once, but three to four times it gets frustrating. Especially as it never gives you the items back, you have to go and repurchase your guns, or collect new ones in combat. At this point, why even let me buy guns just to take them away, usually at the very start of the next level. It stops being clever or fun when you do it repeatedly. If there was one aspect of the game i could change it would be this.

Overall i'd give it an 8/10 maybe 8.5 for it great gameplay but a few glaring flaws. Definately grab it as part of the trilogy, especially on sale.",1701254260,1701254260,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I want to mention the racism in this game. I know that it's set in a different time, and I know that mafiosi are bad guys. But if you're going to portray racism in a game, it needs to be handled thoughtfully. That's definitely not the case here: some of the dlalogue has a nasty 4chan stink to it.

Most of this game is driving and gunfighting. The driving is okay but boring, and I quickly got tired of driving from one side of the city to the other. The gunfighting is clunky. Moving and shooting from cover is often frustrating and I often felt that I couldn't get a good angle on target due to the camera and controls. The combat mainly involves blasting your way through waves of goons. It gets old pretty quickly.

The only good part of this game is the music. They have licensed some great old tunes for this game. There are plenty of AAA blockbusters with worse soundtracks. I could listen to this stuff all day.

In the end, it feels like the developers just tried to do too much with too little. If they had ditched the open-world pretensions, pointless fistfighting and half-baked stealth mechanics, then perhaps they could have produced a slick little '50s-themed cover shooter. Instead we're left with a glitchy hodgepodge of rubbish.

Finally I will add that the game plays fine on Linux using Proton-GE. You may need a workaround for the launcher - you can find that on ProtonDB.

The optimization is bad especially on lower end pc, sudden fps drops and some textures are just straight up missing or bugged

I don't see much improvement in terms of graphic either even though the game required more space and better specs than the original 

I'd only recommend buying this on a heavy discount rather than paying full price

Checkpoints are horrible, models disappear or turn into a zombie in some cutscenes, the dialogue sometimes overlaps and characters repeat the same lines over and over, police are way too forgiving to the point where I had no issues whatsoever which is bad, on hard mode the enemies can shoot you through walls and they just randomly one-shot you, there are parts that I'm sure they have never playtested...

But the worst of all, the optimization is horrendous. I have a 4070 and I couldn't believe my eyes when my FPS went down to 20 just out of nowhere. This happens in some shooting parts where there are lots of enemies and they keep throwing molotovs. None of these issues were in the original game.

All they ever did was just some fancy lighting around the city and window dressing to make it look like they added a few things.

While the original ""Mafia II"" had its charm, this remaster fails to live up to the expectations set by the stunning remake of the first game, resulting in a product that feels lackluster and underwhelming.

From a graphical standpoint, the game is a letdown. Despite being labeled as a 'Definitive Edition,' the visual enhancements are minimal and do little to bring the game up to modern standards. The textures, character models, and environmental details show slight improvements but are far from the complete overhaul seen in ""Mafia: Definitive Edition."" This discrepancy is jarring, making ""Mafia II: Definitive Edition"" look outdated and lackluster in comparison.

The gameplay mechanics also suffer from a lack of refinement. What was once acceptable in the original now feels clunky and outdated, with combat and driving sequences that are more frustrating than enjoyable. The game misses an opportunity to modernize these aspects, which would have been a significant improvement for the remaster.

One of the more critical flaws is in the narrative itself. The story of Vito Scaletta, while a classic tale of crime and betrayal, feels overly stereotypical and lacks depth. The linear storyline, devoid of any meaningful side quests, contributes to a sense of monotony and missed potential. Unlike ""Mafia: Definitive Edition,"" which managed to breathe new life into its story, ""Mafia II: Definitive Edition"" seems content to retread familiar ground without any significant additions or improvements.

The absence of side quests further diminishes the game's appeal. In an era where open-world games are rich with side narratives and additional content, the lack of such features in ""Mafia II: Definitive Edition"" makes the game feel barren and unengaging. Empire Bay, though aesthetically consistent with the period, lacks vibrancy and fails to encourage exploration, making the game world feel static and uninviting.

Additionally, the soundtrack, while authentic to the period, does little to compensate for the game's other shortcomings. It remains a lone highlight in a game that otherwise struggles to captivate or impress.

In summary, ""Mafia II: Definitive Edition"" falls short of delivering a satisfying gaming experience. It is overshadowed by its superior predecessor, lacks significant graphical or gameplay improvements, and suffers from a clich√©d and uninteresting story. For those seeking a compelling and modernized take on the Mafia series, it would be advisable to look elsewhere, as this edition does not do justice to the potential of a full remake.",1699807640,1699813447,False,2,0,0.508864104747772217,0,True,False,False

The pacing of the chapters are terrific and game play is simple yet raw, which makes it complicated at certain points as you progress. Vantage points, cover, & conserving ammunition are essential. Shops, guns, and vehicles are all elegantly designed and while I really enjoy the upgradability systems, if I had to pick something I wish they had expanded - it would be the customization. Empire Bay is beautiful and the city succeeds in subconsciously creating a false sense of nostalgia for a time and place that doesn't exist - just as it did with Lost Heaven. The payoff of the connective tissue established at the ending of M1 weaving into this installment was done brilliantly.

Grand Theft Auto: The 'original' open world sandbox, rooted in questionable realism. It's identity? A reinterpreted reflection of our society with a focal point on the illusion of the 'american dream'. Overly-heightened. Flamboyantly grounded. Gliding on the fine line between nonsensically absurd & realistically resonant. Every story is driven by complex characters bound within ridiculously intuitive mechanics, rich environments, cityscapes, and vehicles. At it's core, Grand Theft Auto is the universal story of the underdog. The ones who refuse to stay under. Who by any means overcome adversity, trial, and tribulation. Usually ending with joyrides that ascend - to close the sun.

Saints Row: Like GTA, the SR franchise is equally (if not more) self aware. It's identity? Nothing more & nothing less than a mindless parody. A parody of what? Everything. What started as a solid satire alternative rival to Rockstars behemoth of a property; Saints Row slowly morphed from a structured, somewhat respectable sandbox - into an unhinged fever dream. Ironically what initially was it's biggest strength became it's tragic downfall. Becoming a caricature of itself as the games evolved. The original two games had the potential to bloom into something significant if Volition decided nurture their consistent tone. A bit wacky no doubt, but serious enough when need-be and stakes were felt nonetheless. The intricate customization of the structure of your character & faction was something unique (and exciting) to SR. As well as building relationships and infrastructure while climbing the ranks throughout the city. All things that are present in the newer entries - only thing missing is the emphasis on a contained linear structure to the story that the original two had. I'm all for bigger sequel stakes and insane sequences but they should feel tethered to what came before. A natrual progression should be felt and seen. When you go from taking over a city to fighting an alien invasion with superpowers from the white house as the president of the united states - somethings off. A few wrong turns were taken. Off a cliff. Everything after 2 was outlandish in every way but they had their moments. Increasingly ridiculously bizarre (and honestly cringe worthy at times) but still manages to retain the mindless fun. The mindless parody.

Mafia: Not only is the Mafia franchise the most realistic of the 3 but IMO, it's also the most successful when it comes to immersion. It's identity? Realism. Mafia is driven solely by it's story. I'd argue that the period piece elements of each installment are not only one of their most important narrative devices but they're kind of unseen characters - establishing the look, feel, & framework of the protagonists lives moving forward. While Saints Row & GTA's characters usually have many gray shades layered within them - Mafia's characters on the other hand are black and white. Self accepting monsters. What separates Mafia from other similar IP's is the ever growing looming dread and brutality throughout the story. Whether it be Tommy, Joe, Vito, or Lincoln - the angels on their shoulder took vacations. Their drive is fueled by their shadow, and the warped desires it bares. 

Grand Theft Auto is where I go when I want to explore.
Saints Row is where I go when I want to escape. 
Mafia is where I go when I want to experience. 

There's probably a better way to word that but that's the best I could convey the separation that exists between them. Mafia I's 'Lost Heaven' was based on Chicago. Mafia II's 'Empire Bay' was based on New York. Mafia III's 'New Bordeaux' was based on New Orleans. If the next one doesn't use an already established 'revamped' version of a map we're familiar with I'd love to see a city based on either Washington, DC or California.

* overly twitchy police
* being in the middle of a gunfight, having a cutscene, and then after the cutscene, having no weapon equipped
* floating cars
* roads not really designed for smooth driving
* slow traffic and long red lights

Unlike Mafia 1, the story never really held together.   Events seem disconnected.  Everyone accuses everyone else of betrayal, but it's never really confirmed which story was true.  Towards the end, Vito begins acting out of character, doing inadvisable things and lying about it like a child.

1) Areas where Mafia 2 could have improved over its predecessor; it ultimately did not i.e lack of free roaming variety, side missions. 

2) Where Mafia (2002) excelled; Mafia 2 is somewhat of a downgrade i.e the AI is more clunky, cops don't immediately chase you if you cut corners or speed a little and NPCs seem to rush in front of your car. Also to my great dismay there is no real time public transport system :(

The story is great, the characters are generally good, the car radio is excellent and the city and environment design is awesome. The game has amusing collectables in the form of vintage playboy magazines as well as 'wanted posters' spread throughout the city although the latter is a hassle.

The 3 different DLCs provide the player with something as close to 'GTA' that this game can get but its not that refined, with recycled assets, areas and most missions feeling like busy work. 'Joe's Adventures' is arguably the best of the 3 as it contains key stone missions that provide new indoor areas as well as story driven cut-scenes associated with those missions.",1694206958,1694206958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Action[/h1]

Let me start by saying that the game itself is pretty good. It has aged pretty well and is still fun.

Great story, great characters, great music, really good setting and atmosphere. The game has a lot of nice touches and attention to detail that a lot of other city based open world games do not have. The shooting mechanics are decent however some of the guns feel very weak and inaccurate especially from longer range.

The AI of course can snipe you with a Tommy gun from 100 yards away even when you're in cover but you couldn't hit a wall from 10 yards, it can definitely get frustrating, but again not a deal breaker as most of the time it does work.

However, this being advertised as the ""definitive"" edition is where the game fails. It is riddled with bugs and audio sync issues. Constant stuttering in and out of cutscenes. Frame drops are constant, lots of pop in, and the game crashes quite a bit. The graphics themselves do look better, and the lighting is improved over the original, but again the performance issues are absolutely noticeable and do interfere with game play especiallythe driving. I'm not going to lie I have still been having fun with this game as its not entirely unplayable, but if you're sensitive to the performance issues you will hate it.

There is no way to defend this game, this ""remaster"" is an absolute slap in the face to fans and the fact they're charging money for a game that performs worse than the original is unacceptable. Game itself is solid, the performance however, is terrible and I cannot recommend this game whole heartedly as I would like to because of performance.

Just finished playing Mafia 2 for the first time and I'm in awe.

I played the remake of Mafia 1 a couple years ago and it was fantastic, my first entry into the Mafia series, heck my first time even really hearing about this series was when I checked steam and saw ""Mafia 1 Definitive Edition"", I had no idea what I was in for.

The ending of Mafia 1 left me wanting so much more even though It was very sad.

Enter, Mafia 2 with Vito and Joe.

A game from 2009 with a remaster that doesn't do it justice. While Mafia 1 got a needed ground up remake, 2 got some graphical improvements but at the cost of missing content in the main story.

The graphical improvements are noticeable however for such a legendary game it not getting a ground up remake is disappointing.

Nonetheless the game still holds up pretty well in 2023 for a 2009 game. The movement, car mechanics, and other things do feel clunky at times but it never makes you want to stop playing or enjoy the game less.

The story is amazing. Taking place in two different settings where one has snow and more retro cars, outfits, and radio songs while the other is the spring and more modernised in many different ways. 

The characters, voice acting, and dialog/writing is top notch. A story that has all the moments you'd want in one.

Characters play off of each other well, Joe and Vito especially, the main theme of the game is one of the best in gaming, and the ending like Mafia 1 is extremely sad.

My only big complaint with the game is how many missions there were where you have to drive across the entire map while watching out for cops and not killing yourself by crashing just to do something small that plays a little part in the story and then to drive all the way back to your home, go to sleep, and continue the story usually by doing that over and over again. It got repetitive and annoying due to how many of those types of missions there were.

Aside from that this game is amazing.

The music, graphics, voice acting, characters, sound design, story, dialog, and city all come together to make a fantastic game that still holds up well in 2023.",1693985196,1693985196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only negative thing for me, however, is that there is a solid number of bugs that keep happening in the game. I played almost 50 hours and after passing the main story and starting to play the DLC : Joey's adventures, after the mission : ""supermarket"" I got this glitch where Joe is falling through the sky and can't be stopped. Unlike the main part of story which has chapters, Joe's adventures doesn't so I cant even get back and reload the last chapter, which means I would need to restart the complete DLC to maybe be able to finish it , which is not going to happen. Jimmy's Vendetta I haven't even tried. 

To bad for this bug that happened. I can imagine people's frustration when they pay for this and come to the very end and you can't finish the game normally which you payed.

However I highly recommend passing the main story which is totally worth the hours , of course if you love mafia games.

The story came across as very original. The individual episodes and missions had a ton of variety. The world felt massive and alive. The main character was sympathetic, because he was drawn into the criminal life, basically, against his will. The exposition captured attention from the start, and the ending was a grand crescendo. [/i]

Now, about Mafia II: 

On its own, maybe this game would be considered OK. But as a direct sequel to Mafia, it really looks dull. 

- The [b]main character[/b], Vito, is a dirtbag who, we learn, actually aspired to live a criminal, predatory life starting from his childhood. He pretty much deserts from the army in the middle of WWII. He does time in prison for a technicality, but he actually deserves to have done a lot more time. He is given the chance to work a respectable job, but sees himself as ""too good"" for actual honest labor. His living family is always an afterthought to him, because his own wellbeing is his highest priority. 

Contrast him against the main character from the first Mafia -- a meek, working family man who is unwillingly sucked into the criminal world by evil, unfortunate circumstance, and who struggles against his lifestyle throughout the whole story. The player is deeply moved by this character's inner conscientious fight, while Vito's conscience is flat-dead, and his ""struggle"" is purely external, material. 

- Joe, the main character's mission [b]partner, friend, and literary foil[/b], is a stupid, loud-mouthed, annoying, shallow walking stereotype. I was actually surprised when the credits rolled, because I was certain the game couldn't end without him betraying the main character -- Joe appears to be the kind of sleazy, greasy, oily scheisster, that he is obligated to stab all his closest friends in the back. 

Contrast this with the previous game -- the two characters who partnered with the protagonist there were both unique, distinct personalities with original backstories, and until nearly the end of the story, it appeared that they would all be faithful to each other. The characters in that game were much deeper and multi-dimensional than the lazily written, profane, stupid supporting character of this game. 

- The [b]game world[/b] in Mafia II is, frankly, lackluster. It's a bit disappointing when you're immersed in running from the cops, crash your car near the elevated train station, run up the stairs to board the train, only to realize that there are no working trains / subways in this game like there were in the original Mafia. Nor are there the closer-to-realistic reactions from the traffic cops when they see you running red lights, speeding, driving dangerously, etc. A great game makes the player feel ""in the game world"" enough to behave realistically, rather than goof off, which Mafia did, and Mafia II doesn't. 

- The [b]main story arc[/b] was simply lacking the entire length of the game. We learn from a cutscene that the main character wanted to live the ""thug life"" from childhood, and saw it as his ticket to easy street. We have one quick, silly mission which serves as a tutorial / backstory. After that, it's a string of missions which are all pretty much in the same format (drive from A to B, pick something up, something goes wrong, shootout, chase, run, go back to base, mission complete). 

There is zero character growth here like there was in Mafia when the main character meets his woman, gets married, and has a child over the span of years. 

There is no ""breaking point"" in this story, where you see your character's life turn upside down and start to unravel. In the first Mafia, there were clear pivots, wrong turns, which set the dramatic end of the story, such as it was, into motion. 

There is no climax in this story, and the ending was so ""level"", that I was confused and nonplussed upon reaching the end of the game. In Mafia, the ending was ambitious, grandiose, out-of-control, accelerating, fatalistic, rapidly depriving the main character of options in life. It left the player with an emotion like the main character was on the steep downward slope of a roller coaster coming up on missing tracks. 

I wish I could recommend this game, but if you had the pleasure of experiencing the first Mafia, this one will undoubtedly be a letdown. Don't let this game spoil your impression of the first installment.",1691990371,1691990643,False,2,0,0.48201143741607666,0,True,False,False

I was extremely hyped for this game when it first came out in 2010, but felt a bit underwhelming after the original Mafia, still enjoyable, but not really able to capture what was so great about Mafia I. With the remastered edition, the age of the game starts to become an issue however. Mafia I now is a shiny modern remake of the original and is mostly top notch, but the remaster of II is only a very superficial overhaul of the original release, in which you can barely spot the differences with the original. But worse, there's still a lot of bugs and glitches in this version of the game. Outfit issues, missions that can't progress because a police barricade from the previous mission didn't despawn, horribly deformed faces in cutscenes, enemies that get stuck in a hallway, leaving you to wonder why the mission isn't progressing and tons more... Still needs a lot of polish.

This game now comes with all the DLC for Mafia II wich is a blessing, but also a curse; I have an issue with the outfits and cars that are dumped on you because you have enabled a DLC outfit pack or car pack. This is all good and well, but it ruins some of the most important aspects of a game like this; progression and immersion. You want to unlock these items somehow, because why bother collecting any other car when you start out with some of the best cars in the game? Make these a little more difficult to obtain throughout the game. It requires a bit of balance, but there's a better way than outright unlocking them at the start. Also, having a car and outfit from Mafia III in the game is a bit too immersion breaking in my opinion.

The driving is not bad in Mafia II, I've never felt the intrinsic motivation from the driving however, not like in other games, like the original Driver for instance; behind every drift corner is a car waiting to interrupt your flow. On every straight piece of highway is a car that decides to change from one empty lane to another to ruin your speed and your car's bodywork. On every crossroads there's a car that decides to take a left turn even though you're fast approaching. After having played through all of Mafia II multiple times, I still don't feel like I'm able to satisfyingly speed through the city. Which is half the game, so it's bothered me quite a bit.

Another gripe I have with all driving games like this is the navigation system. In Mafia I, you were told to take the Giuliani Bridge or other landmarks multiple times, so after a few missions you were fairly familiar with the area around that bridge. You had to be, there was no line to follow on the mini map. In the original GTA III or Driver you were running around the map so much that in the end you knew it through and through. I've played the original Mafia I all the way through probably around 5 times and I know Lost Heaven like my own backyard. When I'm driving in the original Mafia I or GTA III or Driver, I don't need to look at the map apart from getting an idea of the destination. I knew every back alley, every shortcut, every fastest road. In Mafia II and other driving games that rely on this navigation system, you're constantly looking at the minimap to see when the next turn needs to be made, which inevitably makes you run into something because you're not looking at what's ahead of you. Studios spend so much time making these large beautiful worlds and you spend half the game looking at the bottom corner of your screen staring at a somewhat more dressed up version of ""snake"". It's a real shame that every game is resorting to this and I might feel old saying this, but people can't navigate streets anymore. I wished you could turn this off in the settings. In Mafia III there was at least a different approach to this but it's still the easiest way to disconnect you from the map.

The shooting is pretty good in the game, nothing too special, but enjoyable nonetheless. I liked the variety of weapons, the shooting etc... Only a more accurate long range rifle would have been good, possibly with a scope.

Then there's the Jimmy DLC; The Betrayal of Jimmy and Jimmy's Vendetta are some of the worst DLC I've ever played. In an effort to quell the critiques from comparing Mafia II with GTA IV, Hangar 13 decided to add an open world mission based system resembling that of GTA. Which to me is really unnecessary. It might have worked if done at least a little bit decently, but it feels like a very cheap copy paste of what other games had and it made me lose a bit of respect for the Mafia franchise. There's elements of the GTA system that I prefer over that of Mafia's but they had their own more immersive approach and I've always appreciated Mafia I and II for this. If the missions in the DLC would have been polished, more original and possibly contain some dialogue, cinematics, etc... they would have been passable, but in the end it's just a collection of point farming missions in the hopes that people would want to replay these for some reason. But the worst thing about the DLC are the achievements. I like to unlock all achievements, but for this one I might leave it at 97% completed. I've played through all of the Jimmy's Revenge DLC, finished all but two achievements and I still need to drive 820 miles to get to 1000 miles driven for the second to last achievement? Are you kidding me? Some achievements are difficult, but this is just horrible grinding. There's a glitch to get these last two achievements, which says enough, if there's an urge to find a glitch to get these last achievements, they must be unreasonably grindy to obtain.

The Joe's Adventures DLC is a lot better. It's lacking the relative polish of the main game and is basically 4 missions with some more point farming side stuff in between, but at least there's custom content, some new areas and interiors to explore, little things, but definitely a welcome addition. I particularly liked the mission on the frozen lake and the shootout in the strip club. 3 DLCs like this would have been great. Also the achievements for this DLC are fun and manageable, some are difficult, but definitely doable. Nothing like the ridiculous please-play-my-game-some-more achievements from J's Revenge.

Alright so this game is better the the first 1 in almost everything other then looks. At first i was put off, but then i came to love the way the graphics looked. Tho there is alot of graphical glitches, and some bugs.

For exampled sometimes, the characters would just A pose in the middle of the scene, or faces would be streched, or voice lines would just keep repeating. The game only crashed twice. 
Also there is some things like during a car chase if the car youre chasing gets struck and the stop, the game will think they keep going. causing you to fail the mission bc even tho you are with the car you are chasing, it thinks that car got away. 

Spoilers

The story is better then the first, i loved this game. like the opening after returning home and walking in the snow, interacting with people. theres all these little side things to do, and you get achievents for it. like helping a lady fix her car after it broke down. I was just looking, i didnt know it would turn into a small mission. Theres also convos you can casually have with npcs if you stand around a bit. its nice. 

With that being said the game just kinda ends? like the first one but better, after joe is taken away... I was waiting for Vitos after story. like what happened to him? like the first game this one lacks a falling action. a way to tie everything up in a satisfying way. 
The first games went to fast. this one just didnt have one.

Theres also some characters where you think they will have roles, but they dont. and the sorta just disappear for a while, or in some cases are never seen again. its a shame. 

With that being said Joe is best character. I LOVE JOE. SO MUCH. i havent played the adventures yet, maybe some other time. but this game is amazing. i hope the third one is even better.

Also the hooker not having anything to do with the plot. I WAS CERTAIN SHE WAS A MOLE OR SOMETHING. like the game kept focusing on her, and shes everywhere. i dont know if they were reusing her sprite.

While comparing Mafia 2 with the definitive addition, there are definitive improvements but it didn't really hit me like mafia 1 definitive addition did.

Gameplay definitely improved, we received more guns, more cars, gunplay was similar but a little bit better.  Money system was introduced but there is not much to do with the money, I mainly repaired cars and bought 2-3 suits. Some of the save locations are rude, had to redo 10-15 minutes of gameplay because of lack of saves.

Story is where I think mafia games shine, it's a good mob story, but there are some occasions where you get lost in character names. The underworld is much bigger than it was in Mafia 1 and I would've like to have spent some more time with the characters rather than going and doing mob stuff. Voice acting was nice, even the cutscenes were really good.

Also, being able to listen to the 1940's music was a nice touch

This game was way ahead of it's time and it still holds upto this day despite of being a 13 year old title.
its the best mafia game, far better than mafia 1 remake and mafia 3 and head and shoulders better than many other titles that came in recent years.

cons- i got soft locked at least three times in my single playthrough in three or 4 chapters, had to restart the chapters to complete them which proved to be a tedious task.
 *** Many achievements too are bugged and cant unlock them.
 *** Clothing of vito often buggs in cutscene which totally ruins the immersion

P.S, there is basically no difference between definitive edition and classic edition. play whichever your heart desire.

The story is just as amazing as the original, it houses some of the most impactful twists and turns while the players second guess themselves into predicting what might come in. Vito is an enduring protagonist that is only as great as the supporting character in the story that bounces off of him.

However, there are still some new and old issues that plague the definitive edition. The gameplay is still just as frustrating and the gunplay is just as uninspired as when it was first released. It's a stiff mess that requires too much of the player's attention to pull through ridiculous missions. Even the new improvements in weapons sounds can't save the gameplay.

Overall, besides some minor faults, the experience of Mafia 2 is still present within the definitive edition and offers up the same adventurous game for a broader audience. It's a solid game.

Lasted maybe 15 hours and didn't feel repetitive at any point. Voice acting is good. Gunplay is pretty good. It pushes the player to use cover rather than running and gunning, and the enemy AI behaves the same way. Enemy AI is quite impressive for the game's age, though they will occasionally get stuck in place. Only saw this a few times, so no biggie. The game has a shocking amount of environment damage, like tables, pillars, etc. all visibly losing chunks of material when shot. It's a cool effect when in a gunfight. The driving in this game is better than pretty much every new game. The cars feel truly heavy, and not many games pull that off. I'm very impressed. Graphics are well, 10 years old. They hold up well, but don't expect to have your mind blown there. My biggest issue is that stuff that forms as a result of large gunfights like debris and casings do not despawn when they hit a certain count. As a result of this, I've had my frames drop from a stable 60 down to 15, which is not fun in a fight. I looked briefly at the DLC in the game, and it seems kinda bland.

Let me just say that the game is absolutely stellar. The story is gripping and the world feels alive. This isn't an open world on the scale of GTA, rather it's a world that helps the story to move forward. Some of the mechanics haven't aged that well and the shooting isn't great but the story definitely carries the game. 

As for the port, I wish I had played the original. The remastering job is decent but the stuttering when you drive and the parts where the FPS drops to the 20s takes you out of the experience.
When these performance issues occur it seems to drop GPU and CPU utilisation into the teens. This remaster has almost been out for 3 years and it's unacceptable that they haven't fixed these glaring issues.

As for gameplay, GTA: The Boomer Years it is not. While comparisons can be made to Grand Theft Auto, there is also differences. Such as the lack of manual saving. Your auto-saves are typically connected to missions or finding rare collectables. You can get speeding tickets/chased for not stopping to pay them. You also lose your guns often during the story, that it becomes pointless to buy them. No really. Just kill enemies to get back your lost weapons. Never waste a cent on firearms or ammo. And if there's any rare guns you loved, forget about them. 

Honestly, the game feels pretty linear for an open world title. But if you've got 10-14 hours to spare, this could be a fun distraction.",1689903478,1689904583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gun play is sort of better, but aim assist is weird.
The story is convoluted and its really hard to connect with the characters like the last game.
You get a lot of money but it feels like you can't do anything with it other than repairing your car or buying a suit.
The driving is better.
There are still some visual glitches from time to time, but nothing game breaking.
Some missions are punishing and will make you restart from a very early point and that gets tedious.

The game got a fresh coat of paint and reworked sound apparently, but it introduced so so so many game breaking bugs alongside that makes it harder to play. The old junk like checkpoints placed in the most bizarre spots stayed as it was, not helping in instances where you have to not only fight enemies, but glitches too. 

Examples:
The objective to go to bed at the end of 2nd chapter did not disappear causing it to stay trough next 2 chapters, constantly giving me 2 waypoints at all time, which causes minimap to freak out and change the route. I had to start from scratch to solve the bug from said 4th chapter to solve it.
2nd thing that made me almost snap was at chapter 14 at the end where we have to shoot our way trough the building and escort somebody. It would be a shame if their's AI would just freak out on 1st flight of stairs causing them to stop pathfinding, but it did. Relaunching the game and run across whole build to get them certainly was a way, but that's not any escort mission should be.
Other minor bugs included broken character polygons in many cutscenes, constant lagspikes probably due to broken mipmapping, cars spawning sideways in the middle of a road or right in front of you, drivers falling from heaven to sit behind the wheels etc.

The developers painstakingly recreated the era with period-authentic cars, fashion, and music, immersing players in the vibrant, gritty world of organized crime. The city itself feels alive, bustling with activity and providing ample opportunities for exploration.

The gameplay mechanics are well-crafted, offering a blend of action, stealth, and driving sequences that keep the player engaged throughout. 

What sets Mafia 2 apart is its commitment to character development and storytelling. The game explores themes of friendship, betrayal, and the price of power, providing players with a narrative-driven experience that resonates long after the credits roll. The voice acting and dialogue are top-notch, bringing the characters to life and making their struggles and triumphs feel real.

The addition of destructible objects, cars and overall almost anything made the game much more lifelike. Guns felt better, but the forced crosshair in the top portion of the screen made it really hard to get used to. 

However, enemies are also very different. While cops are more or less a joke to deal with, the gangs suddenly got a major aimbot/wallhack that is really annoying to play against on the hard setting.

Melee combat is atrocious with nothing really else to do than wait for a parry every time. 

All of this combined was supposed to feel like an *definitive edition*, but except texture upgrades, it is not noticeable.

A game that makes you fall in love with the protagonists, which fully involves you and which pushes you to want to play it again in order to relive those great moments.

And exactly as I wrote in ""Mafia I"" I rewrite it here, I highly recommend it to all gamers, without distinction, because until today, 13 years after its release, it manages to excite us as it did in the past.

I've just finished playing Mafia II: Definitive Edition and I'm thrilled to say that it's been an unforgettable journey that completely exceeded my expectations. This edition takes a classic game and masterfully revamps it, taking full advantage of current generation hardware to truly make this title shine.

From the onset, you're immersed into the post-war world of Empire Bay, a city brimming with life, diversity, and period-accurate details. It's a setting that is both intoxicating and unforgiving, perfectly capturing the romantic yet brutal essence of the 1940s and '50s.

The game's narrative is its biggest strength, showcasing a captivating and deeply personal story of survival, ambition, and the undeniable allure of the Mafia lifestyle. The protagonist, Vito Scaletta, is a character who's realistically flawed and relatable, bringing depth to his journey from being a war veteran to an ambitious gangster. The supporting characters are just as compelling, each one contributing to the intricate, morally complex tapestry of Mafia II.

In terms of gameplay, Mafia II: Definitive Edition manages to find a good balance between driving, gunfights, stealth sequences, and narrative sections. The gunplay is tight and responsive, with a cover system that feels intuitive and keeps firefights engaging. The driving mechanics have also been refined, providing a good sense of weight and momentum to the various period-appropriate vehicles.

Graphically, the Definitive Edition shines with its impressive visual overhaul. From the detailed character models to the atmospheric lighting, this game is a visual treat. Empire Bay looks stunning in all its glory, with beautiful day-night cycles and weather effects adding a sense of realism to the world.

Perhaps my only gripe would be that some of the original game's flaws still persist, such as the occasional AI mishap and the lack of variety in side activities. However, these minor flaws are easily overlooked in light of the game's strengths.

The original soundtrack and exceptional voice acting also deserve a special mention. The developers have curated an atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly complements the era, while the voice actors deliver convincing performances that breathe life into the characters.

In conclusion, Mafia II: Definitive Edition is an exemplary remaster, staying true to the spirit of the original while enhancing every aspect of the game to meet contemporary standards. It's a testament to the timeless appeal of a well-told crime story, coupled with engaging gameplay and stunning visuals. This game deserves to be in the library of anyone who appreciates narrative-driven games and the noir charm of the Mafia setting.

A must-play classic, definitively.",1685297856,1685297856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Did I mention there are no other activities to do besides the story?

The is a seriously bad game that aged poorly. You will drive down the same 3-4 streets over and over and over again. This should have been a linear experience. You will die in combat from poor cover spots or shot by bullet sponge enemies who survive point blank shotgun fire. In the first half of the game, my car slammed into nearly everything in a 40's era car as if the brakes were completely shot.

The performance is probably worse than the original with the controls feeling exactly as they did in 2010, which isn't for the better. What you're paying for in essence is 35GB of enhanced textures, which at least playing on a 1080p monitor on the highest settings, I barely found noticeable for how much disc space is being demanded. 

I think the story and characters of Mafia II are compelling for the time that it came out, and definitely worth experiencing just once. They manage to make horrible human beings by all moral accounts still likeable in personality, leaving you both disgusted by the people that you do come to care for in the narrative. However the DE has also no changes to the story, you will not be experiencing any new or remade content- which I think is the only thing that would've saved this game for me as a stand-alone product. 

I would say buy the original Mafia II but unfortunately as per usual from publishers nowadays, they make it impossible to buy the original games in favour of forcing the new versions onto consumers. Even on GOG you can only buy the classic version of Mafia I which the Definitive Edition has for all intents and purposes become a far better version of in every way. So I suggest either obtaining the game through 'other' means or watching a playthrough on Youtube for the full experience of Mafia II nowadays. It is not worth paying anything above $10-$15 for the original game, let alone pay full price of the DE to experience a game that still belongs in 2010 in this form.",1683513951,1683513951,False,7,0,0.525443971157073975,0,True,False,False

This game is really something special the game plays out really well and is super well paced, it never feels like the missions are dragging or anything you do is super forced for the sake of padding or other reasons, the voice acting is great and the story is a classic mafia story that for someone like me, a big fan of Godfather, Goodfellas etc... just hits all the right spots. The characters are fantastic and Vito surely deserves his face on the mafia's Mt. Rushmore. Driving controls and camera are kinda wack at times though.
 HOWEVER this review is negative for all the reasons everyone else is saying, I personally didn't notice any bugs until about half way through(besides the stuttering) and only then it was a few minor bugs, but after chapter 11ish the bugs came rolling in, some I remember from back in the day when I played it on 360, It stutters like a mad man on crack if you don't cap the frames to 60 or whatever your system can handle, (probably 60fps regardless), 
visual bugs in the cutscenes started appearing(vito's hair, eyes getting stuck etc...), and even worse the infinite loading screen is back in chapter 14, along with Joe and his *** getting stuck in chap. 14 as well.
The ""Improvements"" are nice but not really well done and not worth the terrible buggy mess we got, sure the lighting is better in some scenes but it also blinds the **** out of you too! Sure the reworked character models are nice, but they only worked the story characters and no one else(and not even the outfits in some cases, so you get higher res faces and 360 era suits on 'em), I mean they still used only 3-4 models for all the npcs on the sidewalks, background etc, THERE IS LITERALLY ONLY ONE ASIAN MODEL FOR THE CHINESE AND ONE COP MODEL! And yeah the textures are nicer too even if shop awnings float around sometimes. The camera for driving still sucks, the performance is garbo, and only some city textures were updated. Its like a WIP mod made by one guy and this is just a preview except it screws the whole game over and now you gotta buy it to get the older more superior version of it.
I really love this game, but 2k did all of us dirty with the ""DeFiNiTiVe TrIlOgY"". Don't support this game or if you must buy this game, get it on sale.

TL;DR - Buggy, half-***ed ""remaster"" not worth the time or money, classic version is goated though.

There are a lot of similar things between GTA 4 and Mafia 2. The graphics , the physics , the gameplay and even the main character ( war veteran who becomes a criminal ). Mafia 2 has some weaknesses compared to GTA 4 , but its still a pretty good game.

[b] Pros: [/b] 
- The main story is good 
- The physics are great , feels very similar to gta 4
- The graphics are decent
- The gameplay is a bit boring sometimes , but its good

[b] Cons: [/b]
- The DLC-s are not fun at all , barely any cutscenes and repetitive gameplay for the most part
- The optimization is not good , just like gta 4 ( 70-90 fps with dips on a good PC R5 3600 + RX 5700XT + 32 GB RAM)

If you like Tommy, the taxidriver, gentleman, who fall in the Mafia because of his spitefull flaw but still with an honor code, you're going to hate Vito the muscle with no more personality than a dry board. His family is sweep under the rug after two hours of game despite how important they seems at the beginning. He is a war veteran coming back after getting an explosion in the face, his squad dying, himself being saved by a deus ex machina, but he go right back to low level crime the second he can. I really tried sympathizing with him and his story of illegal immigrant son, with alcolic violent father, end up throw in WW2 after getting arrested, but he get no personality, no remorse, not a single actual reason to sympathize when he always make the same moronic choices

1) 2K, If you make a series of games, don't change the fu....king controller setup between two of them, even more when you don't offer the possibility to modify the controller scheme. Worse, don't change the meaning of options between games. In the first, putting the police on normal make them unaware unless you ram them, but simulation make them go after you if you go too fast, or cut a red light. Here in normal, they still care if you go too fast but you can ram them and they don't react att all. I got fined in the first 10 minutes of game on this BS

2) The fov is a nightmare (that can be modified through modding). The game is ugly as sin and the gameplay look like a crossover plagiat of GTA4 and Yakuza with the stupid hand to hand combat (between Vito supposedly a war veteran and mooks). Actually no, while this bit of gameplay is Yakuza plagiat, the entire game and story is actually something of a counterfeit GTA4

3) While the map is way smaller than Mafia 1, the city is so cluttured you can't actually go faster from objectives to objectives compared to the first

4) The only flaw I gave to the first game was that outside of following the story, driving and shooting, there wasn't anything to do in this open world. Mafia 2 add money, and the possibility to buy guns, food, clothes and modding vehicules. Except the only ways to make money is to follow the story, drop cars in two places, and rob stores that then become unavailable until next chapter. No racing, No use of the hand to hand combat for illegal boxing for exemple. No side content except DLCs

5) The story is a wash, Vito is just a dumb muscle that get the short end of the stick everytime because he is a moron. Joe have enough personality for two, that of a drunkard loser I just want to shoot 30 minutes in the game. Except the mafia giving mission, almost nothing actually happen around it. Even once made in a family, nothing change for our characters from the start.

The game's world is meticulously designed, with an accurate representation of the time period that includes everything from the cars and clothing to the music and architecture. The attention to detail is impressive, and it creates an authentic and immersive atmosphere that is rarely seen in video games.

Ingridients:
2 x 400g beef fillets 
Olive oil
500g of mixed wild mushrooms (don‚Äôt forget to clean them!) 
1 thyme sprig, leaves only 
¬Ω kilo puff pastry 
8 slices of Parma ham 
2 egg yolks, beaten with 1 tbsp water and a pinch of salt
Sea salt and recently ground black pepper

For the sauce: 

 olive oil
 200g beef trimmings (these can normally be requested at the butcher when ordering the fillets)
4 large shallots, peeled and sliced 
12 black peppercorns 
1 bay leaf 
1 sprig of thyme 
Dash of red wine vinegar 
1 x 750ml bottle red wine
 750ml beef stock

1.) Wrap each fillet of beef in plastic wrap (make sure it is tight to set the shape!) and leave it in the fridge overnight
2.) After removing the plastic, sear the beef fillet for 40-60 seconds, ensuring the outside is brown while the inside remains rare. Remove the beef from the pan and leave it to cool down.
3.) Cut the mushrooms finely and fry in the frying pan with olive oil, the Thyme and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Continue to fry over a high heat until the excess moisture is gone and you are left with a paste like consistency. Remove this paste and leave to cool
4.) Cut the puff pastry in half and put  each piece on a lightly floured surface. Mold each piece into a rectangle big enough to cover your beef fillets and place in the fridge
5.) Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on your cooking surface and put 4 slices of your parma ham in the middle, slightly overlapping in the shape of a square. Spread half of your mushroom paste evenly on this square
6.) Season one of your beef fillets and use the plastic wrap to envelope the ham around said fillet. Roll and tie the ends of the plastic wrap to get a satisfyingly even log. Repeat step 5 and 6 with your other fillet and chill both for 30 mins 
7.) Move the beef from the plastic wrap  and nvelope the beef fillets in the pastry. Coat the pastry in the whisked egg yolks and wrap with plastic wrap. Leave this in the fridge for 30 mins
8.) While waiting, now is the time to make your sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large pan and fry the beef trimmings until golden brown. Add the shallots, pepper, thyme and bay leaf, stirring frequently until the shallots are also golden (around 5 mins) 
9.) Pour in the vinegar and boil until almost fully reduced. Now pour in your wine and let it boil until the same effect is achieved. Add the beef stock and bring back to the boil. Let the sauce simmer for an hour, removing any foam from the surface. Strain the sauce and add seasoning where necessary.
10.) When you are ready to cook the Beef Wellingtons preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius/ Gas 6. Slash the pastry with a blade or a sharp knife to allow it to expand during baking and bake for 15-20 mins until the pastry is golden and cooked through. Allow to cool for 10 mins before carving 
11.) Reheat the sauce and serve as an accompaniment to the Beef Wellington.
12.) Enjoy and reflect on how much of an awesome chef you would be in 1800‚Äôs Colonizers Britain

I think if i had played the vanilla version of Mafia 1 it would have transitioned alot smoother but since it was the remastered edition -which looked fantastic btw- it was like stepping onto a bunch of nails. Dont get me wrong, i still enjoyed this game but in its current state its a far cry out from being a top tier.

First of all, most of the graphics look decent, i didnt really encounter too many things that seemed out of place, of course coming from the mafia remaster i had high hopes thinking this one would be visually stunning from the get-go. It plays like a game of the time, abit clunky, abit messy but overall enjoyable.

My biggest problem with this game is the saves... The game keeps a checkpoint so far back to what you've progressed to. For instance, i could clear and entire mission, kill all the targets, escape to the end location but if i somehow manage to die before a big cutscene or near the area im meant to get to its like Dr.Strange used the time stone and put me allllll the way back to the start of the initial mission. Now this may not seem that bad, but some of these mission require you to go across the map sometimes to finish it so it can become tedious. Not to mention i was playing on hard difficulty so i could be easily killed within a few shots. Another lacklustre thing was there not really being alot to spend your cash on, i bought all the guns i could at the gun shops, fixed a few cars up but thats it. To top it all of, you lose all your cash TWICE throughout the game, so heres me spending about 1 hour cheesing the map refresh rate at Bruskis scrapyard to continuously crush two cars at around ¬£400 each to be able to have as much cash as i want for it then take that all away TWICE lol. 

Overall its quite the mess but still fun overall, im going to play the third and final game soon so im hoping ill enjoy that one also.

If I could sum up the game in a nutshell with a sitcom overtone, it'd be ""Joe's Sales Pitches"" because with each successful buy, Vito drags himself deeper into debt. 

Vito and Joe forever remains as an iconic and based duo. I'm looking forward to modding the game as much as I am with the original first game. Looking forward to replaying again and again. Joe's Adventures is hilarious.

I played the original mafia remaster on ps4 before playing this and decided to try to get used to the pc controls. Although it felt odd at first, the controls make a lot of sense and feel really good in my opinion. They could be better but they are not bad by any means. And to anyone expecting this game to feel like a mafia game, its less of a mafia game and more of a crime game (basically 1950's GTA IV). I think that the storytelling is top notch in mafia 2 and has slowly became one of my favorite story's of all time. I didn't think it was too spectacular at first until i would realize ive been playing the game for six hours straight and then i realized how much i really sympathized with vito. On the other hand, this game is pretty glitchy (or at least the pc port). If you dont mind restarting 20 minute missions or restarting your game occasionally then by all means please play this game.

That being said, I hate that they still make you drive everywhere with no skip. Also, the saves are in awful places.

It also feels dated by the treatment on women, (blow job scene anyone?)/ That being said, it definitely  hooked me after the initial set up and the long prison chapter was very bold. I honestly wanted Mafia III to be great because Clay is one of the best characters ever written, but it became a lame GTA grind in game play.

Poor family, debt-ridden father and bad friendships are elements that lead him despite himself to be caught in the act during a theft, resulting in his being brought back to Italy to help in the liberation of the peninsula during World War II. Returning to America because of a gunshot wound, he will find a way to be discharged from the army forever, hoping to resume a social climb that will make him forget his modest origins.

From this plot unfolds a story some 15 hours long and divided into chapters. Marked in the middle by an additional long passage of time, useful to tell the story of Vito's psychological evolution, as well as the radical social change from the postwar period to the economic boom of the 1950s, reinforced by the abandonment of the wintry and snowy climate in favor of a milder and more lush one.
Mafia II is, like its siblings of the same name, a work that pushes hard on the emotions, wanting to tell a raw, adult story that spares nothing and no one, as life has taught the protagonists themselves. Vito is a man of low lineage who, as is so often the case, is willing to get his hands dirty in order to live with his head held high among the greats. He will discover the joys and sorrows of his choices, until a bitter but somehow just ending. A plot that never reaches the splendor of the first unforgettable chapter but that still, ten years later, will be able to give you some moments of the highest stage value.
Mafia II received several high praises upon its release. We have already analyzed the period of its arrival on the market, and undoubtedly the boost of the memory of the first chapter helped quite a lot in the general reception, both of the press and fans. As time went on, we realized, despite ourselves, the major issues and difficulties encountered in making a highly linear game within an open world.

The difficult coexistence with GTA, which at that time had reached its fourth chapter and was able to showcase a beautiful and enormous Liberty City, evidently weighed on the minds of the guys at 2K, to the point where they decided to work even more assiduously on their vision of the open world, which, unfortunately, never really worked.

Mafia II is a schizophrenic title, throwing the player into a series of missions that punctuate the passage of time between waking up and resting again. There is never any real sense of freedom of movement, dictated only by a city that is rich in detail but reduced in size and deadly dull. Aside from a handful of restaurants, clothing stores and workshops, the rest of the interiors are relegated to campaign missions that circumscribe the area solely to that specific moment. Forget about the freedom to choose which mission to undertake, just as it will be useless to try to think about finding secondary assignments (here called jobs and reduced to the bone).

From this point of view Mafia II fails miserably in its purpose and, what is most infuriating, is that it does so out of the one and only need to please a market that would not have accepted it otherwise. As if that were not enough, this displaces a shooting system and a driving model that are capable of setting the standard even now within the genre.",1681086734,1681086734,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have played the game for the first time ever so for me the story was really nice. A minor negative in my opinion was the lack of a ""Free Roam"" mode but this was easily overcome by loading a chapter with quite good progress money-wise or with plenty of guns and cars in your disposal. 

As for the DLC's ""Joe's Adventure"" was enjoyable but the two with Jimmy as the protagonist were a bit boring. I personally played them just for the 100% and the achievements. 

The biggest problem I encountered was the random ""Load Failed"" error i saw in my playthroughs of ""The Betrayal of Jimmy"" and ""Jimmy's Vendetta"" making me play them from scratch as I was not able to recover any of the two save game files. Also I was a bit dissapointed by the fact the all of the DLC missions was actually a time trial making the experience a bit rushing for me and not being able to enjoy them in the extend I would like. 

Apart from these things considering the DLC's, I really liked the main game so I would personally recommend it.

I was expecting much better after playing the first instalment of the franchise - Mafia: Definitive Edition. That felt like a definitive edition, this on the other hand, felt like the same game from 10 years ago with the 'definitive edition' label strapped to it. 

It feels like they did the bare minimum with this ''definitive edition'' and I would almost say the legacy version is better. The graphics hasn't changed one bit and looks just about the same as the legacy version, but with more bugs. 

Everything was running smoothly at the beginning, until I got in deeper and deeper into the story chapters. I started noticing characters' faces messed up and cut scenes with broken segments, Characters speaking over themselves, and repeating themselves, on the SAME conversation (even in the final encounter)
The list of bugs just goes on and on.

Now the DLC is another can of worms on its own, and is absolutely disastrous. 
Why in the fuck would you make EVERY SINGLE mission a time trial? 
Playing the DLC felt like a chore more than anything else. 
Drive there, shoot everyone, return. Run here, steal a car, return. Over and over. 
Not to mention the story is almost none existent with cutscenes telling you NOTHING. 

So, don't let the title fool you, this Definitive Edition lies in the Classic Mafia II version. Not this remake.  It runs better, looks just as good (even better in some aspects) and doesn't have these annoying issues.

Mafia II is definitely worth playing, but make sure you don't rob yourself out of an enjoyable ride with these technical issues. Play the Classic version instead, and skip the DLC.",1680768185,1680768185,False,11,0,0.588384449481964111,0,True,False,False

Game was actually fun! Did not expect I would have a great time with such an old game, but it held up. Story was amazing too, a man making a name for himself in a world of crime. The dynamic of vito and joe might be one of the greatest tandems that has blessed the videogame world. Did not get bored actually since the gunplay was really challenging on hard difficulty.

Mafia I is better tho. People say mafia 2 had better story, I disagree. Tommy's story was way more personal and contained more emotion vs Vito making a name for himself.

First off, the game looks and runs great. Coming from the original, DE is a far cry away. Aside from the odd newspaper flashing, everything appears seamless and its almost as if there's a new color palette making the world brighter. Performance seems optimized well enough. I ran on max settings 1440p (2700x/ rtx 2080) and probably averaged around 80-120fps.

For folk new to the Mafia series, I'd absolutely recommend giving this game a shot. Its fun to play as a mobster! The story and characters are unforgettable and the attention to detail in the recreation of the 40-50's era is phenomenal.

I kind of see them as Variants of the original Mafia I story outcomes but through other characters eyes.

Mafia II has by far the best Driving and Car collection/modifications of the Trilogy.
It's not as polished graphically as I and III but the gameplay is exactly the same as it was when I first came out.

As someone who's already played the original Mafia 2, I was excited to see how this new edition would improve upon the game.

First off, the graphics were definitely a step up from the original. The environments and characters all looked more polished and detailed, which made the game feel more immersive. However, I did notice some glitches and bugs here and there, which was a bit frustrating.

In terms of gameplay, it was pretty much the same as the original. The shooting and driving mechanics were solid, but there weren't really any new additions to the gameplay that made it feel fresh. It was just more of the same, which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it.

The story was still the highlight of the game for me. Mafia 2 has always had a great narrative, and it still holds up in the Definitive Edition. The characters are well-written, and the voice acting is top-notch. However, I did feel like some of the pacing was a bit off. Certain parts of the story felt rushed, while others dragged on for too long.

I would say that Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is a decent remaster of the original game. The improved graphics and solid gameplay make it worth playing again, especially if you're a fan of the original.

There are loads of graphical enhancing mods for Mafia II that are way better looking than this remaster.

To be honest Mafia 2 is a great game. Great story, great gameplay and great music, it perfectly captures the vibe of the forties and fifties. But that is the classic version not this rip off ‚Äúremaster‚Äù...

I did love the remake of the first Mafia, but that was a remake of something totally new and well crafted worthy of the ‚ÄúDefinitive Edition‚Äù name. Here we have a remastered version labeled as ‚ÄúDefinitive Edition‚Äù where the developers put little effort in it. Basically we do not have much more than HD graphics, cool snow and some tweaks here and there. In the end, the game feels buggy with NPC‚Äôs, and even our own character, do not move their lips in some cutscenes and in some others they are invisible. And on top of all the bugs the game feels laggy and I was not playing with the same graphic card that I had when the original game released in 2011 I was playing it on a 3060 Ti. 
It is a mess how a game Mafia 2 can be destroyed with a ‚Äúremaster‚Äù job like this.

Imagine how funny it would be if one day they decide to remake it. Since this is already the ‚ÄúDefinitive Edition‚Äù what would they call the new version? ‚ÄúDefinitive Definitive Edition‚Äù, ‚ÄúReal Definitive Edition‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis time the Definitive Edition‚Äù

Anyway, as I said before I do not recommend this to anyone. It is sad because I did like the game, I like the trilogy but this is not the way. Surely for many players that never played Mafia 2, this will be unnoticed and you may like it despite the many issues of the game‚Äôs version. After all, now, you cannot buy the classic version anymore, when you buy this you get the classic version for free and surprise surprise what do you gonna try to play? (Big mistake).

Truthfully speaking, Mafia 2 is not as good as Mafia 1, but it is certainly a gem and a ""must-play"" for everyone - I highly recommend playing through the two games. With that said, I bought Mafia 1 and 2 on sale and I would NEVER buy either of the two games at full price. 30 bucks for this port that has a lot of bugs (which we will talk about) is just not acceptable. I paid 5 and I felt like that was a reasonable amount for this old port. 

Took me about 10.5 hours to finish the game on Hard difficulty, so let's talk about the good, bad and ugly. Starting with the bad and ugly, 

‚Ä¢ Stuttering gets progressively worse throughout the chapters - started off relatively fine, but by chapter 12-15 the game stuttered an insane amount to the point where it felt semi unplayable. By then I was too invested and had to just endure the terrible performance. 

‚Ä¢  [b] SLIGHT SPOILER INCOMING![/b] Chapter 14 is bugged and has been for years. If you decide to rob any stores during chapter 14 or rob stores in order to get enough money for Bruno, the ending cutscene will not show up and you will have to re-do this mission (which is quite long, might I add). The simple fix is to take the $22.000 when you kill Derek and then crush cars at Bruski's. 

‚Ä¢ Way too expensive. 30 bucks for an archaic and bad port like this is outrageous. Don't ever buy this unless it's on sale. 

‚Ä¢ A lot of visual bugs... Faces, cars, screen blinking, etc. 

‚Ä¢ Dialogue bugs. Repeated lines and delayed lines are common. 

‚Ä¢ No ability to free-roam? Seriously? Why was this never implemented. Even Mafia 1 had this. 

‚Ä¢ Cops in this game are useless - you can massacre the whole city and all it takes is to speed a little bit up and they will never catch you. Massive downgrade to the cops in Mafia 1, which I found to be brutal on Classic mode. 

All in all, you can get past the bugs and enjoy the game, none of them break the game completely and I played through the whole thing without a single crash. Let's talk about the good...

Mafia 2 is a game that executes the 1940s and 1950s theme perfectly... Everything from the cars, Empire Bay which sets the tone for a fictional take on New York brilliantly, the weapons and most importantly, the characters and overall story-telling. These are without a doubt Mafia 2's strongest points. I can't praise the story enough, it is enthralling and captivating and you become heavily invested in the characters of the game, to the point where deaths in-game are felt on a personal level. It's just one of those games where you have to play through it to see what it's all about - trust me, it's worth it.

Oh, and they also give you naked Playboy women to look at throughout the game and I can shamelessly admit that I collected every 50 of them. Oops.",1677775495,1677776267,True,16,1,0.695598125457763672,0,True,False,False

First of all, the story: The first Mafia game had a great story, it's what drove the gameplay. You had unique, memorable character design and introductions, great voice acting, and a plot filled with interpersonal drama that actually develops like a movie. Mafia 2's writing feels so watered-down by comparison, with bland characters in service of a generic plot. 

Also, taking place only a few years later than the events of Mafia 1, you would expect the game's story would take the opportunity to tie into Mafia 1's rich legacy and characters - but as far as I can tell, it doesn't at all. And I'm not spoiling anything when I say: The game actually punishes you for completing the first few missions by sending you straight to prison! Which brings me to my next point...

The gameplay: I don't know what the real difference between Mafia 2's ""Definitive Edition"" and the original Mafia 2 is, but I don't think it matters - because it would seem the developers took complaints about the driving and shooting challenges of the first game to heart, and made this game completely about beating the brains out of every knucklehead you encounter with your bare fists. 

There's actually very little action in a lot of the game's levels before the third act - and the majority of it involves clunky 1v1 fist-fights with AI opponents in instanced events. This would be fine if the fighting mechanics are on par with a decent brawling game, but this isn't. Wooden, at best, is how I would describe the controls, and most fights quickly devolve into button-mashing trash. It's only after slogging through this that you get the chance to really play the game...

As far as the gunplay goes - it's not bad. It's about the same as Mafia DE; the cover action is pretty smooth, and there's some room for experienced gunslingers to take shots that wouldn't be possible on other cover-based 3rd person shooters. Shooting goons in this game is really fun. Same goes for the driving physics - the quicker 40-50's era muscle cars are a blast to drive, but there's only a few missions where you are actually put to the test driving anything. 

On top of that, there's a lot of points in the game where you get your money and weapons taken away unexpectedly, so there's no real point in earning money or visiting shops to access new equipment in between story mission save points... the open world function is basically useless. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this game lacks all of the side missions, secret vehicles, and characters of the first game, besides some soft-core pin up art!?!?

Overall, it pales in comparison to the 1st Mafia, and the 1st Mafia: Definitive Edition. If you can get it for less than 5 bucks it's a fine time waster. Even on hard difficulty, it's a game that you can play at your leisure, as long as you get used to the checkpoint system. But if you're expecting the story and action of the 1st Mafia... well I don't know what to tell ya, champ.

Pretty good game and a decent remaster from what I have seen since I didn't finish the original game. But overall I decently enjoyed my time with it and I'd recommend it if you can get it on a sale.

+The best thing in the entire game for me is dialogue. It's a dialogue-heavy game but every line says something, it's not just dialogue for the sake of filling up the void. Paired together with amazing voice acting makes it a delight to listen to the characters talking.

~The story itself is good, but I wasn't fully into it.
~The combat is passable.
~I feel like it could've used some more save spots in some missions.

-My main gripe with this game is the amount of driving, I get why it's here but I don't find it all that engaging to constantly drive from point A to B, especially since it's often the same locations.
-Another one is with the remaster itself and some bugs in it. For example, whenever you destroy the environment, especially that one mission where you have to shoot up something, it quickly goes from 144 fps to 17.
-Another bug I encountered is when you have to chase a car, I was behind him the whole time, something like 10 meters distance (so not much at all). And then the car just disappears so a dialogue line can be played ""we lost him, better go looking for him"" (or something like that). This also frequently happened in combat with grunts, they just sometimes disappear, happened two times in the China Town mission.",1675949366,1675949366,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This game, especially after Mafia III release, got a positive reputation, most of which it does not deserve. In short, there are two reasons: utterly empty and repulsive characters and a lot of technical issues.

The protagonist, Mr. Scaletta, is a descendant of a deadbeat Italian man, whom along with their family, immigrated in States in mid 1920s. From the start, there's a stark difference between Vito and protagonist of Mafia I, Tommy Angelo -- whilst Tommy got into the criminal business by chance, and although ultimately he got fully integrated with family, did so with some reluctance, Vito is a different story altogether. He's an unpleasant arrogant hood boy whose only motivation, as he states during exposition, is to have the most money and carry the least of the responsibility and consequences.

Comparing to Tommy, to whom I can, to a degree, show some sympathy and compassion, I hate Vito. He's stupid, dumb and witless, triggers absolutely zero compassion, and to be honest, doesn't deserve his second chance. Just like a piece of dumb dumbness, he floats along the coasts of the plot, with no back thought, effort or even a blink of initiative taken. Steal a car? Not his idea. Sell drugs? Not his idea. Shoot these random guys or execute someone? Not his idea. He just does what he has been told. Even Joe is more to my liking: although he's not in check with reality and is constantly being borked over his delusion of grandeur, he shows some initiative, character growth, even some emotions.

But Vito? Nah, I'm just a lonely dumb gopnik from Italian ghetto, and I want more money, thanks.

There are a lot of holes in the character development, their motivation and the plot in general, but the main, ahem, ""protagonist"" is the worst of them, in my opinion.

The plot as a whole has some issues with pacing, and the ending -- well, don't even start me on that. Let's just say that this is the most anti-climatic ending in a mafia-themed game I have ever seen. Especially after the build-up that the game does just a few minutes before the credits.

Now, to the the other stuff. The original game was an impressive, but a bit dated experience. Driving and shooting mechanics, in my opinion, felt clunky even at the time of the original release, graphics were impressive but the engine was not optimized very well, and whilst the game positioned itself as a next-gen experience, the muddy textures and very strange facial animations looked questionable at best, along with cloth simulation. The only truly impressive things I can remember which looked great in 2010 were particle effects and destructible environments, albeit at the cost of the performance, which wasn't great to begin with.

Now the remaster tried to address some things, but let's be honest: devs didn't do much apart from fixing deal-breaking compatibility issues and updating textures and some of the models. All of the bugs you might remember from the original game -- they are still here. Broken scripts, broken driving mechanics, questionable stealth and AI behavior, it's all still here. Now what they've brought new are some unexpected stutters here (frame pacing is all over the place), broken particle effects (during diner shootout scene FPS dares to drop to mid-teens on a RTX 3070 Ti -- how about that?) and other performance issues, and a few new cars from Mafia I and Mafia III for character to use, a taxi cab and a muscle car.

To sum up: there's nothing ""definitive"" in this ""edition"". It's just a rather old game with its own issues, which was very cheaply bumped up to the ""running on Windows 10"" state, bundled with a few new bugs and a new price tag.

I've bought the whole ""remaster"" pack on a sale for a very low price, so I can't really complain about price-to-entertainment ratio here (plus to that, Mafia I re-make is great!), but on its own, this game is not worth its asking price, and I would've preferred the original any day of the week, especially considering that community fixed most of the original's bugs and performance issue on their own.

Oh yeah, you can't buy the original anymore. How meta.

Cons:

[*] World feels empty
[*] World is super ugly in comparison to the first game
[*] Character models are ugly
[*] Gunplay didn't really improve
[*] All characters are flat
[*] Story is bad
[*] Fights are not fun but just tedious to extend the length of the game
[*] That includes both the gunfights as well as the worst box fighting simulation I have ever witnessed
[*] The performance optimization of this game is garbage. Whenever you start to destroy the environment you be better prepared for the FPS to drop down from 200 to 20. And yes they remain that low until you leave the area or die.
[*] The music selection is sooo much worse
[*] Menu has less options in regards of video quality and control

Get it if you love fantastically developed mob stories, that are very cinematic like Goodfellas and The Sopranos. If you care so much about graphics, maybe skip it but try it if you love story rich games that isn't that long.

Mafia II is a game made with allot of love and hard work from its developers, While one can reminisce about the countless hours of cut content due a to rapidly approaching deadline, The game dose a lot right the cut content makes certain areas of the game like Vito's phone call to Franny and the reference to features that no longer exist in the game awkward. That being said Mafia II is probably my favorite game of all time having played it since childhood, Vito Scaletta's story felt real it was exiting it was engaging and in the end it was somber. As all media relating to the mafia goes there is no such thing as a perfectly happy ending (until Mafia III if u can count the rule together ending as happy) Joe's fate is left as ambiguous (until III) and Vito's narrative in this title doesn't end as him being some wise guy Capo at the top of the food chain, Vito leaves as a 26 year old with a slightly better idea of the mob and with the thought is best friend is going to die because of him. I have a lot of love for this franchise that being said they're some issues with the Definitive Edition, If your expecting a from the ground remake of one of your favorite 2k titles that's not this game but it's probably in the works by now. Sometimes Vito's feet glitch through Marty's bed sometimes cut-scenes will cut themselves off if you've seen the community tab then you've probably seen some of the more glaring almost game breaking ones, The Definitive Edition also dose not bring back any cut content for the game in a substantial way. That being said if your looking for a remastered Mafia II in 2023 than the Definitive Edition is worth buying in my opinion, I had plenty of fun playing through both the main story and the following DLC's. In fact the DLC's bring back the Supermarket, Cat house, Frank Vinci's Mansion, the Warehouse, ect. as playable area's as well as allowing you insight on whats happening inside Empire Bay outside of Vito. All things considered though the game has its Flaws the Definitive Edition of Mafia II is a game worth playing for both Veteran fans and New players.",1675053593,1675053664,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Story, physics, your advancement in the game and feelings of reward. Enough free-roaming to keep you entertained. Only qualm is after you beat it, there's no *continue in free roam* option so it's just ""chapter select"" from then on, which works fine.

Graphics, also great. I did find that the game performs outrageously (low fps) on High physx, with zero difference while using Medium physx -- specific to some areas, i.e. points within the distillery mission.. Using an overclocked 2070 super on my i9-9900kf @ all core 5.0ghz.. I do consider this likely is just another case of crysis-tessellation but either way, visual appearance doesn't change at Medium and I can maintain my steady 144fps now. All other settings @ high seem to be OK

Lighting and weather are a marvel to experience; you need gameplay though and overall, I would say that I quite enjoyed the DLC. I don't usually like driving in games, but I kinda got to like it in Mafia II. Just as well, there's a lot of it. The DLC are not wonderful or great, they are just about good. The problem is there's too much repetitive grind and overall they often lack challenge in the missions. They just about kept me hanging in there with occasionally varied tasks to complete the end story, but it was always only just enough, not awash with thought and planning. Joe's Adventures are the worst of the DLC though, jarring arcade elements are introduced and the missions are far too much of a grind with little variation. However the base gameplay is good enough to keep you going through the DLC and there are just about enough lengthy, complex shooting missions with the added challenge of being against the clock to keep up the interest.

A good base game that handles driving very well and does a reasonable job of character development. The fps element of the game is a solid cover shooter that allows for multiple routes to targets and makes good use of the environment to destroy, hide and explode to your advantage. This is highly enjoyable. There are varied weapons that sound, reload and feel different and obviously do different levels of damage. ammunition is plentiful (I played on medium difficulty) and the draw distance and collision detection is generally excellent so get your sniper skills in actions because enemy AI is distance triggered and this allows you a hack in some of the more open moments.

I just want to indicate some points that I think it shouldn't include in ""definitive edition"". Firstly, although I played this game in medium level, I think NPC's shooting power is too annoying. Also in missions, NPCs spawn anywhere randomly(and they'll most likely kill you with a shotgun). Dying in the middle of the mission is annoying because usually the game starts you from the beginning of the mission. I think save system is not good for the game called ""definitive edition"". Also, the graphics did not satisfy me. I know Mafia 1 remake should have more adjustments but I think Mafia 2 deserves some innovation too.

In some stages, you will load in already being shot.

Things to note.  It's a semi open-world, but there are more opportunities to explore the world than the first Mafia. Your character, Vito Scaletta is not an ex taxi car driver in this story so there are less driving challenges in Mafia 2.

I love how they segue the characters from Mafia 1 into the story of Mafia 2. I won't spoil it by giving out too much here but that was a big surprise.

I want to slap whoever thought it was a good idea to not be able to shoot out of cars in Joe's adventures when most of the mission have people shooting at you from cars. What a joke. So unfun man I';m just driving like a defenseless bafoon. how unfun dude seriously. Also the no saving during missions in Joe's adventures is do dumb. DO NOT PLAY THIS DLC ITS NOT FUN AT ALL. 

Dude every time I get out of a vehicle my weapons are put away. This Gmae is literally trying its haredest to be unfun I swear on my life. Every Dev decision is complete *** what are they thinking I cant even beat the mission wtf I'm on easy i've tried 5+ tiomes and it just restarts you at the start what a complete inconsideration for my time what a joke I'm not 100%ing this game what a complete waste of my time **** the Devs they are complete ********. *******************!!!!!!!


Play this game for sure. Aiming and shooting is way better than the first game. Driving is also really fun in this game. The music on the radio is AWESOME. Sometimes I just sit in my car and let the song finish before starting a mission. 

You can place way points on the map which was absent from the first game causing major headaches. Alt-tabbing doesn't break the games cut scenes or audio which is big. Cops dont agro as much in this game as well. you can get away with alot more while in the last game everyone would call the cops. Fist fighting has had alot more effort put into it and its really fun. Learning the counters mid game was super cool. 

The voice acting is hit or miss. Sometimes its extremely good and I';m super engrossed in the story but sometimes they are complete robots it feels like. 

Main game is pretty easy even on hard difficulty. The DLCs are kinda boring imo. They are just errand boy missions with timers. 

That being said, I'm really upset you cant shoot from cars. 

---------SPOILERS AHEAD---------

In Joe's Adventures there are a ton of missions where you are getting shot at from a another car but there is nothing you can do unless you want to stop and take care of them but whats the fun in that? Let me have that mid chase gunfight. 

I'm gonna say it... There are too many wanted posters. On top of that number 63 I think needs you to jump off a bridge onto a roof to collect it. Maybe its because it was one of the last ones I had to get but I missed it over 5 times and I was furious. I know there was a similar collectible in the first game but pls when there are almost 200 make it easy for me. 

In the mission where your house is set on fire and you bail out the window is kinda silly. In no world am I going to be able to walk up to someone unarmed in my underwear while they are unloading their firearm on me and take them down. This really took me out of the game. You should die instantly imo. 

The way they tie the two games together is so cool. I was hyped when it happened. I wont spoil it you just gotta see it. 

Definitely play the game though its really fun.",1674002137,1674090188,False,3,0,0.502486526966094971,0,True,False,False

This Mafia is the best story for me, I have been playing the whole story for the fourth time, I watched and still watch Pedro for example at his series three times at least and I still enjoy the game and I will continue to enjoy it. Mafia 2 has a very well developed, interesting story, which I like a lot, the game is just great, if I had to write everything I like about Mafia 2, I would write it for another 2 hours. Mega, mega, mega I really appreciate that Mafia is in Czech, I'm glad because if it wasn't in Czech, I probably wouldn't even play the game, so I appreciate it.What I noticed now is that I played Mafia on normal difficulty and everything was fine, I had no problem with the game, but now I play Mafia for the fourth time, but this time on the difficulty difficult and I do not like a few things right away, I do not know, maybe it was just a bug. When I turned on the game on hard difficulty, the game bugged me from the beginning, for example, when I went to Giuseppe in the second chapter to get the discharge papers, I saw only the head, which had never happened to me before, or when I was driving in the car, the sound suddenly turned off completely and I did not hear anything for the whole chapter,I looked at the sound everywhere and I had it on, at volume 80 and it just didn't work anyway, as I said, it never happened to me before, only now on high difficulty. I give it a positive rating because Mafia 1.2 are simply the best, and the game is awesome only if I do not count a few things on high difficulty, even so the game is simply the best. If I had to rate the game, so for me Mafia is the Best, I recommend to everyone! Dirtix. (Google translate)",1671826252,1673641906,True,3,0,0.527968227863311768,0,True,False,False

Lighting and weather are a marvel to experience; you need gameplay though and overall, I would say that I quite enjoyed the DLC. I don't usually like driving in games, but I kinda got to like it in Mafia II. Just as well, there's a lot of it. The DLC are not wonderful or great, they are just about good. The problem is there's too much repetitive grind and overall they often lack challenge in the missions. They just about kept me hanging in there with occasionally varied tasks to complete the end story, but it was always only just enough, not awash with thought and planning. Joe's Adventures are the worst of the DLC though, jarring arcade elements are introduced and the missions are far too much of a grind with little variation. However the base gameplay is good enough to keep you going through the DLC and there are just about enough lengthy, complex shooting missions with the added challenge of being against the clock to keep up the interest.

A good base game that handles driving very well and does a reasonable job of character development. The fps element of the game is a solid cover shooter that allows for multiple routes to targets and makes good use of the environment to destroy, hide and explode to your advantage. This is highly enjoyable. There are varied weapons that sound, reload and feel different and obviously do different levels of damage. ammunition is plentiful (I played on medium difficulty) and the draw distance and collision detection is generally excellent so get your sniper skills in actions because enemy AI is distance triggered and this allows you a hack in some of the more open moments.

It's contains a great character arc  and the voice acting and atmosphere are of a high calibre.

it was also quite refreshing to have mission structured gameplay rather then a bloated open world

Be aware that this is just a remaster rather then the full remake the original Mafia version got (which I also enjoyed)
The visuals are servicable though but don't expect a graphical powerhouse and again the vibe/atmosphere of the setting make up for this.

Lastly I played this from start to finish on my steam deck and it's worth noting that i experienced some serious framerate drops.
It was as low as 18fps at times and whilst Infrequent it was enough to hamper the gameplay somewhat.

READ THE FULL REVIEW [url=https://videogamerate.com/game/mafia-ii]HERE[/url]

Yo, so you wanna know about Mafia II, huh? Alright, let me give you the lowdown on this game. It's a ragin' rollercoaster of a ride that'll have you laughin' and cryin' and blowin' away bad guys like it's nobody's business.

In this game, you play as Vito Scaletta, a wannabe mobster who's tryin' to make a name for himself in the world of organized crime. You start off as a small-time hustler, workin' your way up the ranks and takin' down anyone who gets in your way.

The graphics in this game are insane. The city is so detailed and realistic, it's like you're actually there. And the characters? Forget about it. They're so lifelike and well-written, you'll feel like you're hangin' out with your real-life goombahs.

But let's talk about the real star of the show: the action. This game is chock-full of shootouts, car chases, and all-out mob warfare. And let me tell you, it's a blast. The controls are smooth and responsive, and the gunplay is satisfying as hell. Plus, the game's got some really cool set-pieces, like a prison breakout and a casino heist that'll have you on the edge of your seat.

But don't get me wrong, this game's not all guns and explosions. It's got a deep and emotional story, too. Vito's journey from small-time hood to big-time Mafioso is packed with drama and heartbreak, and you'll find yourself really gettin' invested in his struggles and triumphs.

Overall, Mafia II is a damn fine game. It's got everything you could want in a mobster epic: action, drama, and a whole lotta style. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to give this game a spin. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself up all night playin' it.

Not like this"" and then it ended. I thought the game would have kept going but it just suddenly ends with what just happened and I didn‚Äôt like it.


The Good
The world of the game is nice and at night when the lights makes the city glow, it‚Äôs beautiful.

The beginning was very Christmas themed and there was actually 2 known Christmas songs during this section of game that could be played. I thought it was nice since I was playing this game during December.

The music in general for this game is really good! It‚Äôs just, I don‚Äôt think many of the music that‚Äôs in the game gets played. I could have sworn I heard a song by that clown elvis once. I mostly heard the same old songs so I felt there was a lot of songs just not being played.

Some music was actually implemented into the story to play once you got into the car.

The transition from the first game to the second game was nice.

Just driving around in the city was somewhat calming and relaxing.

The story for the most part was good.

Rain hits the car which was nice cause in the 1st mafia definitive edition, I don‚Äôt remember that happening.

The friendship between Joe and Vito was really nice.

I guess the playboy magazines that you can find was interesting. Never seen those in my life and it‚Äôs just interesting to me to see how much times have changed. Those woman back then all had this short haired bun look. It looked good.


The bad
The ending of the game.

The cops. The ai is actually great but I just want to drive fast. I like the cops in Mafia 1 DE. :-[

Some missions will have you going from one side of the map to the other.

The wanted posters are unnecessary. I believe they were the game devs pictures that you can collect. For what purpose, other than something the devs can laugh at?

A couple enemies near the end would kind of bug out and just stand or be on their knees in their death pose.

The game got buggy near the end when I did a mission with Joe. Dialogue would happen twice. I received double the amount of money from Joe to give back to someone because it happened twice. I quit the game and came back and everything was normal again but I still had double the amount so I was rich in the game. This was towards the end of game and it honestly didn‚Äôt matter. 

I don‚Äôt like the additional content. I don‚Äôt know who Jimmy is and why I should care about him or play whatever story dlc thing this is. It‚Äôs pretty much just go here and do that but it‚Äôs all just waves of enemies and getting bonuses. Like what? Who wants to waste their time with that? And with that ending I just got from the main game, why would I believe that this Jimmy guy would have a better story with all the crap missions that I have to go to? And just to note, there‚Äôs 2 of these Jimmy quest dlc things.

The last dlc additional content thing is Joes adventures. It was actually story content but I felt that it was pretty bad. It starts off earlier in the game but it was just doing a mindless task for revenge. I stopped playing midway into the first mission cause I don‚Äôt think that playing any further would be a good use of my time. I‚Äôm not sure if this dlc goes past the ending of the main game but after seeing the ending of main game, I have no desire to continue playing and would prefer to play a new game.

2k launcher stinks. You can just open the game from the folder though.

2k wants you to agree to some crap but you can disagree. Problem is, it always appears when you first start up the game or go into the options.

Not enough music channels.

A scene in the game was pretty much taken from the movie The Godfather with a slight change.

In cutscenes, sometimes the characters eyes either look up or to the right only. It‚Äôs clearly buggy or something went wrong when doing the definitive edition.

Mafia II is a game I‚Äôm so slowly becoming obsessed with. I only have five hours on it so far, but the original release is pretty good! However, it‚Äôs very much a game from 2010 with jagged anti-aliasing and Xbox 360 vibes. So out of curiosity, I wanted to check out the remaster to see if it ran better and looked a little more clean‚Ä¶

But remember, kids: Most remasters are slimy, cynical cash-grabs that ruin everything we love about old games. 

Mafia II: Definitive Edition is a mistake born out of laziness and piss poor optimization. All the care and love that went into the remake for the first Mafia is lost here. Just slather some hi-res textures and bad saturation and call it definitive. What a mudda fwuckin‚Äô joke! 

First of all, it‚Äôs a major downgrade visually. Yeah, the original wasn‚Äôt much of a looker even by 2010 standards, but this issue was remedied by great retro filtering, the level of detail found in the streets of Empire City, and the utilization of physx particle effects. The remaster has all of that, but the aesthetic is completely ruined by over-saturation and the loss of graphical nuances (fabric physx and character animations). Yet, textures are overhauled significantly with some improvements, but they are so insignificant to the overall experience. 

Secondly, the game is a glitchy mess. Like more so than the original game! Flickering effects and performance issues are still prevalent 2 years later. The original Mafia II had fps drop, but the fact that it wasn‚Äôt patched for a modern release is the pinnacle of laziness. Those 50GB didn‚Äôt do  nothin‚Äô!

This game is a literal waste of space. Even though I got it for free, I would trade it in for a refund. Keep playing the original.",1669817367,1671047809,False,2,0,0.517717540264129639,0,True,True,False

Graphics (7.5/10): Not spectacular, you can tell it was a game made in the 2010s. the textures (while improved) still aren't the best, and there are times where bloom is excessive.

Performance (7.5/10): It takes some tweaking to get this working perfectly, at least for me, make sure the priority for running Mafia 2 is ""high"" (not ""Realtime."") and also set PhysX to medium as high is extremely resource intensive. after doing those 2 things I averaged 150fps. This game is rather buggy too, nothing really game-breaking, but it's definitely immersion-breaking, there are quite a few outfit related bugs. and there's major graphical bugs during a couple of cutscenes in the chapter ""Balls and Beans."" Also due to how this remaster was done, many of the bugs from the ""definitive edition"" are also made present in the ""classic"" version which comes with the game.

Controls (10/10): Controls are snappy and responsive, you will rarely find your character being too slow to do what you want. going in and out of cover is smooth, you have 3 different walking speeds even on keyboard.  Driving feels really good too, and it's weighty, as it should be while driving these giant chunks of 40s-50s steel.

Story (8.5/10): Very good story, believable characters, good humor, some of the best f-bombs in history. You are an Italian immigrant by the name of Vito Scaletta, who was drafted into WWII in 1943 as they needed people on the Italian front. after getting shot you're sent back to the US and your friend gets you out of the war. However your family needs money to pay off a loan shark, so your friend gets you set up with some jobs that keep escalating further and further. That's about as much detail as I can go into without spoilers.

Final score: 83.7%
This is a solid game, and I really enjoy the story, but a multitude of bugs and lack of polish keep it from being better. People coming to this after the incredible Mafia 1 Definitive Edition will most likely be disappointed that this game didn't get quite the same treatment. However if you do like Mafia: The Lost City of Heaven, or its recent remake, Mafia: Definitive Edition, you should definitely give this a shot.",1646108216,1670380441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have some supernatural ability to hear the police radio...also the cops have a supernatural ability to scan for stolen plates pretty quickly for the 1940s...
Poor performance, occasional FPS drops and micro stutters while driving. Not well optimized like the Mafia 1 remake is
Vehicle physics feel off, not at all nice like the first game. The steering is too heavy and there is way too much oversteer. Also, you can't manually shift anymore

Also, the save system is pretty horrible, as there are only auto saves and they are quite rare, so you have to be tactical with when you need to stop playing and prey there are no crashes (I had none).

An excellent story with memorable characters set in a city that never sleeps. This is the story that turned Vito into the stone cold mobster he is. He goes from poverty and oppression to war, and then into the criminal underworld with Joe. Everything, with the exception of the middle point of the game, is done with Joe. The ending with Joe shook me and my girlfriend. Poor Vito. Must play, and get Joe's Adventures DLC to get the full experience. Also, 50 pieces of pr0n scattered around the world to collect.

Joe's Adventures take part during the middle part of the game, so I recommend starting the adventures after completing Chapter 6 (Time Well Spent) in Vito's campaign. There are 19 more pr0n collectibles to find and ""spend time with""
(no srsly there is a stat for time spent viewing the pr0n)
I feel like this shouldn't have been a DLC, and more of a intermission character swap. But you can thank the publisher for that BS.

The Betrayal of Jimmy and Jimmy's Vendetta both take place during outside of Vito and Joe's story lines, and is not cannon to either. Jimmy is just a random dude doing missions for some mob guy, and other than that the story isn't really important. Hell, Jimmy's last name isn't even mentioned. Ever. At any point in the game. What does matter is that Jimmy's story lines are a free roam action movie with guns, cars, and plenty of shootouts. I recommend playing it after finishing the story line of Vito and Joe. By then, you should be able to deal with the noticeable difficulty bump in Jimmy's campaigns.
Even though I talked more about Jimmy's campaign than Vito and Joe, I must emphasize that Jimmy is extra. There are no new pr0n clips or collectibles added, and only 1 car is added. Get this if you want more of Mafia 2, but don't expect the same wow out of Jimmy's ""story line.""

Onto the common points.
The music on the radio as well as in the game is phenomenal and makes the world feel like its in that time period. Perfect.
The radio personalities also add to the game and make if really feel like there is much more going on in the world.
The voice acting is great.
The driving is something you will do a lot, and I love it. There are plenty of cars to choose from and enough customization to make it fun to hoard cars. (A tip, hoard the culver empire and smith custom 200. IMHO they are the best all round cars with enough speed to get anywhere in a hurry without using too much fuel. There's a reason why the cops use them. The houston wasp isn't a bad choice either.)
The shooting is not so great. The cover system works against you constantly, and more often than not the pistols and the shotgun will be much more useful than the 50 round tommy gun. Which greatly saddens me because mafia shootouts and tommy guns are supposed to be together, man. When you eventually get your hands on the MP40 or .38 machinegun, there will never be a need to use the tommy guns. Also, you can't gun and drive, so there goes your power fantasy of wanting to drive-by  a bunch of goons with a tommy gun, like in the movies. The sound effects for the guns do the job.
The graphics are good enough maxxed out at 1080p on my PC, however I remember playing this on my PS3 near when it came out and thinking that there was no way a console game could look this good and be this fun. The streets and alleyways are full of NPC's, and there never is a shortage of cars on the streets. (looking at you  GTA <.<)

There is enough content here (if you bought the DLC) to keep you entertained for at least 20 hours.

10/10

I really hope Mafia 3 can hold a candle to how good this game is.
(Spoiler! It didn't, and Mafia 3 could never be this good.)
------------------------------------------------------------
This is a copy paste of my review for the original release. This version contains a few graphical changes, and some weird PhysX support changes, iirc. I played the original release to death on both PC and PS3, and honestly I couldn't find any huge differences in those versions of the game compared to this version of the  game. Mostly, this game is the same. I feel my review of the original game applies here. I recall a single issue I had, and that was when I first played this game on release with my i5 6400 and gtx 1660 super, I had a bad frame rate. That was patched out, and the game ran smooth afterwards. 
2022 edit: This game is incompatible with my dual monitor setup. I have to run only one screen at a time or it will default to 1080p. My main monitor is on a rtx 3070, and i run most games at 1440p. I use a second monitor on my intergrated graphics from my 5700g, but the game bugs and boots on the second monitor at 1080p with all resolution settings locked. Disabling the dual monitor setup via windows key + P  works. My guess is the game is loading into only 1 api per boot, so it defaulted to my 5700g graphics chipset's optimal settings.",1651081879,1669515033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The funny part is that the original Mafia 2 is only 9GB, meanwhile, this one is 44GB. It's really not worth that much GB difference when you are playing the same game.

Apart from the remaster, I don't understand why people praise the story for this game so much. In my opinion, the story is not intriguing, the characters are very forgettable, and has too many unnecessarily annoying objectives. The game feels empty in general idk. However, I can kinda see why people loved it back in the day when it was first released.

One thing I really liked about this game was the setting, they nailed 1940s-1950s atmosphere just like they did with the first game. I especially liked the atmosphere in the winter era early in the game.

Maybe, if I played the classic Mafia 2 first, I would have liked it more. Even though I don't like the story itself, this game definitely deserved a much better remaster like what they did with the first game.",1667180219,1667180219,False,18,1,0.57543104887008667,5,True,False,False

The game itself is not bad at all, but compared to the remaster of Mafia 1 it scores very low.

The story is really good, I like the progression in the game and all of the challenges the main protagonist has to face. The music is also nice and you can enjoy a nice cruise around the city while listening to the radio. Another thing they nailed is the map itself, very unique in my opinion, which is interesting to explore. There are the different vehicles, guns, and shops which also add to the games' charm and not the mention the magazine collection ;).

Aside from these positive features, there are some key elements that are ruining the experience for me.

There are a lot of visual bugs & glitches which I usually tolerate in any game, since its impossible not to have such, but in this game there is a bug in every possible mission. A very annoying part of every mission is going to your bed/home just to finish it. I had to replay several missions like 10+ times (not exaggerating), and some chapters even, because the characters AI would break and you cannot finish them.

Another issue is with driving 100 km/h besides the police and they don't give a damn, but when I drive 41-42 km/h call all units....like what the heck. Somehow when you're on 3 or 4 stars and there is no police following you, they still manage to shoot at you from somewhere, they are not even behind you or visible on the map. 

Aside from this there are these invisible edges, specifically on the highways, when you are too close to the railings, you somehow hit an edge and instantly die, this is if you drive fast enough, but I thought it's ridiculous. 

Another thing they could have focused on is the day and night spawning NPC's. Why is there the same amount of traffic and people in both day and night, this makes no sense to me, it is nothing game breaking, but a personal critique I guess. 

One last complaint regarding the progression in missions and the re-spawn points if you die during the mission. I don't remember in which missions exactly, but upon dying you are brought back almost in the very beginning of the mission. I believe that transferring you relatively close to where you died would be better and not being forced to replay almost the entire mission, just to die from one bullet in the head and reset it again...

I am not complaining that the game is hard or anything like that, this is just my experience with this game and some people may disagree with what I am commenting. I like the game overall and the challenges it sets, but having to replay missions because of issues in the game and all these bugs/glitches just totally drain the fun I was expecting to have while playing the game.

I'm sorry, but they should have done a better job with this remaster...",1665906440,1665906887,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

To add insult to injury, it is carrying more bugs than the original and is demanding a whole 50GB of your real estate (compared to ~8GB for the original).

I received this for free when it released because I already owned the original game. Which is ""fine"", but should also be telling [i]you[/i] something about the amount of differences there actually is to be found between the two products (and how much 2K is actually valuing this one). Visually speaking, there is barely any differences to really speak of between the two versions of the game. Yes, the characters faces and textures are slightly higher in definition, which can be nice in the cutscenes, but in no world nor reality does this justify for me the additional 42GB of storage space required and the bugs.

You should make up your own mind about it, and I am under no illusion that most people will not fall for the fallacy of ""Newer = better"" (that is to say, I do expect most people to fall for that fallacy), but perhaps try to keep in mind that [i]Mafia II[/i] is fine as is, and that not only is this ""Definitive Edition"" almost entirely redundant and unnecessary, it is also making for an overall worse player experience.

Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if someone were to tell me that the only reason this even exists is to forcibly expose players to the 2K Launcher everytime they try to start the game (so that 2K can nag you for your personal data and target you with advertising).",1662114634,1665221113,False,103,7,0.792891442775726318,0,True,True,False

‚úÖGame looks much better on 2K resolution
‚úÖVanilla version provided for those who buy Definitive Edition and Definitive Edition is given for free for those who own Mafia II (Classic) 

Cons:
‚ùåDraw distance sucks, some objects even shadows appear right in front of my eyes
‚ùåLots of bugs that were absent in vanilla version as if they worked so hard on importing every bugs from Mafia III
‚ùåRaincoat, jacket, hat issues
‚ùåToo much space required (6x more than original)

The game itself is decent - a linear experience that has some pretty solid writing and voice acting, and OK gameplay.

The driving is the worst in any game I've ever played. The combat leaves a lot to be desired. Realizing it's a game before the modern era of gaming, it is has frustrating checkpoints, sometimes being closely spaced and sometimes not happening until after several mission objectives have been reached.

The difficulty is purely based on the abysmal health system. 3-4 hits and you die. Health regenerates partially, but the only way to fully regenerate is to eat food, food which is not available in the middle of a mission. Similarly you will frequently die while driving, having a car turn into your path with no ability to dodge it. Then one accident and you're dead.

On top of all of this the story is more or less a simple rehash of the original. Be a guy, get noticed by the mob, join the mob. All the while, driving to an objective to A. Watch a Cutscene, B. Shoot a guy. C. Fight a guy. D. Walk to a thing and press X. Then you get in another car and drive to another thing. Once you've done that, you get to drive home and sleep to go to the next chapter.

That's the game. You can steal a dozen cars for a guy. You can rob some stores or buy some clothes. All that is for nothing though because about every 7 chapters the game deletes your money and your wardrobe so the game can continue making you go to work.

This is more subjective, but the world doesn't feel complete. It feels like the Joss Whedon Justice League, where everything was supposed to be dimly lit and atmospheric, but then it got the color saturation pushed to 11 and brightness pushed to 12. So the whole world feels like it was made for a different game.

I'm sorry I wasted so many hours on this, only to not complete it. The best part of the game are the pictures of Tits you find now and again, but I could just google those, and then google myself.",1663468037,1663987946,False,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

its technically more stable (it only crashed 1 time and it bluescreened my computer so that was very cool) but performance remains fairly bad, with the game struggling to run at certain sections, frames are never stable and often drop significantly at random, even in fairly unremarkable enviroments
the audio mixing in this game is also some of the worst i have ever heard in a game, i have never heard anything like it in a serious product

the story is a bit so and so, it has higher highs and lower lows compared to mafia 1.
its not so much that its particularly compeling, your guy waits all of 1 second before being alright with killing 100 guys for 50 dollars and doesnt actually seem to care a whole lot about what goes on around him, but the story at least tries to take him to varied places and ""do"" more

the gameplay is overall fairly bad
cars have somehow worse controls than the first game, with the wheels of every car having the grip of a bar of butter on a frying pan (something like the racing section from mafia 1 would had been literally unplayable in mafia 2), movement and cover is weirdly stiff compared to the previous game (but is offset by weapons being MUCH more accurate and lethal) and you spend an absolutely inhuman amount of time driving from place to place

driving in itself isnt so much the issue, its that it often feels meaningless and like some way to pad out the gameplay, as you'll often be asked to drive across town multiple times per mission for really trivial reasons, so you spend what feels (or might very well be) half the game just driving, usually in complete silence
another thing the game does is have a variety of what i assume are meant to be immersive actions as part of some missions, we're talking things like ""move this box extremely slowly to this place"" or ""walk to the box and grab the cigarettes to give to the guy very slowly"" and so on, which could just as easily had been relayed in the form of a small cutscene which it DOES DO sometimes. it feels really inconsistent and like the game doesnt really respect your time

its not that id want more combat and less driving/actions though, combat is fine? i guess? but with weapons being so accurate and lethal its really just a thing of sitting behind cover and burst firing your smg at enemy heads (which kills them instantly), its not particularly hard or engaging, at most you feel mildly frustrated or inconvenienced over having to redo a fairly long section against enemies that can kill you in as little as ¬Ω a second. i think one of the major issues is that you have so many weapons, you are never made to choose what weapons to bring or pick up, or be careful with how you spend ammo, you are never at a danger of running out of ammo, once enemies use smgs you never have a reason to use shotguns and pistols, and so on

the last gripe i have is that car customization and gun stores are pointless, just as pointless as money is
you'll rarely if ever be allowed to actually use your own car for things, and the game will super frequently take all your weapons away from you. as in, take them away and not give them back.
so you can go to the army surplus guy, buy an smg thats fairly rare, and then 30 minutes later the game just yeets it and insists you use the semi auto pistol. you may as well not even have had these things, but i do remember that the game came out in an era where a bunch of companies really wanted to have gta mechanics and features in their games so eh

dunno though, its a game that exists, play through it once and forget about it

Hardly any (but still some) crashes.

Great-ish story.
Decent music.
OK-sortof- driving around.

The game covers a wide span of years and implements decour/car changes as times go by.
This is *almost* really well done, but the city doesn't really change enough to feel like time has really passed.

Overall, the story here is good to decent with a few minor ""why the fuck?"" moments.
You know like that moment in a movie when the bad guy is in the crosshairs but the other character spares them and subsequently gets killed? Yea, this game has a few plot moments like that which signal that some Hollywood fuck has taken hold of the story.
Too bad too. The first one was so well made I had high hopes.

Overall, it's not a shit show like 3, so I still do reccomend it for a one time play through.

Overall, if you've played Mafia 1 (Classic or Definitive Edition), Mafia 2 maintains the vibes of its predecessor (content, action, etc.). If you want to continue the Mafia series, this version is worth purchasing. However, Mafia 2 DE appears to have more bugs than Mafia 1 DE in my experience.
Spoiler alert: [spoiler] Remembering the mission where I had to follow Luca to the hideout, that moron crashed into other people's cars without my interaction, and the game failed me because ""Luca didn't get there""? Or when I went to see the arsonists who set my house on fire and he crashed into two cop cars just to get out and collaborate with the other cops to shoot me down? I'm losing my mind with these cops, it doesn't even make sense. I didn't take a screenshot, but they're literally standing next to each other, guns drawn, pointing at me. [/spoiler]

BUT for the love of God, I would strongly recommend you to leave these 3 DLCs alone as you complete the main game, just don't even bother consider playing them and move on with Mafia 3 or something rather than wasting your life on these like me. First and foremost, Mafia 2 DE includes three DLCs (2 for baldie Jimmy and 1 for Joe). These arcade games have a timer and, in my opinion, the missions are patched together and repetitive, making them unworthy of playing. I'm not exaggerating, but stay away from them if you want to keep your sanity. The majority of my time in Joe's Adventure is spent doing repetitive arcade quests, driving around, and picking up floating icons just to drive to another location to do some boring stuff. The cops must be the most irritated, as they are both stupid and racist. Every mission, I had to change outfits, and it feels like they could hear your gunshot from 500 kilometers away and still recognize your appearance and car plate. Oh, and there are no checkpoints in each mission; if you fail at some points in one quest, you must restart from the beginning.
Spoiler alert, again: [spoiler] There is a mission in Joe's where you have to drive to ABC Hills (ABC = Something i cant remember) to steal a luxury limousine with 3 thus guarding it. Even if I wait for the cops' cars to drive away to began the shootout, they still can performed impossible things like issue a wanted posters and my car plates. How could I even complete this mission when they require me to keep the perfect condition yet the cops are like magicians appear from nowhere. Yes, I did double check if there are any blue-shirt morons wandering around both on mini map and outside. [/spoiler]

Overall, this game is worth playing if you are interested in the Mafia triology. Just dont bother with the DLCs. Hope these help. Ciao.",1662266628,1662266927,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

With a game as iconic as this for my childhood and with a story that is great (at least the first time, then it is kind of meh) there is no way I could forget it. I decided to replay this game because I recently just bought Mafia: Definitive Edition and I LOVED that game so much it made me want to go back and play/replay the series. The updated graphics at time look great but I am not really sure I can say I like them all that much, during cut-scenes especially it was really weird. Vito and Joe were updated with newer graphics but with some of the NPCs they would look like they did when the game first came out (It was really strange and pulled me out my immersion quite frequently). This edition also had some ""bugs"" like big ones, one time Vitos head practically was collapsed in on itself, another Joe was COMPLETELY invisible during a cut-scene even though it played out like normal, sometimes you could see through your player models (for sure if you wear Lincoln Clays combat fatigues, textures popping in and out, and sometimes doubling/overlapping dialogue. Although these bugs were annoying they didn't really ruin the whole game for me (maybe it is a nostalgia thing), so I still recommend it if you want a better graphical picture but recommend the Original one for less bugs but loss of graphics so it is kind of a trade off. Pick your poison I guess. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

TLDR:
The game is still as good as I remember, especially for the sale price it has right now, minus the graphical bugs (there were quite a few of them) introduced in Mafia II: Definitive Edition. I would still recommend the game if you are interested. Although these bugs were annoying they didn't really ruin the experience of the game for me (maybe it is a nostalgia thing), so I still recommend this one if you want a better graphical picture but recommend the Original one for less bugs but loss of graphics so it is kind of a trade off.

Half the time you'll be pissed off at a bug or getting pissed off that a guy you shot point blank with a shotgun didn't die. You're better off playing the 1st or 3rd if you want good gameplay. But I did like the story. If you liked the story of the first one then try it out, if you didn't you might as well skip to the third. The only reason I played was the story. Everything else about the game annoyed me, the combat is awful. You can't blindfire when in cover, so every combat encounter has you either waiting for an enemy to peak (Which they do very rarely) Or rushing them which results in a 50/50 chance of them dying with 1 shot or them taking 200 bullets like they're iron man. Also no grenade hotkey (Which isn't horrible lots of games don't have it) But it becomes such a pain in the ass to scrolls through 10 weapons just to throw a grenade. The driving is also a pain, which you do a lot (No one can drive themselves you have to drive and get shot at pray to the gods your AI buddy can fucking aim) Also you can't shoot while driving, which baffles me because you end up in car chases (Alone) while getting shot at! So you have you either hope they miss or dodge the fucking bullets. Cops are also so inconsistent they sometimes pull you over for going 41 miles an hour but will let you go while you're going 200 miles an hour. They are also just pains in the ass, which may be what they're supposed to be I just get annoyed with them easily. But what I think is one of the most annoying things is how many times this game just takes away all of your guns and money and never give them back. But then in the next level give you 20k. It's like this game couldn't pick a direction. Like if you wanna take all my shit then take it don't act like you took it then give it right back. Although you never get your weapons back which is bullshit (I bought a Kar then they took it in the next level lol) I think this game should only be played if you liked the story. No other reason the only reason why I'm giving this a positive review is because the ending was kinda good imo and wasn't very straight forward (also don't play the dlcs please fucking god don't)",1661957230,1661957291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its not the Skyrim Special Edition and not a GTA 5 next gen upgrade, its just a quick moneygrab for the devs to be able to excuse themselves into selling a 12 year old game at 30 dollar price point.

Same exact game as the original mafia 2, which is at the same time its strongest and weakest side. Some graphical bugs and a few graphical inconsistencies are present even on highest setting. The coat physix is literally so broken u can fix it by literally deleting the APEX physix engine folder. The game doesn't have any new outfits or guns or anything, not even the ability to take the hat off when wearing any suit or trench-coat, even-tho the no-hat look is already in the game files and is used in every cutscene.

They could have fixed the bugs in the original game, improved the graphics on a fundamental level, added more features and DLC and whatnot. But they didn't. Instead, they added more bugs, improved the textures a bit, ruined the cutscenes and maxed out the contrast slider. They didn't even bother to update the fonts to not look pixelated on modern resolutions.

So while the first game got an amazing overall haul with graphics, sounds and so on it feels like the biggest improvement on this game has probably been bigger resolution support(if that) and native 60+ fps but thats about it. On the other hand that came at a cost of a host of issues that from what I could read online was not present in the original game and that the studio that did the ""remake"" where unable to didn't bother to resolve.

Is it worth playing? Sure if you get it on a good sale. Probably not worth getting over the original if you already have that.

DLCs needs a section for themselves
There are 3 DLCs in total, the first 2 from a new character called Jimmy, both of them are free roam with basically no story/cutscenes, all its missions are time trials and a big score board and constant +100, +200 points all over the place. For fuck sake just let me try to enjoy the game play but nooooo. Also if you fail them you have to start over from the start of the mission every single f...ing time so I did not bother very much with these. The last DLC is from Joe's POV while Vito is in prison to fill in the gaps it starts of with some story elements but after 30 mins maybe you are thrown into the same free roam cr*p again and now have to do the sh!tty time trial missions with scores to be able to get story missions and in total there is maybe 1 hour of story missions, so its better than the first 2 DLCs but still utter trash and nothing compared to the main game itself.

Pro's
Its still Mafia 2, the story is decent enough to warrent playing through it.
60+ FPS support natively(it still starts out being set to 30 fps limit which makes you wonder what the hell they where thinking...)
No real improvements over the original apart from this.

Con's
All sorts of graphical issues, hairlines not fitting to the head, people looking at the wrong things when speaking, textures going haywiere.
Steam overlay lags and seems poorly made.

BUY ORIGINAL MAFIA 2 FIRST and you'll receive this game for free (because it doesn't deserve your money anyway)
I bought classical Mafia 2 and receive this ""deluxe"" edition. 
 
While the game looks nicer-ish than the original, cracks start to show early on. From the model re-works some charcters do look better, but it's weird seeing a high-poly newly modelled character interacting with a character model from the original 10 year old game. Some things look great yet some they had no updated and next to the new stuff it looks unfinished.

 Newspaper boys are removed, you no longer order food, both Vito and seller are silent, smoke glitches there are some visual glitches (hats do not show in cutscenes or it cuts inside Vito head), Joe Barbaro has some pathing, 3 times I've seen civilian drivers T-posing while they drove their cars etc

There are minor things one would forgive for an original release and expected a patch to fix it soon. This is a ""re-master"" an ""deluxe"" product. Some of there bugs were never seen in the original. I haven't seen them back in 2014 and I haven't seen it last month when I replayed the original Mafia 2.

Mafia II?  It‚Äôs a name you‚Äôve not heard in some time, maybe too long to be safe.  How was it?  Well, It‚Äôs certainly not the life for everyone.  As it should be.  If everyone had the stomach to do what you did society would fall apart at the seams.  Maybe it already had.

You swirl the glass of brandy in your hand.  Its soft brown features glisten off the dimmed desk light, waiting to reach your lips.  But it feels heavy in your hand, so far out of reach, the endeavor of drinking it seems to be more effort than it's worth.  Your sins weighed too heavily on the drink.  Frankly, you couldn‚Äôt blame it.

It was all hubris in the end.  The shining city was alluring to all who entered, who wouldn‚Äôt want to take it for themselves?  The streets are alight with neon signs, each corner is carefully crafted after the rockin‚Äô punk of the 1950s.  A new age with new ideals.  The fidelity and detail was breathtaking.  A diner at every corner and a crooked cop at every other.  Whether they pulled you over for a ticket was a fickle thing.  But it‚Äôs the only time you ever stopped to appreciate the world around you.  You were always in such a rush running around the city it became mundane, flashing past you like a moving picture you were only half paying attention to.

The cars were beautiful, the women even more so.  The fancy clothes, the guns, the respect, for a time it was all yours.  You can see moments, flashes of the good times.  When you had everything and you felt unstoppable.  But those times were always fleeting, always destined to be faint memories lost in the dredged mud of regret.  Cause at the end of the day it's not the good times that stick with you.  It‚Äôs not the drunken sex parties that keep you up at night.

Your drowsy eyes linger on a glimmer in the corner of your shabby apartment to the only clean thing there.  An old nightstand with a Colt .45, fully loaded with the safety off.  It always sits by your bed, always, just in case.  In case it's your door they come bursting through this time or if it's all just‚Ä¶

You shake the thoughts away.  Taking another drag of your cigarette.  Smoke permeates the room again giving the whole room a gray, misty atmosphere.  It smells terrible but it's comforting in a way.

But your eyes don‚Äôt leave the gun.  You don‚Äôt clean it the way you do cause‚Äô of the dust and grime.

It‚Äôs so vivid, as clear of a picture as you could print.  You can see the three pinned site in front of you, you see the burst of flame and the shocked look on the boy's face.  Christ he couldn‚Äôt have been over 18.  There were waves of them.  Nameless people one after the other gunned down by your hand.  Sometimes it felt like a shooting gallery, like one arena after the other.

But with your arsenal it never posed much of a problem.  From pocket pistols to submachine guns you‚Äôve used it all.  Even MGs at some points, shredding through people.  After which you‚Äôd stop off at home, wash the blood off your suit and be off again to the bars and shops.

But maybe you could live with that, they chose that life same as you.  You see them every once in a while.  In the reflection of windows and at the corner of your darkened room but they don‚Äôt haunt you.  Not like your friends do.

You can‚Äôt quite imagine them now.  It‚Äôs still there but their faces are foggy and hard to make out.  Sometimes you almost see their smile.  On the grassy plains of central park drunk off a bottle of champagne, but still it's hard to make out.  It‚Äôs like an echo, coming back distorted and broken from the mountain tops.  There‚Äôs only one clear image you have left of him, one seared into your mind forever.  His broken and contorted body lying motionless on the ground.

You see his face.  Emotionless, eyes clouded over, staring at nothing.  You have a hundred memories of the two of you and only one keeps you up at night.

A far off siren blares through the night air, no other sound permeates the air until you put your burnt cigarette out on a nearby ashtray with its brothers, producing a soft hiss.  You slam your drink and stagger over to your bed, sitting down on it.  The rest is short lived as a knock wakes you from your thoughts.

[i] Brap Brap Brap! [/i]

The wooden door echoes and goes silent.  No one calls to you from outside and you don‚Äôt call back.  You casually grab your pistol by the nightstand, in no real hurry, and bring its sights to rest on the door.  You stagger a moment, the bourbon fogs your vision for a second and you threaten to topple over.  But you rally and hold yourself up.

Your focus should be trained on the door but your eyes can‚Äôt help but wander back to your nightstand, back to a singular framed picture.  It's a picture of you and‚Ä¶  Him.  You're both smiling and waving, standing in front of a car, it‚Äôs red with a white stripe down the middle.

For a moment you forget about the constant dread and fear.  You're back there in the car park and you're happy.  Not for the car, or the money or even the fame.  You‚Äôre just happy to be there, with them.  As much as you try to hold onto it it starts to fade away like a pleasant dream in the darkness.  

You hear someone whisper to another behind the door and the unmistakable click of bolt falling in place.  It seems like things are coming to an end for you.

And maybe‚Ä¶  Maybe that‚Äôs not such a bad thing‚Ä¶

I've been a fan of the series forever and with II being my introduction, it's also my favourite. Which is why it's a shame that the ""Definitive"" Edition is a tad underwhelming. It's not all bad, some extra cars & suits are neat and I don't have any complaints about the sound changes but when the file-size is almost a whole gigabyte bigger than the remake of the first game, it [i]does[/i] raise some eyebrows as it's hard to see how that 25GB or so of assets are utilised. 

Granted that the textures and models look notably better, but corners have been cut quite a bit and some of the post FX choices are questionable. One thing you'll notice almost right away is that just about every light source is significantly brighter and it's not uncommon for sidewalks to be glowing on a sunny day. It's a shame to see them pull a Rockstar and have a smaller dev team ""remaster"" one of their older titles but at the very least, it's still playable and isn't [i]too[/i] unpleasant to look at.

In about 90% of the campaign nothing actually happens you're just kinda running around and that's about it making money waiting for the ten years later screen so you get on with the same shit you just did in the chapter before. the side activities are shit you can rob a store instantly put your gun away and walk out and the cops literally act like hellen keller and have no idea it was you and the cops are so retarded in police chases I swear you could outrun them in a fucking tractor all you have to do is hold w they do the rest they'll either slam into a fucking wall or just randomly get so much slower than you verne from over the hedge could outpace them. not to mention the constant fucking stuttering you have to go through and as soon as the frostbite level destruction physics kick in and some dust comes off a wall or some wood falls down you go to 20fps for the next 20 minutes until you're over the boring fucking shooting gallery. oh did i mention this game is a fucking remaster yet it looks like someone got playdough and stepped on it multiple times curb stomped and shit on it i watched this shit side by side with the original and the only thing i could tell that was different was the fact game constantly goes to fucking 3 fps half the characters faces wasn't even upgraded they just looked like blurry messes they almost just went fuck it they 3 lines in the whole and didn't bother. anyway this game is boring as shit and i completed in one sitting at twitch.tv/seamanontop :)",1657675642,1657675642,False,2,1,0.484919130802154541,0,True,False,False

- good soundtrack
- good length of game (not too short but not too long)

- the tommy angelo bit and suit was a nice touch
- vito is sexy

- bugs - i personally didn't experience any bugs until the last 2 chapters where i got some audio and visual bugs but didn't impact on me playing the game

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2363382893 [b]NOTE: I have not played the classic version and this was my first playthrough of Mafia II.[/b]

[h2]Story[/h2]
Takes place in 1945 where protagonist Vito Scaletta returns home after serving US Army to avoid prison time for a committed robbery. With the help of his partner in crime Joe Barbaro Vito tries clearing the debt tolled upon his family of a mother & a sister by his late father from a loan shark. He then begins to make gain contacts & perform jobs that leads to his involvement in mafia. There are many interesting characters you will meet & work with for the length of its gripping story. I loved every bit of it & Vito Scaletta is a name I'll never forget. 

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Majority of gameplay consists of you going from point A to B and sometimes C.  This gets repetitive very quickly & sucks the strength of it's ongoing storyline. Hence driving obviously fills up majority of my play time. Driving feels decent. You can customise your car with a few options in areas of paint, body & wheels then store 'em in your garage. 

Fueling / Cleaning / Repairing cars,  buying clothes from various stores around the map, consuming food from the fridge at home & buying weapons remind you that this is an open world game. All these activities are totally optional & you can finish the game without ever knowing any of these. Some achievements are tied to specific activities which apparently is needed to be done before the accepting the final mission because you cannot roam freely after the credits roll without starting a new game.

The world is beautiful, there is a part in campaign when [spoiler]we transition to a few years later scenario where the world is changed on a large scale.[/spoiler] This moment felt very fresh & appreciative when I experienced it for the first time.

[h2]DLCs[/h2]
They do offer interesting stories & cutscenes featuring characters from the campaign but at the the cost of doing repetitive strips of generic mission more than once which is boring as hell. Just finishing a DLC mission alone is a rare achievement because it requires so much will power to go through all three of them. 

[h2]Opinion[/h2]
It looks amazing, especially with ReShade. I found no bugs, no issues with anything & it was a smooth experience till the end. Thought it is a definitive edition I would've loved some extra features addressing issues mentioned above like a fast travel option or the ability to roam freely after the final mission but I guess that's not how mafia works.

I disagree with the reviews presented here, this edition works great but If you're convinced by others, try the classic version because this is a legendary game afterall, definitive or not.

After beating the Definitive Edition twice (one in hard difficulty) I came to realise that this game could've been a way better remaster in literally all terms. Now I'm going to cut to the chase and tell all the deficiencies. 

First I gotta mention all the bugs and lags I've encountered (which there wasn't any in the OG version whatsoever). And then there's the game size that I've found it quite excessive, this game has no right to be 44 GB. Also I was really hoping they'd bring the deleted content from the OG version, you can check em out more on YT.

Overall, this is not a decent remaster. It's really a bummer that you can't buy the OG version standalone. But I feel like I don't even need to tell how great the story develops.

When playing this game, though, oh man, I fell in love.  Gameplay was good, gunplay was great, story was great, but the overall atmosphere of the game is what had me addicted. I spent a lot of time driving around and admiring the world, admiring the cars, etc.  Mafia 2 really opened my eyes to the glory of the 40s and 50s car wise.  There were so many I really loved.

One small detail that I really loved was if you had a passenger in your car and ran a red light, your passenger would call you out on it.

I really loved all the radio stations and the on air djs.  It was very relaxing and entertaining not only to hear old songs, but to hear the djs talking about world events.

I really appreciate the devs giving us a junkyard and letting us take cars there for money.  I was doing that for hours just to extend my time in the game because I didn't want to quit.

One gripe I had was with the police. Holy crap were they overly aggressive when in a pursuit!  Was a bit much at times.

The saving system in this game was really confusing and weird.  It never explicitly said ""sleep in a bed to save"", but it also didn't say if there was auto save.  Closing the game was like gambling, you never knew if you'd be at the spot you left off at or an earlier point.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game.  There were a lot of small details and quality of life things that GTA would never, ever have.  Also surprised about the playboy mags actually showing naked chicks. LOL",1656928448,1656928448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly it felt great to return to this game, the cut-scenes are very nice except one where one of the characters keeps looking at a completely wrong direction rather then at the character that he is talking with. It was very fun to play as Vito again and the story of this game will be probably the best one out of all honestly. 

Some of the bugs that I noticed were the already mentioned wrong eye placement in one cut-scene (Leo Galante's eyes) and also in a couple of mission where there is a lot of action and shooting, my fps just drops down to 40, but most of the time my fps was great, those were the things that annoyed me a lot.

As for the overall review I was even thinking about not recommending it, but since the best thing that this can offer is if you buy it, you get the Classic one for free, I just had to recommend it. Also, if you hate the 2K launcher or this game has some game-braking things, then just download the classic one and you're all set. Also GET IT ON A SALE, IT'S 100% NOT WORTH 30 EUROS.

If I don‚Äôt recover blood, then it is very likely that a certain task will fail, and the automatic blood recovery of the second generation can enable me to successfully clear the level and complete the task, which also brings me a good feeling in the game experience.

For all intents and purposes, I will not be reviewing Mafia 2, rather, it's Definitive Edition release.

The impact of Mafia 2 is not often mentioned in games today; simply because triple-A titles today do not respect much of the ideals that Mafia 2 was developed under, as they have no such need for depth today. in a few years from now, we will come to appreciate gems like Mafia 2 as they may not exist by then.

That is why we need the Definitive Edition Remaster. There are sacrifices - such as the weird color correction choices, more reminiscent of Fallout 3 SweetFX mods from 2010. However, 10 years after it's release, it is a good thing to see a title still recognized and updated by it's publisher. Most companies would want to snuff this game out of public eye, especially around the time of a new release, as to ensure sales on their new title.

It had a rough launch, sure sure, but all glitches except 2 funny and minor ones were all fixed. All gameplay bugs were fixed, nothing's going to stop you from progressing the story, nothing - just two genuinely funny looking glitches, both of which probably won't even happen on your playthrough. 

This isn't meant to be a remake, it's meant to be a graphical overhaul of the original game to make it look beautiful - and it greatly succeeds at doing that (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE (1) NPC THAT LOOKS LIKE COMPLETE TRASH COMPARED TO THE OG). 

This definitive edition was given completely for free to all people who owned the original so I don't get why a free game is being sh*t on so harshly.

The visuals are great and match the theme of the game with the dark grittiness of the mob mixed with the gritty of the 40's in the early game and the brighter parts in the 50's with cars having pastel colors. The sound can be troublesome at times with what seems to be echo or delay in foot steps especially when inside buildings or on quiet areas. The gun play could be a bit better but considering this is a remake i wouldn't knock it. My main gripe is that for a remake while it stays true to the original game (don't get me wrong that's a good thing) I hate that it has the 2k account integration every time you open the game to the title screen. I also wish that when remaking this they'd included an option for first person view since that's better than the over the hood view when driving and would make an already detail filled game even better.

Game looks fantastic.
Good Driving mechanics.
Runs good (as long as you don't max out the GPU physics.)

CON's;
Story is not very interesting (especially the ending).
Gun play is awful.
Missions are always placed super far away.
Missions follow the same cliche theme; Drive to the other end of the map, Kill someone and their goons, The end.
Audio glitches characters talking over each other. 
Graphical glitches (mouth not moving when talking in cut scenes, Hat glitches through head,
game play glitches (Objective ""crash on the couch at Joe's"" remained active thought the entire game which messed with the GPS system) 

Conclusion 4/10
Would definitely not recommend to anyone looking for an interesting story about the mafia. If you are into driving to the lackluster missions for more than 50% of the time then you'll love it. Mafia 1 is by far a much better experience

Vito Scaletta is an immensely likable guy and a great protagonist.  Empire Bay is beautifully rendered though honestly I wish it was a little bigger.  The DLCs are great add-ons and way better than the ‚Äúfreeride‚Äù in Mafia, though honestly, The Adventures of Joe is more enjoyable than Jimmy‚Äôs two DLCs.  Probably because again, Joe is a likable guy, loyal to his buddy Vito, and smart in his own way.  Jimmy however, is mostly an enigma.  He doesn‚Äôt appear in the main game, and has no interaction with Joe either.  He is also much less likable, and I don‚Äôt really care if he lives or dies. Joe and Vito, I cared about.

One of the best things about the game is all the cars you can drive around.  Though Hanger 13 gave them fake names, they‚Äôre almost all based on real cars and a little bit of research will reveal that they did an exceptionally good job pulling them all together and rendering them pretty accurately, considering.  The Body Shops that are available and the opportunity they give you to upgrade your car is super cool.  This has to be one of my favorite parts of the game.

There are a large amount of weapons available and you can carry one of each type. Hanger 13 was also mostly authentic with the weapons basing them on real weapons and keeping the names relatively close the real thing, for example, the 1911 pistol, from Colt, is described by Joe in one cutscene as a 1911 ‚ÄúCole.‚Äù Still, I appreciate that they stayed mostly true to the real weapons with a few minor errors such as the 1911 firing with the hammer forward instead of the hammer back and the same with the M1A1 firing from the closed bolt (bolt handle forward) vs the open bolt (bolt handle to the rear).

I hate that you can‚Äôt save the game when you want to save the game.  It automatically saves at specific points and always during ‚Äúchapters‚Äù of the story.  So if you go out trying to build up your garage of cars, using the money in your bank account before it disappears (because you will lose it all in a specific chapter), you had better finish that chapter so it saves.  I once went around grabbing cars, painting them and stashing them in my garage, only to get killed and lose all the cars I had paid for.  It does not save when you park a car in a garage.  And since the game is so linear (not as bad as the first Mafia) it is a trick to find the time to get some cool cars in your garage.  Plus, it never really explains any of the side missions.  You have to figure that out on your own or research it on the internet. Seriously, there are about seven cars I stole, upgraded, painted, and parked in my garage that I lost because I didn‚Äôt hit a specific checkpoint save before I got killed. That‚Äôs usually when I quit for that session. Very frustrating.  But I learned my lesson and now only get cars when I complete a mission and before I go home to end it.  Though, this is much easier to deal with in the DLCs.

One thing I really wish they had is user accessible folder where I could drop in MP3s of my favorite songs from that era that would automatically play on the radio along with all the songs they already have.  Hanger 13 always selects an excellent variety of music but that variety is limited enough that you will hear the same song within an hour.

Minor things that bugged me in the beginning is Vito getting off the train carrying a suitcase.  Soldiers, like him, whether on leave or discharged, would be carrying a large dufflebag of the their personal gear.  That was the suitcase for anyone in the military (Marines and Sailors would call theirs a ‚Äòseabag‚Äô).  Also, the jump wing on his uniform are way too big.  His unit, the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) is a real unit that was one of the regiments of the famous 101st Airborne Division (represented by the ‚Äúscreaming eagle‚Äù patch on each shoulder).  This is the exact same regiment of Easy Company of the famous ‚ÄúBand of Brothers‚Äù book and miniseries.  The only problem here was that the 506th first saw action in Normandy, not Italy.  Ideally, they should have made him a member of one of the PIRs from the 82nd Airborne.  Those guys did see action in Italy.  Should‚Äôve made him a paratrooper in the 505th PIR!  Those guys were the only ones that got 4 combat jumps in WWII.

So my complaints are minor and I very much recommend this game.",1648596865,1652120810,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

RANT TIME!!!
I played Mafia 1 back in 2002 when it came out. I didn't know what to expect and other than the racing part, I loved the game! Back then I skipped this one, since when you can only afford one or two games a year, stuff gets sorted away. I later read about Mafia 3 in a gaming magazine. I was curious about a Mafia game where you played as a black character mixed with the carpo system, but I never got to play it, since the release date was about a year away or so when I read about it. And time flies.

""What the heck are you going on about?!! How is this relevant for Mafia 2???"" you might scream in a rage fit about now, and I'm sorry for the exposition. Here is my point. I saw Mafia 3 was on here on sale and got the full package since, why not?

I then played Mafia 3 first, since that was the game I was curious about. The gameplay got a bit boring with 3 around the end but the story! OMG, that story!! Mafia 3 is the perfect revenge story in the universe of Mafia set around the Vietnam War. The controls are the same as in Mafia 1 (except for the speed control since at that age apparently speeding is not a big deal)

Then I played Mafia 1, to see if I remember what the fuss was all about back in the day. And once again the story is just amazing! You get to love and feel every emotion of the characters in your path, and everyone feels alive! The Racing still sucks, which was about the only thing I remembered outside the ending, so I had really high hopes for Mafia 2.

Mafia 2's turn then came and the first thing you get introduced to is a new fresh interface and control system that sucks all the ass that it can suck. It's clunky and slow, and I can't count how many times I died when I tried to equip a weapon. 

Then we have the story... yeah I see people who are praising the story and I have no idea what they are talking about. There is NO character growth. I had no shits to give anybody in this game, and it kinda seems like the game felt the same way. Even Vito's family didn't give me any emotional reaction, because they are just there once in a while.

Spoiler rant
[spoiler]I was really slow when it came to Vito. I didn't connect him to Mafia 3 and I didn't register that he and Joe are the ones who kill Tommy at the end of Mafia 1. The worst part was when the killing Tommy mission came my reaction was, ""Arh, okay!"". That's how much I cared about these two goons. Kinda sad to be honest. Then I had to check if Vito was the Vito from Mafia 3, and he was. So now I was waiting to see how his story would fit in with his M3 story, but naw, but a blank boring ending.[/spoiler] Vito is the Connor (Assassin's Creed 3) of the Mafia series. Boring. Of no importance. Just... meh!

If the price of buying Mafia 1 and 3 are lower than buying the whole Definitive Edition, then just do that and skip this one. It really does not add anything of value, as seen in M3 where they even used the interface from Mafia 1 back.",1652110061,1652110061,False,0,1,0.433965831995010376,0,True,False,False

The game has an amazing story (excluding the end). Mission writing is equally good to the first mafia game. Gun-play is equally good, while the world's atmosphere albait a little stale, feels nice. 

The problem with this game, is it's gameplay. The way the story is laid out, makes you feel more like a taxi driver rather than mafia guy. From the 15-20 hours you are gonna need to finish the game, more than half of them you will spend them inside a car of yours, going from point A to point B. At this point, I think i can go to Joe's place with my eyes closed, from any point of the map. The game unfortunately doesn't offer a ""teleport"" option (like in Mafia I) either, in order to skip a few known and boring rides.

And if that wasn't enough, the game has awful checkpoints as well. The developers have put very few checkpoints during missions, which is not necessarily bad, but they have put those few checkpoints at very awkward places as well. Meaning that if you die, you might need to re-drive back to the mission's location, re-watch (thankfully skippable) cut-scenes, and sit back during scripted portions of the missions. In general if you die during a heated mission, you usually have to waste a few minutes to go back to where you were.

Additionally, I would like to talk about the game's ""remastered"" aspects. The game has a bunch of glitches, some of them that seem to have been transfered straight from Mafia II classic as well. Additionally, character graphic glitches are prevalent from time to time as well, breaking any immersion that you might had at the moment. In general, it's not a good ""remastered"" game. The developers treated this remaster as a cash-grab, since they just did a reshade, repacked the game with zero changes, and shipped it back as something new, which is totally a fucking lie.

Finally, what the hell did they do to my boy [spoiler]Joe[/spoiler]? The ending was pretty bad and inconclusive, leaving you with a cliff hanger, which is implied, but never going to be clearly laid out. Everybody can think for themselves what's gonna happen to both  [spoiler]Joe[/spoiler] and  [spoiler]Vito[/spoiler]. It's a linear game, therefore I would have liked a linear and straightforward ending as well.

To conclude, playing this game is not going to be a very happy journey. Especially after the second half of the game, in which you are going to start getting frustrated more and more with some of the stupid game mechanics. Nevertheless, if you really really want some mafia dose in your system, make sure you have played Mafia I first, and then buy this (ON A SALE) as well.",1651498279,1651498476,False,5,0,0.519024550914764404,0,True,False,False

It was nice to have richer gun sounds and a sharper resolution, but whatever they did to the character models has utterly ruined the storytelling; all the subtle eye movements, facial expressions and emotions conveyed that made the game as good as it was are completely absent from this version. For some reason they also seemed to think that giving the two main characters blue eyes (previously brown) was needed? All of this not mentioning the frequent game crashing which was virtually nonexistent beforehand.

The performance is extremely low at times. One mission where you shot up a place (the same mission of the first screenshots of the game on the store page) went to 15 FPS. Others have been to 30 - 45 fps.. This is on a 3070Ti with a i7 8700k, it just tells you how horrible optimised this game is. It's also strange how some missions can be very low performance and then when you die it all of a sudden  goes up to your expected performance.. 

The story is fine. The sad part is that i tried to play the original version of the game but because my mouse for some reason did not work i ended up playing version this version.

Now this is not the first time i play this version of the game. I wanted to complete it once and for all but last time I played there was this bug that made it so i could not enter a door.. I found out later that there was something that broke the save files just there and you had to do EVERYTHING again if you wanted to play it trough. That says something about this game and the fact that It's a bug from the original game that never was fixed and they did not fix this time either. 

Would i recommend this game? Hell no. If It's not at 5 euros or lower i would never recommend it. 
The story is fine but when there is so much problems with this version you better play the original but then again there is problems with that version as well.. I was not able to use my mouse as i wrote above. 

For your own sake: go and play Mafia: Definitive edition that's a good remake of the original game. If you want to play this game then be aware of the issues!

If you end up buying this hot garbage here is some solutions to some of the issues you might face:

You can skip the launcher by using the following command in the properties in Steam: 
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mafia II Definitive Edition\pc\Mafia II Definitive Edition.exe"" %command%

Check PC Gaming Wiki for more. There is some issues you cannot fix like the performance issues at least that i know of.

First of all with the definite edition you get all the useless 2K stuff, a useless launcher, useless advertisment for Mafia 3 and you are asked everytime if you'd please accept their online stuff or whatever useless thing that was.

That said the game also felt meh. I liked it till the mid, then it went way out of hand. Mainly because the story felt just a bit overdone but also because they started simply throwing lots of enemys at you.

+/- Light remaster. This is not a complete remaster. Its only upgraded textures and additional post processing. Sometimes certain PP effects don't work well.
+/- Semi open world. There is no free roam at all. Any time you are alone without a timed objective you are free to explore the city. There isn't much to do besides grab collectables. Much like the Mafia 1 it just facilitates the story.

+ Great story with memorable characters.
+ Voice Acting is very good.
+ Immersive world design
+ Vehicles are well designed unlicensed recreations.
+ Driving physics are interesting on simulation. Attention to detail with effective transmission modelling and tire compression under these heavy vehicles using old tire technology. Descent damage modelling.
+ Combat is well made with focus on realism. All weapons are one shots to the head. Just consider magazine size and dispersion for the best results. Hand to hand combat is okay. It takes a little getting used to. Particularly on hard difficulty.
+ Music selection is descent and adds to immersion.
+ GPU accelerated physics/PHYSX. Works wonders for this game(and most other games its implemented in). A surprising amount of deformation and particles breaking off of objects makes environments more believable and interesting.
+ Collectables. For once they are contextual and relate to the games world rather than being random meaningless objects(granted they still don't actually do anything). Real images from early playboys and wanted posters are the exploration collectables. The others are progress based.

- Post Processing. Some of the new effects don't work correctly. Such as blinding lens flares/bloom in certain lighting scenarios.
- Particles. Some physics particles accumulate without being deleted until going out of range causing massive lag spikes in a few specific scenarios.",1648608245,1648825283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u]What I liked about the game[/u]
[list]
[*]	I liked the cover system. It made the combat so much easier, especially compared to the first game. 

[*]	I liked the new things they added into the game, like cloths shops and being able to customize the players car. I always liked the little things they added like refueling your car, getting your shoes shined, or being pulled over by the police. 

[*]	Loads of collecterables, like Play-boy magazines and wanted posters. As you progress through the game you will also unlock artwork. 

[*]	Vehicles handle better this time round. They are still sometimes tricky to handle; which is to be expected from vehicles of that era, but they aren‚Äôt as bad as the first game. 

[*]	The voice-acting and cut-scenes are stellar. The game had some really likeable characters like Joe and Leo. 

[*]	A good selection of weapons from that era. 

[*]	Interesting story. The story is similar to the first game; basically you start of as an associate, then you become a made-man and then you fuck it up.  I also really liked the WW2 section. 

[*]	The hand-to-hand combat is very fun and enjoyable. 

[*]	I thought the stealth sections were pretty good. You are able to dispatch enemies quietly.

[*]	I like the amount of destruction you can cause in each level.  

[*]	Good soundtrack. 

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]

[*]	I remember in the first game that once you completed the game you unlocked free-roam extreme were you could complete challenges to unlock unique vehicles. There is  no free-roam mode or extreme . 

[*]	There‚Äôs no countryside to explore, like in the first game. 

[*]	 I wish there was a larger variety of shops and gimmicky stuff.  Overall I felt the game needed more content. 

[*]	Shame you couldn‚Äôt fire weapons while driving. 

[*]	No melee weapons. 

[*]	The game is too short. 
[/list]
[u]Conclusion[/u]

Overall I enjoyed Mafia 2. They have made a lot of improvements compared to the first game, like a cover-system, good hand-to-hand combat, and improved vehicle handling. The game has a nice selection of fire-arms from the period. The game has likeable characters, Like Joe. The game isn‚Äôt as generous with content as the first game, For example no free-roam or free-roam extreme , and I wish they added a country-side to the map . If you enjoyed the first game then I highly recommend you buy this game.

Other than that, this game is amazing. The story was captivating, and kept me on my feet. The world felt good, with you second guessing breaking into cars with cops coming around the corner, on patrol, and the characters were so good. I will remember Joe Barbaro for a very long time. Grab this one when you can. 30 dollars is a big asking price, and I got it on sale, but I'd say it's worth it either way.

It's a great game story wise, the graphics and sound are pretty decent, overall the game play is mostly great, just occasional clunky stuff you expect from games from the generation this originally came from.
The big draw back to this game is simply the bugs, they're super common and completely ruin what could be on of the greatest games. You can't go 10mins without seeing minor graphical bugs, half the cut scenes just sometimes don't play any sound at all, randomly my characters head shrinks right down where there should be a hat, but instead i get a mini head.... Tbh it's mostly amusing because i know the story inside out, but to anyone knew experiencing the game, it'd be awful. Thankfully i've not had any hard crashes or anything, it's just minor weird stuff tbh.
I'd recommend this game for anyone that has played the original, or someone that really (and i mean really) enjoyed the first mafia definitive edition and wants to experience more of what is a great story (although you might have to keep replying a mission for the sound to work etc to experience it), it's a headache because of the bugs, but i'd still recommend it to them certain people. Everyone else should give it a hard pass.

6/10 overall because of the bugs, if it wasn't for them it'd be a 9/10. What a shame.

I'd recommend waiting for a sale or buying it cheap if you can, to avoid buyers regret.

Edit, i've managed to fix a handful of the bugs by using headphones which solved most of the audio related bugs, none the less, it shouldn't need headphones to play the game. All the visual bugs are still there but thankfully they don't effect the actual game other than being funny then they do happen. I'll bump it up to 7/10 because it seems like you can work around the bugs with trial and error.",1646862192,1646921041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Judging from reviews and just people talking about it, seems like very little was done on this one compared to the original mafia and its definitive edition. Thats not something i can comment to much on though.
The game is decent, the beginning is very good and the snowy Christmas atmosphere does set a nice tone throughout the early gameplay. Eventually though i did feel like the story gets a bit disjointed. There are many names thrown around and it gets tough to keep up with who everyone is. Furthermore there are a fair few events that could have easily been cut because they do next to nothing for the overall cohesion of the story and actually just end up feeling like filler.

SPOILER AHEAD!
If you are someone who played the original Mafia and eagerly wanted to know more of how Vito and Joe end up being the ones to take Tommy out you will be disappointed, the whole thing is glossed over very quickly and felt like an afterthought. It isnt really part of this games story but they needed to include it since Vito is the player character.

The performance is a bit wonky, some say its the GPU Phyx not working properly causing huge fps drops but im not sure. The optimization is definitely questionable.

Some would call Mafia II: Definitive edition a hot mess, or that It needed a lot more content and graphics upgrades to be considered ""Definitive"". I've looked at over 100 reviews of this remastered game, 98% of which are completely wrong and unfair. Half the people never gave it a chance and never looked into the smaller details or took notice of anything. The other half are bagging on it because others are too, to the point where people are making up lies to make the game seem worse. This is my complete ""REAL"" review of Mafia II: Definitive Edition. (Note: I won't be covering the story, I'll only be covering the improvements and changes that make this version better than the original).

- Quality Improvements
People argue that the definitive edition looks worse then the original, mind you the original was made in 2010. If anything the definitive edition is 10 times better, adding on 34 extra gigabytes worth of upgraded content compared to the original 8 gigabytes in the original. The game improved hair. Characters now have individual strands of hair instead of the blocky textured hairpieces from 2010. And the game is now rendered into a 4K resolution with massive texture upgrades and improvements such as walls and floors. Faces now have dimples, holes, scares and wrinkles that make the characters more realistic. Throughout the Definitive Edition game-play I only encountered 1 bug in an entire 11.7 hours of game-play, which involved a 1 seconds clip of a face being stretched.

- Gameplay 
(Nothing has changed in the gameplay, I'll just mention some great features and a few flaws that were carried from the original)
Mafia II has decently realistic vehicle mechanics. It's the small details that count, such as the tires bouncing and going flat when going up and down hills and bumps. The gun-play is also very smooth, fairly easy when in gun fights, nothing really presents a challenge. The Fighting mechanisms are absolutely amazing and smooth, with various different fighting techniques, Styles, strengths and finishing moves depending on the objects closest to you. The cars are accurate for the times, but unfortunately the world doesn't feel as lively as it should be. 

- Conclusion
I 100% recommend this game to anyone who's looking to spend 12 hours immersing yourself in a decently mature story from the time your wake up to when you go to sleep, then this is the perfect game for you.
Weather you prefer to play the 2010 original or the Definitive edition it really doesn't matter. You get both when buying the Definitive edition anyway.

TL;DR: The upgrades the game got were decent enough to be considered definitive, I'll give the game an 8/10.",1637418119,1645437505,True,48,2,0.755152225494384766,0,True,False,False

He was supposed to come back fighting after healing, but Joe Barbaro, his friend, will help him to stay in America. 

A game extremely worth to play, a game that will show us how is the life being part of Mafia.

The game is too easy. Hard mode recommended (still easy).
Game environment is very bad. Cops and people are dumb and passive. Only take you 20 seconds to escape the police. Nothing happen when you hit the car or when you do something abnormal, there is no dialogue and people do nothing.
Music 4/10
I still hear some soundtracks from the classic version of Mafia 1. It's cool because it makes you feel the vibe of the old Mafia.
Main story is lame and seperate.

There are way more bugs unlike there were in the original mafia II, the story is still the same nothing has been added or removed. 

There are graphical enchancements, but I don't really think they are done well good enough either, for example Joe's face is enchanced, but his neck looks like somebody skinned him by the neck. Also eye movements are fkd up, in cutscenes some character's eyes are looking to two different locations as same as me looking two different sides in Counter Strike Global Offensive. 

There are visual and audio bugs like I said up above, smoke animations on streets are all bugged, so once u see smoke coming out of sewers it keeps repeating itself in each 4-5 seconds and ruins the atmosphere. 

However if you want to play the game for the first time, this game has one of the perfect stories u can ever find, there is no openworld in this game, but you are free to travel the entire map as u want and collect collectables such as playboy magazines, wanted posters etc.

Just one thing 2K, u people really screwed this game up since it's release, cut content and all. YET ITS NOT ENOUGH AND U GUYS SELL A UNFINISHED REMASTER...

It started out alright but the further I played, the more issues showed up. 

To start theres some positives.
The new graphics are for the most part nice. Especially if you have a 4k display. Mouse and keyboard controls aren't bad. The main story is still one of the best. It comes with all dlcs, and gives you the original version of the game with its dlcs. You get new outfits and vehicles for having Mafia 1 and 3 DE and for linking a 2k account. The playboy magazines are in tact. 

So whats wrong with the definitive? Well for starters physx is gone unless you delete a file, and even then it only works for your character. Your hat can glitch into your face in certain cutscenes. Characters eyes can be stuck in a certain spot. And dialogue in one of the last chapters play all at once over each other. Every time you go into Joe's apartment complex the cops describe what you look like, acting like they're trying to find you. Some cutscenes have people talking but their lips aren't moving. Major fps drops in shootout areas. Distance pop in is way too close. Objects on the ground kept flickering unless I messed with the anti aliasing settings. Smoke effects run at like 2fps. Seeing a pop up notification saying I've lost connection to the 2k servers got annoying. You're required to have the game run alongside a horrible 2k launcher that's also a resource hog. (You can play without this launcher by launching from the games executable file instead of directly on steam.)

All in all you're better off playing the original version with some mods if you want better visuals. I thought maybe this was a bad remaster because 2k rushed its development, but, given D3Ts previous and new lazy remaster work, I think its a rush job by both studio and publisher. We were promised fixes for this and Mafia 3, but they never came. It's a shame because this franchise deserves better...",1644511968,1644511968,False,19,0,0.723567426204681396,1,True,False,False

I was in the midst of replaying L.A Noire and i came across the definitive edition of mafia and since i was already focused into that time period i picked them up. The first one the story had me going the whole time up until the very last scene and as soon as i finished i started mafia 2 just so i could see where the story goes and as i play through the game i realize what is really going on. By far the best story ive had from a video game in years. Forgot to mention i started off with mafia 3 on my PS4 and that has no comparison to the first two Mafias. Mafia 3 is good but man no where close to the first 2. Also the bugs yeah sure there was one scene i was talking to joe and he was completely invisible kinda through me off and then another scene where my hat was just inside my head which i lauged at because it was funny as hell under the circumstances of the scene. 
Hands down the most fun ive had in awhile playing a story based game. if you have not played these. Its a must play if you can grab them on sale even better. But if you look past the minor little bugs and glitches when you reach the end of the game you know it was worth it. And yeah Mafia 2 wasnt a full remaster like 1 was but it still looked good for what they did do.

It was a bit of an interesting choice by 2K to make this sorta deal. You remake the entirety of Mafia I from scratch, putting Hangar 13 on the deal to do so. You do a slight spit shine to Mafia III, unlock all the DLC and such and add your lovely DRM that works so well that you grenaded your own game and then you did this. You took a game from 2011 that looked pretty alright, gave it the world's most VAGUE spitshine of a remaster and called it a day. Oh and the DLC's no mortal man bought.

You are lucky I love this game 2K, because I will still give this game a positive review. ONLY because you allow people to play the Classic Edition through this. Take this new review as more of a talk about Mafia II (Classic) than the DE, because beyond a few hundred bugs, it's still the same game.

Mafia II is the game that got swept over in the fanfare about GTA IV back in the day, and most people just sorta shrugged at it as a result. Mafia as a franchise has been perpetually stuck playing second fiddle to GTA and being judged for it. The ol' Crowshaw meme of ""CRIME DOES NOT PAY"" does fit this game like a glove, but in comparison to the 19 other games that tried to do that, Mafia II actually decides to make that concept work and matter by giving you actual stakes to lose.

You play as Vito Scaletta, a slightly DIFFERENT first generation Italian immigrant to America who initially falls in line with his best friend Joe Barbaro into the seedy underworld of crime in the city of Empire Bay. Through a world war and back again, you follow the pair as they attempt to pay for Vito's fathers debts by any means necessary. Quick, simple and with enough points for the plot to throw wrenches in it. And with a fun 1950's world to explore, various old cars to steal and destroy and a very fun and basic gameplay system to it, Mafia II is a modern classic. Like the original, it's simple in regards to most of it's actual parts, but that simplicity works in delivering the story. 

Are the plot points super deep? No. Do I care? No. I still remember most of this game and I can't remember like 95% of GTA IV so who's winning here, Rockstar?",1590329302,1644178230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still quite a good story but Gun-play is outdated a bit, especially the fighting compared to Mafia 1 DE, The driving feels jank in not the good way like how Mafia 1 DE was, It has like quick over-steer at the start, and at low speeds, and really high under-steer at high speed, its not something you can really get used to, unlike the more consistent but still controllable jank driving that is in Mafia 1 DE. 

There is also ""minor bugs"" such as facial animations not working, no audio in cutscenes sometimes, things poking out of the characters body, and sometimes the character audio duplicates, its wierd. OH yeah also during one of the scenes Joe bugs out and couldn't get past a scaffolding, There is a way to get past that, the trick is to block his movement from touching the scafolding and he should teleport to the other side.

Initially I treated it with a lot of caution: having played GTA over the last 17 years, I was afraid I had grown too accustomed to its universe and that I might therefore become unable to enjoy comparable games.

My fears were overcome after I gave Mafia 2 a few tries. It is a strong title with a very good storyline and characters as well as great graphics. When you drive around you absolutely do feel as though you are in an East Coast American city of the 1940-50s, 2K Games and Hangar 13 deserve great credit for how they recreated this kind of urban environment.

Their attention to detail is further evidenced by the level of detail of the vehicles. The player can find out various information such as the vehicle's top speed and power when it comes to vehicles that have been stored in the lockup. Also unlike GTA, vehicles kept in the garage remain in the player's possession; you don't have to fear about losing them in random missions.

I played the main story on Medium difficulty and felt it was just right: not so hard to the point of making it impossible to enjoy yet challenging enough to keep it interesting. The combat and shooting modes are impressively realistic. You won't see stuff such as heads exploding when you shoot at targets. Also depending on where you aimed you may need more than one shot to finish off an enemy, which brings added realism. There are not many missions, however this is offset by the complexity of the missions and the time required to complete them.

Vehicle handling is a lot like in Grand Theft Auto IV: the vehicles feel heavy and therefore convey the feeling of being behind the wheel. Car crashes have been replicated quite well: they won't suddenly turn into trash or catch fire as in some of the GTA games.

A common criticism I have read of this game is that it is not truly open world: you have to follow a specific sequence in completing the missions and do not have total freedom to explore Empire Bay. I did not find this to be detrimental to my enjoyment of the game and I certainly do not think it should prevent others from enjoying it for all its other aspects.",1643391056,1643391056,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

Visuals are the same, and maybe even worse than the original, quite surprising. Voice animations are very noticeably awful. Felt like I was playing the game for the sake of it after a few missions. Countless obvious model clipping in cutscenes. This remake reeks of zero budget and zero hours of labour; I wonder what they actually did differently. I had all my settings on maximum and I wasn't even close to the advertised game's screenshots on the store page; I guess that's some false advertising for you.

I'd happily drive to and from missions while playing the Original's DE, however the visuals and sound gives a very dull and uninspired atmosphere; it's a slog, whereas the Original DE was a pleasure to spend time in and take it all in.

PROS:
It has a pretty good story line. It is very similar to the original mafia but with different characters. That is expected.
Characters are likable and animations are good. City looks great and atmosphere (especially during snowy winter - start of the game) is amazing. 

CONS:
Some characters and parts of the storyline are not that good (sister and mom). They are made on a very basic level and there is not attention to detail to their characters.
There are minor glitches where  NPC car would stand vertically in the middle of the road, however this is not that frequent. I saw it a couple of times throughout the game.
In scenes where there is mass shootings in the buildings framerates wold significantly drop. I think this is due to newly introduced tears of the wall (colisions) system. I.e. I am generally havinng 110 fps and I would experience drops to 30 fps (RX6800).",1643192677,1643192677,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Once you've seen it, there's not much point in it other than your progression through the story, meaning there's not much to do in this game outside of the story, sadly. Some clunky gameplay, which becomes particularly relevant in combat situations or when you get caught by the police, who will fire on you non-stop for merely chipping someone's vehicle or even when you're the victim of NPCs attacking you (at least, as far as they know) lol. 

Examples of clunky gameplay are:

1. Sometimes your guy might switch to the wrong side of cover when you're trying to aim the opposite way
2. There may be times where your guy doesn't switch to his weapon on time in the heat of the moment, getting you killed.
3. NPCs may take cover in front of you before you do. In this situation, it can be difficult to get them off on time, and you can get lit up by gunfire as a result of this.
4. When you pull someone out of their car, the game won't automatically put you in the car, but instead force you to press the action button again to get in it. Might be a personal choice of theirs, but seems counterproductive to the idea of stealing people's cars and can negatively affect you in a heated situation, especially if you forget how it works.
5. Molotovs will sometimes hurt you when their effects are physically nowhere near you, which can get you killed, obviously.

The game design is quite outdated in those ways and can be quite frustrating.

Also, be mindful that the checkpoint system can be quite bad too, and set you some ways back if you happen to die at a certain point (this can be especially frustrating if you played on Hard difficulty like me).

Overall, these gripes are annoying but fairly minor for the most part. There are only a few situations where it might impact you greatly, unless you play like an absolute madman. Otherwise, the game is a reasonably fun, atmospheric story that will take you through a variety of interesting scenarios. I think it's worth experiencing once. Not much replayability though, unless you like collecting magazines and cars but hadn't done so already in your first playthrough. It's a reasonably short game if you just go through the story the whole time.

~[i]Tony Montana, Scarface (1983)[/i][/h1]

‚ÄúThe Definitive Edition‚Äù. What do you think of when you hear those words? Well, technically, you can think of pretty much anything. Just because those words mean nothing. Publishers can literally sell us anything and call it ‚ÄúThe Definitive Edition‚Äù. And [b]Mafia[/b] is a perfect example of that. At the point I write this, there are three games in the series. All of them have ‚ÄúThe Definitive‚Äù editions and all of those editions are absolutely different. The first [b]Mafia[/b] got the best treatment. [b]2K[/b] asked their division called [b]Hangar 13[/b] (which was already merged with [b]2K Czech[/b], creators of the original game) to create a proper remake and gave them enough money to do a good job. [b]Mafia III[/b] didn't get any treatment at all. They've just released a free update that was supposed to improve graphics (spoiler alert ‚Äì it failed and almost broke the entire game) and called it a day. Now, what about [b]Mafia II[/b]?

For [b]Mafia II[/b], [b]2K[/b] hired a little (about [b]100[/b] employees) British company called [b]d3t[/b] and asked them to do a quick overhaul. So... yeah. Unlike the first [b]Mafia[/b], the ‚ÄúDefinitive‚Äù edition of the second one is not a remake, but a quick remaster. Remember what we had in [b]Shenmue[/b] remasters? Well, it was [b]d3t[/b] who worked on them. If you've played modern versions of [b]Shenmue 1[/b] and [b]2[/b], it should give you a general idea 'bout what to expect here. Take the old game, sprinkle it with some modern technology and voil√†, that would be [b]$29.99[/b] (note how price of [b]Mafia II[/b] remaster is exactly the same with the one of [b]Shenmue[/b]). At least, that was the idea.

Because while [b]Shenmue[/b] was a console title, the one that only [b]DreamCast[/b] (and [b]Xbox[/b] in the case of the sequel) owners were able to play (as long as we're not talking about emulators, of course, but that's a different story), [b]Mafia II[/b] was a multiplatform game that was already presented in [b]Steam[/b]. And obviously, asking money for such a basic overhaul would have make a lot of people angry. So, [b]2K[/b] decided to play it smart and sold the new version only for console owners. Didn't make much sense for [b]Xbox One[/b] owners who still had their [b]Xbox 360[/b] discs on them (backward compatibility, ho!~), but for those who didn't have the game yet and, of course, for [b]PlayStation 4[/b] users it sure did. So, that's how it was about selling this version, while in [b]Steam[/b]? In [b]Steam[/b] everybody who already had the original version in their libraries got the new one for free, while for the rest of us the new version just replaced the old one in the store (more about that later). So... we've got an updated version and we didn't even need to pay for it. Life's good, right?

Well... technically ‚Äì yes. Yes, it is. On paper. It comes with all [b]DLC[/b]s (unlike the original version, cosmetics in the remaster will unlock with time and won't be available at the beginning of the game), the textures were replaced with those of higher resolution, there's an [b]MSAA[/b] ([b]Multisample Anti-Aliasing[/b]) support, there are improved shadows and light, new technology was used for both hair and foliage, etc. Some sounds (like sounds of shooting) were also improved. In other words, like I said, on paper it's pretty cool. Unfortunately, only on paper. Because it looks like due to limited monetization, this remaster got very limited budget. And as the result... yeah. You know how it is about those quick and cheap overhauls. Instead of fixing and improving things? They just make everything worse.

First of all ‚Äì nobody cared to fix the old bugs. It's not like [b]Mafia II[/b] was the buggiest game ever made (thankfully, [b]Todd Howard[/b] wasn't involved in its development in any way), but it had a series of well-known bugs that pretty much everybody who played the game before knew very well. It was only logical (yes, you can call me [b]Mr. Spock[/b], thank you) to fix those in the remaster, but like I said, nobody here bothered. Quite the opposite, it looks like the game became more buggy now. At least, while playing the remaster, I've experienced way, [i]way[/i] more weird bugs than before. One of cutscenes with [b]Harvey Epstein[/b] is broken too and looks like a mess. The color palette was changed and looks way more cold than needed, while ‚Äúretro‚Äù effect was completely removed, which makes the game to look... weird. Especially for those who remember playing the original. New hair and  foliage technologies are half-broken and come with tons of visual glitches (remember [b]Cyberpunk 2077[/b]? That's the stuff.). New light looks totally out of place and may even cause troubles. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

In other words, we've got the same exact game, only worse. The ‚ÄúDefinitive‚Äù edition of [b]Mafia II[/b] is one of those cases, when it's actually a better idea to stick with the original. Sure, the original didn't have high resolution textures optimized for [b]4K[/b], but honestly, I didn't feel bad playing it on my [b]4K[/b] TV. The remaster, on the other hand, felt way worse in many ways. There's a little ‚Äúbut‚Äù here in a form of the exclusive [b]DLC[/b] that adds suits and cars from the other two [b]Mafia[/b] games, though. We've got [b]Tommy[/b]'s [b]Shubert Six[/b] taxi and gangster suit to remind us about good ol' days in [b]Mafia 1[/b], while from [b]Mafia III[/b] we've got [b]Lincoln[/b]'s [b]Samson Drifter[/b] (which totally breaks the balance, by the way) and army coat. Sure, it's nothing big, but... it's there and some die hard fans may be interested in it.

All in all, though, it's still a no-no. [b]PlayStation 4[/b] owners don't have much choice, but for everybody else out there it's way, [i]way[/i] better idea to stick with the original. Which... unfortunately you can't buy in [b]Steam[/b] anymore. Well, technically you can, but to get access to it you should buy this crappy remaster first (it comes with a free copy of the original version). Because, like I said, that's what crappy remasters do. They just make  everything worse. One way or another, that's pretty much it. You already played the original game before? Just forget about this remaster. Nothing good here. Totally no reason to bother. You haven't played the original yet? Wait for a good discount and pick this one up, [i]but[/i] play the original that comes with it instead. You're on [b]Xbox One[/b]? Go buy the [b]Xbox 360[/b] version. And if you're on [b]PlayStation[/b]? Congratulations, you're screwed. Dixi.",1642328575,1642527289,False,199,5,0.852192997932434082,0,True,False,False

1. The graphics are TERRIBLE compared to its predecessor's remaster.
2. The story makes a bit too little sense.  You see Vito's motivations initially, but then the story kinda gets messy, and convoluded.  It's a good story, but not as epic as Mafia 1.
3. I do feel that they made the health system a bit too easy here.  In Mafia 1 & 3, you rely on consumables to keep your health topped up.  In this one, your health auto regenerates to a certain extent.  While you do appear to be a bit more squishy, it still makes the game a lot easier than Mafia 1.


HOWEVER.... the game is still fun!  The game actually gives you a fair amount of freedom to do what you want, and a lot of activities to partake in as well!  
You can rob stores, steal cars to be crushed for money, and go to a bar to purchase a bit of whiskey to regenerate your health.
You can upgrade your cars to a pretty reasonable extent!
You can find Playboy collectibles with lewd pictures of women (seriously, this collectible idea is GENIUS.  give this man a raise!)
And most importantly, crime status is better!  Even after you run away from the cops, your car and person can be wanted, and you need to change the look of either in order to evade the crops properly!  It's a pretty nifty system if I am being honest.

While the story lacks, and difficulty is a bit easier than Mafia 1, the gameplay is a lot more fun than Mafia 1.  Definitely give this game a shot if that is a selling point for you.",1642442811,1642442811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]Mafia 2 is for many a favourite game and some cursed it. 2K decided to make a remaster of it with all DLCs in one pack called Definitive Edtion. Let's take a closer look at it.[/i]

[b]The Main Game[/b]
The main game has a very good story. Maybe it could be longer, but I'm fine with it. You will visit many interesting places in Empire Bay city. You will play as Vito Scaletta who came to the USA with his parents and sister to start a new life. You will want to be a real gangster, but later you will see it isn't as easy as it looks. I play it in the Czech language and I must say dubbing is perfect. There are many funny buzzwords and smile situations.

[b]DLCs[/b]
DLC pack will double your playtime. It's not like the main story. There are arcade missions where you go destroy stuff, hijack cars and kill some guys. What I miss in DLCs are cutscenes. Before nearly every mission you have only text without dubbing. Joe's Adventures has 4 story missions but Jimmy's Betrayal and Vendetta have fewer missions with cutscenes. I would appreciate it when mission descriptions have dubbing at least. Overall DLCs are fun to play. You have free-roam where you can do anything that you want.

[b]The Main Game and DLCs[/b]
The game has very good music. You can listen to the radio in a car with many nice old songs from the 40s and 50s that make you feel you are really in the 40s or 50s years of the 20th century. Also, the cars list offers pretty cars and the game has awesome car handling. Not awesome, it's one of the best car handlings in open-world games. When you choose simulation in options you will need to drive really carefully if you don't want to end in a tree or wall. Mafia 2 offers a good selection of weapons. You can find here classic Thompson 1928 or Colt 1911, German rifle Karabiner 98k or Italian submachine gun Beretta Model 38. There are a lot of toys to play with.

The graphic is better than in the original game. There is no that a quite strong bloom effect. In the 2010s it was fine but nowadays I'm happy it's not here. Textures are better and the whole Empire Bay looks updated.

Both the main game and DLCs have quite a lot of bugs. Sometimes face is bugged in a cutscene, people are doing stupid on street things like jumping over a fence without reason. Another bad thing is optimization. There are some FPS drops if you have NVIDIA PhysX enabled. Also, the game crashed a few times during my playthrough. And there is one thing that is not a problem of remaster but Mafia 2. Devs should make more missions in the 40s in snow. In the main story, there are only a few missions in snow and in DLCs, there is only one in Joe's Adventures. Snow is well made here and fun to drive. Cars feel like they are driving on snow. The devs didn't use the potential of snow.

[b]Ok, let's conclude. I think this remasted should be better, but it's not a disaster or bad. If you have played the original Mafia 2 before and you want to replay it, you can try this remaster. If you haven't played Mafia before I recommend you to play it. Yes, it has some bugs and optimization isn't good but it's playable and fun. You can enjoy a good gangster story, with many funny quotes and with Joe and Jimmy you will turn the city upside down.[/b]",1641664127,1641670483,True,7,0,0.570708334445953369,0,True,False,False

10/10 Graphics - Definitive edition is a solid remake of the classic. Awesome!
10/10 Details - A lot of hard work was put into graphical details and to give that 1940's feel.
10/10 Music - If you like oldschool music or are into a nostalgic adventure, would recommend.
9/10 Gameplay - Shooting can get repetitive, but you get varying opponents and missions. So it remains fun!
8/10 Miscellaneous - Side-missions, helping NPC's, you can do whatever you want. Shop, eat, pimp.
8/10 Characterization - NPC's and side-characters look a bit the same, especially NPC females.
8/10 Operations - Very rarely does the framerate drop or does the game crash. Rarely. But it happens. So save up!

I played the first one when i was young and remember it being not half bad so i thought i would try this one and i regret it. The gun play is bad and the cover system feels last minute, there are whole sections of the game using hand to hand combat but it is shallow at best. I am 8 hours in and this open world is calling with the characters and contacts they have established but havent yet let me make a choice on how i would like to play. Oh and the checkpoints are horrible. Whole missions and driving here and there just gone! And did i mention you cant manually save the game, all auto save. So when the shitty driving kills you 30 minutes into a mission be prepared to have to do it all again.

all that being said, i see what they were trying to do. Its a game to play for the story (even if its not thrilling and damn predictable). And they spent alot of time building in an in depth police system who know when your speeding or running red lights and are fairly formidable in battle, you have to pick locks to steal cars and  the main character has to get dressed everyday. there was some attention to detail but just not in the right places.

alright lets start this review off by saying yes mafia 2 is a good game but that's only because of the story, i enjoyed the story its your classic old school gangsta but other than that the game is quite average, the gameplay isn't horrible but it is very stiff and not as fun as you would hope for and the way that the game works tries to make you feel like you are in an open world game but really you drive from point A to point B and then do story missions. (there isn't any side missions) As for the DLC that comes with the game again nothing amazing go here and kill/steal finish mission its pretty boring, if you are looking at this game from an achievement point of view its going to take you a while and its quite the slog to do everything.

[b]Mafia 2[/b] is as close to a modern classic as I can think of, maybe not as much as the first Mafia as that got an outright full-on remake and this didn't. But I've never played classic Mafia 1 or the remake. Mafia 2 was my introduction to the Mafia games.

[b]So what's different about the Definitive Edition?[/b]
Well, you can't buy the classic version anymore for starters. Additionally, this version [i]technically[/i] speaking, looks nominally better with higher resolution textures and improved lighting and weather effects. But it also suffers from an immense amount of technical failures that the classic version never had. More on that later.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2695557172

It also features the additional episodes (scored arcade style for replayability) ‚Äî The Betrayal of Jimmy, Jimmy's Vendetta and Joe's Adventures.

[h3]Made Man[/h3]
You'll play as Vito Scaletta coming back from the war after being arrested and given the option to enlist instead of serve time. The game is based in Empire Bay, a fictional city that is based on New York City. As you may have surmised by the title, you join the Mafia  ‚Äî where a number of low level robberies, criminal mischief and other more serious offenses take place. Such as the manufacturing of corpses and their disposal. Some might call it business. As I've stated, I never played Mafia 1, but I have played the more divisive Mafia 3 and I understand why it's so polarizing. I happened to enjoy it. From my experience, you don't need to have played any of the other games to enjoy Mafia 2 or 3, but you'll get more out of them if you do.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2695615949

[b]Mission Structure[/b]
The game is actually [i]extremely[/i] linear. It's more like a movie that just happens to take place on an open map. There's never any choice as to what mission you can do next. Some missions don't give you the best equipment but because the map is technically open in between objectives, it allows you the agency to go get better stuff or not. Either by buying better weapons, stealing a better car or upgrading one you've already got. The only significant side activity you can do is to bring cars to the scrapyard for extra cash, otherwise the only side activities are shops ‚Äî whether you engage with them as a normal customer or just rob them is up to you.

It's one of the only open-world games specifically about crime where the police will come after you for minor traffic offenses e.g., speeding, fender benders with non-police cars. You can actually turn on a speed limiter to prevent you from going over the speed limit. Oddly, the police are not concerned if you enjoy driving against traffic provided you don't make contact with any of them. Of course, they'll also come after you for the [i]real[/i] crimes being committed throughout the game as well. Speaking of, being wanted by the police has separate ‚Äúmeters‚Äù, one for if the vehicle (license plate) is wanted and one if they're looking for your physical description. You're able to essentially hide if you switch cars while unable to reach someplace to change your clothes. But the police will notice if you drive too close.

[h3]Anecdotes[/h3]
Given the advantage of a retrospective viewpoint, you may pick up on things this time around you didn't the first time, such as Dave Fennoy voicing some of the radio dialogue ‚Äî he's in a lot of games, but most notably, he's Lee from Telltale's The Walking Dead. And I'm almost certain I heard Mike Patton of the band ‚ÄúFaith No More‚Äù voicing some random NPCs, though I can't find any credits for him. He also does a lot of voice work including his more known parts like ‚ÄúThe Darkness‚Äù where he voices... the Darkness. As well as Nathan ‚ÄúRad‚Äù Spencer in the 2009 Bionic Commando re-imagining. 

[h3]TechSmech[/h3]
I ran this game using a Ryzen 5 5600X and a 6GB GTX1060 and it ran relatively fine beyond the much higher temps that a much more demanding game would typically run on this system. There were also sequences where a lot of fire or environmental damage would cause the game to drop down into the 40FPS range. I was running it at 2560x1080@75Hz as that is what my monitor's refresh rate is, I didn't test it at higher resolutions or frame rates, though there is a custom FPS limiter in the options.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2695567581

The 5600X, in my testing, draws about 35W when it's basically doing nothing and I use stock Wraith Stealth cooler so it tends to run a tad hot in the first place. However, in my Prime 95 stress test at 100% usage, it pulled 75W while never exceeding 83¬∞C at stock settings. So despite the shown CPU temp seeming relatively high for what's it's doing, it's well within its normal range. It's just... a lot higher than more demanding stuff ‚Äî I'm left to believe that something is simply [i]off[/i] regarding this game.

There were glitches regarding facial animation and 'headpieces' to include hair and hats being set [i]within[/i] the head during cut scenes. Sometimes ‚Äúambient‚Äù dialogue would repeat. And I don't mean like it simply ran through all the available recorded lines throughout the course of the game or sequence, I'm saying it'd repeat the line immediately after finishing it while cutting off other lines. It only happened in a few places, however.

[h3]The Gist[/h3]
It's unfortunate that this ‚ÄúDefinitive Edition‚Äù is riddled with technical issues. But I feel the narrative is strong enough to pull through those more [i]dicey[/i] moments. It's the type of game that will get remade for the next 30 years, even if it's called something else.

The story is completely mundane and uninspiring and there's no real character story development to keep you wanting to play.

Mafia 2 is a nostalgic game for me. I played it when I got the xbox 360. I remember really liking the game and found it one of the best. I never had the opportunity to play 1 and now with the definitve editions I could play Mafia 1 and 2.
Mafia 1 I enjoyed playing, since I had never played the game before. The graphics were really good in comparison to how it looked before, but the story was fine.

I played this after completing Mafia: Definitive Edition and it was nice to see how it tied together in an essence (if you finished Mafia and then this one, you'll know what I mean xD). The story line for this specific game was a little all over the place and didn't allow for as many decisions or ""freedom"" as I would have liked and the cut scenes that were used in the open world in order to load and render things when going from your apartment to the street or into a shop, etc. was somewhat annoying at first but easily understandable as the game definitely had it's glitches but for a remastered game, it was still enjoyable and I would buy it again! I liked the technical aspects of being able to steal cars, change their plates, upgrade them, etc. I wish money wasn't always a constant issue in the sense of you'd lose it often during the story line and you never seemed to be able to have a chance to be out on your own to get more because it wasn't a part of the story besides for one mission. Another thing I wish was that they made the magazines more noticeable or more of a thing like they did on the radar of Mafia. I didn't think to even start looking for them until about halfway in because of how the game itself ran through initially tutorials and what not. But again, all in all, I really enjoyed the game and am looking forward to playing Mafia III even though the series itself has mixed reviews all across the board.

The only difference I saw from the classic was a couple graphical updates to some textures and that was it.  Heck the classic edition had more starter outfits, though you get more in the definitive edition once you progress much further in.  I guess what I'm getting at is this feels like a lazy port instead of an actual definitive edition of a game.

The story is alright, although there are some story beats that you can see coming from a mile away which can kind of take you out of the experience.  I really enjoyed Joe and Vito, they came off as best friends throughout the adventure and even looked out for each on multiple occasions.

However there are issues, one of those things being that this game is very buggy and it becomes quite noticeable once you are further in.  Most of the time it's down to pathing where you can watch someone just run themselves into a wall and keep walking.  This one was the most prevalent.  During certain cutscenes the mouths just stop animating and it's like the character is trying to be a ventriloquist(This is the second most prevalent one i've found).  For some reason it didn't really start cropping up for me until the butcher level.  The game does use a physx engine which can be turned off.  I recommend turning it off because for some reason it will tank your framerate to a very noticeable degree in certain areas.  When I turned it off, the framerate drops disappeared and I saw no real change in the game, as if nothing actually used physx.

Ambient Occlusion will always reset itself to ""Medium"" the next time you boot the game up if you try to set it to ""High"".

The sound is decent, though I believe it's because they used the same sound files from the classic edition with no actual changes.

All told Mafia 1 Definitive Edition felt like an actual definitive edition of it's game and did more to claim that title, while Mafia 2 Definitive edition just feels lazy and didn't improve on anything other than a few textures and is somehow buggier than the classic version.

I agree with them, there are some gameplay/graphic upgrades, but I barely notice much of a difference between the original Mafia II and this Definitive Edition. 

However, for some god forsaken reason, the classic version of this game is unplayable for me, it always crashes 5-10 minutes into playtime. Doesn‚Äôt matter what fixes I try, nothing works. The classic edition is scuffed for me for some reason. Thankfully, at the very least, there is this playable ""definitive edition"" of Mafia II.

Most Mafia fans say that classic Mafia II is one of the best out of all the Mafia games, but personally, coming from someone who has never really played the classic Mafia I and Mafia II games, I would prefer and recommend Mafia I Definitive Edition over this game. 
However, for this game, narratively, the story is solid and entertaining, the environment and open world are well thought out and immersive, and the gameplay feels crisp to a T. I still enjoyed my time with this game, and, to a lesser extent, recommend it to Mafia virgins/noobs coming form the Mafia I Definitive Edition like me.

There was another chapter where I had to close the game and turn it back on because a car was stuck on the driveway upside down and there was no way to get it out of the way. 

Then, there is this odd scanning going on when you first start up the game that can be incredibly annoying.

I really wanted to recommend this game, I loved the main story, but the DLC at times is even more broken to the point you get stuck.  Currently I have given up on the game on Joe's Adventure, the car that blows up says 3 seconds, it blows up in 1 second, making it impossible to finish.

The original had a ridiculous soundtrack and radio songs but it appears broken in this version.  Some audio overlaps and cuts off early.  This is a real shit show.

Mafia 2 is severely underrated. The gameplay is fairly similar to GTA but it is way better than GTA V. The police will chase you and fine you for speeding, when police see you commit a crime you're wanted until you change you clothes, if you are caught stealing a car or escaping in a car that car becomes wanted and you have to change the plates, damage to cars is permanent, and you actually can run out of gas (its not annoying though because it doesn't happen often). The story is also significantly better than GTA V's in my opinion although it does end somewhat abruptly and leaves more to be desired. My only complaint is that there isn't very much to do in the game outside of the story and that is something GTA V does better. If Mafia 2 had more open world elements I think it would be remembered as one of the greatest games of all time and could have possibly rivaled GTA.",1635036926,1635036926,True,92,1,0.834082126617431641,0,True,False,False

One of the greetes! Becouse in my life im looking only the best games to play and other games im delete or asking money back from STEAM every time. So what about this games.
First all the world of Mafia 2 D.E is best changes this is just greet physical and best graphical changes in games story even GTA 5 REDUX Mod is not so perfect. You will ask me why? I think so! 
My Answer is so, becouse the MAfia 2 D.E. is good graphical games and even if you got LOW PC like my PC HP from 2007 with NVIDIA GTX 750 and 4 GB Ram. You will by very happey becouse this games is so best created that you can even in very low pc have fun with playing this little Paradise of Classical world sweetes Times story Mafia 2.
Im playing this games not for Killing people and not for even make money or other missions.
I love this games becouse i love the sweet Athmospher of the Classical world and Sweet Classical cars from 1920 to 2000. 
All cars was greet style. But now every car is Toilet with people inside.
And i love the old calssic houses and citys and people and clothing and Radio sweet Radio music from Classic times.
And yas this every music from Radio in Mafia 2 is sweet only whan you play Mafia 2 and in real life is other feeling.
And you know why it so? Becouse the Athmospher is other and the world is Classic with classical people and the citys are classic style builded. And one think what i love in Mafia 2 games is that you can mod your car change the colore and numbers and other good thinks and you can eat hotdogs and in house you can eat and drink and you can go to the coffe and eat and drink  and one more think i love the clothing shops in Mafia 2 that all clothing is greet!!!
What about Mafia 3 or Mafia 1 D.E? All that games i have played before and i dont like it. Becouse Mafia 3 bad optimisation to high Graphic card needed. In Mafia 1 D.E Needed Good Graphic Card plus you need to know that the world is boring and there have no shops like in Mafia 2 and no Caffe and no snowing days!!! I love Mafia 2 more than GTA 5 and More Mafia 1 and 3 and more than Just Chause 3 and Hitman 2016 and more Hitman 2 and more Battlefield 1 and 5 and more Call of Duty world war 2. Becouse Mafia 2 D.E Asking from your not best computer of the world and not high  graphic card. And even if you play with low graphic you will enjoy the games.

The game is chapter based like Mafia I was but it reminds me much more of an GTA game than a sequel to Mafia I. The graphics and gameplay are mediocre, the voice acting is pretty good and the map is pretty large. The story though, is great and I love all the little things that make the game so immersive.

Bugs with Vito's head when wearing some outfits, characters looking cross eyed in cutscenes. Flickering shadows and smoke. The DLC's arcade style is tedious and repetitive, it was clearly lazy work from the devs. But the story is great, almost as good as the first one, you get to experience to time periods and two seasons, winter in 1940's and summer/autumm in 1950's. Character's are great, although the pacing sometimes feels rushed, like there are elements that were cut out of the game. All in all, worth it for the game story and solid gameplay.

Unfortunately Mafia 2: Definitive Edition has not been remastered to the same level, and as a result there's not much point in the Definitive Edition existing - you might as well play the original which is cheaper, less buggy, and looks pretty similar (from what I remember).

All that's been changed is textures which do make characters and environments look better, but the game overall looks very similar to the original Mafia 2. Not only that, but this game has a huge problem with objects popping in, as well as the FPS tanking in larger firefights. Some characters also have problems with their eyes during cutscenes, as they'll not even be looking at the player but rather off to the side, and it's quite noticeable. 

While I enjoyed Mafia 1's story more than 2's, I did have fun with the game. Combat feels OK, though a bit generic, and the whole semi-open world execution is nice as it allows you to explore the city as well as allowing you to feel like you're progressing in the world (in terms of cash and cars). The soundtrack is pretty banger, and though I felt many characters paled to those of Mafia 1, there were some that I did really enjoy.

I'm only giving this a negative review because the remaster is so obviously just a re-release that claims to be a remaster, yet is so lazy in actually remastering the game. If you do buy this it comes with the original Mafia 2, and my recommendation would be to install that version unless you really want to play with some slight visual improvements.",1631775482,1631775482,False,1,0,0.494699656963348389,0,True,False,False

I just finished Mafia 2 classic and will base my review on it:

The graphics look almost the exact same, what they remastered I have no idea. Lighting? Car detail?
Instead of working ground up like the first Mafia, they took the already outdated graphics and ""polished"" them.
Like having a 480p sh*t, now a 720p sh*t, but it's still sh*t!!

The story, cut-scenes are copy-paste, literally.

If you have the classic Mafia 2 save games still on your computer, it'll transfer over to this game (collectibles included) interestingly.

The graphical stuttering issues STILL persist from the classic. Although not game breaking, but still annoying as f*ck.

If you already own the classic, do NOT bother buying this game.
If you don't own either, I'd probably buy this game because then you unlock an outfit in Mafia 3 Definitive Edition.
This game is still fun, but a terrible ""remaster"".

I never played the classic version before this one so I can't tell you how it compares, but you get it for free if you buy this so who cares.
What I can tell you is that I did encounter some bugs. Mostly graphical errors, character eyes looking in the wrong direction and heads spinning around during in engine cutscenes, a frightening one where a guys face was stretched out like those guys from Spy Kids, there was a weird one during chapter 14 where Vito started saying all his lines twice, but the only thing game breaking that I encountered was a mission where Joe tried to break through the wrong door forever, but the checkpoint was only a couple minutes back.
The major gameplay criticism I have is in fact related to the checkpoints. I don't expect an auto-save every other step, but they can be spread a little thin during some of the lengthier combat sections. The worst offenders in my opinion being the Chinese restaurant, the warehouse after the drug bust, and both halves of the final chapter's big combat zone.",1630748716,1630748716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, the game is filled with bugs which sometimes may cause the player to reload the level. One of the most annoying bugs that i experienced in my play through was when an in game character name Joe would get stuck running against boxes during a mission that he must follow you or you cannot proceed. Also during gunfights occurring inside buildings my FPS would drop from 165 to 30 and would not go back up until I had left the area. The controls on this game are also extremely unintuitive and annoying to use making the game play not feel fun to actually play.

If you compare this game to the first Mafia's Definitive Edition you can see how little work was put into this game. It would have been great if the developers gave this game the same treatment. The games DLC's also leave alot to be desired as they are basically boring missions where you must destroy vehicles or shops which is not very fun game play.

I originally planned to complete all the achievements on this game like I had on Mafia 1 Definitive Edition, however playing through the DLC's I realised how much i was not enjoying playing the game and how annoying the missions were, therefore i stopped and installed the game, as if you are not having fun doing something then there is no point in doing it.

I had high hopes for this game after playing through Mafia 1 but i cannot bring myself to play it in the shape that it is.

If you already owned the original, you got it for free and vise versa if you bought DE first. Even so, the only difference is that there are some 'up-resed' graphics, that's it. This is definitely not the same as Mafia 1 DE (so... maybe some false advertising in that regard). Considering all that, this is the first time I have reviewed Mafia 2, so how does it hold up?

Visuals are pretty good especially for the time it was originally released. Great sound, fantastic voice acting and a banging 50's soundtrack. Overall, the open world just oozes atmosphere, the attention to detail is magnificent. I know one of the big criticisms of DE on release was the bugs, but they must have been ironed out. All I really encountered was some rare asset drop ins and some weird cosmetic issues, but almost never.

As for the game-play in this open world, everything else is very solid too. I had a ton of fun with the gun play and driving, both hold up fantastically. Each chapter/level design is unique and interesting which latches on to the story so well that I was kept on the hook from start to finish.

The story itself though? The first game really took you on a journey with a man who was forced into the life of a mobster and dealing with the woes that came with it. But this one is about two guys who have completely embraced this life, regardless of how brutal the Mafia world can be! It was so much fun to revisit these characters and take in how much they love being a gangster, no matter what is thrown their way. Seriously, one of the best open world stories ever, let along mob stories.

I haven't picked up Mafia 2 since just after it was first released. Playing it again had me thinking ‚Äúwhy do we not get games like this anymore? Why have they not built on these amazing, immersive experiences‚Äù? (Mafia 3 is next on my list, but I have heard it was a step backwards). $49.95AUD does seem steep for an old game (really, the DE doesn't add anything new), but it is so hard to find a quality single player experience like this these days.

I'm happy to announce that I'm enjoying it about as much as I enjoyed Mafia Definitive Edition. 

One of the reasons I generally dislike definitive/remastered versions of games is it is never apparent what was actually changed. I never played the original Mafia II so I've no idea how this stacks up to that, but from what I understand they mostly added bugs. I have, however, only stumbled upon one of these bugs so far and all I had to do to get around it was to backtrack a couple of steps to shoot some dudes in order to progress. Not too bad. 

A lot of reviewers also criticize the game for not utilizing the open world elements a lot, but to me this is not really an issue. It just means that the creators had focus and they knew where they wanted to spend their time. In this case, they had spent their time on making the story and the gameplay around it feel as fleshed out as possible. I think more open-world games should follow this approach. Having an open world is great, but do we really need the open world tower grind that were popularized by games like Assassin's Creed? Mafia II proves to me that you really don't. Focus on what makes the game good and spend less time on content for the sake of more content and I'll be a happy camper.

Anyway, that's it from me. I can definitely recommend this game and I fully intend to finish the main story at least before putting it down.",1628505548,1628505548,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The whole experience is railroaded for you to follow a short story and there is no freedom at all. To call this an open world is a joke as the city is the smallest I've seen in a gta clone, and only serves as a place for you to drive from point a to point b between missions.

All missions feels the same and you have no choices. 
No need to buy weapons or ammo as you get them all for free.
You start with the best car in your garage which doesn't even belong in the time era.
Loaded with invisible walls to make sure you're guided.
The gun play is not enjoyable and all guns feels the same.
When the story is done you can't continue playing.
If you try to shoot civilians or allies the game won't let you pull the trigger.
You can't even jump...

The only content this game has is the story and it's generic at best.

But the reason I felt strongly enough to post a negative review that this game is absolutely unforgivable with its checkpoints and saves. 
I completed a mission that was mostly just boring driving from point to point. But I stopped before I went back to the character's home, so the mission never marked as complete, even though I had done the work. When I came back to the game, I was right back at the beginning of the mission.
Later, I went through some pointless conversations, fought a guy, had a whole cut scene during which days passed, did a short tutorial on a new combat move you get for some reason, then decided to go to bed. I turn the game back on today and I'm all the way back to wandering around having pointless conversations.
I don't know how the original version was, but if you're going to remake a game, update quality of life stuff like this. It's unforgivably dismissive of the value of the player's time and I'd get a refund if I hadn't found this out after two hours of play time.

I have a 2080 TI and an 8-core CPU with 32 GB of RAM, so I should have no trouble playing this.  But it seems to crash my system when loading out of cutscenes.

While the story is seemingly simple and kind of drags in the middle, it is still pretty great with an excellent ending that was super satisfying and I respect that the game takes its time in certain missions for key character building. The gameplay is more on the average side with a mediocre hand-to-hand combat that is used far too much for its own good, however the driving and shooting are pretty good if unremarkable in the genre. While not giving the same gorgeous 2020 makeover as the first Mafia game, the sharper textures and improved lighting for this remaster still makes it look undeniably better even though it still looks pretty good today. Unfortunately, the optimisation can feel pretty bad and it is sad to say that it wasn‚Äôt uncommon to see massive framerate dips and pop-in that would really hurt the immersion of Empire Bay with otherwise looks great with some great attention to detail even though it is ostensibly almost as barren as Mafia: Definitive Edition. I would totally recommend this game for it‚Äôs great story and gorgeous cityscape and I will probably replay it at some point in the future and do it‚Äôs DLCs which are included in the Definitive Edition.

This Game Is Just For Someone Who Wants To Play Mafia Trilogy ( I Mean For Somebody Who Wants To Understand Mafia Story From Begin To Finish! ); But If You Want To Buy This Game Play Solo ( Without Mafia 1 And Mafia 3 ) , Just Forget It.
Graphics Improved Over These Ten Years But Really Didn't Make Any Sense Specially In Higher Resolutions Such as 4K ... ; There Were Only Some Texture And Face Improvements and Nothing Else!
No Gameplay Update Or In-Game AI Improvement... :(
I Loved The Original Mafia 2 And This Remastered ( If We Can Really Call It Remastered! ) as Well But I Highly Recommend To Play The Game in Normal Difficulty And Don't Even Think To Play On Hard O_O
The Only Thing That Made Me Really Crazy About This Great Game Was That Hanger 13 Made The Game Suuuuuper Hard Compare To It's 2010 Original And I Really Don't Get It.
At The End , I Personally Don't Like To Write Bad Reviews For a Game Cause I'm an Animation Designer And I Understand How Hard It Is To Make Great Games Like Mafia... But as I Told Before, Buy This Game Just For Story Line With It's Two Brothers Or Leave It Alone.

Coming straight from Mafia: Definitive Edition, I was a bit excited for Mafia II: Definitive Edition. I really was expecting a graphical upgrade and way of story telling. The game is pretty much identical to the original release of Mafia II. If there was changes I would have to go look them up because I can't see them on the surface. The graphics are 2010, unchanged - which was disappointing after playing the first Mafia remake.

If you want to see the story which really has nothing to do with Mafia: Definitive, I would wait until it is on sale. It is a real shame that they didn't do as good of a job on Mafia II as they did on Mafia.",1625904006,1625904006,False,4,3,0.488401591777801514,0,True,False,False

If the Definitive Version of the game isn't up your alley, then buying this does also get you the Classic version of the game too. I do agree with some reviews saying it deserved the same Remake treatment as Mafia 1, because it well and truly does, and if you ask my I do prefer Mafia 2 to the original Mafia.

How Mafia 2 works its open world is actually one of my favourite treatments of it, where technically it is an open world but it works in chapters so you do still progress through levels. Its a shame that the next entry in the series completely ignores that aspect of Mafia 2's Open World. 

The gunplay itself is pretty basic cover shooting, except for the crosshair is in the top third of the screen which is... weird, to get used to and I completely forgot about it when revisiting this game. The driving on the other hand, SUCKS in the best way possible. These cars from the 50s feel exactly like that, terrible and old. I should also mention I was playing on Simulation for the driving.

Improved graphics can't compensate lack of anything ""definitive"" about that pathetic excuse of a rework.  Despite visual glitches (like flickering smoke and rubble textures) graphics are the only good thing about Mafia II: Definitive Edition.  Even though, during the gameplay one can't even tell a difference between that version and the original (classic) due to the original's textures not being so outdated or even old. So, it doesn't have the same effect as it had with The Lost Heaven Mafia.
Considering the time from the release, bugs are unlikely to be fixed, so I wouldn't recommend that garbage to even the worst enemy.

The story for the game was better than Mafia 1 in my opinion I got to know the main character more the ending was better as well, I think the best part of the story would have to be chapter 9-15 the situations you were put through made the ending better. The combat is meh I enjoy it but It could have been better, the driving is my least favorite, the cars feel clunky when turning corners and end up crashing or going to the other lane maybe its because Im used to GTA. Overall its a fantastic game with a great story and again Im disappointed that the graphics didn't get fully remastered like Mafia 1. (A FOV slider would have been nice)

You play as a spaghetti slurper named Vito who goes through a lot of shit in this game. He returns from the fronts of WW2 and finds himself broke and jobless. Afterwards he does what the game promises in the title, he joins the mafia. 

 First ~10 chapters are awesome and really sell that Italian mafia feeling, last 2 chapters felt a bit rushed and didn't enjoy the same detail as the rest of the game. Nontheless, Vito is a well thought out character you can sympathise with. Also his long-life friend Joe is one of my favourites. There are some cool twists and turns in the story that keep you engaged, despite the relatively monotonous up and down driving you sometimes have to do to get from mission to mission.  [b] All in all the story is the soul reason you play this game and I rate it a solid mom's spaghetti out of ten. [/b]

If you're less into story and more into driving 'n shooting there's plenty of that too. Gun handling is meh but it's fun, and shouting [i]'you wanna mess with my family uh?' [/i] with an outrageous Italian accent whilst blasting a dozen of guys with a Thompson never gets old. However, don't go into the game expecting a GTA V style gameplay, it is not that kind of game. I found the car handling to be a bit 'slippery' but nevertheless also pretty solid. I have read of some people who don't share this sentiment, so that may be something every person has to decide for themselves. There's not a lot of RPG elements in the game except clothes shopping (which do look fucking awesome mind you, if I could i'd wear fedora's + raincoat IRL), and car customization. [b] At its core,  game mechanics are enjoyable and serve their purpose but they are not the reason I binged this game for four days straight.[/b]

Last, let me state the the DE of this game is not worth the extra money, just get the classic version. Graphics are marginally better and that's it. The original versions' graphics are still awesome and don't take away from the game. I've had some launcher issues and one bug that led to me redoing a mission, but nothing spectacularly game breaking or anything of that sort, still weird they did not fix this in the DE version.",1624967919,1624968604,True,3,0,0.54314720630645752,0,True,True,False

Story: 9/10
I had heard good things about Mafia 2‚Äôs story before I began my initial playthrough.  The fans were 100% correct.  The story itself is captivating, the tone and character interactions are reminiscent of the film Goodfellas (one of my favorite gangster/mafia movies of all time).  The story is what really makes this series stand out.  Joe and Vito‚Äôs relationship is charming and believable.  I found myself invested in the outcome of a lot of these characters.  Some of Vito‚Äôs acquaintances lack a certain depth or uniqueness to make them memorable and takes away from the story and immersion when I can‚Äôt remember who is who and what role they play exactly.

Graphics: 7/10
The game itself is quite beautiful, especially the environments.  The environment is colorful and lively and provides a nice change of pace from more of the dull open world environments we see nowadays.  Facial animations are still a bit rough.  I‚Äôve encountered the occasional visual bug.  One example that comes to mind was Vito‚Äôs hair clipping in unnatural ways during a cutscene.  The lip sync is rough at times, perhaps the remaster could‚Äôve gone further to polish some of the less than stellar animations. 

Sound: 6/10
The soundtrack is immersive and is one of the highlights of the game.  The radio stations play music accurate to the 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs.  My biggest complaint comes from the lack of variety in the game‚Äôs radio stations.  There really isn‚Äôt much going on and I found myself turning the radio off to avoid hearing the same song for the 10th time in an hour.  Audio bugs were more frequent than visual bugs.  Most notably there were a few missions in which the same dialogue is repeated 2-3 times in quick succession which made it hard to understand exactly what is being said.  Overall bugs and lack of variety leaves a lot to be desired.

Gameplay: 7/10
Mafia 2 plays a lot like a cover shooter with some stealth elements.  Playing with both keyboard and mouse as well as an Xbox One controller felt responsive, and I have almost no complaints with either.  The KB+M bindings can be configured to your liking if you find the default control scheme awkward.  Very standard third person open world gameplay.

Such editions of a game should be bug free and and should provide good quality touchups. In Mafia II's case, the latter is nicely handled but the former is neglected aspect. 

Character models are definitely improved with relatively high fidelity textures for the characters. But you tend to see the bugs in this version which were not present in the original version. That is where it was bombarded with negative reviews. 

For some people the playing experience was very bad. In my case, the playing experience was not that actually that bad. I experienced weird physics or mesh based glitches a couple of time in my whole play through. And very few moments where I experience FPS drop but this can vary with other users.

The good thing is that this version came up bundled with all of the DLCs, which can be extend the content for some but for me they were simply fillers and nothing more. Another thing is that on purchasing the definitive version you will also get classic Mafia II free. So that is a plus.

Anyways, my few complains are only for the version of the game. The game itself is beautiful. The storytelling, the character development and even the missions are beautiful. If you have never experience Mafia II before then you must.

It was mostly due to the fact that had never played the first one so I didn't feel right playing this one. Now that I have, I was finally able to sit down and finish it. Let's see how it goes.

The story follows a brand new protagonist, Vito Scaletta. He's an immigrant who comes to the US as a child with his family and hits rock bottom early. His father works a job at the docks, but spends a lot of the money gambling and so he's always struggled. He became friends with a kid named Joe and they get into lots of trouble together doing petty crimes. One day, when they got older, they get busted for a crime. Vito gets caught and has to do time. He gets enlisted in the army and gets his first real look at the power of the Mafia. While doing a mission, he and his team are about to killed, when a Don comes in and just ends the war, no killing required. Vito returns home after some time and runs into Joe again. Joe is doing much better now that he has new ""connections"" and Vito needs to make money to pay for his father's debts and to get his life in order so he doesn't end up working a dead end job like his father. That's where we come in.

Mafia is an Open World adventure game that plays sorta like GTA. You'll be driving cars, handling missions, etc. The narrative is what really excels in this game. Just like the first game, I really enjoyed the story. Seeing Vito go from petty crimes to get into the family. His best friend Joe is such a great comic relief/ best friend foil to the story. I will admit the story was a lil hard to follow in some points since there are so many mafia families as opposed to part 1 where they mainly focused on two of them. However, I was still able to enjoy it from beginning to end....for the a lot of it (we'll get into that in the gripes section).

Just like the first game, I will always praise this series for keeping the player straight on the path of the story. There is never any, ""Look for this guy on the map to start the mission"" kinda deal. Soon as the chapter starts, you drive to the location and the mission starts. When you finish the mission, you are free to roam around the city and look for collectibles, or just go to bed and proceed to the next chapter. Absolutely respect that and wish more open world games adopted this. The music is top notch in this game, I loved driving around listening to the soundtrack. Some songs I knew, and most were new to me. 

But now for gripes, and I have plenty of them. This game look snice for a Definitive Edition, but it is filled with bugs. Random trash with the texture wrapping gone, characters walking through things in some cutscenes, there were some cutscenes where Vito's head was caved in a bit (that was jarring to watch), graphical slowdowns, my game crashed once, etc. I was able to finish it, but for a ""Definitive Edition"" I have to say this was rather bad. Just like in the first game, I cannot stand the fire fights in this game. I feel like they're worse in this one because the checkpoint system is so bad, enemies sometimes have the ability to one shot you, and sometimes enemies don't load properly into the game so when you think the coast is clear to continue, you walk through a door and a whole bunch of them are on a stairway instakilling you. It was a frustrating slough to deal with. I wish the auto aim feature was as strong as it was in the first game's because the shootouts are the one thing I literally dread in this game. It sucks going through a whole building only for the last enemy to get a lucky shot on you and now you have to do a long section all over.

Final verdict? Check it out, especially if it's on sale. Despite my gripes, I really did LOVE the story and characters. It's what pushed me to finish the game because I really enjoyed the story being told. I still despise the gun fights and I always will, but the driving and everything else made up for it in spades. If you enjoyed the first Mafia, you should play this one...just be ready for a bumpy ride, graphically. Thanks for reading!",1624224035,1624224035,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's 2021. The open-world game has been undergoing constant shifts with the more sophisticated plotline, like Red Dead Redemption 2, or bigger worlds with more events and stories where you can travel with a cup of coffee(Talking about Just Cause 4, Days Gone). But also with lovely buggy cities where you can make your choices, do some trading, shot some deadbeats, and --- jump into the water without creating a water splash, yeah, that's our Cyberpunk 2077~. It seems that the larger the world becomes, the more freedom the player gets. But marvelous as it looks, players may fall into the voids if handled wrong and feel lonely once the world becomes repetitive. Once players reach this threshold, the game has several ways  --- introducing MMOs, DLCs, rogue-like self-replicating missions, even some history lessons, etc.  --- to stretch its life cycle of engagement for a week or two. That said, people keep pouring their wallets in exchange for fun!  

Gargantuan and bulky as those games become, I can't help but feel overwhelmed by tons of distractions like random I-DGAF missions or trivia that have nothing to do with my engagement with the game mechanism or the storytelling. After months of gaming in the Assassin's Creed series, I've come to realize that the scale of the world and its logical complexity has its sacrifice, its potentness.

While Red Dead Redemption 2 still gives players the chance to go on a killing spree once in a while, nullifying whatever the personas built by hours of storytelling, the Mafia series takes a different approach. In Mafia II, though you can drive around aimlessly across the city, there are no meaningful objectives or collectibles like all those to-do lists in Ubisoft games, pushing players back to the track of the plot.

I would give some spoiler-free introduction to the story and protagonists for those who haven't played the Mafia series. In this game, you play Vito Scaletta, an Italian American, a war hero back in WWII, the son of a lower-class family bullied by evil capitalists. With Mafia's help, Vito managed to get back on his feet and face reality with his close pal, Joe Barbero, in Empire Bay.  

Since the Mafia Definitive edition is out, maybe consider playing them in tandem if you haven't touched them before.

Presentation 8.0: Engaging story with just the right amount of flexibility, a vivid, beautiful Empire Bay
Gameplay 7.0: A bit clumsy, feeling of greasiness when driving, punching looks repetitive
Graphics 7.0: Even though it's been years, the graphic still holds up.
Audio 9.0: One of the best OSTs I've ever heard!

Verdict 8.0: If you're looking for a potent shot of wine, here's your poison!

From the beginning, Vito says he doesn't like his dad. Okay, fine, understandable. Now we fast forward to near the end of the game. Henry is dead. We need money to pay Bruno. Go talk to Derek, help him out. Suddenly, we find out that Derek basically killed Vito's dad. AT NO POINT PREVIOUS TO THIS HAS VITO EVER SHOWED ANY RESOLVED FEELINGS TOWARDS HIS FATHER! Now, Vito is mad, and ends up killing Derek and Steve. Why? Yes, he is your dad. However, you have explained several times to several different characters that you don't like him and don't want to end up like him, in fact, that is Vito's entire motivation to be in the Mafia to begin with. So why are you pissed now? If you hate your father so much that you roll your eyes when your mother talks to you about him, what do the circumstances of his death matter? I feel like in a real situation, after taking that oath to join the family, that yes, of course you would be mad, but you wouldn't just fucking kill your friends because of it. More than likely, you would say that he is a dick for not telling you before and you could hold a grudge, but straight kill him? For something they hid from you for good reason? I don't understand how people seriously think this game is ""a masterpiece"". Not even to mention the bugs. And the graphics. Fucking Christ. This game came out last year and it looks like GTA IV. 

And the gameplay. Driving? Fine. Shooting? Fine. Level design? Awful. You can't blind shoot over the walls like in the first game, or like GTA which is clearly the inspiration or base concept for this series, so you're stuck waiting for a solid 30 seconds while 15 guys shoot at your cover, and sometimes your cover doesn't even protect you! You still take damage! What's the point of the cover if it doesn't do anything? The enemies run out of nowhere, you have no time to react, there's even a point where you turn a corner, a grenade drops down and it literally explodes before you have time to go back through the door, meaning you are almost are guaranteed to die there and have to do the section all over again. You require knowledge of what is going to happen before it happens. Not to mention the ending which is horseshit.

There are only two good things about this game. Number one is old playboy magazines. Number two is your friendship with Joe. That's it.

Shit game. Don't buy it. For any price. Ever.

Also fuck you if you think this game is a masterpiece.",1623670534,1623670534,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Coming directly off a playthrough of Mafia 1, its exceedingly difficult to judge this game.  Is it good?  I think it is?  Just not as good as the first remaster.  Is that due to weaker narrative? Partly, but its hard to say if I am less engaged in the story of Vito simply because I loved the character Tommy more. Tommy seemed to have a more clearly defined personality with ethical and moral stances which made him easier to inhabit as a player participating in his story. Vito is an opportunist and scavenger- Where Tommy felt like a man that could eventually run the city, Vito feels like a lifetime goon. 

The other facet to this experience that makes Mafia II tough to judge following Mafia's remaster is that it has objectively inferior visual and technical quality. This means that despite both games being passable 3rd person cover shooters of relatively comparable quality, the less immersive Mafia II becomes easier to judge more harshly. 

Why do I recommend?  Despite everything, I inhaled his game in about 3 sittings. Clearly I found this to be a gripping and engaging experience. At the end of the day, I consider this a legitimately decent game that lives in the shadow of its cooler older brother.",1623464569,1623464569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But there are quite a few negatives:

- The description says ""presented in stunning HD detail"". Well, the graphics is one of the worst parts of the game, imo. It doesn't look good at all.

- Bugs/glitches. Haven't enountered many, but have had a few annoying ones. Like having your parter stuck in doorways, preventing progress, and having to restart missions. And cars getting stuck in something invisible on flat ground.

- Game world. They made this large city, but apart from the main story, there's almost nothing to do. And the little there is, isn't fun. Stealing a few cars for cash gets boring VERY quickly. And collecting over 180 (!) wanted posters isn't going to happen.

- Following characters is always a negative for me in games, and it's A LOT of that here. It takes away the freedom to do things your way. And there are also far, far too many ""taxi"" missions, meaning driving people around.

- Absolutely no replay value. This game is for the story, nothing else.

I have a fairly high end setup, a GTX 1070, i7-2600 and 20GB of RAM, which is more than enough to run the game, in fact, the GPU and RAM are both significantly higher than the recommended specs. The issue however, is that while the game generally kept a steady 75 FPS, there were times the game struggled to even stay in double digits at all, making the game super slow and chug to get to a new area. I'll keep it brief, but in general, there were a LOT more bugs in this version than I ever remember in Classic Edition, the graphics are said to be remastered, though I couldn't tell a difference (however I haven't played the CE version in a while so take that with a grain of salt, it just didn't look terribly great), it came with 2K's launcher that it didn't tell me about, and at some points I've been made aware there are game breaking bugs that plague this version and not CE. If you can choose between the versions? DO NOT BUY DEFINITIVE EDITION! Capiche? Is it worth the struggle? ... At times, yes, I'd say the game is 100% worth a try no matter what, but if you have the choice, stay away from this version. I DID receive this version for free, thankfully, HOWEVER, it just kinda, appeared in my Steam library long after I bought the original, so I assume they were pushing for it to be the new normal version but it didn't cut it and I see why.",1622090398,1622090398,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Upgrades from Mafia 1 Definitive:
-Better shooting
-Better melee
-Better story
-Added Customizations to appearance and cars
-Fixed ragdoll problems

Cons:
Downgrades from Mafia 1 Definitive:
-Worse checkpoints
-Worse driving mechanics
-Skipping unnecessary drives was removed, adding an extra couple hours of wasted time to the game
-Removed medkits, meaning you have to wait for your health to recharge to 3/4th after any bullets you take when playing on medium or higher. Sometimes you'll just outright be instantly killed if you don't take the correct cover at the correct time.
-Dialogue glitches in a couple of missions

The game is alright. Graphically I feel like it's a step back from Mafia 1, and it doesn't really seem like the remastered version did much.

The main story is worthwhile as it delves into memorable characters, chapters and world setting. This is where Mafia 2 shines.

You know, I absolutely LOVE this game, and would whole-heartedly recommend anyone experience the amazing story of which it is, however; after the latest update, 2K Games decided to play the wise guy and REMOVE Steamworks save integration, losing me my entire playthrough that I was workin' on.

Not only that, but these smug bastards decided now would be a good time to inject some shitty DRM. So now when you launch the game for the first time after this update, you're presented with a nice little kick in the balls called ""2K Game Launcher"". That's right, you read it correctly. Another Goddamn launcher we have to have installed because 2K Games wants to feel included in the hair-pulling fiasco. Absolutely worthless.

The first half of the game felt great, frame rate was alright, but the graphics did kind of feel the same, but with a slight refresh. Nothing dramatic like a Halo remaster. It wasn't a big quirk, because of the fine details they added, like texture on clothing and others.

However, I do not recommend this game at all simply because I cannot finish it. I am currently stuck with Chapter 8, and halfway through the chapter, after the first stop, I (attempt) to head over to the next spot, which is Millville, and when I'm one turn away from getting there, everything starts to de-load, and disappear, and I fall through the world, and just get stuck in free fall until I quit into the main menu. Nothing crashes. It's literally me falling through the world. I try and look through for help somewhere, but it seems like no one has the same issue as I have, and most of the posts in the community either praise the game for somehow getting past this bug, or it's in Russian, or it's exposing the millions of other bugs that riddled this game. On the bright side, I did manage to hit 300+ mph and get the 120 mph achievement, and I also got the free fall achievement too, but I would rather finish the game than do that.

For people wondering if this is worth it, it's not. This game feel rushed, and it feels like I spent an extra few on something for a slight graphical upgrade. Get the classic one, you'll actually finish the game. 

One note I have to say is that the devs really seemed proud to release this, I really don't hope they release OR remaster any more games, because this is just an absolute disappointment and they really need to step up the bug fixes.",1617911092,1617911296,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The only thing that's definitively good about the definitive edition is better textures. The payback is that it's four times larger now (35 GB vs. 8 GB), but it's not that much of a problem today. Oh yeah, there's probably one more good thing: that nasty bug where PhysX could cause a crash is probably fixed (at least, I haven't encountered it).

Now, about the bad things:

1. With new textures, most faces now look older and uglier (in my opinion). Everyone's hair became too shiny as if it's covered in grease or is just made from plastic. Also, the 4K-textures seem to abruptly end just below the neck. If someone's wearing a shirt with their chest partially visible, It's very noticeable, and it looks... bad.

2. There's a whole bunch of graphical glitches now, like flickering pieces of textures or some floating pieces of glass ""attached"" to your car. Sometimes, the character's mouth won't open, and sometimes his eyes are looking in the wrong direction. (and PhysX for Vito's clothes is glitchy, too) This looks either bad, funny, or just stupid.

3. The new graphics will lower your FPS in a lot of scenes. Interestingly enough, the benchmark showed some great increase in FPS when there's no shooting or anything, but in the action scenes, it dropped so low that the average became worse than in the original.

4. Weirdly enough, the game managed to corrupt my DLC save file once, so that each time I reloaded, there was nothing but an empty gray screen with a minimap (I could move, but I couldn't see anything). I managed somehow to reach my apartment using the minimap, and when I opened the apartment door, the problem was gone. This never happened in the original version. If I weren't lucky enough to solve it, I would have to restart the whole DLC (which was 84% complete at the time) because there's always just one save file! This just isn't right.

5. In DLCs, the briefing pictures are now either missing or censored for some reason, which is not nice either. Also, some of Jimmy's lines were redubbed for some reason, and the original ones sounded better (in my opinion).

All in all, there are too many cons. I wouldn't even say that the new textures made the game look better because the difference is not drastic and, also, it's pretty obvious they weren't originally intended. I mean, it looks obvious, as if they don't belong. The original faces look more attractive and more natural, and system requirements are lower, too.",1616962234,1616963744,False,1,0,0.527410209178924561,0,True,False,False

The main difference lies in the fact that plot and storytelling are decreased to a bare minimum. The definitive edition is good work in refurbishing graphics though, except for some smaller issues. Here‚Äôs my pro/cons list:

Play time: about 15 hours

Pro:
+ nice story start connected to WWII
+ general story start with American Dream background
+ 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs songs everywhere depending on the decade
+ good remaster graphics-wise
+ nice title song
+ differences in world appearance depending on decade
+ mission connecting it to Mafia 1
+ good physics
+ tough ending

Cons:
- some graphic issues like distorted character faces, fog and particle flickering
- huge frame drops in some areas and scenes
- bad console control portation
- characters remain mostly shallow
- story remains shallow with loosely connected missions
- missing epic story-telling of part 1
- bad voice acting (recognisable use of 1 person for 5-6 characters)
- gameplay reduced to GTA kind of mission succession only
- quickly in jail for 10 years and no help possible?
- Radio stations are copied from GTA
- Police AI issues (tolerate taking red lights, stealing cars from drivers & forget quickly)
- At the end of the game the dialogues are messed up, repeat several times and get mixed up completely
- Feels like the city area is smaller than in part 1
- Very boring DLC only featuring a number of independent missions
- less freedom & variety than in part 1
- not really open-world

Conclusion:
Overall, I was quite disappointed by Mafia 2. The first part was such an epic story and gameplay, whereas part 2 feels more like a mediocre 40‚Äôs/50‚Äôs copy of GTA. The graphic overhaul was done well except for some minor issues. But the game itself is unappealing.

However, issues arise on the technical aspects. There are various visual bugs and glitches such as flickering smoke, weird physics etc that still haven't been fixed. 

Something that I haven't seen mentioned is how immersion breaking the open world activities can be. For example, for some reason every single person has a gun in every single store throughout the city and robbing the store at gunpoint will mean that everyone will whip out their guns to shoot at you. The police system is also a bit weird as the police will only stop you for speeding or crashing into people at full speed and will turn a blind eye for running red lights or driving on the wrong side.

Little short but still, if you are intrigued by mobster's, give this game a go.

Pro's:
The atmosphere and setting is just perfect, loved every moment driving (and walking) from point A to point B.
It's a rollercoaster of emotions, that's all i'm going to say about that.

Con's:
There is little interaction in the city itself, the atmosphere is just right but there is not much to do besides the main story. You can buy diffrent guns (there is almost no point becease you pick up alot of guns from dead body's) and you can shop for more clothes. Other than that there is not much to do. A missed opportunity.

If you play on hard difficulty you can spawn in the middle of a room when the gunfight begins. So if you want to live you should start to pray to the RNG Gods.

overal, good game loved (almost) every moment of it but it's not perfect by any means.

The impetus of revisiting this story, actually completing it for once following a couple of prior attempts on the PS3 and the original PC version in the past, with some enhancements to make up for the passage of time to boot, was surely an offer I couldn't refuse... in hindsight. Having finally completed it on my Twitch.TV broadcast in October 2020, and experienced it for all that I personally feel it is worth, It only seemed appropriate that I share my thoughts. And broken down in the paragraphs below, here they are:

[b]Story:[/b] While a fairly short experience by some of today's standards, it's still every bit as good as I remembered from the original Mafia 2. It's not a dyed in the wool classic like Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, or even the Mafia: Definitive Edition remake. But it's also not an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions that shouldn't have [i]been[/i] made, either. Thankfully, for better or worse, there have been no changes in that regard, and it's been preserved in all of its original quality. Nothing watered down, or sugared up for today's overly sensitive Z generation who have to cry to Twitter every time somebody looks at them cross-eyed.

[b]Audio:[/b] For probably 2/3 of the time I played it, it's been pretty good. However, I have noticed a fair amount of moments in the story where background noise would just be vaporized out of the cutscenes, leaving only the voice acting (which is awkward), or lines of dialog repeating more than once (which can overlap in some instances). This is a bad oversight which has broken the immersion, and affected the overall experience - especially towards the end of the game - and something that I would have to dock points over. Finally, while I understand that licensing issues become a thing after a certain period of time, legalistically speaking, I was nonetheless disappointed in the amount of cut music from the games radio stations. There are remedies for this, but none that I will publicly provide.

[b]Controls:[/b] Dated, and cumbersome. We're not talking PS1 or N64 era, but it's significant enough where I would've considered them an oversight in the remastering process. Had I been in charge of them, there would at least be two options: one for more modern controls similar to GTA, and one for the classic setup. Unfortunately, I can only judge these from the perspective of playing this with an X-Box One controller hooked to my PC, though. So, while I won't dock a [i]LOT[/i] of points, I will still be making concessions here for what it is.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] The hardest ride of them all. The AI can be straight up broken in some instances, and rudimentary actions or events sometimes don't register as they should (like the objective for crashing on Joe's couch never going away throughout the entire playthrough). And these are just a couple examples of the various bugs, big or small, that you will encounter throughout your experience with this ""remastered"" title.

[b]Graphics:[/b] While they CAN look better than the original game, there's a lot of things here in duality that throw a wrench into the cogwheel. Hats clipping through the player model, eyes not properly tracking, faces literally morphing off of peoples bodies, and various other things of that nature. Play it long enough, and you will discover something to hate. Guaranteed. 

...and while we're at it, a side-note concerning the PhysX: I should [i]never[/i] have to go into the game's root folder, and delete files, in order for rudimentary clothing physics to work properly, either. While not game-breaking, or even a buyer beware-grade issue, it is still annoying. It was just there, baked into the code of the original release, and should've been considered here as more than an afterthought by the developers all the same. Rant over.

Anyone familiar with my past reviews knows I rate games on a scale of 1 to 5. Here's a description of how that system works:

[table]
[tr]
[th]Rating[/th]
[th]Summary[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]5 out of 5[/td]
[td]Perfect on every level, or damn close to it. The fun factor completely overshadows the very few, if any shortcomings, and the overall product is, without debate, worth the full asking price.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]4 out of 5[/td]
[td]Above Average. While it's still a good, if not great product, there are noticeable issues here and there. Worth full price, but if you can rent it on console, watch gameplay online, or wait for a sale on PC, even better.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]3 out of 5[/td]
[td]Average. The caveats are on equal ground with the amount of entertainment provided. Rent it on console, watch gameplay online, or wait for a sale on PC.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]2 out of 5[/td]
[td]Fair. The problems with the overall product are noticeable, and outweigh the fun factor on most levels. Watch gameplay of it online if you must, or rent it on console. Deep sale on PC at absolute best.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]1 out of 5[/td]
[td]Poor. The product is an unmitigated disaster with very little, if anything, to be lauded. Unless you're a masochist, the best recommendation I can possibly give is to watch gameplay of it online. Don't waste your money.[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

[b]Overall Score:[/b] 3 out of 5. It wasn't totally void of fun, and I was happy to have finally seen this game through to the end. Playing the classic, if you can get your hands on a copy (or happen to already have it in your Steam library), I can see where that would be at least a 4 out of 5 experience - one that I recommend you dive into first-hand, wholly, above anything else. However, if your only option IS the ""definitive edition"", it is almost guaranteed that you will experience the same level of bugs and glitches that I've endeavored (as well as others), and I urge you to factor that into how much you're willing to spend - if you're willing to spend. Personally, I can only recommend it in good conscience at a deep (if not reasonable) sale price across both the PC, and console editions (replacing the latter entirely with a full on rental, if you're one of the lucky few who still has an operational video store nearby). The developers (or management) refused to commit to full-priced quality control with this product, opting to release it in a semi-broken state, and this level of effort should not be rewarded as such. It sets a bad precedent, and only ensures that we get more products like this in the future - an existing trend that I'm honestly sick of at this point.",1603910496,1614401345,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,True,False

This game definitely has all of that and many more bugs. For me though, I can work with bugs as long as the gameplay and/or plot are worth it.

PLOT (light/mild to no spoilers)

 This game has so many loose ends and unexplored plot points, down to the last mission ending with a sort of cliffhanger/ open ended situation. The actual plot also abandons key aspects that never really come up again. Your sister? Shows up literally twice with no follow ups about that plot. Your family history? Shows up in 2 missions to never be talked about again. This Mafia Commission/syndicate that controls everything, including the leading familes? a Red Herring. The whole Marty thing? Abandoned as soon as its considered a heavy plot detail. The FBI? Nothing ever comes from it. The amount of plot items that show up just to be nonstarters is astounding. I think this game has 15 chapters, and I still really can't find the climax. I genuinely thought that the final mission was the climax until the game went to credits leaving me confused because we've had 0 character growth and 0 consistent plot points. This is not Mafia 1, in which its a Mob movie set in a video game. This is several heavy action sequences compounded with a weak story.

GAMEPLAY

So driving in these games always sucks. For these early open world games, driving mechanics are just awful and unwieldy. This is problematic as the game has you driving literally all across the map all the time (no one else drives???) making driving even more important than in Mafia 1. Combat is also pretty janky. It's so easy to die in this game, which sucks when compounded with the amount of enemies for action sequences. Even on normal you will fight through 15-20 guys, just for someone to one shot you from 10 feet away with a shotgun. Not to mention in some instances you can be shot even though you are in cover. Long story short, this game takes the careful almost sniping pistol practices of Mafia 1 to a Rambo with a Tommy Gun is your best means of success. I say this because I tried the whole, sit in cover, wait, shoot, go back to cover, shoot, and then tried a charge with fully auto guns approach, and the latter was much more successful. Also, the amount of gameplay mechanics that aren't even mentioned until the last 3 chapters is astounding. Did you know you can rob stores and steal things besides cars? No? Neither did I until the game tells you in the final 2 missions. Same with crushing cars for money. Also, this games has at least 2 (maybe 3) instances where you will lose all of your clothes, weapons, and money. Once would be bad but understandable, twice? GTFO.

FINAL THOUGHTS

In totality, I only finished this game because I bought the Mafia Collection and wanted my money's worth out of it. I see 0 chance of me replaying and sludging through 15+ chapters of bad story and janky combat just so I can find some nude pictures.",1613677723,1613677723,False,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

***POSITIVOS:
*El pelo de los personajes se ve mucho m√°s lindo
*Fixearon el bug de que cuando rob√°s el Jefferson Provincial al principio del juego la pantalla de ralentizaci√≥n dura menos (YA ERA HORA)

***NEGATIVOS:
*En el medio de las cutscenes, los personajes tienden a buguearse y vizquear los ojos en direcci√≥n inferior derecha (vi√©ndolo desde la c√°mara, ser√≠a inferior izquierda desde la perspectiva del mismo personaje), pero no pasa siempre ni con un conjunto de ropa en espec√≠fico, sino que es completamente aleatorio
*Con ciertos atuendos, la cabeza de Vito se rompe y a su model le falta una feta de cabeza desde donde empieza el pelo
*Existe una chance de que cuando quieras robar un auto te subas de pasajero y no puedas bajarte, efectivamente softlockeando el juego, lo cual es especialmente irritante cuando el juego no tiene opciones de guardado manual, poni√©ndote en la situaci√≥n en la que ten√©s que perder todo tu progreso desde el √∫ltimo checkpoint para seguir, lo cual estropea completamente cualquier intento de platinar el juego
*Si choc√°s el auto en el lateral derecho de la autopista sur, cerca del muelle, en un lugar espec√≠fico, existe una chance muy alta de que clipees a trav√©s de la reja y te caigas al mar, dej√°ndote sin vehiculo (lo cual me pas√≥ 2 veces seguidas, posiblemente tenga algo que ver con el vehiculo Shubert Futura y c√≥mo est√° clippeado, pero sigue siendo inaceptable)
*En una sola playthrough de Mafia II edici√≥n definitiva, me encontr√© con m√∫ltiples (m√≠nimo 3) bugs de di√°logos, en los que √©stos se overlappean entre s√≠ solos, lo cual hace que si lo jug√°s por primera vez te puedas ir olvidando de entender la historia. Necesito aclarar que en mis 6 play-through de Mafia II cl√°sico nunca me encontr√© con este bug?
*La frecuencia con la cual, al salir de una cutscene salt√°s a una escena de gameplay que no es adecuada (por ejemplo, terminar una cinem√°tica y que en vez de el juego ponerte en la escena siguiente a esa cinem√°tica, te ponen de nuevo al principio de la anterior) es preocupante
*Joe, o cualquier NPC as a matter of fact, apenas entra a free roam no para de dispararse con quien se encuentre, m√°s all√° de no estar en hostilidad con los g√°ngsters o ser buscado por la polic√≠a, simplemente dispara a quien se encuentra en su paso mientras uno intenta buscar los carteles de wanted
*Entrar a Vengel's, que un auto de polic√≠a me siga adentro del local, rompiendo los vidrios, sobornarlos para que me dejen ir, acercarme a la caja registradora de Vengel's para comprar un traje, que la polic√≠a de la absoluta nada quiera arrestarme nuevamente, los soborno, repetir infinitamente.
*Cuando acerc√°s lo suficiente la c√°mara a un personaje, este desaparece para limpiar tu visi√≥n, la pr√≥xima vez que lo vuelvas a enfocar va a aparecer borroso y con puntos negros en medio de su model, hasta restaurarse de su forma original. No es game breaking, pero no estaba en el Mafia II original (aunque mi memoria puede fallarme, pero no recuerdo haberlo notado en el de 2010)
*Si en el cap√≠tulo 14, despu√©s de matar a *SPOILER FREE* rob√°s una tienda (lo cual es algo muy l√≥gico de hacer, porque ten√©s que juntar plata para pagar un monto considerable de dinero), lamento comentarte amigo que tu save file, en la cual ya habr√°s jugado unas 15 horas, est√° corrupta! buena suerte empezando el juego de nuevo rey!


Ante tanta injugabilidad desinstal√© el juego de ra√≠z, 2k tendr√≠a que agradecerle a Jesucristo que no me adentr√© en ninguno de los dlc y no segu√≠ con mis planes de platinar nuevamente el juego, porque muchos m√°s bugs que JAMAS ESTUVIERON EN EL JUEGO ORIGINAL seguir√≠an apareciendo y por ende expuestos al p√∫blico mediante esta review.

The story, the gameplay and the content is just as the original. A great gangster story with likeable characters (like Leo Gallante) and unlikeable characters (like Joe Barbaro, who acts like a f**ing 5year old). The gameplay is a decent cover-based shooter with a lot of weapon choices (although you will stick to tommy guns). The content is the main story plus a sorry excuse for DLC, which is basically the same assets of the game reused in side-missions. The DLC is by any means an ""extend"" to the story, but rather a ""go to point A, grab a quest from a textbox, go to B, kill/steal/whatevs, go to safe zone"".  

The visual upgrade is a welcome one, but it comes with the price of bugs. I didn't run to any gamebreaking bug, but some textures were off, some A.I took the day off, sometimes VIto will go through his bed.

This review is one that I regret having to write. I can honestly and truthfully say that not only is Mafia II an overall great game, and is tons of fun to play. Lovable characters with actual depth, a great story, and massively improved gameplay make Mafia II not only a great sequel, but an upgrade at that. 

Now, after reading that glimmering opinion, why the negative review? 

[b] WELL THE GAME DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK, THAT'S WHY [/b]

This legitimately makes me so angry, because every single fiber of my being wants to praise and recommend the game. However, morally I cannot, as there are times where a quest/mission prompt is glitched/bugged/broke or whatever, and as such, a mission cannot be continued even though you are doing everything right. It began to occur around chapter 11 for me. This is a massive issue as it means you have to quit and restart, meaning you must restart an entire chapter at times. For those unfamiliar with Mafia II, that means you might have to start over a half-hour long chapter just because a quest prompt was missing. Also, restarting does not guarantee that it will work the next time. I ended up wasting nearly an hour and a half over one mission. Nah, that's enough. 

Overall, just a massive shame that such an amazing game gets brought to it's knees over one issue.",1613018996,1613139888,False,1,0,0.439737141132354736,0,True,False,False

[b]Reviewing (skip to whatever interests you most):[/b]
1) Similarity with GTA-series.
2) Missions.
3) Cars.
4) Police. 
5) Bugs.

[h1]1) GTA?[/h1]
Someone, who never played Mafia series before (me!), may think it's like a GTA game.
And he'll be 50% wrong. 
There's 3rd person view, driving involved and various cars available, plus missions where you shoot enemies and escape from police. That's about all similarities with GTA.

Free roaming is limited: you play chapters, each containing 1-2 missions. You want to explore - explore during the missions. 
You've completed a mission? Next chapter starts. Plus the only time game saves - once a mission starts, [u]cannot save up manually[/u] (wtf :D )
However, there's not much to explore - [u]the city is small and not used up to its potential. [/u]
While in GTA games you end up fighting in multiple locations, [u]in Mafia II you repeat the same route: safe home - diner - thug factory.[/u]

A character only carries two weapons and any food - any - sandwich or a drink, will replenish all of his health. No need to worry about becoming chubby as in SA. ;)

The only collectibles you may care about: playboy magazines. And they must be picked up during missions. 
No, there is no mini-games like rampage, cannot earn money in taxi, ambulance or catching criminal. Forget it.

[h1]2) Missions.[/h1]
About missions. I can only name few memorable: 
a) dressing up as window cleaners and blowing up the meeting window from outside, 
b) delivering a car with broken breaks from the top of a hill 
c) aaand digging up a grave while drunk.

All missions are quite serious, so tiny-little room left for jokes (there are some, but only a few).

Main game is short. But its 3 DLCs (each!) just about a little shorter than the base game, minus videos before/after a mission.
Heavily love two expansions about Mr. Clean (lol), bold guy citing his kills and drifitng around.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2378749944
DLCs somehow stand out, they played slightly differently, involve new landscapes (snow lakes, more port fights).

[b]Two things I loved a lot: cars (driving) and police.[/b]
[h1]3) Driving.[/h1]
Vehicles! Somehow simple, but authentic physics and damage behaviour. You damaged your ride too bad? 
It will smoke and stall, get out and fix an engine. ... [u]you may also run-out of fuel. [/u]
You can also customize you license plate and colour the whole car.
When drive away with snow - it will gradually melt. But no shooting from a car. Errr...

[h1]4) Cops! [/h1]
They will chase you by two factors: 
a) if witnessed committing a crime in cloth, they run after until you change it. 
b) If spotted stealing a car, driving one in a wanted outfit - its license plate instantly becomes wanted, be sure to change few numbers in a garage. 
[u]The higher wanted level (4 stars max), the quicker they will spot you in a car in a wanted cloth.[/u]
Funny enough, you can hide in covers, behind cars and they lose interest:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2376902031

Oh, police also wants to fine you after a collision or speeding. The later somewhat inconsistent: driving above limits in a city is fine, driving within max on a motorway - is not. Eh?

[h1]5) Optimization.[/h1]
[b]Overall - very smooth and runs perfectly. Nothing game-breaking. [/b] Yay!
However, experienced minor graphical glitches: NPCs walking through textures, blurry faced, or.. this thing D:

[h3](Spoiler-Free Review)[/h3]
[b]Mafia II Definitive Edition[/b] (M2DE) is a remastered edition of the original Mafia II from 2010, set in Empire Bay in a timeframe spanning from 1940s to late 1950s. The game narrates the story of Vito Scaletta, an Italian immigrant which, along with his family, migrated to the USA to find a better life. The protagonist's early years are riddled with difficulties (as most immigrants faced back then), so at some point Vito starts small-time criminal activities - not knowing that this decision will change his destiny forever.

üü© [b]The Good Side[/b]
[list]

[*][b]Can almost smell the gasoline![/b]
The atmosphere and setting of 1940s and 50s are recreated beautifully in Mafia II. Empire Bay proves to be a vibrant, beautiful city - even more so in this remastered version with its updated visuals. Immersion is solid, as citizens will react realistically: for instance, by assaulting Vito after he scratched their car. There is a decent interaction level with the environment (such as buying hot dogs from a cart, for example). Music, mannerisms and ways of speaking are coherent with the times (even Italian ones: I can tell being one myself). Those seeking immersive settings will not be disappointed.

[*][b]Fear & loathing in Empire Bay[/b]
The storyline delivers everything expected by a high-tier criminal drama: violence, betrayals, loss - but also good times, sex, booze, gambling, luxury. Mafia II successfully shows how some people are not driven to criminal life by being inherently evil, but rather by sheer necessity (as in Vito's case) - while in other instances, the opposite can be also seen. The characters are well developed, especially those closer to the protagonist, which have some extent of growth as the years go by. Definitely a solid story with characters matching its quality, that does not betray the franchise's legacy.

[*][b]Not quite over yet[/b]
Mafia II offers a good chunk of additional DLC modes, all included in the Definitive version. ""Jimmy's Betrayal"" and ""Vendetta"" both trace the story of a famed hitman that served all the biggest families - while ""Joe's Adventures"" is a series of missions featuring one of the most important side-characters of the main story. Depending on completion rate, there may be even 10+ hours of content in these ""expansions"", which is almost as much as the main game. However, don't expect great differences in terms of gameplay from any of them.
[/list]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2388511191

üü• [b]The Bad Side[/b]
[list]

[*][b]What's the point, then?[/b]
This second entry in the series tries to expand gameplay by adding side activities, such as reselling stolen cars or robbing shops, in order to make extra cash to spend. Other than that, it adds a more ""interactive"" city framework, with gun shops, clothiers, mechanics and more each with their specific function or sales inventory. While these shops can be useful at times, the side chores can be completely overlooked: the main story will always provide more than enough cash for all the guns, ammo, upgrades and clothes one would ever wish for.

[*][b]I never asked for this...[/b]
Certain fights and situations in the main story are unfair or poorly designed. For instance, in some cases combat will start with Vito standing in the middle of a room like a target dummy - on higher difficulties, it's only up to luck if he'll make it to the closest cover in time or not. This can indeed be frustrating. The worst instance is found in a specific chapter, where an enemy can spam unlimited molotovs at the protagonist, making that one a very badly designed fight. Car chases deserve a negative mention: at times the car's frame seems to not shield Vito from bullets at all, making it very RNG dependent.

[i]It took me around 12 hours to complete Mafia II's main storyline. After that, for those interested, three Extra Modes are available, which add around 5-9 hours of content in total depending on completion. For 30‚Ç¨ and with overall good quality the selling point is fair enough, so I can recommend buying this game for full price especially to fans of the franchise.[/i]

[h1]In-Depth Breakdown[/h1]
üéÆ [b]Gameplay Analysis[/b]
Gameplay is divided into Exploration, Combat, Quests and Character Management.

[b]Exploration[/b]
Is performed by car over long distances, on foot in closed spaces and vehicle-free areas. Being Mafia II a linear adventure, exploration can only be done in-between those mission phases that have no time limits (most of them). Exploring the world has not a real point, save for finding achievement-related collectibles or exotic cars to add to one's garage. In each story-related location it's possible to hand around a bit more and talk with side characters for some extra lore, find some eatery to restore HP or go to a clothing shop to get changed (which can be done to evade police identification).

[b]Combat[/b]
Plays out in a rather arcade third-person shooter fashion, with Vito being able to carry a true arsenal of weapons in his pockets - ranging from pistols to military grade rifles and even grenades. Weapon handling and damage are quite realistic especially on hard difficulty, with 2-3 shots being all it takes to kill both Vito and most enemies. Headshots are a guaranteed kill on any living thing without exceptions, as it should be. Vehicles prove to be extremely resistant to damage, unless shot in the fuel intake valve or other weakspots. Melee combat is also a thing and uses dodge, counters and heavy / light attack systems to form a simplistic but enjoyable alternative to guns - just don't bring fists to a gun fight.

[b]Quests[/b]
Are mostly related to the main story, and have good variety. Sometimes, special criteria may be in place such as stealth section where being discovered triggers a game over, undercover car chases and other unique situations depending on the case.

[b]Character Management[/b]
Is performed at shops and home. In the former, Vito is able to buy guns, ammo, clothes and upgrade cars depending on the shop type, while the latter is used to restore HP (fridge food) or change owned clothes (wardrobe). A handy garage with a cap of 10 cars is available to collect the fastest rides one can find, each customizable and moddable to some extent.

There's no denying almost all textures look better. I run both the classic and this remaster at 4K and the classic definitely has some ugly PS3 textures left over on fences, some buildings, sidewalk textures, etc. This remaster takes care of most of that and makes the textures up to current standards. I also appreciate the enhanced snow on the ground as before it just looked like a sidewalk painted white. I'm on a POS AMD 8350 and I can still run the game at 4K/60fps for the most part. So the performance isn't atrocious if I can run it with a decade old processor. 

There are some Nvidia Physx issues: I noticed if you turn Physx OFF, Vito's character will have the cloth physics applied to his clothes. But if you turn them ON, he doesn't. It's like they screwed up when they remastered it and somehow coded it backwards. I would say just run with it off to get Vito's cloth Physx to work but then you don't get the enhanced grass/vegetation which are almost required since the grass with Physx off is straight up the flat 2D PS3 texture. So it's a shame they never patched to correct for that. 

Other than that, for a free game, I'm happy. If you didn't own the original Mafia II and are considering purchasing this, perhaps it's worth it on a sale and not full price. I don't think the remaster and it's content are worth what they're asking, as much as I love the game.",1612748570,1612748570,True,2,0,0.549363970756530762,0,True,False,False

Story 9/10: You play as Vito Scaletta, a wannabe gangster and aid and get aid from and to your best friend Joe Barbaro who has been 
there for you for your whole life. You will experience so much together. So much indeed. The city is Empire Bay. Real life New York. So many opportunities, the American dream as they say. Will you accomplish that dream and so many other dreams that Vito has? How will Vito's story end?

Graphics 7/10: Not that much improvement overall. Some of the textures were upgraded. Better lighting and facial structures of the main and sub-characters. Mostly, it's the same look from the Classic version. But of course there are bugs, glitches and lower fps and game performance with this game. 30 fps near many areas, even on strong rigs. The developers might fix these issues sometime in the future.

Gameplay 8/10: The driving mechanics are so realistic! You won't find the GTA driving style here. The driving style here is a more brutal and realistic one, I would say. You get penalties from driving fast or not driving carefully from the cops. The shooting gameplay is rather simple. The weapons are rather impressive. I Like their design and sounds. As I stated above, the gameplay is open word so you can kinda explore and collect collectibles, only this can you do though. The game has achievements also, always a plus in my book, just like the classic version. Sadly, no more stuff beyond the main story missions and collectibles were added.

Soundtrack 6/10: I wouldn't say that I am intrigued or surprised by the soundtrack, only the main theme puts me on chills. Some scenes have a powerful track out on them while others don't. Kinda a miss or hit or done by purpose.

DLC (3 in total) 5/10: Filler in my opinion. With the DE you get all of the DLC with the main game of course, so no losing here, you can play them or not, if you are an achievements hunter like myself you need to complete these and miscellaneous achievements that you can only obtain by playing the DLC's. All the DLC's have a timer on every mini-mission and you have a limited time given in order to complete the missions and do some extra work for the achievements (e.g Drifting daddy 'o', millionaire etc). The best one is Joe's s Adventures which covers the time gap on what joe did after a crucial point in Vito's life.
In Jimmy's Vendetta, well you guessed it: Jimmy's Vendetta!
And The Betrayal of Jimmy: Betrayal. In addition to these, you get various car and outfit themed DLC's and exclusive outfits from past mafia games to the most recent ones. (E.g. The Mafia III protagonist can wear Mafia II's protagonist's clothes and drive his car and so on)

Overall 9/10: This is a nice addition to your Steam Library in general especially if you are a Mafia fan, have already completed the Classic Mafia 2 game, the story, the achievements etc or even a newcomer who wants to try a Mafia game and also get all the dlc included in the price and not independently. Then this game is for you. 100 %

Thank you hangar 13 for giving us another chance at completing the game again from the start, obtaining all the achievements, enjoying the game with a fresh look and of course giving it for free to the Mafia 2 Classic owners like myself!

P.S:

+ Heavily story driven
+ Chapter Base Progression 
+ Collectibles Playboy Magazines (Hint: While embarking on Chapters be sure to explore for hidden Playmates) achievements as story progresses 
+ Third person shooter (In my opinion, very fluid over the shoulder shooter)
+ Cover systems okay
+ Tunable cars (Old School music from the 30's - 50's to drive you nutts)
+ Graphics are okay for 2021, but could be better 
+ An array of weapons to choose from
+ Running over citizens with your rigged quite fun (warning police will give chase)
+ Selectable clothing to suite your taste 


- Not true open world
- No game plus once completed 
- Multi Player non existent 
- Enemies are not shown on mini map  
- Exploration/Side quest are non existent 
- Police AI are freaking dumb ass hell
- A rehaul like Mafia in terms of graphics would of been nice
- The AI for the citizens inhabiting the city could better
- Physical combat can be better
- Can't line up citizens against city buildings and or wall and mow them down
- Gentle Mens Club sucks considering the nude collectibles magazines.  
- Can't enter any other buildings unless its story driven or shopping attire 
- The weather system could be better

Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is a good game that has a series of flaws nothing gamebreak, but bothersome when we are talking of a remaster of a 10 year old game. The story makes up for most of the problems.

Random game crashes as early as the title sequence.
Control sticks not working when loading a game.
At one point I had an intense cinematic moment that wouldn't trigger until I ran backwards through a level to kill some cops who were politely hanging out in a stairwell, doing me no harm.
Really easy stuff to playtest was just let through to the final version.

Controls are quite different from the definitive edition of Mafia 1 which seems insane and annoying. Somehow Mafia 1 has superior graphics and gameplay. Mafia 1 also does a better job of displaying the controls clearly in the HUD as you go. 

Audio issues - specific characters have white noise in the background. Crap recording work.
Enjoy the audio masterpiece of two characters having a conversation with the exact same voice
Scenes of people eating, complete with actual mouth open chewing noises (why would you do this?)

Mafia 1 has much better face mapping, and all round the graphics and world are much better. And it handles much better on PC too. Frame rates here aren't what they ought to be.

If it's a choice between Mafia 1 and 2. Go with 1. You'll have a much better time.

""You know something, Carlo? For the last 10 years, all I done was kill. I killed for my country, I killed for my family, I killed anybody that got in my way. But this one? This one's for me"" (Vito Scaletta).  An action-adventure game and a sequel to Mafia game, Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is the remake of the 2010 Mafia 2 game.  While worse than Mafia 1 Definitive Edition (that had a great story, great gameplay and better graphics), Mafia 2 Definitive Edition may be a choice for the fans of the series, provided they did not play the original game. Good-buy if on sale.

[h1] INFO [/h1]
- This review is a personal opinion. Try the game for yourself.
- Game was played on max graphics setting and ultrawide resolution.
- This is the definitive, remastered edition of the game and includes all 3 DLCs.
- I did not play the original 2010 game.
- The plot takes place a decade after the Mafia game setting, in the fictional city of Empire Bay during the 1940s‚Äìearly 1950s and follows the life of the Sicilian immigrant Vito Scaletta and his story of climbing the Mafia family ladder, with both larger reward and consequence.
- You can steal and drive any vehicle (including trucks), you can kill anyone (except companions).
- Visit body shops to repair, personalize cars and enhance their performance.
- In comparison with Mafia 1, this game uses a handbrake to help car make tight turns at high speeds.
- You can make use of cash to bribe police and you can use phone booths to call-in a bribe and lose your red wanted status.
- Make use of cover very often (press CTRL near walls or obstacles), it is an essential mechanic of shooting gameplay in this game.
- Obviously, the proper order to play the games is Mafia, Mafia 2, Mafia 3, not the release order (Mafia Definitive was released after Mafia 2 Definitive and Mafia 3 Definitive Editions). Mafia  Definitive Edition remains by far the best game of the remastered series.

[h1] PROS [/h1]
- An open-world design of a large city with parts modeled on New York City, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago, along 19 story chapters plus prologue (15 chapters from base game and 4 more story chapters from DLC), featuring remastered graphics and real-time generated cutscenes. A narrative about family, loyalty, betrayal and greed, a decent story about Mafia.
- The story starts quite slow-paced and you may say even uninteresting, but it gets a lot better at the end of Chapter 5.
- Nice atmosphere and design, a beautiful city and around 50 famous drivable and upgradable epoch vehicles.
- Good soundtrack (and car radio music from the era).
- Good optimization, high fps count.
- Some collectibles (Playboy magazines and Wanted posters) for completionists.

[h1] CONS [/h1]
- Partial ultrawide support (although real-time generated not pre-rendered, cutscenes are pillarboxed).
- The story ends abruptly and very unsatisfying.
- The lack of manual save (the game saves only at the beginning of story missions and at certain checkpoints) may create problems when you and exit the game without starting a new story mission (unless you managed to reach a checkpoint, everything will be gone when you restart the game).
- The remastered graphics do not look quite 2020, some textures and the cutscenes still look old and face animations are not the best around, not much of an improvement over the 2010 original game. Mafia 1 Definitive Edition looks a lot better than this one.
- No side missions available.
- The DLCs are not much of a content. The first 2 DLCs deal with a guy named Jimmy, without any connection with the main story. The third DLC (Joey's Adventures) is about Vito's friend Joe and should have been either part of the base game or deleted.
- Very few bugs, but they are still a thing.
- Cars get damage extremely easy. The fact that you have to repair cars very often (and refuel them), along with feeding your character to recover health is too old style and just a gameplay filler.
- Map directions can be confusing when showing inside doors or building entrances.
- You must dress again every single time you get up from bed (and you must go to bed to progress to the next chapter).
- Gameplay is a bit boring, around 60% of the time you will be driving in traffic (and compared to Mafia 1 Definitive Edition, here you cannot skip driving). Some of the missions are just a waste of time, you must drive around town to sell stamps or cigarettes or whatever. The gameplay also combines too many styles and requirements (shooting, brawling, stealth action, racing, adventure, cars management, evading police, etc.) resulting a GTA kind of mix with Yakuza-like character management (health, weapons, ammo and money). This inconsistency in gameplay actions can become annoying for some players.
- The lock-picking feature is also just a gameplay filler (most of the time I used Q to smash car's windows). You can make good use of it only to lock-pick a few of building doors and cars and one safe-box in the story.

""this one's a toss up for me. On one hand, this is a beautiful game full of great atmosphere and charm alongside some true gangster grit. On the other hand, it took me less than 15 hours to finish this game and I feel like 90% of that were cut scenes. If you do end up purchasing this, make sure you play on the hardest setting to get your money's worth.""

Now, with the Definitive Edition I played on Hard and finished even quicker this time around. I can't really comment on what's been improved but there have been some visual and audio glitches in the game which shouldn't have been possible with an upgraded version. Other than that, I think I quite possibly enjoyed the game even more this time because I was expecting to play it for the story not for the idea that this might be another GTA clone which was my original thinking going into the original. Again, the cars, the atmosphere, the music... everything lent itself to some great story telling and, if you are a fan of gangster flicks and are okay with a good amount of cut scenes and driving, then this is a game for you. If you own the original Mafia II you will have been gifted the Definitive Edition at no extra charge which is super nice of the developers.",1611114446,1611114446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mafia 2 is just awful. It is so much worse than the first one.

Even the buttons to use are annoying, for example its LB to run and jump and look back in a car, just doesn't make sense. 

While on missions following an AI the AI will walk into things, and even get stuck. I will be driving and no pedestrians or cars will spawn. All this just in an hour of playing the game.

What bothers me about this game is that This ""Definite edition"" looks barely better than the original, while Mafia ""1"" was completely remade and looks stunning.
Also, not all models are better. Some side characters still look bad. In once cutscene for example, two guys on screen at the same time look like they're from different games because one is washed out and lowpoly, while the other has visible skin pores.

Good enough that buying the remastered edition felt like the most obvious thing to do. Having said that,it isn't just the game that has been ""remastered"" it is the bugs as well.
Pros:-
1. It is Mafia 2. There isn't much to be said. 
2. Textures have been ""updated"".
Cons:-
1. ""Stunning HD detail"" - I don't know about stunning. Sub par at best.
2. Glitching meshes, vanishing assets.
3. The game as it is doesn't age well. After playing modern titles a lot of the gameplay mechanics leave a lot to be desire.
4. There are certain areas where FPS will drop to sub 30 [even on a RTX 3080]. Seems to be a PhysX issue that was present in the original as well.

Cosmetically it looks great, it's been seriously overhauled in those terms. It might not be on par with other 2020 releases but overall its a vast improvement on the original. It honestly feels like all the effort (if any) that was put into this 'remaster' was cosmetic. From a technical stand point this game feels more dated than the classic.

Mechanically it's dog shit, there are so many bugs and a few proper game breaking ones; twice I had to restart a whole chapter because I literally couldn't progress as a result of either guys not spawning in that I 'had' to kill or because NPC's dialogue wouldn't trigger.

The AI is simultaneously the smartest and dumbest in existence. Enemies can blind fire from cover but you cant. They know when you are aiming at them so if you try and hold the angle till they peek they never will, that is if they don't kill you when you are about to peek. 

The peek animation for you is so slow that (combined with them clearly knowing you're about to peek) means they will literally peek out of cover like the road runner on speed while you are still in the middle of the animation and gun you down. Rather than duck behind cover while being shot at they will literally tank your bullets and shoot back at you which usually results in your death before theirs. Other times they will literally just rush you and 1. You can't shoot from cover without peeking, so in order to shoot the guy thats now broken past the defence line you need to stand up/out of cover in order to shoot him thus exposing your back to any other enemies 2. Shooting them a second time can sometimes interrupt their stagger animation so thus they can snap back to shooting you like they had a brief moment of alzheimers and forgot they were in a fire fight, except they remembered they were some sort of sniper elite James McAvoy type in war and shoot you with ridiculous accuracy even though their gun is facing the opposite direction.

There is also a little Sam Fisher in them as you will often walk into a room with 0 indication that there are enemies hiding, walk past a box and get shot in the back by the guy hiding behind it, im not sure if they were already there or if the game is literally spawning enemies behind me. 

The destruction of cover is really cool looking with tiny little fragments of the wall you are hiding behind getting blown towards the camera, makes me feel like I'm saving private Ryan. It also means you become exposed to bullets the longer you hide behind cover. This would be cooler if the same thing applied to the AI. On several occasions I had blown their cover to shit, can quite clearly see their head through it but shooting at it just sparks off like they are iron men!

Playing on hard was more about repetition than anything, playing the time loop game of triggered sequences i.e. when a grenade will be thrown and counting how many enemies are in a room so i dont run into the issues above. 

In terms of story it's ok, not as great as i remember. Its very linear and most chapters are 1 'mission'. It gives the illusion of open world but really there is almost nothing else to do other than the story, the only time i every really explored the open world was to get collectables/other achievements. 

The characters are pretty flat in terms of personality, it seems like the are all rehearsing for the same background role in goodfellas 'Angry Italian American #2', I found myself constantly forgetting who any of the people were the main character kept referring to outside of Joe & Leo. 

Overall its ruined any nostalgia I had for Mafia 2 classic. Mostly becuase the mechanics feel dated which suggests they've just taken the coding from the original slapped some flex tape on it and called it a day. Although I could be wrong the original might be every bit as great as I remember but honestly I'm too lazy to find out. 

I think i got this free for owning the classic version, which is the way it should be. Buy the classic and get this puttanata free!

TL;DR buy this if you enjoyed the original and it's going for somewhere around 5 bucks. Otherwise get the original its probably better",1610461363,1610462013,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

...is a odd way to start a negative review, I admit. Mafia II is in itself a really amazing game. Lovely story, lovely characters, a great city, lots of variety, small details and also great music.

So why do I not recommend it?

I have played Mafia II (Classic), which was the game that one could purchase before such a thing as a 'Definitive Edition' existed. While playing Classic, I had close to 0 bugs, that I found odd or noticeably distracted me from playing the game.

However, since Mafia I got a Definitive Edition, which for that game makes perfect sense and I think is great, the developers wanted to make some extra money and made two other Definitive Editions for the 2nd and 3rd game. 

I kid you not that this so called Defintive Edition made this game worse than it was before. 

I encountered graphical glitches, repeating dialogue, repeating dialogue, and in the 14th chapter even a gamebreaking bug (I could not enter Bruno's at the very end of the level), forcing me to replay the entire chapter, which was by far also the longest, which sucked a lot. Based on the community reaction, these bugs have popped up for a lot of people. None of those bugs were in the old edition.

I also argue that the Classic edition looked as gorgeous as the Definitive Edition, therefore there is no major upgrade there.

I received this game for free, as did all owners of the Classic Edition, which is a nice gesture, but if one does not have the game and is considering it, 30 Dollars is a rip-off. One could have obtained the Classic Edition before this Edition for much less and it would be better.

I will change this review, if the developers do care about the game and take care of the well-known bugs.

edit: there are basically no checkpoints during missions, the game is like 6 hours long, my other 7 hours was from dying at the last part of the mission and having to restart the mission mulitple times, i over looked all the visual glicthes but why isnt there any male playboy like smh",1610136359,1610136807,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This was and still is my favourite game of all time just because of the story and simple yet remarkable mechanics the game has to offer. 

When I saw the screenshots of the definitive edition I was disappointed at first and wished for a bigger overhaul, but now after spending 10 hours completing the main story and driving around selling cars I am happier with this outcome than I would be with the kind of the graphical improvement Mafia 1 is getting. This style of a ""remaster"" was one of the greatest things that could happen to a 10 year old game that still looked incredible 5 years ago. Except of the few graphical improvements everything has stayed the same and thank God for that. 

The story has to be the biggest selling point of Mafia 2. It was such a blast replaying some of the most remarkable moments I have experienced in gaming story wise. The incredible and most loved characters like Joe and Vito have a huge impact on why the game is so brilliant story wise. Mostly all of the missions were unique and interesting but have to say the follow missions were a pain in the ass especially because of the speed limit we are forced to obey. I'm not going to spoil the ending but the cliff hanger it leaves on is so well done and thought out it had me shook and made me want to find out more about the story and find an answer to the question the game leaves us with. The overall amount of time it took me to finish the story was about 8 hours which makes more sense as the missions are unique. This is better than Mafia 3 where they extended the story by 10 hours just making the player do the same thing over and over again. I haven't completed all of the DLC content but I am planning to in the near future which will extend the playtime without making the game boring as shit. 

The difficulty level is somewhat challenging even on medium as you don't have much health and the enemies use automatic weapons which could kill you just in a few shots. The game wasn't frustrating because of it but made it more fun and a bit of a challenge which I really enjoyed. 

I experienced some minor bugs and glitches but most were rare and mostly were related to character's faces and clothes. I experienced an optimisation issue which was sudden frame drops which should not happen when using the hardware I use. Some were caused by automatic v-sync which was turned on for some reason but for some stutters I couldn't see why they were happening as they even happened when I tried playing the game on low settings. 

In conclusion, this is a must-play for anyone who has any interest in this genre not only in video games but also movies. If it wasn't for the DLC i wouldn't recommend buying the game for the full price but for all the DLC content and the main story paying ¬£25 is a bargain. Personally, I can't wait what Mafia 1 is going to offer after finishing this game. Now I can truly say this is still one of my favourite games of all time.",1590692665,1610047617,True,4,0,0.526242911815643311,2,True,False,False

The check points are horridly spaced out. They are so far apart that you dare not go exploring during a mission lest you crash or something occur and you have to replay the last 10 minutes of a mission again. Coulda been easily fixed by adding a few more checkpoints.

There are so many police in the game. I understand it's not GTA and I appreciate that but it's a crime game - you can't commit crimes because of all the police. Also the traffic fines are ridiculous - someone hits you and you are charged with hit and run...ugh. Thankfully, they aren't as aggressive as the police in GTA so theyre more of a nuisance. 

There's lots of driving in the game and it looks beautiful but the one issue is there's no option to just explore. You're always in mission mode. The only time I ever drove around and explored was right at the beginning of a mission save that way I wouldn't loose too much progress.

One particularly frustrating thing about this game is the checkpoint saving. There's no option to save the game whenever you want (unless to take the time to drive all the way home and sleep in your bed, which is the only ""manual"" method for saving). 

This is frustrating because the checkpoint saves can be 20-40 minutes apart which means if a mission fails for any reason, you're having to redo the same stuff over and over, which personally drives me nuts. It feels like a giant waste of time when most games will let you quick save, but not this one. The AI also occasionally does dumb things which cause mission failure regardless of anything you do.

Bottom line. This is a fun buy on sale game.

The game touts an open-world but there's not really anything to do in it. The game's story is told in chapters and there are no side quests or activities to do in the meanwhile. At least not from what I saw. Given that this game is heavily focused on story, the game should have just moved from one setting to another. There is no point in the open-world and it just felt like it was there to extend the time that someone would play the game.

I recommend this game only because I enjoyed my time with the story, but I see no reason to replay any of it or even drive around in the city.",1609231040,1609231040,True,22,7,0.674281954765319824,0,True,False,False

The storyline, characters, and atmosphere is all the same game I loved, but man do I have some complaints.

In this remastered version, there are plenty of bugs to be handed out, I've experienced faces glitching out, terrible AI, and one game breaking bug ill go deeper into.

     ¬ªThe bug I experienced was in the mission were you are going to the hotel job with Joe, and for some reason the door wasn't opening, he just kept closing it on me to where I couldn't exit the apartment. After restarting the mission multiple times the door finally broke where I could go through, and you can see this in the clip here.
https://youtu.be/Ms7n0UYnr-U

     ¬ªNow for the AI, I have noticed some changes, they seem to be more dumbfounded and unresponsive than I recall, I will be driving and a random civilian will jump into the middle of the road in front of my car, the police don't show up when I rob a store like they do in the original, I can just endlessly rob stores and make money without any consequence, and the police AI was just acting terrible in comparison to the original game. Now for gunfights, the AI just run towards you when in cover, shoot you twice, and kill you, last time I remember they don't all just rush you to where you can't do anything, and it ruined the best gunfights in the game for me.

     ¬ªOther than that I have no other complains, still the same old Mafia I love, I have alot of patience so the bugs weren't a huge issue for me, just the new AI bugs me whenever something happens like I described. 

Overall I would give this game a 3/5. Although it is a great game these bugs and the way the AI act now should've been fixed before the release, and it's still happening now that this remaster has been out a couple months. For $15 bucks you can't go wrong especially with the DLC included. Still just disappointed in how the release was rushed.",1609134379,1609134379,True,3,1,0.540581941604614258,0,True,False,False

Nostalgic portrayal of italian family, with emotional involvement.
Fantastic soundtrack.
Real comedy with some ""lol"" moments.

Be sure to crank up all the visuals to max, enable all video improvements, and use smaa.

Don't expect much change with the Definitive edition its the same game with very small improvements and some how buggier than i remember. The story is what shines in this game, well voice acted characters with a well written story that keeps you engaged. The gameplay Is kinda repetitive, in the game there is a bunch of sections where you will have to do a lot of driving and with me having the option to skip driving sequences in the remake of the first then coming back to this game it was a bit tedious at points but the sections with story dialog its bearable. Gunplay is fun but its outdated and feels a bit clunky at times and within time as you play the game, it gets repetitive at points but you don't notice it as much during the more action oriented parts of the story. The world is well designed for when the game was originally released but with really nothing to do within the map other than the story with no type of free roam or side activities other than going to a shop to buy clothes, going to a weapon shop to buy guns and get ammo or going to the bar to buy some food and getting something to eat, it feels empty and i wish they would have done more with it to bring a extra level of fun and entertainment to the game. The soundtrack is really good it fits the era of the game with well picked tunes making them driving parts a tad less tedious. I did experience some bugs within my playthrough of the game such as characters disappearing in scenes and audio cut outs at times and characters model glitching out or the occasional clothing stretching out during game play or cinematics making the characters look weird at times, small stuff that didn't ruin my overall experience. (i don't know if you will have this happen when you play but wanted to mention it anyways) also i would suggest turning of the apex physics option in the video setting cause i would get frame drops in some areas of the game with a lot of physics based stuff happening other than that when i turned it off it ran smoothly. over all i enjoyed the game despite the repetitive parts and the small amount of bugs i encountered.

Constant clipping, dialouge and character failures, t-posing enemies who will stand still and then one shot you immediatley once you get close. The AI is the worst I've seen in a video game in a long time. Cars will TRY to run you off the road and the cop ""speeding"" feature is so stupid.

Main story is wrote pretty well and there is a lot of fun to be had in the main story. As far as the DLC, its kinda poo poo. Jimmy's betrayal is just arcade style missions, go here, beat up that guy, wreck these shops, etc, and Joe's adventures is the same thing aside from a few key story missions. The other DLC story I cant speak on because I haven't bothered to play it and I haven't bothered finishing up the other DLC stories either. Overall its a real nice game and since you get the 3 DLC's together with the definitive edition it doesn't matter too much that they stink since you do not pay extra for them.

You can shoot while driving in GTA 4, and Scarface: the world is yours, and those games came out before Mafia 2, hell you can even shoot while driving in the original version of Mafia 1.  There's no good reason Vito can't shoot while driving, especially since he was in the army and at least had more experience with shooting than Tommy Angelo.  Tommy was pretty much a cab driver, before joining the mob and he can shoot while driving, so why not Vito? Second, they REALLY, REALLY need to work on the checkpoints in the game.  If you die sometimes you can get sent way back.  Like I lost a fight with Frankie's Husband and instead of me starting where I died or at the very least in the apartment, they really made me have to drive all the way there and go all the way up the apartment again.  Then there was getting killed in a head on collision after chasing the mob guy in the car, and then they made me have to watch the same part over again where Vito enters the Irish bar and hearing the guys who burned down his house talk about how he got away for the umpteenth time.  The least they could have done was start the chase all over again, and not have me go through the dialog and the gun fight all over again.  Third, the control scheme is a little out of whack.  if you're using an Xbox One controller, B more often than not is reload, but for some dumb reason they had right bumper reload.  Third, while most of the story was good, the ending was rather anti-climactic because it felt unfinished.  I'm sure there's probably more story in the DLC, but if I were to play this before I know there would be DLC, then i'd say this ending was very badly written.

I'm trying to find the distinct area's where you improved the game beyond bloating from 7gb to 36gb.

Update: December(ish) 2020 - the game still to me isn't better than the classic with a few graphics/audio mods. While *some* performance improvments have happened today's hardware can run the classic maxed out and the physics look great for the time. I truly wish they would just release tools to let the community toss in better textures/models since obviously the update has higher poly count for a few things.

Reviewing this in 2020 as the DE version, it's surprisingly limited in terms of the AI of 'background' characters (just jumping out in front of your car, for instance), it doesn't feel all too 'open' really - the story is pretty much linear, the game is also relatively short (do not expect anything ANYWHERE NEAR GTAV) which I didn't recall it being so but back then it was probably fine, though there is still a good 12-20 hours worth in there.
It does also have a bit too much 'filler' in there when it comes to tedious tasks and should you fail at any point it is likely to throw you back further than seems right at times.
On hard difficulty, it's challenging but not overly so, though losing the police seems a bit too easy still.
Graphically, it looks good, but it does have some glitches - one terrible case of this is with Leo [spoiler]at the end of the game while you are riding in the car with him, his eyes are like a dog looking upwards[/spoiler] which is embarrassingly bad that it made it through ANY kinda of QA process.
The music, voice acting, and all that jazz is superb - it really gives it the right feels in all regards.
[spoiler]It also has one of THE great call-backs in gaming history, imo, when you get to see old Tommy Angelo once again, truly loved seeing that again[/spoiler]

I'd recommend this game still, for sure, but it has to be said - it has it's flaws, mostly just graphical glitches - but it's still as good a Mafia game as anything else out there, though in terms of content it's maybe around 5% of what you get with GTA V, as a comparison.

Better than most stuff.

Sure, its got some strange bugs, glitchy facial expressions and some of the achievements don't work (note how I've completed the game but somehow didn't get the achievements for completing certain chapters) but overall the presentation is very good. A lot of hate for the new lighting system, but I personally think Empire Bay at night looks much, much better.

Gunplay is the same, simple, straightforward and satisfying. Driving is fun and varied, and incredibly unforgiving.

Mafia II is short, but the attention to detail throughout the game is insane - from hubcaps rolling off your car when driving erratically, your car getting dirtier the more you drive in the snow, to the way the citizens of the city start the game not knowing who you are, to them knowing exactly who you are. Memorable levels, memorable chapters, memorable characters.

Wasn't a big fan of Mafia 3 imo, so when I heard this was getting remastered I shat my pants in excitement.  I always thought this needed a proper remaster, and boy was I wrong. The only reason I'm giving it a positive review was solely so I could relive this game again,  other than that this game is one gigantic clusterfuck of a  mess. They claim that they've fixed it via patching, but I find that to be absolute bullshit. I don't know if this has happened to anyone else but whenever I would  drive  little bits and pieces of stutter would happen occasionally. Don't get me started on the major fps drops whenever you get into gunfights, it is literally miserable as fuck. So yeah this is probably the longest review, I've made on a game lmao. So would I say it's worth buying the remastered version? No I don't think it's worth it, if anything you're better off playing the classic version instead.

The gameplay is not too impressive as well, it does however have a certain feeling to it that other games don't have, being searched by the police is more intense yet realistic compared to similar games and driving feels much more real.

First off I want to say, I really prefer remasters and do not like complete remakes so that is a positive. Mafia II is a pretty decent game and the remaster does look [i]slightly[/i] better than the original but they actually downgraded a lot of things.
[list]
    [*]There are lots of weird flickering/artifacting graphical glitches that I have never seen in the original version
    [*]PhysX does not work like the original, suggesting that they might have ported over a console version instead of upgrading the original PC version
    [*]You can no longer switch the speedometer units to metric. It is bugged. This is minor but still... this wasn't a problem with the classic version of the game
    [*]The draw distance is really short. I am pretty sure it was also short in the original version but it seems like that is something they could have easily improved.

For those who haven't played it, Mafia II is set in the 1940s and 1950s Empire Bay (New York) and tells a Goodfellas-esque story of the consequences of mob life. The Mafia series is more story driven, but Mafia II's semi-open world is the most detailed of any of the Mafia games, with the ability to rob stores, make phone calls, and the many buttons around to push. While not as detailed as GTA, Mafia II's attention to detail and realism elements are the most extensive in the Mafia series, like getting gas for cars, open/close car trunks, light switches on/off, food/drinks to replenish health, get drunk, snow collecting and falling off car roofs when parked/moving, etc. All these details make the world feel really alive. Mafia II has the best law enforcement system in a crime game, including police recognition of outfits and license plates, both of which can be purchased and changed, as well as being issued tickets for traffic violations small crimes rather then the police shooting every time you are wanted. Collectibles like the nude women of the Playboy magazines scattered throughout the world that remind me of my youth. The characters are incredibly likable, the story is fantastic, the 40s/50s music on the radio is great, and the gameplay is a lot of fun.  

As a Definitive Edition from the classic, not much has changed but the graphics. The world is much more detailed texture wise, and everything looks a lot better overall. The game settings can be altered for higher frame rates as well. Nothing new is added to the game at all, not even a free ride mode which the game really lacks and Mafia 1: DE got, which is extremely disappointing. On top of that, there are many bugs and glitches with the graphics, like grass popping in and out and people's eyes getting stuck in one direction, frame rate drops, and crashes. There are also many weird changes like character eye-color, haircuts, and some cutscene NPC face models. 

Mafia II: DE comes with all three DLC. Joe's Adventures fills in some gaps from the main story and is fun to play as a great character. This DLC has its own cutscenes and has a less linear gameplay with missions scattered across the map, and many unique missions different from story objectives. The other two DLCs are about a new character named Jimmy that is unrelated to Mafia II's story. It is more of Joe's DLC but with less of a story and more unique missions. There is a lot of driving in the DLC, probably to drag it out, and it gets annoying over time. There is little interest in playing as Jimmy due to the lack of a proper story and alternate timeline, but it makes for a good ""free ride"" mode without the mod.

The Definitive Edition of Mafia II is definitely a weird package in the trade-offs regarding better graphics for more glitches and annoying changes, but the best part is that buying Mafia II also gives you a copy of Mafia II Classic for free, so either one or both can be played. Players who had Mafia II Classic before DE came out also received a free upgrade, which was very generous of the developers. Whichever copy of Mafia II is used, this game is a must-play for anyone who hasn't played it before, and a great excuse to play it again.",1603946053,1605974110,True,3,0,0.550344109535217285,0,True,False,False

The game itself is absolutely great. Really loved it.
But I can't really see how Definitive this edition is. All I noticed is that facial textures are better but everything else is pretty much the same. Besides the game is even buggier than the original one. I wouldn't recommend it if you played the original game because there is really not much of a difference. But if you are new to it, buy it on sale and it'll definitely worth it.

Sadly so much things have been left unpolished or fixed. By so much I mean A LOT. I can't believe it's somehow broken still, even if there was like around 10 Years to fix everything. Just to name a few, there's Vito getting a reverse bowl cut, and there's Beans who got some facial reconstruction in Chapter 9. 

I also stand by everyone's word to say that this is sadly a lazy remaster. You can't tell what were the differences from the original 2010 release to this Definitive Release. I kinda expected it to have Graphics similar to the Definitive Edition of Mafia 1. 

Pretty much the only reason I play it today, it's because my computer can't run the classic Mafia II, now I'm stuck with this lazy remaster.

The gameplay is passable, however it is so repetitive it quickly becomes monotonous and very tedious. 

What looks to be an interesting Open World game set in a rarely featured era, quickly becomes a bore, as the Open World aspect is an illusion, as is choice in your characters actions; if you end up buying this waste of money you'll soon realise as you become frustrated by your character having to do the most stupid shit that no-one in reality ever would, as the game repeatedly drags you kicking and screaming down a narrative one way street. 

The most disappointing thing about this game, is what it could've been with a little more development. It so could have had side quests, more gameplay mechanics, and given the player choice with how they play the game and not treat the customer as a fool. This could've competed with Rockstar open world games with a little more care, however instead they decided to make a cheap imitation, with no open world, character development, choices, varied gameplay and just the worst story I've played in a long time, pretending to be greater than it is.

The story makes it a must play for anyone interested in a classic rendition of the mafia lifestyle.  From rags to riches, so they say; Characters steadily rise in power, but so do the risks that are often associated within organized crime. 

However, the remastered version is but a shadow of its former self.  The first half of the game is for the most part, okay, assuming you can stomach occasional character clipping.  By this I mean sometimes I would see a character's head literally cut in half upon entering in a room (Other players seemed to experience it much more than me) and textures popping in and out.  A perfect example of these textures not cooperating is after walking outside of your apartment you could see the grass throughout the city look like VERY low quality textures. 

I tried the game on high and highest graphical settings, and what I noticed is 95% of the time the grass looked as if it was stuck on the lowest quality, and occasionally its textures would, at the blink of an eye, revert to ultra quality, then quickly back to lowest setting and basically remain there the whole time.  But guess what, when this did happen, you can bet your bottom there was also a performance hit that came with it.

My fps at points was cut to 35 in several areas.  Driving around the city yielded on average just over 100 fps but certain areas performance just tanked. An example of this is in Chapter 13 when you enter a restaurant; in this area, my fps hovered between 30 and 35 up until the chapter finished.  How on earth do you get 100+ fps in an open world with much more going on than inside a small linear building with at most half a dozen characters on screen at one time? On a 3600x and RTX 3070 with 16 gb of memory no less.

For an original release from 2010, its 2020 remaster felt sloppy, rushed and as a returning fan, I can see there was no love poured into it.  Calling this a remaster is doing the original a great disservice. Truly an unoptimized mess which does not look better than the original.  Why? Surely there was no reason to release it half-arsed like this.   Fortunately it was free because I already had Mafia 2 Classic, so I really can't complain but I felt it necessary to offer some insight for those just discovering the game.   Speaking of which, go buy Mafia 2 classic if you can find it for a good price.  Otherwise, wait until this goes dirt cheap and try your luck with it then. Remember, you can always fall back on a refund within 2 hours.  As it stands, I cannot recommend this remaster in any way shape or form.",1604986368,1604987060,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Mafia might just be my favorite video game series of all time, with Mafia: Definitive Edition being on spot number 2 in my personal list of best video games ever!

Mafia II takes place between the 1940s and 1950s in Empire Bay. It looks amazing and it‚Äôs a fun world to explore. Thankfully the story of Mafia II takes you around the city so you‚Äôll be able to explore everything throughout the game. Compared to the first Mafia game, Mafia II gives the player more freedom. It‚Äôs an open world game and between the story missions you are able to explore Empire Bay on your own. In Mafia: Definitive Edition you are continuously following the story, automatically starting the next mission right after you‚Äôve finished the other. I really enjoyed the off-story feeling; being allowed to drive around for fun, rob a store to get some extra cash, and legally buy clothes/weapons in that exact same shop you robbed earlier. After each mission you also have to get home first so you‚Äôre able to get some sleep. This helps a lot to emerge yourself more into the world of a mobster, wondering if you can make it through the night without someone killing you in your own house. It is the mafia of course and you‚Äôll figure out rather quickly that not everyone can be trusted inside this business, even though they seem like your friends.

Driving is a big part of the Mafia games. If you have ever played one before you know their vehicle physics are trying to be realistic. It‚Äôs far from the awful vehicle system in GTA games, which might be the reason why I really dislike the GTA series. While the vehicles are a lot easier to control in Mafia II compared to Mafia: Definitive Edition, it‚Äôll still take quite some time to get used to them. One amazing thing they‚Äôve done in Mafia II is to include different seasons in the game. The first few chapters of the game take place during the winter and the snow/ice makes it a lot more difficult to drive. It‚Äôs such a cool detail, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen it in any other game before. Eventually it‚Äôs summer and the world looks so different, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre in a totally different city. The world looks bright and colorful and makes you eager to explore the same city once again. Now it‚Äôs easier than ever before to drive around in Mafia. No slippery roads, the brakes will actually make you stop now and with this decrease in danger you‚Äôll have no trouble racing through the city with the fastest car in your garage.

I‚Äôm not really into spoiling game content. You‚Äôve got to figure the story out yourself and trust me, it‚Äôs insanely fun to play. My reviews will tell you some gameplay details that I think are important to mention and might make you consider buying this game. I won‚Äôt ever spoil the story of a videogame in a review.

Oh man, what should I even start with‚Ä¶ The game has so much issues. There‚Äôs characters in the game who will sometimes have their face wrapped inside-out, looks terrifying as hell. Other times their arms would stretch around their neck and launch in the air, again; freaky as hell. In a few cutscenes the main character‚Äôs mouth would not move while he was talking. During my playthrough of the DLC I came across a lot of spots with no collision; my character would walk straight into a house or mountain and no, not through a door. Clothing will occasionally clip inside your characters body, especially with longer coats. So I recommend wearing a simple shirt so you won‚Äôt have these weird issues. To continue, the NPC‚Äôs are unable to open doors. They just walk straight into the door and keep walking, and every now and then they‚Äôll try to open the door but it just won‚Äôt budge. They will also keep running in circles when they‚Äôve lost track of your location. Thankfully, in my experience, this wasn‚Äôt all really that bad. Because the game contains quite a lot of comedic moments, these bugs/glitches only made those moments even funnier.

Mafia II: Definitive Editions also includes a bunch of DLC (extra Downloadable Content). The first two packs contain missions for a new character that does not appear in the main storyline. I have to admit those are really awful. Because it‚Äôs a new character who looks too much like the modern hitman and doesn‚Äôt fit in the world of Mafia, I had to quit playing after almost boring myself to death. I also discovered a huge amount of bugs while playing this DLC, already mentioned in the paragraph above.
The third and last DLC pack contains missions for Joe Barbaro, one of the main characters from the story of Mafia II. I Love Joe, one of my favorite video game characters. In the main storyline of Mafia II, there‚Äôs a time gap of quite some years. This DLC fills in what Joe was up to during this time gap and is definitely worth checking out.

So, do I recommend this game? Oh I certainly do. One of the best stories in my video game history. It doesn‚Äôt matter a lot if you play the remaster (Definitive Edition) or the original, both are fun and share the exact same story. The game looks better in the remaster, if it works‚Ä¶ As I mentioned the game is in an awful spot, filled with bugs and glitches. For some people this might break immersion and kill the game for them. I don‚Äôt remember if the original had the same issues, maybe it did and the developers just didn‚Äôt bother fixing it. Make sure you buy the game if it‚Äôs on sale, it‚Äôs worth your time. It took me about 20 hours to finish the story, not bad right?",1602440365,1604588537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

10/10 experience, A Classic, Amazing story.

Things i love: The unforgiving combat (played in medium) you start to think about how you move in combat, that way it gets pretty immersive. I love the way that you never really get to spend your blood money, cause some shit happens, and that's just a clever lecture of how the Mafia life really is. I love the characters, i love the voice acting.

Things i don't love: This definitive edition has some bugged smoke FX, and i fixed that simply by turning off PhysX. The save spots are a tad bit too long, if you make a tiny mistake, you get sent wayyy back, and have to do that 2 minute work over again. Theres a little too much driving.

For someone willing to use even the most simple of mods a modded version of the original is superior in all aspects.  Even comparing both games in their unmodded state the original version is more stable, and there is no excuse for a remaster to be significantly technically worse than the original.  While I was able to get the game to run decently at a frame rate consistently above 30FPS I could only do this by lowering graphical settings to far below what I used in what should be the more technically-demanding Mafia remake.  Furthermore while I played the main story with my only issue being frame rate drops in situations with a lot of explosions or a lot of automatic weapon fire the side content Joe's Adventure regularly crashes on me, and crashes almost every time I am forced to restart a mission (which will be more often than the base game, as all missions in that expansion have time limits that get increasingly strict).

As far as the original goes though again I do recommend it.  Mafia II has one of the finest stories you'll find in an open-world game, and while it doesn't force more cinematic-like pacing like the remake of the first game it still paces itself well and puts the narrative first by having a core narrative completed in order as opposed to tons of side missions.  It still mixes in a small amount of open world benefits like keeping and customizing your cars and having a city that feels a little more alive than the playgrounds of some other titles.  As a part of the trilogy on sale as a package the price is right, but speaking personally I wish I had just re-installed the classic version and modded it up as opposed to playing this version.",1603623783,1603623783,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]‚ñ∂Ô∏èIntroduction[/h1]
Mafia 2 is a third person open world game with a strong emphasis on storytelling. This is the successor of Mafia 1 which was one of the best games of the early 2000s. As we all know by now Mafia 2 was a worthy successor in 2010 but how does the HD Remaster stack up? Lets take a look. Mafia 2 Definitive Edition was developed by Hangar 13 and d3t and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]

Release Date : 19th May 2020 (Mafia 2, 23rd August 2010).
Last known update: 19th May 2020.


[h1]üéÆGameplay:[/h1]

[b]Are there any changes as far as gameplay goes?[/b]

[list] [*] [b]Mission design and shooting :[/b]
If you think Mafia 2 is just another ‚Äò‚Äôcopy‚Äô‚Äô game of Grand Theft Auto you‚Äôre totally wrong, the Mafia series really takes the time to make you familiar with controls, movement and shooting, it is a slow paced third person game that sometimes might need a little bit of tactical movement. Mafia makes great use of the run and cover system and enemies usually die within a couple of shots, now level design was great in Mafia 2 as every mission had a different meaning and different way of completing. The level design of Mafia was actually ahead of its time, sadly mechanics weren‚Äôt and the game still feels a little rusty and slow compared to Mafia 3 that does actually have the mechanics as it is a much newer game. So in short, no they did not change anything and I like that decision as it keeps the purity of the game quite high.

[*] [b]Open world potential:[/b]
Granted Mafia 2 didn‚Äôt possess a huge man in 2010 and in today‚Äôs time it is worse, still the city of Empire Bay is extremely detailed with a lot of potential, the NPC and randomly generated humans in the streets of Empire Bay feel alive, for example in the snow timeline of the game you could see random people falling due to the icy roads and this honestly adds a crazy level of detail that is even by today's standards unmatched.Now as far as special events go you basically get nothing, you cannot race your cars not can you play quicktime missions which is kind of lackluster as far as stores and what you can do with your money you get a plethora of options  like boutique stores, vehicle garages and even gun shops.

[*] [b]Weather and other little details:[/b]
Weather and nighttime are actually working real time in the game, out of nowhere it might start raining and the rain is actually noticeable while driving, that's pretty rare for an open world story game that doesn‚Äôt really focus on driving that much. After your cars break down due to multiple fatal hits you can actually go out and repair it yourself just like in the 1950s. Lastly you heal yourself by consuming food and you even get custom cutscenes for this which is a great attention to detail.
[/list]


[h1]üìöStory:[/h1]
You have been warned, spoilers ahead.

Vito Scarletta is the main character and his story starts back in Sicily when his parents decided to avoid the WW2 italian drama and travel to Empire Bay, USA. Vito was both fascinated and disgusted by the city and had to learn the language in order to keep on surviving there.After some years Vito crossed paths with Joe Barbarro and both of them started robbing small shops together as money was low. One day Vito gets caught and gets to the chance to fight for the American army in 1943 in order to defeat Italy. Vito then comes back after an injury in 1945 and after that his mob career took on. First Vito was working for the Clemente family in which he proved useful but after someone snitched on him during the gas stamp mission vito had to serve jail time. While in jail Vito got to know strong people like Leo Galante and obviously joined the Galante prison gang. After proving that Vito is a viable option Galante got Vito out of prison right after Galante took Exit. After being a Free man Vito had only his sister as his mother died while he was a prisoner. Joe offered Vito a spot to work for the Falcone family and Vito happily accepted without seeing the bigger picture, after some breathtaking mission killing former boss Clemente, witnessing Henry's death by the Empire Bay Triads under the command of Mr.Wong and more Vito realises that Falcone wanted to kill all the other Bosses in order to sell Dope freely. In order to combat that Vito had to kill Falcone as Leo Galante ordered Vito to do in order to save himself from all the other families and the Feds.


[h1]üåáGraphics / Audio:[/h1]
As mentioned above Mafia 2 got major texture and lighting improvements. Most of the noticeable improvements come within cutscenes where you can clearly see a lot more detail on the skin and hair of character and even their eyes look normal now compared to the OG version. Lighting and textures and even minor geometry fixes are noticeable within EMpire bay.

[*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b]
Audio is a mixed bag in my opinion. cars do sound just a tad bit better but gunshots are pretty flat in the remaster while the OG version had quite the kick still, Voice actors are still the same and I think that the soundtrack hasn‚Äôt lost any songs which is always a plus as the music in the game is just amazing.

[/list]

[h1]üåÄPerformance:[/h1]
[b]The Remaster works better on High end devices but worse on Low end ones. [/b]
Here are the Benchmark stats of both the Remaster and the OG version.

[list]
[*] [b]In Game:[/b]
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S: Mostly 144fps on ultra settings while normally playing.

Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:Mostly about 28fps on Low-Med while normally playing.

[*] [b]üñ•Ô∏èBugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b]
In 12 hours of being an Italian mafia boy I had no crashes but minor bugs, for example PhysX wasn‚Äôt working on my Coat and I had to do some fixes, lighting bugs and even magazines vanishing. Other than that I had a great and stable experience.


[/list]

[h1]üí≤Price:[/h1]
If you had Mafia 2 you get the Remaster for free.
Great Value.
29,99Eur. is a little too much, I would wait for a sale.

[h1]‚öñÔ∏èConclusion:[/h1]
Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is a more than solid remaster as it does give you all the DLCs and improves a lot as far as graphics go yet it still has some minor technical problems which is not really optimal, if you can ignore that you get a hell of a game though.

This remaster was, therefore, an opportunity to upgrade graphics and gameplay, as well as bring the cut material into the main game. I can confirm that they failed in both these regards. 

The graphical updates are minimal and the work that has been done to Vito's face is quite jarring when looking at the SD side characters that weren't considered important enough for an upgrade. The PhysX software that the game was originally marketed on is actually worse in this version, with the clothes not reacting realistically as the original did - I later found out you can simply delete the 'Cloth' folder within the game files to make it work, but for some reason the developers have still not patched it in the vanilla version. 

Finally, Mafia 2 was well known for having a lot of content cut that was near completion (due to studio pressure) and I was hoping to see some of this in the definitive edition... as it was already all voice acted and therefore the studio would not need any more money going towards re-dubbing the lines. This too was not included. 

Ultimately, this is a huge disappointment. Not because the original game is bad - far from it - but because this remaster could have been so much more, especially at ¬£35!

Started playing this one and noticed an immediate difference. Sure the gunplay is tighter but everything else is sort of a let down.

The story feels rushed in a way and the characters lack a lot of emotional depth that made them feel so real and compelling in the first game. The main hook that gets your character into the Mafia is also quite lazy and uninspiring as well.

Also, there's this really bad ""Wanted"" system that marks you AND cars that you drive that have been spotted by cops. YOu have to go through the process of changing your clothes in a safehouse or driving your car to a shop every time you get caught for the tiniest pettiest crime which is such a boring drain that it makes it not worth it.

Some people say it's still a playable game, just not comparable to the first. I say those people can't say that. That's like someone repaying you with steaming shit and calling it equal.

However this remaster unfortunately is probably the sloppiest work I've ever seen. When even the classic version runs better, sounds better and looks better. Hear me out, here. This ""remaster"" mainly added higher resolution textures. But nothing else to it. Increasing the size of the game from 7GB to 40. For no good reason at all. The textures while they do look great, looks completely out of place to the rest of the world of Empire Bay and everyone in it. During a conversation you still see NPC's to your left that is completely untouched or re-textured.

Especially noticable on the landlady in Joe's building. You will find her character everywhere, as well as the ""Red Fox"" call-girl that shows up pretty much everywhere. Reused assets constantly. Even though this happened in the classic, it's a bit disappointing that no thought were gone into fixing things like this.

What makes the game even worse is all the bugs. It's been out for a while now and very little has been done to eliminate things that never even existed in the Classic version at release. Misaligned cameras, assets clipping (Such as wearing your hat around your throat instead of on your head) Glitching AI that seems more interested in the wall than actually apprehending you. Especially noticable during the robbery where the Irish interrupts you. When escaping from the police, they don't even exit the stairwell to the roof before you shimmy across the billboard. I had to kill them and reload twice, before I got the prompt to shimmy across. And I had to enter the stairwell and blow away the cops that seemed more interested in inspecting their shoes and the wall instead of attempting to chase us.

Another mission where the AI's aim is so good you won't even make it to the first intersection that is about 20 yards in front of you when you start the mission. I did make to the second a few times before I gave up. Restarted the whole mission just to try to get a faster car before exiting the compound after the first meeting with the Chinese.

Everything, even the game play is completely broken in comparison to the classic version of this game while looking old, still at least look homogenous. No textures stand out too much to make it look like it doesn't belong there. Which unfortunately they do a lot here.

There is nothing definite with this version of the game. It's the most disappointing remaster I have ever come across. Not even the PhysX effects work as they should, leading you to delete the folder for clothes for them to at least use the basic ones that Hangar 13 implemented to even work. Unfortunately meaning only YOUR clothes will have some kind of physics while everyone else will look like they came from the original game released 2002. How this ever passed to release is something I will never understand. They should have made a proper remake of it just like they did with the first one. And released it afterwards. I'm happy I got the game for free, courtesy of owning the original game on Steam. At least I didn't lose any money on this. Because it sure feels like a loss. Just buy the original and play through that instead.

Another glitch I forgot to mention is the sound. The volume of the conversations aren't on par with each other. One line will play super loud while another will force you to increase the volume to even hear them speak. A lot of other conversations doesn't play at all.

If you're familiar with my Mafia: DE review, you know basically what i'm gonna say here. The Mafia trilogy are up there amongst my favourite of this genre, The grit and violence means they are a cut above the rest, And debatable whether Mafia 2 or 3 reigns as the best of the series in my opinion. I would like to mention here, that i don't quite recall quite what  was available in the original rendition of Mafia 2, So i will be trying to review this as its own title entirely.

Story: 8/10
Having already played Mafia 2, and knowing the ins and outs of the story, the twists and turns in it still captivated me this time around. You play as Vito Scaletta an up and coming criminal in 1940's ""Empire Bay"" which is essentially just a soft rework of New York of the period. You are busted for some low end crimes and begin the game in service of the army. Upon leaving service you meet up with long time friend Joe Barbaro and your first steps toward becoming a ""Made Man"" begins. I rated this story so highly not because it isn't a cliche mafia story full of betrayal and intrigue.but because of how fleshed out Vito is as a character. His background, his interests and his personality are all almost readily apparent and begin to develop as the game progresses. I would also like to mention that this game pulls no punches. It's filled to the brim with racism, violence and sex. This adds to the realism of the era's grit and immerses you but its by no means for the faint of heart.

Gameplay: 8/10
+ Movement: A slight increase in mobility from the first game, Vito moves fairly smoothly around the world, his ability to vault short obstacles and that's position on the controller (I play 3PS games with a controller because it allows you to move slower in stealth) makes alot more sense and is far less clunky than it was in the first game. This doesn't mean its without flaws though, Vito still has a hard time navigating tight areas and often will ""take cover"" against completely irrelevant surfaces and get shot in the face because of it.

+ Gunplay: The gunplay here is hard to argue with, the guns feel effective and powerful and sound completely immersive, When you heart people belting out full mags of a tommy gun into the cover you're hiding behind and you hug it hard because you know peaking will clean your clock.

+ NPC/World Interactions: While the world isn't exactly ALIVE. Because the game takes place in Episodes across a 10 or so year gap, the world changes quite rapidly. But even so, each individual experience is full so to speak with people to talk to, and people living their lives, and you can really feel that as you run and drive Empire Bay's streets. My only qualm is that police seem completely disinterested with the NPC's breaking laws and only focus on you. It would add to the experience if police pulled people over occasionally.

+ Driving: While NOT as immersive as the completely remastered Mafia DE, Mafia 2 DE is still quite a solid driving experience, the cars react like you would imagine they would to the certain environmental effects, rain and snow. But also smashing the rear of you car, leaves quite a significant dent in that spot which was a nice touch.

+/- Fist Fighting: I couldn't decide if this was a positive or negative. Perhaps its both, perhaps its neither, But seeming it takes up a large portion of the game time, I have to mention it. It's great to see the mechanic where you get locked into fist fights with groups, shakes things up from the whole run and gun gameplay, But its not done particularly well here. Its pretty hard to monitor what your opponent is going to do and because Vito isn't particularly agile, he seems to get smacked in the face quite frequently.


- Difficulty: This game is easy. Far too easy even on the hardest difficulty, I don't recall it being so easy the first time i played it through but this time it was a breeze, i wish there was a realistic difficulty where gun shots actually took their effect on you, slowed you down, made your aim weaker etc. But unfortunately the overall difficulty was mild.

- Mission Diversity: One of the things that makes these kinds of games captivating is taking part in a lot of different experiences, The first game pulled this off amazingly. The 2nd..Not so much. There isn't a lot happening here, beyond driving from here to there and fight off waves of enemies until you reach your objective. A strong dynamic for sure, but it gets boring by the 10+ hour mark.

Visuals: 5/10
I was hoping for more, from the definitive edition, the touch ups weren't enough to warrant replaying the game. The game still suffers from what it always has, graphical glitches to make your character and the characters your talking to look completely broken or animations completely broken, breaking the total immersion as a whole. The remaster was almost completely irrelevant. The game is extremely graphically glitchy, in fact the first mission i played i jumped out of the cinematic car, and a woman was half way through the concrete of the footpath. Not a great experience. Surely without a doubt though on a mid to high end PC this game ran flawlessly high frames, Which i would expect no less because much of the world is still geometrical.

Audio: 7/10
Its hard to rate the audio bad here, apart from a few audio glitches that occurred frequently at the start of the game, completely loss of sound in 1 ear on my headphones or crackling as people talk, or completely cutting out entirely. But the soundtrack and audio here was expertly done back in the day, and were made to seem aged even then, It doesn't suffer in the slightest, if nothing else i feel as though it might have helped the immersion.

Overall: 8/10
Mafia 2 was a trophy winner of its time, perhaps the best Mafia game ever made (Up for debate with 3) but the Definitive Edition didn't bring much to the table, the game suffers from what it always suffered from, graphically and gameplay wise, But now suffers from its aged graphics and a new slew of audio concerns. I received this game as a freebie as many who owned the original did, But its really not any different from its original experience. Other than a very limited assortment of face touch ups to make it not seem as old as it is. A worth while experience for the sake of the trilogy but if you are after the same dedication here as the first games Remaster was, you're going to be sorely mistaken. For the price of $70 AUD for the DE trilogy though, i would warrant that price seemingly it included a full remaster, a rework and all the DLC's.",1601773015,1601773191,True,3,0,0.545141279697418213,0,True,False,False

[u]Empire Bay City[/u] 
Empire Bay city is like New York in 40/50's. It has such a beautiful atmosphere and soundtrack of the game gives you really nice vibes. It takes you into story and sometimes it is really fun just before mission explroe, or go to restaurant for sandwich and one bottle of beer. 

[u]Storyline[/u] 
The story is about ambitious Vito Scaletta who only wanted money, family and just live rich life with his best friend Joe...but somehow it turns totally diferently. I need to say that Vito and Joe are best duo, ever i saw in games before! 

[u]Soundtrack[/u] 
The soundtrack on it's own is really original, immersive, original and gives you really good feel to the storyline. Even radio songs are very good chosen. Specially ,,Let it snow.'' ...hehe. 

Pros: 
+ Remastered Graphic textures 
+ Storyline
+ Empire Bay
+ The feel is like open city world 
+ Atmosphere 
+ Soundtrack 
+ Czech Game 
+ Immersive city and features 
+ Customization of cars and clothes shops 

Cons: 
- glitches in few cut scenes sadly in remaster
- few problems with Nvidia Physics, hopefully will be patched 


I would say in full score 8,5/10 :) as remaster. It is really good game, story is amazing (well Mafia 1 is best) but Mafia 2 still gives you really the feel about ,,Mafia''. So if you want really good story with great characters, then definitely i recommend this game. :)

Has it all imo that it needs to have to be an amazing mafia game. A good story, wtiting (though these two kind of fall appart in the final 3 chapters due to it feeling really rushed with a bit of an abrupt end which is kinda meh) and acting. Great soundtrack. Still some great graphics (for a 2010 game) and physx is always a plus in my book (and the default destructible environments are real nice too and better than any other mafia game by far). The open world is also the best in any mafia game with different types of stores all around the city and side jobs which makes this city feel way more alive than any other mafia game (especially 3...). I also prefer the gunplay and overall feel of the gameplay in this game to the others, even M1 DE in some aspects. My only gripe may be that there is a bit too much just driving around throughout the game for me. Even though it is a part of the series, it gets a bit old sometimes. But why do I not recommend it? Oh i tell you why.

Definitive edition my ass! All of the above is pretty much true for both versions, but there are things that I encounter in this one that I have never encountered in my numerous playthroughs of the classic version. Sure, some minor bugs still carry over (which may be acceptable to some, not me but they do not really get in the way), but there are a couple of GAME BREAKING bugs in this version. I have had to restart 3 chapters because the final mission ""locks"" up and wont let me progress and crashing a couple of times. I have also encountered numerous dialogue scenes in cars that are broken where every person in the car speaks at the same time making it impossible to understand what anyone is saying. Also the physx effects are downgraded and you need to go into the config files to even unlock some of the missing features. 

Beyond the audio and game glitches, there are a couple of visual bugs too. Some effects even seem like bugs but they are meant to be like that (Lights in the tunnels being blinding and not in a realistic or good way). Performance is also really odd. Sure, the physx looks amazing to this day and the graphics are nice, but 18 fps on a pretty powerful machine is not acceptable. The graphical upgrades are not close to being good enough to warrant the performance impact that it has.

So all in all. Mafia 2 is a great game imo, but Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is an overpriced and inferior product to Classic. If you want to play an amazing game, buy Mafia 2 Classic for cheaper. Definetly not a perfect game, but I still even to this day have alot of fun with the game. But stay away from this edition of it. A true disappointment to all fans of the series.

The first one of the remasters was amazing to me. it looked like it was made today and even playing it on medium setting the city still looked amazing, from models ,lip sync expressions and the story was great. I played through that game in 3 days and might attempt to do another run at it on classic since I gave up on it at the racetrack and the armour vehicale chase.

now to come from 1 to the remaster of 2 it felt like a gut punch. as soon as I saw the menu I was confused thinking it didn't change to 1920 x1080 since the text was still somewhat pixelated to then find out it was on that setting. the menu background looked just bad as well like it were all low LOD and the textures were compressed. starting the game and I was even more befusseld, it looked dated like it came out around 3th console generation but like early of that the animation was stiff, textures looked just low, now I was playing it on medium settings thinking i'd be somewhat heavy for my pc since I played the first remake like this but it looked just aweful. I really didn't want to believe some of the reviews here saying it looked just like the original but it does, even when I changed it to highest settings I could. I had textures constantly disapear as I just stood next to it, items just appear out of no where 5 meter before me, and then I met the AI I didn't get too far but I had to escort some lady to my car but she refused to turn the corner and kept walking back to the doorframe of her house to get stuck there. at that point I just quit the game. 

I tried to give myself the mindset that this is an old game from 2010 to fight the feeling that it came out THIS YEAR but It's not right. I don't recommend it",1601319311,1601319311,False,1,0,0.474820166826248169,0,True,False,False

1030830,69458972,76561198045474181,963,46,86,0,25,1589956920,"Mafia II: Definitive Edition is an updated release, a HD remaster, of an already HD game that features enhanced models, textures, changes to lighting and the sound engine of the game. The game does look nicer at in motion. Some changes, like the greasy hair and the somewhat shinier eyes do look a bit strange, and I have noticed a few interesting artifacts with the Ambient Occlusion implementation, but generally, the game does look nicer. The nicer graphics don't necessarily explain the fact the download size of the game is nearly 5 times larger than the original, or the performance hit, but generally, the game does look nicer. As an owner of the original PC version of Mafia II on Steam, I received this version for free, while still keeping the old version in my library, which is a big plus (unlike Rockstar and the 'Complete' Edition of GTA IV that replaced the originals completely).

BUT, there are some issues with this re-release, starting with the first thing you see when you launch the game; the launcher is pointless. When I adjusted my settings so it would run in 1080p Borderless, when the game loaded up, it was rendering out at 480p full screen, but in a 1080p frame, so the game was in a tiny corner of my screen, and I had to navigate and change the options through the in-game options menu to get it running in the correct resolution. After getting the game to run 1080p, Borderless, Maximum settings (minus MSAA, which I ran at 4X and Vignette and Chromatic Aberration off because those effects are bad on a good day), I immediately saw they had re-done the pre-rendered cutscenes. Not just an upscaling, but they had re-done from scratch. The pre-rendered scenes look quite a bit better and might run at a higher framerate as well (which might explain the file size increase somewhat). Then the game crashed. After re-launching, Borderless Windowed Mode no longer worked, and when I tried running it through the options menu, the game threw up a load of messages about Nvidia Apex/PhysX, which is still in this version, but significantly gimped, and with no clear option to enable or disable the effects. Also, despite setting it to skip the launcher, every time I restarted, the launcher would load up first.

Once I got back onto the game, now in Fullscreen instead of Borderless, it loaded the in-game cutscene, and the audio was only going through my left ear on my headset. In-game cutscenes are mono on my setup, not pre-rendered, not actual gameplay, but the in-game scenes are. The shooty shooty bang bang part ran just fine, and audio was normal. The next in-game cutscene also ran in mono. Then the train station cutscene ran normally, then the in-game drive down the hill ran normally, and then the bar cutscene ran in mono. I was able to fix this by changing the in-game audio option to stereo and restarting the game.

Once I got to run around, I saw that the cloth physics were removed. This is disappointing, I have a Nvidia GPU so I was hoping these physics extensions would still work, considering that some PhysX particles are clearly still present, but they are not. Consequently, because some PhysX effects seem to be forced on, there may be a performance hit on AMD GPU's but I do not know for certain so take this statement with a grain of salt. Lacking the full PhysX effect experience has no impact on the actual gameplay, but it is a visual feature that is missing from the Definitive Edition that belies the idea this is the Definitive Edition for some players. Also, note that I did not run the game at an unlocked frame rate, so I can't comment on whether or not they fixed the bugs caused by running at over 100 FPS, such as the slow-motion glitch. Reading around suggests they have fixed them, but I cannot confirm that right now.

Graphically, as mentioned, the remaster is a mixed bag. Faces have benefited the most, but the eyes and hair look a little strange sometimes, appearing far shinier than they did originally. Artwork is generally of a higher resolution, pre-rendered cutscenes are completely rebuilt from scratch to use higher quality assets and run at a higher resolution and framerate. Lighting changes, such as sun effects and shadows have changed, with a stronger Ambient Occlusion process (with mixed results), higher quality shadows, including better actor self-shadowing, and a draw distance that seems to be further pushed back than it was before. The game generally looks better, although some of the artistic changes might throw you off.

Audio-wise, the soundtrack is apparently equal to what was in the base game in 2016, down 16 music tracks from the original release, some of which are on the better known side of soundtrack as well. It's far from what could be a definitive release, not quite on the same level as GTA IV, or the current state of the original Mafia if you buy it on Steam now, but that's little comfort. You are not getting the full original soundtrack experience. Apparently, some further tracks are also missing from the Joe's Adventures DLC pack, but I can't verify that myself, as I don't really want to play this version of Mafia II any further due to those technical issues. There is a mod to re-add the missing music, but you shouldn't have to mod a game to get the original intended experience. Audio mixing, by my ear, sounds a bit off in some places. Some sound effects have been replaced with higher quality assets that again I think work quite well but sound mixing seems off, even after I fixed the mono sound in some of the cutscenes, something still seemed off compared to what I was expecting to hear, as though the sound mixing in-game was wrong, with loud effects playing too quietly, something that does not occur in cutscenes, where instead it seems to lean a lot on my left speaker channel.

Overall, I can't recommend playing this version over the original. It does look nicer, but there are too many issues that make the Definitive Edition an inferior edition to the original version, which is still in your library and included in this versions purchase (or on GoG). Play the classic version instead. It doesn't look far worse (Mafia II still looks quite good) and suffers from far fewer bugs. Because this is a remastered compilation, it doesn't add anything, so you aren't missing out on any additional content unless you want to play the DLC mission packs (which aren't very good to be honest), and the original might not crash as often either.

Mafia II is a great game; the remaster is not the best way to play if you just want to play the game. The new version does not make a good game bad by any means (granted, I stopped playing before the end of hour two because I had enough of having to stop, drop out, tweak and come back to get the damn thing to work), but it is a sub-par re-release. Fortunately, unlike Rockstar, 2K aren't forcing you to use this version if you don't want to and unlike Rockstar's 'Complete Edition' mess, there are actual improvements that can be mentioned. The original release still works perfectly as long as you keep under 100 FPS on modern operating systems, it's also a HD game with a far smaller install size. There are too many drawbacks to truly call this game a definitive release. The classic release is included in this package, unlike GTA IV now, so I would recommend playing that version instead if you've never played Mafia II before.",1589952577,1601295617,False,45,4,0.764693975448608398,3,True,True,False

- they added Bugs (a lot of them)

Mafia series is without a doubt my personal favorite series of all time and I was very happy when the Definitive Edition Trilogy remaster was announced. The game follows its first part with the authentic and entertaining story, great gameplay and nice graphics/soundtracks. The music in this game is truly amazing. Especially if you are into mobster content as I am. In comparison to other open world games, Mafia is different. The game is built around the missions you're doing and the focus is on the story, which is definitely a plus to me.

My friends can attest to this.The Remaster of mafia 2 is, odd, to say the least, some textures got updated, most notably the roads and the character textures, as well as some more minor elements and Clemente's slaughterhouse seems to have gotten a bit of a repaint too. Main Character models are way more detailed than the classic mafia 2 ones, and some voices of some minor characters have changed, like the soldier's in the intro mission.Markers, markers for enemies on hard mode have been removed, thats for gang members, cops are still visible on the minimap. Lighting has been changed as well, but nothing impressive by any stretch. There are also new gun sounds, which are very pleasant to hear. I honestly have no idea why this needed a remaster, you get some minor graphical upgrades and some postfx options and sounds, but besides that there is nothing to this remaster.

This game gets confused, and limits the game to the lowest resolution of the system. I can't go past 1280 x 1024, because this game sees I have a monitor with that resolution, and decides that is what my computer is capable of. Edit the settings file, you may ask? Nah, then it throws a fit and goes into 640 x 480 safe mode.

The game tells the story of Vito Scaleta and his best friend Joe, with their rise through the mafia ranks; without spoiling too much, Mafia 1 & 2 have some of the best story-telling in previous generations, with the first game being fully remade later this year. 

The game takes place in Empire Bay, with a semi-structured open world modeled after New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. The game takes place over the time period of the 1940‚Äôs & 50‚Äôs, with great attention to detail within the world ranging from the architecture, cars and music. The game is told in Chapters with structured missions, controlling Vito in a third person perspective.

If you have not played Mafia II before it is well worth playing, some have been complaining about this edition only being a remaster, but it is still a fantastic game. This game's price point IS ¬£24.99/$30-35. Depending on your taste for these types of games, it may be worth waiting for a sale; also, the game is free to you on steam if you own the classic version already.

Mafia II was one of the finest games of the last generation, I highly recommend picking it up at some point.

I had read some reviews and seen that people were having trouble with the game running, crashing, and other graphical issues. I had only had one graphical problem and I thought it was funny so it didn‚Äôt bug me. That was until I got to the last quarter of the game and everything just decided to stop working. The game would crash, drop to about 20 frames, the world wouldn‚Äôt load, characters saying their dialog lines at both the same time and repeating them over and over again. 

It‚Äôs a real shame because I had a great time playing the game until the last parts. The story is something that I haven‚Äôt experienced in a game. It‚Äôs like playing a gangster movie and all the jobs they get are missions and first jobs are easy. As you play more the jobs start getting harder and things don‚Äôt always go as planned as usual. I loved how it was like playing through a movie and the soundtrack helps get you into the right atmosphere. It‚Äôs a big plus that it doesn‚Äôt share songs in Fallout. At least all the times I was listening to the radio I didn‚Äôt hear a single song I heard from another game that tries to use old vintage songs.

The gameplay is fun but there is a lot of driving. At first, the driving is great because it gives you time to get to know characters and there are a couple of funny conversations. By the 10th mission, you will be getting tired of driving every place you go. The missions and the tasks you have to do for people make you feel like a gangster. The game does a good job of telling you what it‚Äôs like to get into the Mafia and the lifestyle of those in it. The gun sections can be a little difficult which is good. I played on medium difficulty and there were plenty of times I died because I trying to spray and run through. Its that difficulty that‚Äôs just hard enough to make you stop and think of an approach but it won‚Äôt take you more than a couple tries if you die.

If the game was more functional I would give this game a thumbs up but sadly we live in a time where games we buy aren‚Äôt even completed on release. I never got around to playing the original/classic version but I‚Äôve heard that if you can get your hands on it, its the better version. That is all.

Release Date: 19 May 2020

*Note that I did not play for 2 hours as I was offline for most of the time, it was near 8 hours instead*

Pros:
The Mafia franchise has had its highs and lows and this, is at its peak, if we only consider Mafia II and not the definitive edition that is. The story is rich and although it is increasingly unrealistic to go guns blazing, that serves as a fun entry point for those who are new to the Mafia series. Maintaining its grittiness and your frustration at cops chasing you for speeding and so on. Yes, cops do matter in this game surprisingly. That aspect allows you to play in a more realistic manner aside from the shooting and explosions and that cops do give you a sense for needing to stay in the shadows and to blend in with 1940s and 1950s American society as an Italian immigrant. The story itself makes sense, the characters make sense, the dialogue makes sense and so rather than immersing you in a game such as Mafia II, it more so immerses you into a movie. Every cutscene and action from the original deals like an award winning film featured from the 70s or 80s and could be comparable to greats such as The Godfather and more modern takes such as The Irishman.

Cons:
The definite edition offers an extension pack to you for free. A ****load of bugs, glitches and optimization issues. Luckily, most optimization issues have been fixed except for the random crashes whilst bugs and glitches could range from Vito ""getting up"" by punching his feet through the bed and eyes pointed in a very unnatural direction during cutscenes. Textures and and coat clippings were also found annoying amongst the populace but I guess it was expected for since it was Hangar 13's job to remaster a timeless game. As they have done a poor job with Mafia III alone, they brought that inexperience into Mafia II purging of anything that is good in the game.

Verdict:
If this was a review about the classic Mafia II, this game would have gotten a higher score, but since it isn't, there isn't much to say before giving it a awfully weak,

- Great story
- Voice acting is solid and the dialogue is interesting
- Audio is decent
- Great variety of songs on the radio
- Car customization is decent though it could be improved upon as you spend a lot of time driving
- Character customization is also decent

---CONS---
- Only 15 hours of game play
- Driving feels like a chore if you use a keyboard over a controller
- Lots of mesh glitches in cut scenes
- No side missions or challenges
- Poor traffic and pedestrian AI

All I had that related to the game was the same old graphics comparison video with it and GTA IV, however, now and after I played through the marvelous Mafia I, I finally get to taste from this forbidden apple, the game everyone praises to death, to the point where I probably never heard anything negative about it.

Well, the first frame hit, and sweet mother that was a huge step-up, seriously, I played the Definitive Edition that was released a month or two ago, and I did hear that the remaster wasn't that big aside from some texture enhancements and color calibration and oh boy dis it a looker. I don't play the latest Tripple A games so I'm not quite familiar with the state of the art graphics that hit the headlines, but I gotta say, it even holds up to GTA V in some areas and even surpasses it in a few details and gimmicks.

The story. I progress like your typical mafioso saga, even picking up on the first entry's notes, split into chapters with varying time skips that follows this trouble-maker and his childhood friend make it from street crooks to made-men. And the plot really makes you work for it. The levels are challenging especially on the hardest difficulty and even the medium one keeps you on your toes. The shootouts are unforgiving and the cops can get really brutal. I love the wanted system and how you have to be smart and cautions in order to stay low on record.

The driving system was definitely a step up from the first game, although, the simulation option did not add much, almost as if it was never there.

The characters are engaging, take the protagonist, Vito, I would always have Mafia I in higher regard in terms of the story and setting, but Vito takes the cake over Tommy as the main character. He's cool, classy and his development shows. He's like the anti average GTA protagonist where the character can do 180¬∞ between cutscenes and gameplay. Joe was the perfect side-kick, always there for his friends and true to his mafioso identity, brutal but also loyal. So good in fact that the last quote in the game moves you to tears having him as a center. And last but not least, Henry. He always had a faint but persistent presence in the story, not always there but somehow always involved, very likable, and interesting fella.

I wish the game had a Free Ride Mode like the first game because as soon as you finish the story, you're stuck loading previously finished chapters in case you want to do some free-roaming. Thankfully, there were 3 DLCs that unlocked the ability to free-roam as much as you want, moving their story from a per-chapter model to more of a GTA open-ended mission checkpoints scattered all over the map.

All in all, amazing game. Definitely, one to play over and over again. Especially the arcadey DLCs that go all the way leaderboarding on you and all, encouraging replayability and grind.",1596929839,1596929839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I won't be writing a review of the original Mafia 2 since I would basically be writing most of the same things. However, i'm choosing to review this because in terms of purely cosmetic things it's for sure worse. First off I will give some credit where it's due, the devs of this game didn't ignore the crappy launch and fixed the gamebreaking and annoying bugs. As a downside to that though, that basically renders this game original Mafia 2 with free dlc and some bonus content if you own Mafia 3. So it really adds pretty nothing new. Now yesterday (the day before i'm typing this review.) I marathoned this game starting at the earlier mission I had started on and beat it from the 3rd act to the 15th over about 6 hours. By the time I had gotten to the end my only complaints were how annoying the cops were, the fact that there are several parts where you lose your hard earned weapons afterwards, and that you can't kill any of the bosses yourself during gameplay. However, my biggest complaint and the reason I decided to mark this review negative and also not recommend the original Mafia 2, is the ending. This a GTA clone don't get me wrong on that. I did enjoy the references to Goodfellas, Scarface, and the Shawshank Redemption. However, anyone that as played GTA knows that at the ending of the game when credits roll, you can hit continue and cause carnage and destruction like you never had before on the open world map, because you unlocked all the weapons and cool stuff. Now in this game after the credits roll and you are taken back to the main menu and hit continue story, I was expecting to be taken to the main map for some sandboxing, but instead I got started over at the ending mission. That was one of the biggest gaming disappointments in my entire life. 

pros 
maybe some free dlc and mafia 3 easter eggs 
old gangster and prison movie references 

cons 
nothing new 
horrible horrible ending 


Overall do not recommend but if you still decide to play this game, you're better off picking up Mafia 2 classic for cheaper. 1 out of 10 solely for the good references. This game could have done really well as a GTA old world Mafia game but it absolutely failed where it needed to shine and the references sadly while they are entertaining can't save the actual gameplay.",1596787092,1596787776,False,2,2,0.452216744422912598,0,True,False,False

And as devs very generously granted me a free copy of Definitive Edition, I couldn't wait to play it again on my new system and as of right now I'm on chapter 15, specifically going for ""Ladies Man"" achievement.  
To be very honest, this is a very well made reshade. Lighting, textures, reflections represent the technological advancement we saw since the release of the original. I don't have any negative remarks, except the game could be a bit more optimized in PhysX section and a few very weird bugs.  
Ultra preset PhysX can cause framedrops in very intense gunfight situations in open roads on entry level PCs (Ryzen 1200, 1050Ti, 8GB ram, 10Gb pagefile set on SSD in my case) and I've had a few hiccups while driving under the streetlights inside the tunnels.  
Bugs include texture glitches, character animations etc. The launcher in particular is awful, should NOT have included that, and I had to relocate my Documents folder just to be able to autosave, because the game glitched.

All in all, I'm satisfied with this. Nothing more can be said about story. Linear but deep story about friendship and loss. Voice acting is great, accents really shine on Italian characters. Driving mechanism, cars, music nicely represent 50's era. It's a 7/10 in my book. Good job nonetheless, Hangar 13!

You can watch side-by-side comparison videos and see how little noticeable difference there is. Vito has blue eyes now and looks a little more tan? Maybe the textures on cars are a little sharper? Basically this looks like the original game with a reshade mod enabled. Apparently they've fixed some bugs which affected the original game on high refresh rate monitors (I was still a 60hz pleb back when I played the original so I can't say), but in exchange they've removed the PhysX elements for some reason? If you were hoping for, say, some of the additional content notoriously cut during the Mafia II's development to be restored here, fuhgeddaboutit.

Since I got Mafia II Definitive Edition for free for owning the ""classic"" version of the game, I guess I can't complain too much, but if I paid for this, I'd be upset.

Underwhelming graphical upgrades and cut content ""might have beens"" aside, Mafia II is still a game worth playing, and didn't get as much respect as it deserved because people expected it to be GTA with fedoras, which it just isn't. However, while it's an enjoyable experience, it's also quite a short one. If you're wanting to play the game for the first time you're looking at paying thirty bucks for 10-15 hours of gameplay, which is a bit dear. If the ""classic"" edition of the game was still readily available for PC at a lower price (like it was on Steam until the remaster was released...) I'd say just buy that. Buuut it isn't.

That being the case: If you haven't played the game before, get this, but get it on sale.

It went from looking like a game that was published in 2010 to one that was published in 2012. It's very clear they only re-released this game as a gimmick to advertise for the original Mafia remaster. This game does not come close to meeting the standards of a game released in 2020. The animations are very minimalistic, choppy, not fluid, and unpolished. There are several visual and audio glitches and bugs, none of them game breaking, but annoyance nevertheless. They did fix one game breaking bug from the original release in the second to last mission where you could not progress, which is good. 

All this being said, the game is still worth playing. The story is one of the best narratives from this genre, even if it may not hold up in places. I'm glad 2k made the decision to give everyone that owned the original versions of Mafia 2 and 3 the definitive editions for free. There would have been even more backlash otherwise. It was also a nice gesture to include the DLC expansions with the definitive edition, as I never would have played them otherwise. They shouldnt have released the definitive edition for this game however. They should have waited until Mafia 1 remastered was finished, and then gave Mafia 2 the same treatment. Yeah, it would have been resource heavy and they might have other projects they want to focus on, but it's a missed opportunity with a game that deserves a remaster.",1596068649,1596068649,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

- Vito glitching through his bed like a T-pose when waking up
- Audio during driving scenes repeating itself (almost like the same track is being played twice, with a slight delay)
- The eye lines of several characters (Leo, Henry) do not line up right when speaking during cutscenes, as if they were not animated
- When playing DLCs I have had scripted events get stuck which causes me to fail over and over again.

I don't know whats up 2K, but this is not pleasing the fans. For this definitive edition of Mafia II, they really haven't done much. Yes, they've updated the textures a little bit, but it is plagued with problems. A lot of textures are super buggy. A lot of the character's eyes in cut scenes don't follow the person they are talking to, and are just completely still, which really kills the scene in some cases. There is just so many bugs in this that I've lost count. It is absolutely annoying.
Hanger 13 didn't even try to incorporate anything new, like, let's say some of the cut content(Purchasable Hotels, Working subway system, and more). Its just ""Oh, here's some 'improved' textures, for $30.""

For quite a good chunk of the game, everything seemed in order. Characters enhanced, some more visual effects, maybe improved sounds? It's all very... unnecessary. But not a problem, it doesn't ruin the integrity of the main game.

... Until I got in deeper and deeper into the story chapters. Then I noticed characters' faces messed up as if it was a Garry's Mod video, cutscenes with broken segments, Vito having his hat shoved down halfway into his head as the back of his head got messed up, Vito getting up from bed quite literally, with him standing up as his legs sticked through the mattress as he ""woke up"". AI companions never moving from one spot to help you out, but still talking during shootouts. Scripted events like tailing missions failing because the car I went after got stuck on his own, and I was keeping my distance. Characters speaking over themselves, and repeating themselves, on the SAME conversation (even in the final encounter)... the list just goes on and on.

Issues, that I've never seen in over 10 years of playing Mafia II across different machines and consoles, happen all the time, specially crashing for no reason. Mafia II doesn't need Vito's hair going fullbright white during a cutscene with emotional impact - it just pulls you out from the experience completely. D3T, the studio responsible for this, did a very subpar job on this remaster, and it is a shame.

Don't let the title fool you, the Definitive Edition lies in the Classic Mafia II version. At least the best way to play is bundled with this mess of a ""remaster"", but with a way too step price tag compared to before, for a half-assed ""upgrade"". It runs better, looks just as good (even better in some aspects) and doesn't have these annoying issues.

It's an okay game, I remember liking a lot more when i played the original a decade ago. The gunplay hasn't aged very well. The main character is likable as are the supporting characters. The story is a typical Mob story, tons of mafia tropes and thick Italian American Accents. If it's on sale and you've never played it before then buy it. If you're looking for the nostalgia fix and you remember the game from 10 years ago, still wait for it to go on sale. I'd give the game a solid 7/10.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

[list]
[*]Game looks better (subjective). It isn't perfect though; It's a remaster, not a remake.
[*]Some bugs have been fixed - Infinite loading etc I no longer experienced.
[*]You get a few clothing items both new and old depending on the edition/pack you bought.
[*]Apart from that. I honestly can't think of anything else for now.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

[list]
[*]A considerable amount of this remaster is unpolished. Down below isn't even a full list.
[*]Unrefined/polished performance: Game lags on a 2080 TI especially involving physics.
[*]Heads warping with the joints etc contorting.
[*]Player hats clipping through the characters head to mouth level leaving the top of the head jagged and crushed down.
[*]Audio Problems such as the audio playing in multiple layers with a 1 second or so delay.
[*]AI is heavily unrefined. If you play on hard, get ready for them to shoot you before even looking your way or even¬†
[*]when they are staggered by gunfire.¬†
[*]Some of the textures are clearly inferior to the original (again subjective).¬†

Please see my review of the original Mafia II (2010 Release) here -> https://steamcommunity.com/id/JasperCarmack/recommended/50130?snr=1_5_9__402

+ Character skins now have subsurface scattering
+ A few upscaled textures here and there

- Does not run well
- Crashes consistently when the player has entered/left a garage multiple times (usually when 'building up' cars and doing things between missions, so you will lose a lot of progress very fast)
- Buggy. Some character heads did not show up sometimes, so I would be seeing eyeballs floating in the air in front of me. Animated sprites and VFX would flicker violently and jump around their origins
- High res Textures suffer from ""HD Texture syndrome"", with loss of original style choices and appearance. This is most definitely a minor nuance and not a major gripe, but it does fight against Mafia IIs original soft, stylised textures that complimented its appearance from when it originally released.

Also legit, why does Joe Barbaro have completely different coloured eyes now? He looks like a different man.

I cannot recommend this new version as it has many bugs, runs poorly, and texture updates don't realy make enough difference to justify it.

I highly recommend you play the original Mafia II release from 2010.",1593938100,1593938100,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

I've just completed Mafia 2 Definitive Edition in around 11 hours, which makes it a relatively short game, although I didn't do anything other than plough through the story missions; not that there's a great deal else to do, besides selling cars, robbing the odd shop or looking for collectables. Mafia 2 was criticised at the time for having an open world without much to do in it but I see it as simply the setting for a good story. While part of me wishes that the experience was longer, and that I could have played out a couple of the cut-scenes, rather than simply watching a montage of my criminal activities, I think this would have impacted on the flow of the game and the story.

At first glance the graphics seem the same as I remember but take off those rose-tinted glasses and you realise that they have actually been nicely updated. Cars look the part and handle well and everything fits the period, providing a great atmosphere; the soundtrack too is also really good. Shooting and brawling obviously play a large part in the game, with gunplay being of the ""press button to hide behind cover, hold aim to pop out"" variety; again, it works well and I have no complaints here.

There has been a lot of talk of this being a poor remaster, so let me just say this:
if you have the original already on Steam, then you have this in your library right now, for free, which is how I got it, and it is definitely worth another play through.
if you have the original on another platform, is it worth buying this? Probably not, not for the current price. It's the same game (albeit with all of the DLC included) with some nicer textures and the occasional sound glitch or ""eyes stuck looking to one side in cut-scenes"" glitch thrown in for good measure.
if you don't have the original is it worth getting this? I would say so. Maybe it's showing it's age in some areas but hey, forget about it. Now get outta here!",1593460062,1593460254,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Okay, they¬¥ve redone many textures, for streets, sidewalks, clothes and the faces look better, too.

What they didn¬¥t do is fix some of the mayor bugs. 

-You can still fail in Chapter 9 when you tailgate Luca and he crashes into another car, while trying to get on the highway.
-There is an annoying flickering goin on with the new smoke effects, that wasn¬¥t present in the original. Also some of the trash, lying on the ground, has this flickering too and some of it has a unnatural yellow colouring. You can see this especially in the first few chapters, because of the snow, but it¬¥s present troughout the whole game.
-The clothes physics semms to be much worse than in the original. On several occasions Vitos forehead just clipped through his hat, or his leather jacket trying to escape his body.
-There are way to many pop-ups. If you drive fast enough you can try to outrun the grass and flowers popping up.
-For some reason all charakters seem to have puppy eyes. Most noticably when they¬¥re in dark envoirements and their eyes seem to glow.
-Also they claim that you get all the DLC¬¥s with it. Thats a lie. At the time of this review, several DLC¬¥s are missing. For example the War Hero Pack, the Vegas Pack and the Made Man Pack. Because of this some cars are also missing, like the Jefferson Futura, the Roller GL300 or the Cossack. You can however play Joe¬¥s adventures and Jimmys vendetta.
-The Fight against Derek is still way too hard. You sit there in his Warehouse, while you get shot at from all sides an he is on the catwalk throwing molotov¬¥s that will hit you TROUGH cover. And there is still no checkpoint after entering the warehouse. So you start on the opposite site of the harbour again and have to kill ~15 poeple until you run into the warehous and get killed again by molotov¬¥s.

I have to mention, they¬¥ve at least fixed the endless slowmo bug from the original, when you steal your first car. Too bad the couldn¬¥t do that in the original.

Sadly, I can not reccommend this. True, I got it for free, since I own Mafia II Classic, but future players HAVE to buy this version, since the OG is pulled from the store.
It just feels rushed and unfinished. They were probably mid-reworking the game, when some manager, or something, walked in the office and told everyone they have to release the game soon, because of the Mafia 1 anniversary.

Edit: Okay, when I wrote this Review I had just finished Chapter 12. Now I¬¥m at the end of Chapter 14 and can¬¥t progress. My Mission is to pay bruno back. 55.000$. I have 55.298$ in my Inventory, but when I got to pay him back, I can¬¥t interact with the door. Even restarting fom a Checkpoint doesn¬¥t fix this.

Update changes can be found the the end of review.

Disclaimer: Just because i have received it for free since i own the classic copy, it dosn't mean that i should tolerate the progressively lower quality end product, ESPECIALLY since it was better before. So i will try to inform the new buyers to what they are signing in for.

The graphical uplift is barely noticeable to classical version. Sure there are some changes like; super shinny surfaces, better makeup for our ageing characters, altered weapon sounds and God like car lights that can blind the blind person. Oh yeah and there is two new cars;
One ported over from Mafia 3 (with terrible damage model) and Mafia's 1 taxi Falconer only available during winter time? And that is it. Can't think of anything else atm.

The game is still missing 2 vehicles from ""Made Man Pack"" weird considering This Is ""Definitive Edition"" Now on to RNG Bugs: Every time you start the game you have a random chance to get rare, common or Legendary bug. ps. Epic bug just crushes your game to your desktop, at anytime of ur playtime...
Sometimes unloaded textures, sometimes unloaded Text. Sometimes no sound or smt. no minimap. Ohh and don't get me started on tailing missions, because you have a really good chance to repeat the whole BORING and SLOW section, just because the opponent is a total derp at driving and gets stucke on other cars, thus game decides to call it a day (failing mission) since you can't go up to him and help him out.. obviously.

Get use to it, this trend is becoming the new norm.  ""oh but i got it for free, ehh its oke""
Good attitude..  xD Mafia 1 Remake goes live in about 2 months xD ""its oke"" and yes i know 
its not Hangar 15 who worked on this rrrresalle of mafia 2, they worked on Mafia 3 xD

I will keep review updated if something changes in upcoming weeks or a month. 
But im not willing to download 44GB again just because they woke up and decide to release patch months later.

Warning! Spoilers Ahead!.. sort of, its to help you save time.
Ps.[spoiler] Before you start the mission on chapter 12 ""Sea Gift"" round up 25.000 shmackles,
( preferably Deric's ;) place ;) You will thank me later.[/spoiler]

This re-release should be called ""Definite Joke Edition"" of once glorious game The Mafia 2.

Review note changes 01/06/20
Remove unnecessary spaces. I'd like to say that there is still a problem with earning some basic achievements which otherwise you would normally unlock easily.

Review note changes 18/06/20
+ Enforcer achievement can be now unlocked, and main campaign stats are now correct. 
Fun fact. Direct @k support website isn't helpful at all. good luck reporting bugs.
- Jimmy's Vendetta stats are still broken, preventing (me?) from obtaining other achievements like; Massacre, Sharpshooter, Firebug and Armament King. (Yes i did verify steam files).
- Still no ""Made Man"" pack cars available. (yes Iam linked to 2K)
- Weird fps drop that have not been present before. (Jimmy's vendetta) As of now.

Final Review note 26/06/20
This game will be uninstalled after I have finally reached 100% complition. 
Summery:
+ Nostalgia 
- I fell like this rerelase didn't deliver much of an experience like classic version did and some of us had a problems running it at 60FPS (it was all over the place). Some didnt have the problems but had same bugs scattered throughout the game despite their glamourus PC machines.
- Corrupted save games. (but i've managed to fix that, i will explain below)
So for same reason, good or bad. This game had my old (classical) auto-saves already present when I first installed the game. Most of which where negative sums that are closer to 
UK national Debt (of about -2.3 trillion)[-4.8Tril to be exact if counted all liabilities because of some F*#ki@! lockdown decision!! of a thing that might be just a flu! And Kill Bill is talking about 2nd wave!] alright ok ok...
So i fixed that.. you know how? xD 
I have copied and pasted my old save games from Classical superior version to DAssE save folder. AND... [i]it worked[/i] I was able to finish the rest of the missing achievements and my game run lot smoother without bad FPS drops [i]Magic[/i]

I can understand all the other comments saying its a bad remake because of the amount of bugs occuring now ingame wich aren't present in the old game, but i'm positive the Dev's will fix them

Positive Things / What i like about the remake:
- Better lightning, reflections, volumetrics
- Street lamps have a really great lightning it looks very nice too see the city at night
- Shadows are more saturated and softer
- Way more detailed charakter skins
- Faces are more detailed, you can even see every freckle, scratch
- Beards better visible
- Hair looks now more like the gelled hair young folks had in the 40's
- The environment feels more reflected on the vehicles
- Objects that were actually round, but were rather angular due to the technology at that time, are now round
- More options to adjust the graphics and behavior of the game
- A ""Launcher"" gives you the chance to adjust the settings before you start the game and can also be turned off in the settings
- Cutscene movies are remade to fit the 1080p optic
- Film grain was removed in many occasions (never understand why it's a thing in games, same as motion blur)
- New arrangment of the Main menu
- Story is still the same (yeah i think this is a valid good point because many remakes do changes on it's stories)
- Xbox Controller work better now
- Even the remake can run easily with 60+FPS on most machines on highest settings

Negative things /What i don't like:
- Main menu now show an Ad for the ""Definitiv Edition Collection""
- Why should i create an 2k account? And why the game needs to remind me about this everytime?
*Answer* You will get 2 new Cloth pieces ingame wich are both ugly in my opinion.
- Ingame cutscenes sometimes have problems with buggy characters, sometimes the eyes don't move, don't blink or just look somewhere else
- Smoke, Steam flickers sometimes and are a little ""too much"" and are not constant
- Some lights especially in the tunnels are way too bright and dazzling
- PhysX. Do i need to say more? Well, it ""work"" but only after you delete the ""Cloth"" folder in the game folder
- PhysX again - after fixing it, it will work, but your clothes start to wobble some time after your character stops moving 
and some other world objects will also begin to wobble too as soon as they move
- PhysX once again? Well not exactly but its still PhysX fault: DLC Clothes (Greasers, etc.) will not show up in your wardrobe if you don't delete the ""Cloth"" folder
- If you kill a NPC near objects like chairs, it will most likely happen that the object will spin away
- If you stealth-kill a NPC like a cop sitting on a chair, the NPC will stand up regulary because he see you, but then act like getting strangled and get unconcious without alerting anyone else
- Combat System is untouched and ducking is still a little clunky
- Movement with Controller is sometimes a bit loose
- They really could have reworked the tuning system, you can only make your car better, but you can't downgrade your car if you don't like the highest tuning because the engine goes through the hood which looks ugly on some cars
- Some objects still have their original graphics wich look out of place
- sometimes the characters glitch a little in cutscenes

There are sure many more things to mention but i think those are the most notable. 

Summary
- Do i enjoy the game? Yes of course
- Do i bitch about some bugs? No, because they are minor, yes i think they shouldn't exists in the game but well, here we are
- Do i recommend the game? Yes and No
-- If you loved the original and want to see the game polished in 1080p then yes, buy it or if you're lucky, you already have it for free anyway. 
--No, because some of the bugs can breake the immersion and fun for many people especially since the gaming community became very bitchy about anything what isn't 100% perfect (nothing can be)

All in all, in my mind, the bugs and everything negative i mentioned is somewhat minor and can be easily ignored, because Mafia II Definitive Edition is still a good game and a worthy successor of the original game and i really have fun playing it",1592872036,1592872036,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,True,False

After ten years you'd think before they put this out they would have taken the time to fix some of the issues that it had even when it launched. Unfortunately not only are a lot of those old issues still there, but there are a pile of new bugs that make the game borderline unplayable. That being said I still played it all the way through and got over 50% of the achievements so I can really talk about this game. I played the original several times over the years, originally on console then eventually moved up to playing it on PC. Sometimes I'd play for just an hour driving around enjoying the atmosphere, others would be full playthroughs just to do it again. I'll state I played this version before and after the 1GB update they put out. So let me start with the pros and then I'll move to the cons. I also have a perfectly acceptable PC that shouldn't be a cause of any of these issues.

Pros-
Beautiful atmosphere now in higher definition.

Great radio soundtrack, though a few more songs would have been nice.

Fantastic car catalog with so many lovely renditions of cars of the era, slightly modified to not be direct copies they'd have to pay to use of course.

Ambient sounds were normally well done, always nice standing out by the road hearing the grinding of a non-synchronized manual transmission on a passing truck.

Story has always been good, not perfect but good.

Police AI when it wanted to actually work was always a nice touch, might be annoying to some but I love the thought of speeding tickets and bribes.

Little details like fuel consumption, losing hub caps, car wash, the price of fuel going up through the story. so few games really do it and it's just another one of those things that you can mostly ignore, but is just a nice touch.

Now on to the cons-
Buggy Glitchy mess. Constant never ending graphical issues, freezes constantly I wouldn't even call them micro-stutters because they could last for up to 5 seconds and could be as often as every 15 seconds or could be several minutes between but through the entire 16 hours I played they were always there. Get in a car? Stutter. look too fast? Stutter. Change the radio station? Stutter. Turn the PC around too fast? Stutter. You get the gist. 

Audio bugs galore. The radio stations were constantly having issues where the last few words of a radio report, or the last part of a song would hiccup and loop several times before it'd finish and go to the next. Talking? Sometimes it'd be an absolute pain because everyone would be stuck talking over each other 2-3 times so you can't make sense out of anything they are saying.

Vehicle AI was a huge issue, sometimes they were fine, and other times they were so unpredictable it's as bad as actually driving in Manhattan. Usually I'd not mention it because real drivers are absolutely nuts, but being on the highway and all the sudden a car up ahead is just parked on the expressway is ridiculous.

Pop in was awful, having cars just suddenly appear on their side or roof in front of you while driving was just ridiculous. I assume it could also be related to why the game is constantly stuttering as it tries to put everything together, but I honestly couldn't say.

Camera one of the biggest issues in this game is the awful camera, it was awful in 2010 and it's even worse now. It's a 3rd person view that's like being on a little ball turret a foot behind the PC, never looking exactly where he looks, but just in his general direction. Getting shot when you're peeking around cover because he would technically be able to see them, but your stupid camera can't is just bad camera design. RE4 had third person camera down in 2005, the GTA games got the hang of it more or less by San Andreas in 2004. There was no reason this 'Definitive Edition' couldn't have taken some time to fix the camera.

T-posing, clipping through the ground and other posing issues were also a constant issue and while not as much of an issue were still something that's probably not supposed to happen.

Shooting similar to the camera is something that really could have been improved in this edition, it's not the worst but the few times I died in the game were because the PC did something weird when I tried to aim to fire.

DLC not all there. Where's my Jeep and uniform? 

Those are all things to consider when you want to buy this game. They might fix it, it'd be nice if they did and if I see things are fixed I'll edit this review, it'd be nice if at some point I could recommend it but right now I just can't. I would have rather paid to get a Definitive Edition that fixed everything than just got my version upgraded when it came out. I really hope they don't screw up the Mafia original remaster because I played that game a ton too when it first came out. For now I'll keep this one installed but I probably won't be touching it for a good while.",1592825621,1592825621,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Vito Scaletta a war hero returns to Empire Bay after taking a bullet he and his best friend Joe Barbaro get involved with the three main crime family's in Empire Bay starting from small jobs to jobs that get more risky and harder as the years go by and the war ends the atmosphere and writing is the number one thing i love about mafia 2 the voice acting is one of the best i heard mainly Joe Barbaro's actor Robert Costanzo and Vito Scaletta's actor Rick Pasqualone the soundtrack is full of classic 40s and 50s which is my era of music and modern day gamer's wont even notice because there music taste is like shit on a shoe from Dean Martin to Bing Crosby some of Franks songs where meant to be there too but got cut you can hear some of them with the ''Friends for life mod' which can be only played on the ''classic version'' of Mafia 2

the story always keeps you engaged there is never a single time where it drags at all most characters are memorable just as the missions are the city breaths life from diners full of people people fixing cars stuff like that 

i give Mafia 2 8/10 if it didn't have most of the content cut i would give it a solid 9",1592681518,1592682357,True,2,0,0.475609749555587769,0,True,False,False

 I see a lot of people reviewing it here saying that it only needs bugs to be removed, and THEN its worth a buy. While bugs are existent on this version (I expirienced a near-gamebreaking one near the end of the game that carried over from the original version), even if they are fixed in their entirety: this version raises the price, file size and system requirements so much, that its inherently inferior to the GOG version, because that one has the same content, is only 10GB and is currently less than 3 bucks. I recommend you buy that version and mod it to hell if you wanna make it look like this one. I bought this game back when it was the original and decided to play it once every owner of the original got this upgrade for free, so these issues didn't matter that much to me.

The story is simply amazing and is a must play for people who have yet to experience it. 

It is easy to see why this ""Definitive Edition"" is getting the amount of hate that it is. If you don't own the classic version, then you are paying $30 to get both versions, with this version barely being an upgrade. There are some graphical improvements, but that is about it. The game still has a ton of bugs, and even more than the original. For instance, the newspaper salesman no longer has any audio and silently waves the papers about. The eyes still move in the cut scenes, to a degree. There are times where people look cross eyed during scenes. Even with the ""improvements"" graphically, the game still looks dated. The character models throughout the game are so re-used that it is slightly jarring at times, which I'm sure it has always been this way, but nostalgia forbids me from remembering it. Some of the cut scenes in the game don't seem to have been updated at all and look entirely the same as they did when the game was first released. 

With all of that being said, I think that all of the above can be overlooked and there can be a lot of enjoyment pulled from the game. This was the first time I have played since it was first released, and I enjoyed it just as much as I did 10 years ago. I can't state enough how amazing the story for this game is.

driving in this game is horrible like there no way you can do hard right turn unless you smash into car or a wall because it doesn't turn at all. 
there is no progression in this game except collecting playboy magazines ( which i don't have a problem with that lol ) and wanted posters.

The first Mafia was my #1 favorite game for a long time, so I was really excited to play Mafia 2. But this games seems to fall short about everywhere. The environment is done decently, but it's not really as expansive as the first game, and that one is OLD. There's a story, but it failed to make me feel any real connection. The missions themselves are rarely interesting, and the way the story is set up, you do a whole lot of ""drive to that place"", that might actually be the bulk of my playtime. The only real interaction I had with the city was driving across it. The stuff they put in the city had no real significance to the campaign.

So, if you're like me and on a mission to go through all games in the series, Mafia 2 is kinda sorta OK, I guess it's worth a play-through. But for a game on it's own, eh. You time, storage, and bandwidth might be better dedicated elsewhere.",1591519486,1591519486,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

‚Ä£ IMPROVEMENT IN FRAME RATE (60FPS)

‚Ä£ No Cloud support or extra contents added for better for this game.
‚Ä£ Clearly not a ground up remastered in quality of this game.
‚Ä£DLCs content are worthless only useful DLCs are outfits and vehicle that's it. 

‚Ä£ Joe's Adventure as much fun it was in story it was clearly not given the interest and time it needed as much as I love its free roam the timer is a fun killer it should work only for extra bonus not complete within time and missions like ""Bomb Under the Seat"" and ""Highway Racing"" makes you wanna lose your nerves its bullshit missions that actually prevent you to progress in game but the end was fun.

‚Ä£ The Betrayal of Jimmy is a waste of your time just avoid it all over and watch cut scenes on Youtube not worth your time.

‚Ä£Jimmy Vendetta its much better than Betrayal of Jimmy and continue after that event the mission phasing is good and vehicle are goods its fun to score as you finish it you will automatically forgot anything about it or when you quit your game its a petty cash grab DLC.

I played this game 10 years ago on console when it first came out and loved it then just as much as i enjoyed this time around. The remaster improves the games graphics and could hold up to modern games of today with a few tweaks and patches. The cars, Charcter faces, and enviromental assets is what i noticed the biggest changes in as everything has had a fresh polish look to it colours are more immersive and brighter and more ambient. The way rain falls onto your car all the little details look way more realstic now than what they did. This game suffers the most from performance thoe as its not very well optimised for pc as there is constant frame drops and Ai issues but with a few tweaks this game will be a masterpiece. 

Police AI: 
One point I really want to talk about is how smart the Police AI were for the time. If you commit a crime you need to change your clothes otherwise police around the city will recongise you. Same if youre driving a the same car they can track your liscense plate if you hang around to long. All these little things even having to refuel your car for the time was different to everything else out there on the market. 

Story: 

10/10 amazing gripping story 

Gameplay: 

9/10 just needs a few more tweaks for performance 

Replayabilty: 

6/10 needs side missions 

Overall;

To the writing, the characters, mature content, and the story. I love it. I bought this remaster because I wanted to jump back in and playthrough again with all the updates. I'm in chapter 9 and I feel like I have played enough to make an opinion on this remaster. Having played through the original release already. It's still the same great story (so far) with better textures and graphics. All the little glitches and bugs that you hear in other reviews are true, examples (blinking fog, graphic glitches, and eye tracking). You can fix some of the blinking on objects and fog by capping your frame rate to 60fps in the games settings. Which is a bummer for someone with a powerful PC. And performance is quite dog turds to be honest compared to the original. Even with a 2080ti and everything on Optimal settings. Physx is bugged and doesn't work for cloth. You shouldn't have to modify a file to fix that. I want to recommend this game, and it does some things right. But in the current state I can't. I really hope whoever is responsible for the patches see the reviews and fix these issues because it's a classic and deserves it. It'd be hard not to feel a little worried about the Mafia Remake. Please optimize it and put all the same effort and love in the finished product, as these fans have for the series.

The Mafia 2 Remastered isn't really a remaster. They changed a few things, still have the bugs that the classic has, characters are just a little bit more tan and crossed eye. The textures are slightly better, and the lighting is messed up. The got rid of all but one ending, hardly any outfits. They cut out some audio, characters no longer blink or move their eyes, which makes it a tad creepy. Does it looks good? A little bit, but not a lot. 

Save yourself some time and just buy the classic Mafia 2, it's made better than whatever this is. I wanted to love this game, but I couldn't.

Are these guys really trying to destroy the entire Mafia franchise??  If so, they are really doing a good job at it; considering the fiasco known as Mafia III... just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, nope, they found a way to really ruin a cult classic and one of my favorite games of all time; jackasses.  Hey, 2K, if you're going to be making a remaster, actually hire MASTER DEVELOPERS to do it; just makes everyone look at you, with baring cringes.

Get the classic version, this is an insult to the long time players.... this is supposed to be an upgrade?  *lol* The classic version plays better, any computer can play it and graphics are just as good with 5x less disk space required.  I rather play an old game at the highest settings than a new game at the lowest.  It's a tad wonky but works well.  I don't get where some players say the graphics are better in DE, not for me anyways.  It looks like it was polished, like the polish on a car; glare-galore.  The classic version was just better made for its time; 10 FN YEARS AGO!!!  This looks like a high school project; which, if it were the case, bravo, this deserves a medal... but since made by so-called professionals, no... this is just shameful.  This was the opposite of putting lipstick on a pig... it's putting feces on a babe's face.

They will likely do like Deus Ex after selling a fiasco... ""oh, we won't make any anymore because players don't seem to enjoy those types of games anymore"" but ignoring the fact they're building trash and players refuse being sold incomplete trash, where the player is left to do the beta testing, for free.  FK that noise.

Look, $30 for this?? WTF... they'd have to pay me to play it but since I got it for free; you get what you pay for in life I guess.  Those who said they played this and not the classic version... are liars.  I will still complain because I am fed up of shitty games being released by developers, let alone butchered remasters of classic games.  Only reason this game exists, is to lick D3T's butt crack.... no other reason, since there are not many venues to profit here.  This was not tested a whole lot.... if at all... or testers were incompetent; pick your poison.

This goes to any development team, release nothing instead of releasing trash for the sake of giving a bunch of losers work, you're just pissing off those who paid your bills for over a decade and will end up with a deficit.  #SteamRefunds

There is a reason I only paid $10 for Mafia III, I don't see it as being worth more than that.  This is why this game was free for the old school players of Mafia II, there is no way that they have gotten less than 90% refunds... like the previous installment. They stopped listening to players and started douching instead of building a fun game and as a result, no one will buy, nor keep, their trash and wonder why they can no longer afford real talent.  I feel this game studio won't last the next decade.  Make a continuance of this game, without douching... and there might be some hope here.... but not hanging much hope onto it, I know the way the world spins now... and it spins toxicity.

I doubt we'll ever see another game like CLASSIC Mafia II from 2K; like triple-triple snowmobiles.  Awesome is being phased out for douching purposes, ""lame and barely acceptable"" is being phased in... sounds familiar (Made in China) eh?  Awesome nowadays costs 3x and takes 10x longer... has a mandatory waiting period and an endless slew of paperwork.

I enjoyed the game if you like a good gangster story with some decent shooting mechanics and well done cinematics then I would recommend this for you.

Pros:
- Can look good at times
- Story
- Cinematics and main characters
- Setting is authentic and immersive

Cons:
- Can look terrible at times, some facial models are bad especially when the camera does a close-up
- Police are extremely annoying in the DLC, not too bad in the main game
- So much driving across the city, I like a good drive but this was just too much
- Linear with no player choice

However, its visuals did not age so well, so here we have Definitive Edition aiming to polish and improve all visual aspects. Does it do it well? I would say its a great improvement and the best way to play this gorgeous game in 2020. It does, however, has its flaws - poorly optimized areas, visual bugs and glitches plus lots of the DLC characters textures have not been touched at all. Even through all of these mistakes I would not call it a sloppy remaster as all of the above mentioned can be fixed with patches and I hope that that is exactly what they will do. Overall recommended as if you are buying it for the first time, you will get classic Mafia 2 with all of its DLCs free of charge and same goes for if you already own the classic 2.

Pros:
+ Gorgeously polished already great looking game
+ Most of the areas dont really hit performance too much
+ Story still holds up today as one of the greatest Goodfellas-like style of storytelling
+ Gameplay is a bit on the arcady side with shooting, but drive still feels really good
+ Well crafted characters

Cons:

- Graphical glitches that are very apparent especially with newly added clothing such as Tommy Angelo¬¥s suit and Clay¬¥s jacket - character model is protruding through the clothes and the hat of the suit was sometimes stuck in the middle of Vito¬¥s face during cutscenes
- Some places are poorly optimized for no apparent reason - there is nothing going on, no shooting or particle efects, it was even in the middle of the night but the game decided 15fps sounds like a treat
- DLCs still s*ck and that is cemented by the fact that creators of this remaster did not so much as a touch textures of side characters of the DLCs
- we have still got those annoying 30fps cutscenes but I guess there is nothing that can be done about those since they are pre-made",1591184426,1591184426,True,1,0,0.50138932466506958,0,True,False,False

Bad things:
-lack of free saving, and sparse saving checkpoints it shows that it was designed with consoles in mind
-lack of free roam after you complete the main mission
-sometimes when undercover and trying to shoot the sights are not were you were looking  just a second before -
accompanying AI, in the cases that they are leashed to follow you they are next to useless because they stop and move as soon as you move
-at this date there are unsolved bugs from the original version ( like Joe stuck in chapter 14th)
-this is about mission design, you didn't get to drive the cars you worked to get and upgrade
- a lot of areas are closed off after the missions are done

Good things:
- good voice acting (even though I am not a native English speaker I consumed a ton of English content over the course of my life so I can tell they did a fine job)
- professional cutscenes
- a lot of details in the world
1. NPC's are going about their daily business with all the mannerisms that you would expect from them gas station is one example
2.period  appropriate soundtrack , commercials, news reporting style, building billboards
3. well crafted interior locations
4.a good variety of cars and stats also some options to customize them.

I did really enjoy the game back then so when this remastered version came out I thought it would be a good time to endulge myself into the Mafia again. 

I did not play the original Mafia II first to see if this remastered version is a big improvement or not but from what I've seen the game holds up very nice even after 10 years. Empire Bay (a mix of Chicago, New York and San Francisco) still has an amazing atmosphere of that era and great to drive around in. 

That said, this is not a GTA clone. Yes, Mafia II is an open world game but there is not that much filler content like in GTA. Mafia II pretty much focuses on the main story line. There are no sidequests except maybe some ways to make money like bringing cars to the scrap heap and robbing shops/gasstations. 

The variations of cars is quite limited, as would be realistic around 1950. You can buy a few new clothes and guns but there was not one moment in the game where I actually needed to buy guns. The clothes come in handy whenever you are wanted with the police and have to change clothes. 
You can also bring a car to the garage to repaint it and change the license plate so the car is not wanted anymore. Customisation of cars is also quite limited and unnecessary. 

The story however is quite good. The game really feels like a Mafia movie, albeit with a lot of scenes directly stolen from the movies but that's fine by me. 

Currently I did not finish the remastered version of the game yet because of a game breaking bug at the end of chapter 14 where Joe as to go see a doctor. Somehow the game thought Vito was in the car , which he was not.... 

I could not kill myself so the only thing I could do is try to restart the game. This did not work because my savegame is broken which forces me to restart Chapter 14. This would be okay with me under normal circumstances but Chapter 14 is quite a long chapter with some annoying filler content. Also, I probably will not get the achievement for finishing Mafia II on hard mode.

I will update this once I completely finished Mafia II and played some of the DLC.

Sure, the graphics and textures look better, as does some of the facial details and whatnot, but weapon sounds were changed when they didn't need to be, the cloth physics for clothes are gone unless you do some serious file digging to find them, and some songs were removed, as I noticed when Dean Martin's ""Ain't That a Kick in the Head"" didn't play during the credits for the main story. On top of that, even some graphical bugs still remain. During the cutscene for Chapter 9's mission ""Balls and Beans"" whenever it shows Luca interrogating Tony Balls and Harvey Beans, Beans's face is horribly glitched. Small items in the game such as cans on the street have glitchy shadows and textures as well. It really makes you wonder, was this seriously their best attempt at a remaster? Mafia II is 10+ years old, and even back when it first came out it looked great. To sum it all up, Mafia II:DE doesn't feel like a remaster at all, just an attempt to create an official Mafia title which in reality could just be classified as Mafia II with an ENB. You're much better off playing the OG Mafia II where everything is still there, as it should be, even if you don't have fancy-schmancy ""improved"" graphics.",1590858428,1590858428,False,1,0,0,0,True,True,False

The game starts in 1945 and theirs a 6 year time jump im not going to spoil and everything changes. the cars, the music, the clothes. The level of detail in this game is unbelievable. People go about their day on the street selling newspaper, go to their jobs with briefcases, shopping, moving boxes at the docks or just drinking in the gutter they will even sometimes slip on ice. Cops will pull you over and give you a ticket for not following the speed limit, you're car can run out of gas, gas tanks explode like real life if shot, tons of little immersion touches but it dosent go as far as the orginal Mafia in these aspect. Cops will put your face in the newspaper if you getaway and get your licesnce plate number so you also have to keep that in mind and change your clothing and buy a new licensce plate. If Martin Scorsese directed a video game it would be MAFIA 2. The characters are all likeable and believable and the story is full of twist and turns.

I picked the non ""Definitive"" version last year for six bucks and change and recently got this sent to me for free so I figured I'd give it a spin.

While I've played worse games, this one is aggressively mediocre in every way that the whole experience ends up being forgettable before it's even done.  I can only really suggest this if 1.) you're really into this setting and 2.) you can get it for cheap, thirty bucks is too high a price by far.

Normally open world games like this start off boring with a battery of pointless tutorial missions that recap mechanics that everyone is already familiar with from dozens of other titles, but here the beginning of where the game peaks.  The snowy 1940s NYC of the opening chapters looks great and the licensed period music only adds to the charm.  These missions are a mix of simple hand to hand combat, stealth, shooting and driving, all stuff you'd expect.  You'll be beating up uncooperative dockworkers, selling bootleg cigarettes, and shooting cookie cutter mooks for 4-5 hours.  Again none of this is revelatory but starting off with these small jobs both introduces you to the mechanics and helps solidify your place at the bottom of the criminal underworld of Empire Bay.

The thing is, once you've gotten through these opening chapters and the game progresses you realize it has NOTHING to offer besides what you've already seen.  Rather than introduce anything new, all of the above mechanics just became more of a hassle to deal with.  Driving around, which is charming at first given the old timey setting and cars, quickly becomes your primary activity, as you chauffeur NPCs from end of the completely empty map to the other, then drive all the way BACK across that empty map to your house so that you can end the chapter by walking up two or three flights of stairs, entering your empty apartment that has nothing you can interact with, and press X next  to your bed.  Shooting is even worse - this game's cover-based combat would have been bland by 2010 standards.  As the chapters progress the only difference is that the game puts you up against large numbers of bullet sponge enemies who can shred your health to nothing in short order if you dare leave cover, often from areas you can't even see.   Memorizing the scripted enemy spawns through trial and error is basically your only option to get through late game combat encounters, especially because you can't adjust difficulty mid-game to just get through the more maddening bits.

But it gets worse - a lot of the games features seem at odds with other design choices.  There are weapon stores throughout the game that you can spend your money at to get gear... but the game regularly will take your weapons away from you at random intervals.  Stocking up before a combat heavy mission is often pointless because the designer didn't design the encounter with you having them in mind.  You can spend your money on vehicle upgrades... but the maddening decision to include a speed limit negates the benefit of having a faster car.  Not that owning a car is of much benefit - you'll almost always be driving an NPC's vehicle which is almost always a piece of crap instead of your highly upgraded cars which largely gather dust in your garage.  You can spend money on outfits, but there's a point mid-game where all of your possessions, those included, are also removed.  Any attempt to spend your time doing ANYTHING besides the story missions, in order, immediately, is rendered pointless.  You can crush cars at the junkyard and rob stores to get money, sure, but why?  It's basically worthless (except, of course, at one point late in the game where you have to raise funds by repeating those two activities, over and over again.  I liked this part because it let me catch up on podcasts while I mindlessly picked the locks of cars, drove them into the crusher, walked up the stairs to the crusher controls, hit X to crush the car, etc etc).

But my biggest gripe is the checkpointing system.  This is the WORST example of this I have ever seen in a modern game, bar none.  The game has no manual saves to speak of and doesn't save when you quit.  The only way for it to save is at predetermined intervals during story missions.  So, if you do get the crazy idea in your head to go check out the world, raise some cash perhaps, and then, say, die in a car accident, you're back to the last checkpoint which could have been an hour ago.  The game punishes you at every turn for trying to do anything other than the story.  I know that it's lazy in a way to compare this to other open world games and complain that it doesn't do what they do, but the game invites these comparisons by trying to copy the open world urban game format and force a linear shooter in to it.

Let's end with the story, which is often touted as the games best feature.  This is the only thing the game pulls off, for me, and even then it's nothing special.  It's your basic rags to riches and then back to rags story of a dude who always wanted to be a gangster.  Every cliche you've seen in mob fiction is represented here and played straight without a hint of irony or subversion.  Vito is well voice acted and the new model for him looks great but it doesn't fix the fact that he's a cardboard cutout protagonist with no agency who has nothing driving him besides a desire for money and the fact that there's no game if he doesn't do the things the story needs him to do.  Every single thing that's asked of him he does without question or introspection and it's impossible to relate to him or his struggles.  Every other character is like that but worse.  I have a special hatred for Joe, who may be the most detestable sidekick character I've seen yet in any game. [spoiler]When he's carted away to be murdered at the end,  I had the only actual moment of emotional resonance in the entire experience, and it was one of happiness that this annoying character was going to be offed.  The idea that this is some tear-jerking moment is laughable to me.[/spoiler].

Overall, I'm glad I didn't spend thirty dollars on this.  If you're really hard up for an old timey gangster game and don't mind it being a boring slog that has no respect for your time, go for it.

Mafia 2 is a game that many would see as a Godfather like story where you go through some hoops, become family and work for the don and  some stuff happens. These games bring out that familiar noir type field, and in the era this takes place, it's a wonderful vintage point.

-Bugs....bugs that I didn't see or even actually notice in Mafia 2 Classic

Mafia 2 Definitive Edition definitely has some problems, more so on console to my knowledge but this isn't about the console port this is about the PC version.

The remaster problem: The graphics on some characters look gorgeous, Joe, Henry, Vito and the other big players within Empire Bay look nothing short of amazing as with some of the set pieces as well looking beautiful however there is a drawback with this in which not everyone in Empire Bay got the special treatment and thus they still look about the same as they do in Mafia 2, for a remaster this isn't a very good thing however as someone who has played through Mafia 2 many times it was a slight annoyance to see a bunch of NPC's look like they do and have Vito look great. A lot of Empire Bay also is very beautiful to look at you can tell there was definitely some passion put behind remastering the game however sadly some of the passion was put into one area and ignored in another.

The story: Mafia 2 follows the story of Vittorio Antonio ""Vito"" Scaletta born in Sicily in 1925, his parents moved him and his sister to America to start a new life, in 1943 he was arrested during a heist with his buddy Joe and given a choice, go to prison or fight in World War 2, after returning from the war in 1945 he meets back up with Joe who gets him out of the service and working with him, Vito after finding out the debt his family has sets out for a life of crime with Joe in order to pay back his family and himself so as to never make the same mistakes his father did. This is just a basic synopsis I wrote up for the start of the game's plot, the story of Mafia 2 while a bit cliche holds up extraordinarily well telling an emotional story of a man who originally set out to help his own family ended up becoming deeply involved in the Mafia life.

The gameplay: Mafia 2 Definitive Edtion's gameplay is the same as it is in Mafia 2, some people call it outdated which is true as it's still the same as it was in 2010, a little clunky but I think it holds up quite well. Each gun brings something a little different, the 1911 is the perfect all rounder handgun to use, the .38 is the weakest of the bunch but fires quite fast, the c96 boasts the most bullets out of all of them and the magnum is the strongest, the shotgun is one of the best weapons for close to medium levels of combat and the Thompson M1A1 is a great all rounder machine gun only rivalled by it's big brother the Thompson 1928, there are other guns that can fill in different roles for each scenario so it is fun to experiment and see which one will suit you best, however keep in mind that some of these guns you won't be able to come by very early on in the game with the exception of Chapter 1 when you are fighting in World War 2. The driving hasn't seen much change either, don't speed around the city otherwise you will be chased by cops unless you know the car you are using will outrun the any day.

Glitches that I know of: currently with Mafia 2 Definitive Edition I know of a few glitches in the game, one of them being a texture glitch with some litter on the ground having broken textures and I believe I am the only one who has encountered  this glitch so far but in the cutscenes for the end of Chapter 10 and part of the cutscenes in Chapter 11 would abruptly end before they were supposed to, these don't affect me too much as I have already finished the game many times however these can be a massive problem for players who are just starting out in the game, if this was just something that happened to me then it is okay but hopefully if it does happen to others it will be patched out soon, the last glitch is just a goofy one in which during cutscenes Vito's head would clip through his hat or his hat would clip through his head, it was funny to see that happen from time to time but it should be patched out somewhat soon so as not to take anyone out of the cutscenes. 

The only other problem I noticed with the game is that during the main story pretty much every coat that should have physics with it would just stick to Vito, there appears to be a mod that patches this out already so use that if you want while we wait for it to be patched out, this problem does not occur in the DLC though for some reason.

In conclusion Mafia 2 Definitive Edition is what many would consider a true remaster, it updates the games visuals and makes it playable on next gen consoles, this is a pretty good PC remaster but a horrendous one on console according to the problems it has, my advice would be to pick this game up if you are interested in an old school Mafia story or get the bundle to get them all, however you need to make your voice be heard if you are encountering glitches to 2k or through reviews to get them patched out.",1590475002,1590475002,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

I finished it multiple times on Xbox 360, same with the PS3, and probably another 2 or 3 times on PC. Add to that that I've just finished this version of the game and i think i can safely say I've played my fair share of this game. The most disappointing part of this edition is that the bug on the objective ""pay Bruno back"" which results in an infinite loading screen or the door not being usable at all, is still present in this version of the game. It's been in the ""classic"" version since launch and is still present in this version, not very ""definitive"" at all.

The graphics updates to this game are nice, although subtle and in no way an upgrade that makes the game ""next gen""
This version comes will all the DLC packs so thats a bonus, plus it was free to owners of the ""classic"" version. 
The story of Mafia 2 itself is great and is something that blows away Mafia 3 in every single way.
If you're tempted to play Mafia 3 and haven't played this, don't bother with Mafia 3. This game is superior in every way.

I recommend playing this version of the game if you've had it for free, as the game itself is brilliant, but the fact that bugs that have been in the game since its 2010 launch is honestly disappointing

Mafia II is a phenomenal game, in so many ways.. If you haven't played it already, then play it!

But, if you already have played it... Do n't expect to be blown away, as the remaster is crap.

1)  some of the licensed music was removed... which RUINS the 1950's atmosphere; half the songs we sang along to as we cruised around Empire Bay are no more.
2) Okay, MOSTLY the texture quality was increased, as was the lighting-- but I've noticed so many instances of lights flickering, decals Z-Fighting constantly (flickering between the decal and the texture beneath as the camera doesn't know which to render on top),  texture pop-in, and remember I used the word ""mostly""? Well, there are still loads of textures that haven't been touched-- these look even more apparent as everything around them has been improved.
3) PhysX (Or lack thereof). The phenomenal physics of the original 2010 game aren't entirely present-- some debris effects seem to be intact, but a lot has been removed-- cloth physics seem to have been removed entirely, making Vito's coat stiff as a board. Unrealistic, and super annoying as his coat physics were one of the first things I'd praise about the original after the story xD
4) THE EYES, like wtf... Characters' eyes are completely fixed in position. This completely ruins the mannerisms of characters like Henry in particular.  They are more detailed eyes though, texture wise, and they reflect the environment quite well, if only they actually f*cking moved!
5) None of the cut content. This was a real annoyance. Many people would have hoped to see the cut content, but none of it is here. It's a shame as I'm sure that alone would've made all my points so far easy to ignore.

Again, it's a phenomenal game, but this remaster is not so good... Play the original-- I'm sure there are ""graphics mods"" out there if you wish for a more modern look.",1590420072,1590420072,False,157,2,0.86791682243347168,0,True,True,False

While there are some visual enhancements, theres quite a lot of flickering on some objects and even lights in the distance and up close. Vito's clothes get deformed half the time, and also I've seen instances where some character faces are deformed. 

The game-breaking bug I mentioned are characters walking into things and not interacting. The game breaker for me that stopped me from moving forward in the mission in Chapter 14 was Joe getting stuck on the scaffold. A few missions ago I noticed characters walking into doors and not opening them, causing them to get stuck.

These bugs made the experience worse and left a bad taste in my mouth. A remaster is meant to enhance the experience not devolve it.

The new textures and lighting are very nice, and the indoor environments are lovely for such an old game. Some of the character models are pretty woeful looking tho, especially the ""sexy"" ladies Joe kicks out of his apartment in the first act, they look like something out of Unreal 2, and all the characters eyes look really weird at times too, like theyve all got really puffy, wrinkled eyelids.
The actual gameplay is the exact same and thats the biggest disappointment to be honest. 3rd person shooting is fairly weak feeling, the guns don't feel punchy or powerful, the aiming is loose and overall its just about serviceable. The driving is okay too, and really those are the only two things you do in the entire game. Oh that, and an insta fail stealth section or two. So yeah. Fun shit like that.

The story is...eh. The writing and voice acting is all very ""eyyy youse guys, lets go boost a cah and slap around some fooken broads"", that is to say its about as cliched and stereotypical as you can get for a story based on the Mob in the 1940's.

It looks like this was quickly ported over from DX9 to DX11 API with a few general enhancements (textures, lighting, etc.) by D3T.  Unfortunately, there are many technical bugs present right now in this port.  It seems that QA testing was either slim or non-existent.

Here's a quick list of bugs I have personally seen happen and/or confirmed from multiple reports from others:
-Physx API is broken.  It's really bad.  Physx is always on, with no option to turn it off, and it's extremely buggy.  Vito (your character) has 0 physx applied to coats, leaving them looking like old PS2 style graphics with the bottom sticking to Vito's legs.  This can be worked around though, by deleting the physx files which enables the back-up physics engine (much simpler cloth physics, comparable to 360 version of classic edition)
-Audio is bugged and cutscenes only go through the left speaker.  You can work around this by setting audio to high and to stereo, although that is a poor workaround for people with surround sound setups.
-Hitching is pretty bad, but I remember the Classic version had similar hitching.  This is likely due to the old engine being overly conservative back in the day.  The engine loads chunks of the world frequently when traveling through the world, causing the hitching(even installing on an SSD didn't help).  This adds to my suspicion of quick port of the Classic version.  I ran Special K and used it's more advanced framerate limiter, in order to normalize frametimes and minimize some loading hitching.
-Smoke and other alpha effects flicker now.  I have seen reports that limiting to 60 FPS corrects this, however this is a bad workaround in the days of Gsync/Freesync monitors.  I personally limit to 60 in single player controller games anyways, but this seems like yet another oversight from the port job.
-There a plenty more, but these are the most frequent I have seen or have experienced myself.  Just look at the other reviews, and you'll probably see many more bugs like special characters causing save issues (Silent, creator the the GTA SilentPatch's, is creating a patch for this as I speak, he knows far more about the issue than me).


I would really avoid buying this RIGHT NOW.  Keep your eyes out for a patch though, if D3T can continue supporting it then it will be even better than the original Mafia 2, which holds a special place in my heart.

D3T, if you see this, you're up to bat!!!  This is your chance to redeem yourself, until then I simply cannot recommend buying this version as it is fundamentally broken.  If this changes and you patch it, I will adjust my review :)",1590286874,1590286874,False,2,0,0.482128888368606567,0,True,True,False

I am about a little over 3/4 of the way through the story and its as good as I remember it . 

Issues thus far
On my gaming laptop 

it tries to use the IGPU all the time... had to force it to use my RTX 2060 with the Nvidia control panel 

once you get past the launcher page... it loads the game at the lowest possible settings for resolution and must be manually adjusted to every time start the game. Only had my system crash Twice during a pretty long play though. Benchmark is pretty broken at the moment .. reports my 9750H running at 10 000 GHZ ... Not sure whats up with that but so far physX seems to be working as far as I can tell with no Modifications on my end . 
game runs around 85 FPS Avg on my rig which is nothing super powered 

MSI GL 65 9SE 
9750H Under volt of -145 mv 
IGPU 630
RTX 2060 6 GB GPU stock settings 
512 M.2 Boot drive
2 TB seagate storage drive
16 GB of ram @ 2666 

I would say wait for buying to see if the DEV care to patch this to make it work better for all .. 
Would hold off buying the Collection as well with their (Remastered mafia Edition) 

If you do not mind a few minor bugs and can play around with some files .. its worth the money if you don't own it already  story is great ..

Mafia I and part II are games with one of the best single player stories that i know.
The story's are in par with stories like in ""The Last of Us"" 

This Definitive Edition of Mafia II is not to be compared with the totally overhault and remastered version of part 1 that will come out later this year..
It does have some better graphics and artwork and it includes all DLC's + The clothes and black Samson car of Lincoln Clay from Mafia III. 

One thing that i want to mention at this point is this;
Mafia 2 was ahead of it's time when it first came out in 2010.
It was packed with awesome PhysX particles that seems to be not showing\working in this devinitive version.
This part can only be fixed by Nvidia i think.
Because in this definitive version the files that are needed for the physX are still based on DirectX 9 and will not work for DirectX 12 because it is not remastered like in Mafia 1
And because of that i believe that the origional part 2 still give the best experience to the player.
But dispite of that it is still a nice game to play on modern setups.

I‚Äôll start off on a positive note, that being that the few things which have changed for the better are great. Wonderful remastered character models/faces, nice looking lighting, and the updates to *certain* textures look great too. But all in all, this ‚Äòremaster‚Äô is just disappointing. So much of the game is glossed over, so many areas that could benefit from new assets or ported assets from Mafia 3, so many areas that could‚Äôve used brand new textures rather than old upscaled ones, and so many situations that could areas that could have more modern effects added, like snowdrifts or summer leaves blowing in the wind. The other big disappointment is just how much this remaster breaks. PhysX has been gutted from the game making 80% of the clothing and physics/cloth enabled objects from the original simply not work, or not function to the degree it used to. Certain effects like sewer steam is broken and jittery. I‚Äôve even see vertex‚Äôs in some cases become completely stiff, causing objects to weirdly stretch and solidify while the rest is moving (another great example of broken clothes). This really is the absolute bare minimum they could have done for a remaster, and they would have been better off just releasing and HD texture pack or something of the sort for free. I personally did not buy this remaster and received it for free as an owner of the original Mafia 2, but if you‚Äôre considering buying this, I really don‚Äôt think the changes justify it. Too little for too high a price, and too many key components broken.

But like so many games, I never found time to go back to it, and once you are multiple generations of graphics past, it becomes even more difficult to go back to.

So I was quite surprised when I was just looking through my library and saw that the ""Definitive"" edition had just been released a handful of days ago, and it had automatically been added to my account since I already had the original version.

I downloaded the 38gb install and played for an hour, the first time since something like 2010 I had played Mafia 2.  

I play on an ultra wide monitor, resolution of 3840x1600, and I was happy to see that the game supports this resolution and that it was automatically selected.  So far so good.

Graphics wise the textures aren't too bad while playing the game, but something feels ""off"" about the character movement.  I don't know if it was always like that, or I'm just too used to playing GTA5 and RDR2 and how the movement mechanics work in those games.  Or maybe it's the animations/character models themselves that do not move right.  Aside from that, I enjoyed the first hour, and I believe I will indeed do that second play-through of the game.

One note about cut-scenes, they do not appear to have been upgraded, and look much worse than the game does while playing.

I have had no bugs or oddities within the first hour of the game, for what it's worth.

Not a good move. They are bad even in doing the bad work....

At least original owners got this free! If they expected us to rebuy the game in this state, this launch would have been REALLY bad.

The new lighting and texture work is overall great, no complaints about that. As for some more important things though...

Now for the issues that I've noticed that need to be fixed:
1. Cloth physics are bugged in the main game. All the physics but cloth work fine, the cloth is stuck at the lowest quality setting from the original no matter what setting you use here. It works fine in the DLCs. Probably just a bug, but please don't ignore this one and leave it unpatched, the main game looks like absolute crap without cloth physics. And don't just stop at the old medium physics setting, give us the full PhysX cloth physics from the original back. Some other issues with cloth include the physics spazzing out and making odd jutting shapes, which happened in the original but is more common now. I assume it's something to do with the cloth physics being bugged in general, so if the botched physics in this remaster are repaired to their original game state, all of this might go away.

2. Some effects like smoke can now flicker and stutter. This is a very noticeable issue that wasn't in the original game, it's distracting and needs fixing ASAP.

3.Light flicker, on streetlamps and distant buildings, was present in the original but is now more noticable, possibly because of the revamped lighting. It would be nice to get a fix, but since this was an original issue, it could be a fundamental engine problem, so I won't be mad if it's not fixed.

4. Some textures that really need high-res versions still use old textures. The biggest offender is the rock texture. Now that the mountains have been made more rocky and rocks are way closer to you up on the roads, they really need to be sharper because they're so visible. Not essential to fix, but would be appreciated.

5. The eyes. Characters look overall great, but for some odd reason they removed the moving eyes from the original cutscenes, now they blink whenever their eyes change direction, and the eyes are in a new direction when they open, we no longer see them move. Some characters don't even move their eyes, no blinking or anything, they just stare blankly ahead the whole cutscene. It really makes the characters less expressive and more robotic. The fact that they covered some of this up with blinking shows that they were aware that they somehow messed it up, and instead of fixing it they tried to hide it, and didn't even do a good job at that since half the characters simply don't look anywhere but forward now. Really disappointing intentional corner-cutting, stuff like this is why I don't respect Hangar 13 that much. Take the time to do it right, you messed up something that already worked, now fix it. As with the cloth physics, just make it like the original again, copy and paste the old animations into the remaster if you have to, I can't imagine why this would be an issue short of a dumb typo or something.

If Hangar 13 fails to fix the three most important issues that they messed up from the original: the physics, flickering smoke, and eye animations, I will not buy the Mafia 1 Remastered or the future Mafia IV if they develop it. I can let III's issues slide because that was their first game of that size. But breaking things that already worked in the original Mafia II, putting shoddy bandaids on them or ignoring them entirely instead of fixing them, and releasing the remaster knowing these things are broken, is a pretty bad look that shows just how little they care. If they don't fix all three of those issues, I'm done with them.

And I know they shipped it out to another company to remaster; but since they obviously chose someone that wasn't up to the job, received a remaster that was visibly not up to par, and released it without fixing any of the new issues anyway, they might as well have broken it themselves. 

After many of Mafia III's still-present issues and now this, Hangar 13 needs to prove to the community that they care about quality by fixing this remaster. How they treat this game with patches after launch is going to be the deciding factor in whether I buy any future game with their name attached to it. The community's good will matters more than they might think; Mafia III's sales were underwhelming because of all its issues and that can happen again. If they keep messing up, the series is either going to permanently end, or get passed off to another developer that's up to the task. In short, either do the community right for once and fix some bugs, or I and many others are out.",1590202448,1590202489,False,278,3,0.901405036449432373,7,True,True,False

When I saw the announcements for a remaster of one of my favorite games of all time, I was thrilled to say the least.

Perhaps I'm being harsh, when you set out to make a remaster of a masterpiece and charge 30 euros for the thing, you'd expect it to be built from the ground up, something that could compete with 2020 graphics while staying true to the original. This remaster completely fails at that. It's literally just Mafia 2 with some mild adjustments. 

I honestly really hope they fix it, and I really really hope that this doesn't reflect how the Mafia 1 remaster is going to turn out in any way, this is a joke.

If this product was free to get I wouldn't be writing this review, even better, if it was a mod I wouldn't be writing this review. The fact you get this product for free if you have the original Mafia 2 does NOT make this any more acceptable.

In 2010 there were two versions of Mafia II. One for PC, the other for consoles. Now there is one with less features than before. Yay, parity!

I read nothing about this before release in the hope that it'd be a worthy remaster. They didn't even bother to redo the text/fonts - it's still blurry and low res. No FOV slider or anything else that would make a nice, modern difference. Plain old laziness. The only difference I can see is with the lighting, distant objects and textures, but even some of those are worse in comparison.

So, yeah, the game itself is amazing. It's worth picking up if you've never played the original. Those looking for an actual ""remaster"" will be disappointed. All the weird jankiness of the original (due to it being a game from 2010) is still there. Gunplay feels sloppy, the AI isn't very intelligent, and the car handling can be spotty. Really, the only thing that stands out is the updated lights and post-processing. 

The textures are still pretty low-res and pop-in is absolutely TERRIBLE. Pop-in actually seems worse since the fancy new lights will pop in when the cars do so it really draws your eyes to it.

Honestly, I wish they'd had just reworked the view-distance and tightened up the shooting since Mafia 2 ""Classic"" actually still holds up really well.

I guess I'm sad since it's a wasted opportunity.

BUT STILL. Don't let that deter you. A great game will always be a great game, so you might as well play a great game that looks a bit better than it did at release. Playing it now really puts into perspective how ahead of the time the game was.

The story is great & the gun play is okay. Driving is fine & dialogue is decent. If you are expecting some sort of GTA style then look the other way cause you wont find it here.

At the moment i have not tried any of the DLC's to  really put my opinion on them but the fact that they are included in the [b] base [/b] game is a fantastic deal especially when the DLC's combined were like $30. 

Is it worth buying if you dont own the classic version? [b] YES [/b] is it worth buying if i'm expecting a GTA Open world style game?

  1.4 hour of playing this mess was more than enough for me to experience game breaking bugs and see the horrors of facial animation. The final straw was finding out that this game's save system is broken. Again. So reloading a checkpoint or even deciding to continue through main menu is impossible. I couldn't believe that it is possible to screw this game up even more. I was so very wrong.
  It absolutely amazes me how you can do something that modding community has done long ago (and done better btw), charge money for it (and it is pretty pricy) and still mess up like this.

When I heard about the game getting an update, I was excited to revisit a game I grew up playing. I honestly jumped in to try an see what all the complaints were about so I could give my 2 cents and try to defend a game I love. 

After playing through the story, I can say that there is some issues that ruin the game immersion-wise. Sections of the game had AI huddled in corners doing nothing. Some scenes had dwarfed faces during important dialogue which was sad to see. Some lighting also broke in certain points of the game. I liked how they updated the textures and made the game look great, but it looks like (to me) they use the same meshes for characters and buildings. Which is not a big deal to me personally, I just want to make that known to those who think the game is completely remade from the ground up. 

At the end of the day, I would still recommend the game for it's amazing story and fun game-play. My only reason I would recommend this version of the game is if you can deal with the bugs and want the nice updated visuals. Otherwise I suggest playing the classic version. Same thing but less buggy.

Generally speaking, there are some encouraging things: for example, improving the quality and optimization of the paintings, updating the Chinese language, and the Mafia 2 can get the latest and final version free of charge. However, there are also many bad places: for example, the Chinese language subtitles and interface of the game are too vague, which gives people a sense of vision of an old antenna TV set, which is also a headache for most Chinese players. I hope that the language definition can be updated later. Finally, I hope that the production team will be able to extract its essence and its dregs, and dedicate the Mafia's 1 plate making to the screen before us. thank you!

How it stands as a graphical remaster;
Pros:
Updated for the Mafia 3 engine (64 bit, better general performance on modern machines)
More graphical options
Updated reflections
Updated textures (on most things)
All DLC included

Cons:
Broken APEX PhysX integration (cloth physics and smoke physics not functional)
Flickering on particles and lights
Mafia 3 shaders and lighting clash with the feeling and setting of the original title
Some cutscene NPC's use old textures, creating jarring visuals

Ultimately, Mafia 2 is an incredible game, from the narrative to the gameplay it doesn't miss a beat. It's great that the game has been modernized to be introduced to a new generation of gamers, but this remaster isn't satisfactory. Either through rushing or negligence, some of the original graphical aspects have been completely removed or worsened (APEX and shading.)
I sincerely hope they patch out some of the issues, but this release could be considered nothing more than a beta release in my opinion. Not worth the money until these glaring issues are fixed, in my opinion this is currently inferior to the original release, even by modern standards.

So they took a 10 year old game made for windows 7 and made it NOT work with windows 7.

Even with xinput1_4 mod the game will start and run but controller will not work. KBAM still works fine.

NVIDIA PHYSX NO LONGER UTILIZED! So everything that made the original version so amazing from tire deformation to clothing physics to snow to certain debris is now gone and replaced with static and hard models that creates clipping and strange rigid clothing. Even doing the XML edit you can get ""some"" PhysX features enabled but at about half of what the ""classic"" version has.

So they took a 10 year old game, added slightly better textures, then took away a bunch of features that made the original game so good, then made it not work on the operating system it was made for.

Talk about a bungled ""re""launch.

Unless you really care more about 4k textures, then I'd say the ""classic"" version still looks better if you are still running 1080p or 1440p, as there really isn't that big of a difference to justify the loss of PhysX goodies and the increase of more than 35gb vs the classic only needing about 8 gb.

If you really want to see what this game could have looked like if they didn't bungle the ""definitive edition"" check out 2 mods on nexusmods for ""classic"" Mafia 2 called: 

-""Mafia II Remastered"" and ""Old Time Reality Mod"" These do a much better job at tightening up graphics with lighting, shaders, and 4k textures as well as a few more addons like 20 more cars, 70 more songs, better damage models and more.

First of all the only major difference in the remaster is the graphics don't have that xbox 360/ps3 era blur & washout. It is more crisp and slightly more detailed. Some textures seem to have been upgraded.

Secondly: The audio is messed up. It is super loud in some parts & the audio only plays out the left headphone. Dialogue also has audio issues where some lines play in lower volume than others.

Some questions I've seen from other reviews:

1. Is it worth ¬£24.99? No. (Hopefully you got the free upgrade like myself)

2. Is physx in the game? Yes. (People have reviewed this game thinking it's not because it's not in the settings menu, however it's a hidden setting which is only turned on if you select medium or high preset for all graphic options, a tip for those having frame drops issues is to set the games graphics settings to the low preset, restart the game and it will turn off physx, then turn your game back to what ever graphic settings you wish but do it manually do not use the slider preset at the top as that will turn physx back on, you only have to do this once, if you want physx back on use medium or high preset restart game and do your graphic settings manually again and your done, you can also enable or disable this in the game files instead)

3. Slow motion bug from the original game fixed? Yes.

4. Texture bugs? Haven't come across any yet.

5. Audio bugs? Haven't come across any yet.

6. Custom controller settings? No. (Only 2 presets to pick from like the original game)

Mafia II: Definitive Edition is literally just that, it's Mafia 2 but better.

Pros
- Improved Textures
- Improved Lighting
- Improved Models
- Better Frame rate and Optimisation
- Same amazing story and characters

Cons
- Fov can be awful at times with no way in game to change, external methods are seemingly possible but don't seem to work for me (This is not exclusive to this version, Mafia 2 Classic also requires external methods) not unplayable by any means but would be nice to have the option in game.

Possible Issues
- My PhysX was apparently already enabled but you will need to double check the top of the review and just make sure it's set to high if you want it in game.
- People are reporting sound issues with headphones and only coming out the left ear however this doesn't happen on my end so just something to watch out for.

However currently, my anti-virus disables the launcher stating it to be a virus, and so this has forced me to turn off my anti-virus just to be able to play the game. I thought there'd be a silver lining when I saw you could disable the launcher, but it doesn't truly disable it, it just starts, then immediately skips. This is a pain, because it means that if I wan't to play the game, I need to keep my anti-virus turned off (which I really don't like to do).

Another thing I noticed which really annoyed me, was the fact that when I exited the game, the game continues to run the executable in the background, and when I go to turn off the exe in the task manager, it tells me I can't. The only way for me to fully close the game is to restart my computer entirely.

I was really looking forward to this remaster too, but until these problems are dealt with, I won't be playing the game, and I can't recommend buying it if you didn't get it for free. Honestly, I'd just play the classic version, it may not be graphically better, but it is the same game, and at least you can play that without having to disable your entire anti-virus software.

My opinion? No. If you haven't played it yet, buy the original. It's cheaper, it's the same game and it honestly feels a little better.

Pros:
- The good looks great in some areas; Textures and models have been improved, but you're really only gonna notice this with some walls on buildings and the character head models.
- Weapon sound effects have been completely changed (Some of them sound ok while others sound unfitting)
- The infamous game-breaking black polygon bug has been fixed
- Performance is enhanced
- Many songs that got removed from past updates have been restored

Cons:
- This ""remaster"" does way too little. Besides the DLCs, no additional content is added
- None of the features that were cut from the original 2010 game has been added. This was a huge missed opportunity
- APEX cloth physics are disabled despite the files being present
- The file size is WAY too damn big. (How did it go from 8 GB's to 37 GB's?)
- The emotion and intensity of some of the character ingame voices has been heavily toned down. (The soldier who tells Vito to ""Take the Shot"" says it with far less urgency and is much more quiet)

Despite the good changes made, I cannot even call this a remaster. This is more or less a port that has been enhanced at a bare minimum. Take 2 and Hangar 13 took a very lazy route with this trilogy pack. They could have truly made Mafia 2 into what it was originally meant to be. Instead, what we are given is nothing but a quick cash grab. 

No additional cutscenes or story, not scrapped content restored, no new features. Its just plain old Mafia 2, that is in some ways even worse than the original.
