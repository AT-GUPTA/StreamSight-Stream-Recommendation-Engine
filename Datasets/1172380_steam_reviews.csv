if you like star wars like i do, youll love this games story and characters. its fantastic, and very refreshing considering they dont make good star wars movies anymore. this game plays out like a very slow star wars movie. the plot genuinely moved me, and there is so much cinematic creativity throughout

the combat is good. its closer to sekiro than a souls game, with a strong emphasis on parrying and a much faster pace, and neat abilities and powerups to get, but boss fights feel pretty aimless and random

the exploration is neat. i enjoyed getting 100%, mostly because i really love the cosmetics. the cosmetic customization in this game is just great btw. lightsaber parts, jackets, droid skins, and ship skins. any puzzles are simple enough to be pleasant, and nothing is TOO out of the way with thorough exploration and a little creativity.

the soundtrack is very nice. nothing id listen to out of context, but it brings great flavor and tone in the moment. the graphics are just incredible. i really didnt think it would be possible for facial animation to be at this level, not just for the human characters, but the aliens too.

Developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts, this action-adventure game manages to capture the essence of what makes the Star Wars saga so beloved while delivering an engaging and immersive experience. The storyline follows Cal Kestis, a young Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the events of Order 66 and is now trying to survive in a galaxy ruled by the oppressive Galactic Empire. As players guide Cal through various planets, each meticulously crafted with attention to detail, they unravel a gripping tale filled with twists, turns, and moments that truly feel like they belong in the Star Wars canon. One of the standout features of Fallen Order is its lightsaber combat system. Respawn has meticulously designed the combat mechanics, making lightsaber battles feel authentic and rewarding. The parrying, dodging, and strategic use of Force powers create a ballet of combat that mirrors the elegance and intensity of lightsaber duels from the films. As players progress, they can unlock new abilities, enhancing both the combat and exploration aspects of the game. The level design in Fallen Order deserves special commendation. Each planet offers a distinct atmosphere, from the dense forests of Kashyyyk to the industrial landscapes of Zeffo. The interconnected world design encourages exploration, with secrets hidden in every nook and cranny. Solving puzzles and overcoming environmental challenges adds depth to the gameplay, providing a satisfying balance between action and cerebral engagement. The attention to detail in Fallen Order extends beyond the visuals. The score, composed by Stephen Barton, complements the epic nature of the Star Wars universe, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments. The voice acting, particularly by Cameron Monaghan as Cal Kestis, is superb, adding authenticity and depth to the characters. While the game is not without its minor flaws, such as occasional frame rate drops and texture pop-ins, these issues are overshadowed by the overall excellence of the experience. Respawn's commitment to patching and improving the game post-launch also demonstrates their dedication to delivering a polished and enjoyable product.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a masterful addition to the Star Wars gaming legacy. It successfully captures the magic of the franchise, offering a captivating narrative, exhilarating lightsaber combat, and a galaxy waiting to be explored. Whether you're a die-hard Star Wars fan or a newcomer to the series, Fallen Order is a must-play, proving that the force is indeed strong with this exceptional game.",1708804004,1708804004,True,1,0,0.525139689445495605,0,True,False,False

Only downsides is once you'r done you probably want more... but there is nothing. (At least if your like me and got all locations at around 93-100% completion already by then, and the final mission which was my favourite is not replayable)... and also it needs Origin to run as written on the side of the steam page.

As for a more useful review.
Plays a lot like adventure games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted, so exploration and a bit of puzzle solving (mostly for side items and upgrades, less so for the main story) with a bit of Souls-like combat and enemy respawn-system thrown in.
It's hardest in the beginning and then feels easier as you progress, with fits with Cals journey from failed padawan to a jedi knight.
So difficulty wise it's easier to get into than other souls-likes since you got the difficulty options to choose from and the easiest one looks like it's a large step down from the others. Likewise for people wanting more of a challenge, the highest seams to be a huge step up from the middle 2 so all in all they could probably be summarized as:
Story (very easy)
Jedi Knight (normal)
Jedi Master (Hard)(I played on this)
Jedi Grand Master (Souls-like?)
(With the difficulty having sliders showing the damage taken, parry windows and enemy aggression when selecting, hence i saw that the bottom and top ones are quite a bit apart from the middle two).

Another thing i kinda like about it was while being linear, often when faced with a fork in the road i had no idea which was the correct route and which was the one hiding a puzzle for a side-secret, which is something that's very rare, usually in games i can just tell ""this is the right way, so i'll go into that side path to collect the thing).

Picked it up now on a sale, got to 96% completion in 22h (according to steam) in just over 2 days, But i still feel like this was money well spent.
Overall i say if you see it on a sale or think you can afford it, it's worth a try.
Hopefully the greatness of this game gives us some new direction from EA when comparing it's good publicity to their Battlefront remakes publicity...

UPDATE:
Figured I'd reinstall and play this again since the sequel is a buggy & abandoned mess (by reputation, haven't tried it myself), but unfortunately this game seems to have had a dose of whatever the Devs put into the sequel, and it no longer starts. It only gives errors and closes on start-up now. 
Apparently something about controllers, the games .exe not being found, launcher/launching errors, and quite possibly the game not being installed on the PC.

Not worth my Money or my time. The characters are not believable, and very poorly written. This game had such promise. Everyone touted how great it is! I can only assume that they have not actually played previous Star Wars games.


The Combat system is a Foggy shadow of other Star Wars games. Dark Souls combat style might work for other games but Really has no place in Star Wars when you consider you are fighting with a Light saber. Light sabers... remember those? You know the Weapon every Jedi had to master and build themselves with the ability to CUT THROUGH ANYTHING. Not in this game... some dude with a wooden staff can block about 80% of your attacks while the combat system only lets you block about 20% of his/hers so you have to dodge... but that will only work correctly half the time as well.

if only it was shorter with less climbing alla uncharted which gets repetitive and boring.
Combat is good but clunky, bosses are pretty good too, story is cool and the ending was unexpected and mind blowing.

I decided to give the game a try and here is how my journey was, SPOILERS AHEAD! :

I started the game with no expectations as games in today's climate are either over hyped or underwhelming.
The story did not disappoint and it kept me on the edge of my seat since the very beginning as I started playing as Cal. The cinematics  and music is encapsulating. If you want to grind the game and explore 100% of every planet and find every secret + crates it might take you 20 hours+ but I went straight in and focused mainly on the story. 
In some areas the game took long to get to the point or it felt like it was dragging. The enemies as you progressed felt good as you got stronger they start to feel on your level or a bit easier to challenge. Specifically the boss fights felt difficult as the parry system took a while to master but once you get the hang of it - its a blast. The game mentions its ' soul like' and I personally feel that is far from the truth - yes some aspects such as the adventure or waves of enemies plus  the save station but other than that not much of a soul like game.
This game made me want to come back each time and finish it even after hours of not playing, I think a game+ would be great in a few weeks/months but right after completion not really.

I would of loved the game more if the travelling system were more open world where you could be in space for example and visit more planets, in total there are 7 but only 5 that are completely free to explore and it can become a bit boring once you have completed everything. 

The combat does take a while to get use it, I loved the fact to that you could build onto Cal and choose what abilities to master, as you progress it feels as if the Padawan actually is turning into the Jedi Knight.

The bounty hunters were the one thing I disliked, they would respawn in very difficult times just before you have a boss fight or you don't have a save station nearby, this was a mechanic I disliked but once you cleared them they never respawn again.

Overall the feel of the game is amazing - the story is great. I personally was gobsmacked right at the end of the game, the whole premise of the game was to find the Holocrom and ""restore the Jedi"" just for Cal to break it. Other than that I still think this game takes you on a ride and I mean who wouldn't want to see the Sith Lord Dark Vader himself.
I think this is a must have for any star wars fan - I would rate the game a 8/10 and would recommend others to give it a try.",1708450926,1708450926,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's some fan service in there too, for good measure, and the story is mostly convincing and conveniently wrapped at the end. 

The game starts off pretty good, and the ending level is really great, but the middle is a slog. They could have just cut the three planets in between and sell it as a 4 hour masterpiece. 

The absence of any sort of fast travel (save for jumping planet to planet on your ship, thankfully) is pretty bad for a modern game, but abysmal and frustrating for a game that gates functional elements (health packs) behind exploration and secrets. You're either doomed to finish most of the game with just two, or spend a quarter of the game backtracking in search of secrets. 

Some of the environments are good, and some of the exploration is pretty neat, but there are plenty of stages that are uninspired and with frustrating level design. The progression of getting your skills 'back' makes sense narratively, but it means you're only spending a small fraction with the full arsenal, and this feels bad. 

Enemy variety is probably as low as it gets, and it's not an issue with stormtroopers - after all, how many ranks can there be - but wildlife could have afforded to be more varied throughout the vast galaxy. Combat is fine but never as engaging as the souls-like formula would expect it to be; bosses are thankfully easy enough to make up for the lack of finesse. Again, apart from the last level, where density and variety finally clicked, most of it feels off. 

There's still plenty of bugs in the game, even after the sequel got some fixes already, but nothing overly disturbing. You can feel like a speedrunner hacking through walls and invisible ropes even just playing normal! The most game breaking part is the EA launcher not launching the game at all, especially on Steam Deck (where it's decent once/if it starts).

I had a few issues with falling through the map or glitching through walls, which would lead to falling off the map, but since you rarely die from falling, and respawn very close to where you were before you fell, it wasn't a huge issue for me.

The mechanics are extremely clunky as there has been too many times where i jump for an objective and i constantly miss or am 95% there and the character doesn't execute. The story is predictable and the story line is kind of dumb, just because the main character some how forgets all his training. The game puts in you a memory of training during game play. I absolutely hated having to go back to previous planets just to get that ONE chest, or that ONE path i couldn't reach because, and again, you forget your training. The game constantly has you looking for chests that only give you cosmetics and are useless. The saber/bd1 character get absolutely random upgrades throughout the game which makes you feel like no matter how many enemies you kill, or objectives you complete, it doesn't matter because there's a random work bench around the corner. Leveling is arbitrary as you never get a consistent amount of experience.

Graphics look good, really good for it's age, runs easy too. But I am now at a point where I have to stop playing because the gameplay is just too broken to keep going, there is zero fun in this. I only spent £4 on this game and the hours I've played so far are 80% just repeating the same shit over and over.

I had several game breaking bugs of things not moving or moving without me, blocking progression forcing me to kill myself.

The controls are a nightmare, literally broken on PC where the dodge is on Y, lol? And on controller the triggers aren't even used for anything in combat. The controls couldn't have been done more unintuitive...

95% of the gameplay is figthing animals and climbing ledges 3 hours in....

Movement feels too slow for half of the mechanics, dodging to short, jumping too short, some attacks take forever until your movement is unblocked again. Running freely on the other hand is super quick as well as turning around and jumping up

In fights against bosses the camera non stops gets pushed away due to walls or dodging making it super difficult to keep track of enemies, the supposed ""tracking/focus"" function straight up doesn't work for me.

For some dumb reason they've used fixed save point location in the linear levels. When you die fighting a boss you have to spent minutes each time running back for another try. The most frustrating thing in the game if you want to play on hard

The fighting should be fun, but for some reason the blocking/dodging/attack feels clonky and just not triggering correctly

Since the gameplay relies completely on the blocking and dodging mechanics, this breaks the game further since it's done so badly that the difficulty levels are either relying completely on executing the combat to perfection or it makes it so easy that there is no combat gameplay left. No inbetween... I started on hard but the issues with the camera and controls overshadows the actual gameplay. Going down even to normal pretty much removes the combat since you just press A to kill everything. On the easy mode/Game Journo mode it's pretty much just walk through the levels

Idk if I come back to this again later, but for now I'm so fed up with this shit trying to make it work to at least see the story, let alone ""enjoy"" the game",1708386881,1708386881,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

An awful journey+good end game type of experience from the era of Dark Souls

***

I have played through this on Jedi Grandmaster with two stems and one late game accidental health improvement and
[h1]Cauliflower Broflovski I : Cosplay Survivor[/h1]
Is not a jedi game.

You are a former jedi temple trainee and a welder from Bracca, yet you can't Qui-Gon a door.
Slash a naked person 4-5 times with a lightsaber, and they are still alive, yet, if they touch you two times with what looks like a stone club, you are dead. 
Opponents [b]parry[/b] your saber with a club.
You use the improved force push/pull on purge troopers and the only damage troopers take is cringe.

In other words, in this game you are less of a jedi and more of a random person from SWcon with some prince of persia level acrobatic skills.

So roll and dodge and roll and dodge and roll and dodge to the end titles as you chip away at the enemies big D health bar, while you pretend it's not just another Dark Souls evening.

Now, to be objective, after the titles, it [b]does[/b] get much much better. 
Every ability is unlocked, so you can finally explore the locations, which have some good music and art. 
Additionally, a game feature is unlocked, that allows you to design and stage great battles against the AI, basically set up your own arena.

Which is some good gameplay, but why the 40+ hours wait, though?

This game should probably be taken to Bracca for refitting, as it has a very solid artistic and fight system core, rendered completely unenjoyable by the decision to time gate everything and buff up endless waves of trash, that nobody asked for in the first place.

I'm typically a fan of games with tons of open-world exploration, but Fallen Order really only has about 5 hours of it. I wish there was more to do on each of the planets you explore throughout the main story, but the quality of what we do get is definitely the highlight of this game. The story/characters are really well written, as is the soundtrack. I found myself emotionally attached to multiple characters by the end, and am definitely looking forward to playing the sequel.

There wasn't too much in terms of character customization, as there were only 5 base different outfits to choose from, but thankfully there were tons of ponchos and jackets to unlock that covered the base outfits, keeping the MC's appearance exciting. I loved the amount of lightsaber customization as well, though I wish we could make more subtle changes rather than only being allowed to change full sections, but like I said I loved the options we were given, so I'm not too disappointed.

Oh, and I shouldn't fail to mention that the combat in the game is slow to unlock, but incredibly fun once you level up enough.

Even though the main character is a padawan, there is no excuse for how weak lightsabers feel or how there is barely any flow to the combat. Combat feels simultaneously stiff and floaty because of how this game prioritizes being ""cinematic"" to the detriment of everything else.

If I could describe this game in one word it would be: jank. This is the jankiest AAA game I have ever played and I can't believe the review scores it got from mainstream outlets.

This game plays like a worse version of Tomb Raider 2016 with a much worse version of Sekiro's combat. For those who have played FF7R and were annoyed by the amount of gaps you had to squeeze through, be prepared for quadruple that amount in this game, plus lots of climbing sections and ""exciting"" scripted sequences where you slide down collapsing terrain or have control taken away from you to watch pointless bullshit. There are a couple sequences in particular where you watch NPCs from a control room as they kill a bunch of enemies. These were supposed to make the NPCs look badass but they were animated so poorly it just made me laugh.

Putting all that aside, I think the decision to try and implement a weighty combat system where you have to commit to your attacks via animation locking was a bad choice. That makes sense in a Fromsoft game but in Star Wars, lightsabers are just metal rods with plasma beams shooting out. There is no weight there.

This game does have some decent story moments and the human characters were fine. Debra Wilson was a good character and she's basically shifted her career into being a video game character at this point so she didn't bother me. However, Forest Whitaker shows up as a rebel leader on one of the planets which was a very wtf immersion-breaking moment [edit: apparently he is reprising his role from Rogue One which doesn't change my opinion that he isn't a very good actor]. I don't really care to list the few good things I have to say about this game because they don't make up for the amount of bad.

Don't waste your time with this game. If you like cinematic games go play Tomb Raider or God of War or TLOU. If you like good action combat games go play Sekiro, which does everything this game does but much much better.",1708191154,1708194062,False,4,0,0.54214245080947876,0,True,False,False

Instead of a Jedi we could as well control a soap bubble. What a waste for the good graphics, characters and animations.

Biggest pain point: the mechanic of dying and respawning is awful. All enemies are respawned at exact static positions if you ""meditate"" (refill energy etc.), but things like opened doors etc. are rememberd even after you died. This does not make any sense in a linear story game. Why not a normal save, die, reset-to-saved-state mechanic?

Second pain point: the level design is horrible. Better don't ask how enemies got to the place where they are. Don't ask why every path or building is an obstacle course. Don't ask why you can climb the craziest things but then suddenly can't grab a 3m high edge. Don't ask why you can do craziest jumps, where it was intended by the level designer, but hit an invisible wall in other places.

Third pain point: the poor balancing. 80% of the game were manageable on difficulty ""jedi master"" (3/4) without any problems, But in some cases I had to change it to ""story mode"" (1/4). It seemed impossible even on ""jedi knight"" (2/4). On the lowest difficulty, however, it was way too easy.

Positive points: The story was OK. Atmosphere, characters, dialogs etc. are actually pretty good. But the fact that you have absolutely no influence on the story (choice for the dark side maybe?) means that I can't really make a recommendation here either.

In the end, I'm just glad that I can free up the disk space again.",1707653749,1708192315,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The movement is disappointing and inaccurate with SO many bugs. Target ting is horrible with AND without auto lock enabled.

The UI is horribly designed, with only a tiny number and bar on the bottom left to indicate healing items and total health.

the Story is the only redeeming quality, but it is so easily predictable. I am known for not being able to see stuff coming, and I called the story out multiple times for being easy to predict.

The only real thing the the game has going for it, is that there no fall damage, but the devs honestly may have just been too lazy to code it

There is NO way to skip any part of the full hour of cut scenes.

Worst of all, YOU CAN'T EVEN LOAD THE GAME WITHOUT MESSING WITH THE GAME FILES! The game automatically loads a bugged version that won't load properly.

While I personally enjoyed the original movie trilogy, I've never been fond of the more recent movies and lore etc. So, these are my unbiased opinions based just on the game itself.

Visually, it's quite stunning with with good voice acting and competent cinematic's etc.
Running on the PC I had no errors, lock-ups or crashes etc, but did encounter the occasional camera glitch that did some funky things but this only happened a couple of times through my entire 40+ hr play through. The audio sound effects and music are well done and with no noticeable issues either.

As for the story, I just couldn't get into it at all really, and I found it somewhat of a chore to stick at it and complete which should speak volumes.

My biggest gripe though is with the game play itself.
I was hoping for a more traditional type of Star Wars game along the lines of the Dark Forces series but this game felt more like Tomb Raider with a light sabre and with no gun-play whatsoever.

I despise platforming type games in general, which this one is chock full of which just annoyed the hell out of me. I play solely for entertainment... not to be repeatedly pissed off. 

The encounters with enemy AI and bosses are reasonably good, with a good variety of different opponents (and wildlife) and the acquired force powers are quite satisfying when pulled off. But the combat ends up being all too brief and quickly forgotten due to yet another irritating section of platforming. 

I pumped more hours into this one just trying to find all the collectables on each level but after completing the story I just found no desire to want to go back and try to 100% it, or start a New Game+ play through. Many of the collectables require force abilities to reach that you don't acquire until the later stages of the game which will require a TON of back tracking.

All up, if your a fan of the Star Wars universe in general, you probably will get some enjoyment out of it, but if your on the fringe like myself (or despise platforming) then I'd only recommend purchasing if on sale or avoid completely.

I was about to give up until I saw a guide on the community hub that explained how to instead force use the older origin app of EA and disable the demon that is EA play. I fresh installed origin and used the installer for a patch mentioned in guide from github. I am now free. I can use the steam overlay as I should and am free of the demon's grasp.

So glad that I bought the game on sale and not paid a cent more. Don't buy this game if you value your gameplay time. 

It is very beautifully designed and plays well but the crashes was not attended to before release on PC and even after release it still is a mess. I wonder how they even tested this game when it was in Beta stage bcs it seems it was just ported straight from console version and not tested on PC properly. Even the run as administrator setting coupled with disabling full screen optimization settings does nothing to lessen the crashes.

I can’t believe I missed this game until 2024. Back in 2019, I heard this game is a soul-like game with lightsaber. For me, “soul-like” is a turn off word, because I don’t like “soul” games.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is almost perfect in every aspect, I think it’s even better at making players feel like they're living in a Star Wars’ world. 
It took me 30 hours to 100% the game, good amount of content for the money. And I bought this game for only 6 USD, it’s a steal!

The only thing I don’t like about this game is no fast travel. It’s very very annoying, even frustrating, to navigate the map, especially if you are a completionist. I literally spent 30 minutes just trying to find a way to a tomb I had visited before, then I found out that although I am right next to the tomb, I have to run to the start of the map to go the only accessible way to reach the tomb. So stupid, so irritating. But good news they add fast travel in the next game: Jedi Survivor.

This game is a must play, especially when It is on sale for 6 USD, buy it, don’t hesitate! JUST DO IT!

I loved every moment of Cal's journey. I bought both Survivor and Fallen Order on the Lunar Sale and it was a 100% worth it.  This game is beautiful, very well written and extremely fun to play. It has the perfect length, with an ""I will collect everything and get all the achievements"" style gameplay, it took me around 30 hours to complete the game. And I can positively say that I would be happy to continue to play it for another 50. I am writing this review as I wait for Survivor to download and i can't wait to continue the story.

[h2]Technical Issues[/h2]
Like most Unreal Engine 4 and 5 games using DX12 backend, this game comes packed with random hitching and performance problems that occasionally caused a fall or death. These were annoying, but not so severe that they ruined the game experience entirely. What did nearly ruin the experience was the fact that I almost didn't get to play the game at all, as the EA launcher was outright preventing me from launching the game for some inexplicable reason (as other reviews have mentioned). I only managed to work-around by circumventing the launcher entirely, and that by itself is a non-starter and should be reason enough to avoid the game entirely, but I'll go on to detail the rest of my complaints.

[h2]Souls-like...?[/h2]
Though it's billed as a souls-like game, in actuality Jedi: Fallen Order has very little in common with the souls-like genre and far more in common with a metroidvania. The only aspect that it shares with a souls title is the ability to permanently lose XP if you die twice without regaining it. However, you only need to land one hit on the enemy that killed you to regain your XP, which is generally super easy to do. On top of that, your XP can only be spent on acquiring new skills and there are no RPG stats to speak of, and the most any skill costs is 3 full bars, so it's rare to ever be running around with a meaningful amount of XP to lose in the first place. The addition of this bloodstain-like system serves no real functional purpose in the game, but it's mostly harmless in its implementation.

[h2]Dated Gameplay[/h2]
This game is a hair's-breadth away from being an on-rails experience (again in spite of being marketed as a souls-like). The vast majority of your time will be spent climbing fixed paths up walls, or going down fixed paths on giant slides, or swinging along fixed paths from ropes, or squeezing dreadfully slowly through nonsensically placed gaps in walls. The game makes a point of showing you all these mechanics during the tutorial and then proceeds to use them ad-nauseum throughout the rest of the game. These are the kinds of mechanics that give the superficial appearance of gameplay, but in actuality provide zero challenge and next to zero ability to explore or play. In 2005 this would have been acceptable, but in 2019 this is just sad. It doesn't help that the combat feels incredibly clunky and inconsistent, making the only real ""gameplay"" part of this game pretty miserable to play.

[h2]Half-baked Animations[/h2]
The in-game character animation in this game is so laughably bad that I'd normally have a hard time believing this was a major studio title... if it weren't for the fact that this is pretty much in line come to expect from major studios over the last decade. The animations combined with constant clipping problems on both characters and world geometry makes the game look incredibly amateur and/or unfinished, depending on what spin you wanna take. Cutscene animations look fine, but it's clear to me that this product was rushed out to the door to meet a release deadline.

[h2]No-bake Plot[/h2]
You know that one RedLetterMedia video about how they love Rogue One? That was all I could think about while playing this game. The story and writing attempts to hit all of the major beats that a typical post-Disney Star Wars product tries to hit, but it does it in a way that feels jumbled, contrived, and incredibly forced (no pun intended). No one in this game has any kind of appeal as a character, and everyone talks exactly how real people don't. Our protagonist is visually intended to evoke the idea of a cowboy, but he looks and acts like an innocent child and sounds like the most boring man you've ever met. Plot beats and character moments happen with almost no setup or coherence, but then everyone will bring them up constantly afterwards as if trying to brainwash you into caring about it happening. This feels to me like a rough-draft of a story, and one that even at its best would be incredibly by-the-numbers.

[h2]TL;DR[/h2]

In the modern day when the quality of star wars feels like a coin flip at times it's refreshing to see that there are still gems out there.
When the game is fun, the characters intresting and the story engaging, thats when star wars is at it's best.

I managed to stay away from spoilers all these years. Never had the time to really sit down and play it. I had no idea it was a souls-like. I absolutely despise souls-like games and how they deal with difficulty. Instead of creating difficulty through mechanics this game uses seer damage against you and the fact that enemies come back to file after you meditate. Maybe in some settings it makes sense, but not in the scope of this game. It would make sense if enemies would respawn after you leave a planet and come back. Given the amount of back tracking you have to do this quickly becomes very very tiring and, at least for me, completely tedious. It is good how they walled off areas according to what skills you have but going through the same area more than twice is something I personally consider lazy development and lazy design. 
The back tracking also kills the pacing of the story.
The game's score is amazing and along with the story are just about everything that I liked about the game.
The lightsaber feels like a glorified shiny club, with a few race exceptions where it actually feels like a lightsaber but this is limited to cutscenes and a handful of enemies. It looks amazing though, it just feels silly that it can cut through blaster proof metal but struggle with a giant bi-pedal troll all the while in the same trolls killing animation shows the lightsaber cutting effortlessly through it.


[h3] <u] Pros: [/u] [/h3]
[ul]
[li] Saber animations look very cool. [/li]
[li] Story is very good, it pulls you in immediately. [/li]
[li] Music is beyond amazing. [/li]
[li] It is good to see a star wars game with this modern technology. [/li]
[li] The story's antagonists, when not part of the wildlife, are very good. [/li]
[li] The action sequences are very intense. [/li]
[li] The game's environment's, when not going through them for the 20th time, are stunning and feel real. [/li]
[/ul]

[h3] [u] Cons: [/u] [/h3]
[ul]
[li] For a Jedi you seem to enjoy killing animals a lot. [/li]
[li] Throughout a great deal of the game you are mostly fighting wildlife. [/li]
[li] Some of the game's most difficult enemies are, again, wildlife. [/li]
[li] The whole skill tree system feels unnecessary, included just because it's impossible to not have skill trees these days. [/li]
[li] The amount of paths in a level makes them feel open, but you quickly run into impassable obstacles if you are not meant to go that way yet and it feels lazy, not to mention that you then have to go back the way you came again. [/li]
[li] The amount of backtracking is atrocious. Going through the same platforming sections again and again, fighting the same enemies again and again feels mindbogglingly boring or forced upon the player. [/li]
[li] Hiding upgrade collectibles (increase HP or Force) behind skill-locked areas makes the idea to include the same functionality within the skill tree weird and vice versa. Yet another badly implemented souls-like mechanic. [/li]
[/ul]

All in all the game suffers from some badly implemented ideas just to ride the souls-like train. The whole pacing of the gameplay takes away from the overall story and very good and interesting characters. You spend far more time dealing with pestering wildlife and massacring natives than a jedi game should, not to mention that as a star wars game there should at least be some degree of choice weather you are more inclined towards the light or the dark. In general, future installments should draw more inspiration from the star killer saga than other souls-like games.",1707658591,1707668306,False,2,0,0.508474588394165039,0,True,False,False

The first 20 mins or so of the game are almost breath taking with the quality of graphics and how the environment is so impressive.   
However about an hour in you realise that once you strip the initial wow factor away and the story is now held back between long map sections of repetitive boring content.   The biggest problems are that the game tries to be a Tomb raider clone and fails quiet hard at it.  It also tries to add Dark souls elements to the combat and saving system which the game just doesn't want or need.   The combat is good at first but then just adds stupid enemies for the sake of it which just messes the combat and camera into a frustrating experience.

Get this game only on Sale, this game has boring in early gameplay and tries to do many things, exploration like tomb raider and challenge with souls like option combined but somehow it couldnt reach such balance although it has better gameplay in late game and decent entertainment in it.

Positive:
1. Graphic is good.
2. MC and others voice acting are suitable.
3. Middle to end cutscenes and story are intense and entertaining.
4. Late gameplay with upgrades make combat smoother although not exactly reach the right point.

Negative:
1. The general star wars story regarding the Empire vs lone Jedi with rebels is already too overused. Boring.
2. The gameplay from start to middle is Awful and Boring. Parkour and dull light saber fighting. I mean at this point I can see why George Lucas make trooper rifle to be slow laser beam, if they are fast as bullets, Jedi would not be main character. Map puzzle feels not as logical as tomb raider, instead more like fantasy like sonic hedgehog map.
3. Back to how this game tries to combine tomb raider and souls like but somehow it couldnt, plus its early gameplay feels terrible, clunky and not smooth.
4. Camera is not perfect and no fast travel in planet.

That said, achievements don't seem to work anymore, as those were tied to Origin in some fashion and the new EA app that replaced it doesn't function correctly. Or at all, really. Isn't EA just the greatest company ever? 
On the bright side, that means there is now genuinely no reason not to use launch option commands to completely bypass that garbage piece of invasive information gathering software. Just do yourself a favour and don't install the EA app at all.

This game is some of the most fun I've had with a Star Wars game. Although the combat lacks dismemberment like earlier SW efforts like Jedi Outcast and Force Unleashed, it still feels fun, easy to learn and hard to master. The puzzles are successful brainteasers, controls feel smooth, and level design sprawling yet easy to navigate around thanks to shortcuts and a handy-dandy map.

And writing/plot-wise? It might appear to be a generic macguffin hunt a la Rise of Skywalker, but unlike Rise, the story is actually fun with characters who you care about and some actually good concepts that are built on throughout the game. Cal's relationship with BD in particular is the highlight of the entire game for me, as is how his character arc progresses overtime. It all culminates in one of the best endings of all time, a climax so intense and gratifying, that I'd dare not spoil because I want you to experience it for yourself.

Overall, with fantastic writing and characters, exquisite action-adventure gameplay and combat, and even solid sound design, voice acting and music, Jedi: Fallen Order is a must-play for any true fan of that Galaxy Far, Far Away.",1706651785,1707562889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

10/10! 
And I'm editing my original review since this is my 2nd play through, which I beat today and I friggin binge played this game for like 10 days... and GUYS! It's still freaking awesome! It's like a favorite movie you watch every 2-3 years giving yourself just enough time to miss it and forget all the fine details. If I don't edit this again 2-3 years from now... it's because I died happy because I played this freaking awesome game!

1. Best character development I've ever seen in a game. 
+
2. Best telling of a story without making you feel like you're watching a movie, but rather makes you feel like your actions are really what help drive the story forward.
+
3. Amazing level design!  
+
4. MUSIC IS PERFECT
=
10.... out of 10

NOT A SPOILER... just a warning for you who want to have 100% complete at the end of the game... You can't go back to the Last level after you beat it. So get your stuff while there... but if you don't you will only be missing out on side story content, not boosters for stats or skins or anything like that, but they are pretty easy to find on the last level.

You only get to play this for the first time once so do yourself a favor and just play it! Don't worry about walkthroughs or any of that. Or do... it's your life... go ahead and ruin it one game at a time!

DON'T WORRY! I know you emotionally torn Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Elden Ring survivors... this isn't the abusive lover you're afraid it might be!!! 

There's 3 difficulty settings... even on the hardest one my first time through I maybe died 30 times... as apposed to 100s of times on dark souls or Sekiro... Let's just call it an even thousand. If you just want to run through and decimate then go on Story mode and it's still a freaking awesome ride and not really challenging.. just fun, and you still have to solve those puzzles. AND IF YOU DIE The guy who killed you holds onto your xp just for that level,,, and if you die again... HE STILL HOLDS ONTO THAT XP... you never lose your xp. You just go tickle him, not even kill him, just hit him once or force sneeze in their direction and they give you all your lost xp back. 

It's meant to be enjoyed... not train you for a POW camp when they torture you.

LASTLY:
BONUS CONTENT!!! I personally loved the 3-4 hours worth of behind the scenes and the making of Since I'm an aspiring indi-game developer, so that alone was worth more than full price of the game on release day (for me personally). I took like 10 pages of notes.

I tried reallocating controls in the settings, but it wouldn't let me assign this function to another key.
There may well be a solution to this, but the I gave up pretty quickly because the game seemed pretty crap anyway. I got it because I wanted something mindless and fun where I could jump around and hit stuff with my lightsaber, but I spent most of those thirty minutes watching cutscenes or moving in the strict, linear path the game had laid down for me. Why is it that so many games designed for console seem to be barely interactive and don't like giving players options?

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is nothing more than a blatant attempt to cash in on the Star Wars franchise with a subpar game that wouldn't be able to stand on its own if it were not part for the use of the Star Wars name. Overall the game is a solid C- or D+ at best. The mechanics are clunky, the plot is disjointed, the character development is minimal, and you spend an absurd amount of time bouncing around doing parkour type nonsense and cave exploration instead of actually being immersed in a Star Wars plot.

The game is a miscarriage best avoided.",1707418222,1707418222,False,3,0,0.497099071741104126,0,True,False,False

This game is a treat and truly makes yourself feel immersed in the world that players no matter the level of knowledge of the IP can enjoy.

The story is mostly self contained within the universe but it never makes you feel as if this isn't a story worth telling. The combat is fluid and fun which allows you to tackle combat encounters in many different ways. Exploration is heavily encouraged and is always rewarding with many collectables and upgrades. There are many ways to also interact with the world from movement and force abilities that constantly increase through the story and make revisiting areas enjoyably and picking up bits of lore and world building you may have missed. The game is decently lengthy but never pads for time. Though when trying to go for all achievements it isn't so helpful as to showing you where to find items and makes some areas require really long treks without shortcuts to revisit.

This is an overall great game and a enjoyable experience throughout with great lore and gameplay. It is well worth picking up on sale or alone if you are so inclined.",1697485052,1707385870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is a little clunky, more or less like the Elden Ring one. And the lightsaber gives a baseball bat vibe. Nothing dealbreaking for me.

Biggest issues are Electronic Arts as a publisher, and their shaenanigans with their apps and things like that. And the optimization is quite bad. Since the game is a little old it should work well on most computers, but as always with EA, they don't give time to polish such things.

[i]Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a fluid, elegant game with a Souls-Like inspired combat that failed miserably, a Sekiro parry and stance mechanic that worked quite well beneath a beautiful Tomb Raider exploration and movement veneer. It's a good game overall, but only because it's a Star Wars game. Would this game be worth it if it weren't a Star Wars game? No, if we eliminate the lightsaber, the force powers and the Star Wars universe we have an average game with nothing to say to the gaming industry.[/i]

Since its big brother Jedi Survivor was released you can get this amazing game for 5 dollars and tons of hours. The graphics are really nice and every planet has an amazing atmosphere. The story you undertake through the game is awesome and keeps expanding with twists and turns, and there is good character development. I love how the skill tree / force skills are progressed slowly and evenly through the game so it is balance and it is like Cal is actually learning through his journey, as he is supposed to be a padawan at the beginning of the story.

Then there is the game play. The game play is amazing. I really enjoy the combat in this game, which is a parry combat system, where you heavily rely on blocking and counter attacking to kill you enemy's. While some people might not like this, as you play on, you earn more skills, attacks and even a weapon upgrade. I love this as it allows you to keep refining how you like to fight, especially if you one who doesn't like the parry mechanics as it offers other ways to take out your enemy's, and just keeps the combat fresh.

I also want to bring up BD-1, as he is your awesome companion with some awesome mechanics. I really like how he carry's all the stims ( healing ) and how you can find and collect more through your play through. As you go on you can also find upgrades that allow BD-1 to unlock doors and pathways that you could never get through yourself. What I really wanted to bring up was his map. The holomap that BD-1 has is the most helpful map I have ever seen in a game. I love how it shows you every path, and tells you where you can explore, what is locked, and what locked paths can be oped using a force power or solving a puzzle. I just find this so useful when exploring or trying to find my way to the objective.

The other game play mechanics like the puzzles and parkour are really fun as well. You can wall run, climb, swing, double jump, slide down slopes, all of which help you move through the game. and just like everything else, you slowly learn more of these skills as you play, unlocking new areas and secrets to be discovered. The puzzles are a good break from combat as you have to use if to unlock doors, solve the tombs, or just get a secrete. 

So, if your looking for a great story driven action combat star wars game, this is for you. I really recommend this game anyone and everyone, as it goes on sale for 5 dollars when it is really worth all 40 dollars. There is tons of constant, places to explore, puzzles to solve, and enemy's to fight. When in doubt if you hate the game refund it, but you should definitely give it a try. 10/10 would play again.",1706977204,1706977204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being a Star Wars fan in recent years is not an easy path. Accepting failure after failure of what has been done with the amazing story is quite tough. However, as Saw Gerrera said - Hope still Burns. And I am writing here not to complain but instead to praise.

[b]Jedi: Fallen Order[/b] is an amazing action adventure story which takes place after the horrible events after Order 66. The  main character – Cal Kestis was a padawan when the Clones betrayed the Jedi. Now – Kestis is a young man and probably one of the few Jedi left and he is on his path to do whatever it takes to complete his own apprenticeship and to re-establish the Jedi Order.

The game combines a few genres: it is a story adventure, full of amazing cinematic cutscenes; it could be one of the sequels of [b]Tomb Raider[/b] or simply a parkour simulator.

In my opinion, the scenario of the game is very well written especially when it comes to flashbacks, revealing the times when Cal Kestis was a padawan before the Empire. No spoiler alert, but we can actually see how Cal Kestis matures and becomes a better person and a more skilled Jedi.


 [h1]We Will Always Struggle, But That Is The Test. It's The Choice To Keep Fighting That Makes Us Who We Are [/h1]

Of course, the game is not perfect. On my first play though the game was a pain. I remember I was stuck on some points for ages as I couldn’t perfectly calculate the appropriate amount of time when I’d need to jump or grab or jump and grab or jump jump and grab. 
The main disadvantage for me was lack of quick travel between the “safe points” or a proper navigation on the planets which made the greedy part of me stop chasing achievements. It was so frustrating when I’d get to a faraway place and then by accident would step on a slide which would lead to the very beginning. 

There are no side quests however I believe it is quite justified. Come on guys, we are trying to be secret, the Jedi are dead, etc…
So it is quite alright that the game focuses on the main quest and solo explorations.
What I loved instead is that the Force Echoes tells us more of the story behind the beautiful landscapes. It makes perfect sense and reveals a bit of the tragedy of the Jedi (and not Darth Plagueis the wise).
Customization is one of the disappointing things in the game. After 10 open chests it became extremely boring to  discover more customizations for your lightsaber. But OK it is more or less alright. But who the hell would hide around these planets 20 different (not really) kinds of poncho? Zeffo? The Night Sisters have a new fashion designer? I’d understand if the chests would contain some planet-inspired costumes, but please no 100500 shades of brown-green poncho. It is absolutely ridiculous when you think about the game and its story. 



 [h1]Keep Failing. Keep Getting Back Up. That Is The Only Way To Succeed [/h1]

But despite all the disadvantages and my nitpicking, the  [b]Jedi: Fallen Order [/b] is able to provide a great experience not only to Star Wars fans, but I’m sure it will be interesting to anyone who is curious about Lara Croft-like games and on top of that I actually would have a real story. 
I really see and hope that the potential of the story will be open In all its beauty, connecting the games and the TV shows. I really hope it won’t be wasted.

P.S. To have a saberstaff and do whoosh whoosh – is actually an incredible feeling!
P.S.S. To reflect the stormtroopers' shots with a saberstaff doing whoosh whoosh is actually cooler!

Its chock full of repetitive, generic AAA stuff we've seen in hundreds of other games. Stuff like platforming, pointless collectibles designed to pad out progression, janky combat, surface deep pseudo RPG systems, and a terrible story. I'm surprised there weren't hacking minigames and stealth added as well. 

To start with, the platforming gets old very quickly. Its got wall running, jumping, sliding, etc. but to such an extent it feels more like a Tomb Raider game. Or a Disneyland amusement park. Its a bit hard to take a game seriously when you're bouncing all around the place like fun house and doing stuff that would be impossible even for jedi. And to make matters worse, it sometimes doesn't work: Cal lets go of an edge for no reason, doesn't grab it at all, etc.

Combat has a similar issue. Its not responsive, Cal often doesn't do what you want him to. But I think it was actually by design. If you take any amount of damage, Cal gets stun and loses his action. Even if you spent force points on it. You still lose the points, but the action doesn't connect. And he gets stunned for so long that by the time you recover, you get hit by another attack. Its essentially ""dodge every attack perfectly, or get stunlocked"" just like Dark Souls. This is what made me hate the combat. Its 5 minutes of rolling and blocking, make 1 attack, then repeat. Combine this with how ridiculously tanky bosses and certain elite enemies are (having a second healthbar you have to damage just to open them up for 1 hit at a time) and it makes combat feel like a slog. Fortunately, you can cheese it sometimes with force powers, but you only get 3 of them, which is incredibly lame, and they're progress gated like all other unlocks. 

So you're not actually doing ""builds"" per se, even though that defeats the point of having a skill system. I hate this in action games that pretend to be ARPGs, but there is no build diversity. So instead it just feels like mandatory grinding. You're expected to unlock every incremental bonus because the game is balanced around it, so its juts action with the ""RPG"" being extra steps. 

The most annoying thing by far though is that Cal's lightsaber is basically a pool noodle. You can hit enemies multiple times, and they just get red scratches. Even when they finally die, they don't get cut it half or anything (at least the human ones), just fall bloodlessly to the ground. It doesn't feel like you're actually a Jedi with a lightsaber, which ruins the Star Warts vibe completely. I'm guessing they did these for family friendly reasons or some nonsense because the Disney Overlords said so, which is even more annoying. 

Lastly, lets talk about the story. Here's a spoiler warning, but the story is so thin and nonsensical it really doesn't matter. Anyway, the main plot goes something like this: you meet a robot that had its memory wiped, except for a hologram of a dead Jedi telling you there is a secret vault built by ancient, extinct aliens with a holocron in it containing a map of force sensitive children. You then have to go from planet to planet, randomly unlocking the droids memory in random places for seemingly no reason, until eventually you find out there is a mcguffin that opens the vault.

How did the aliens know about the force sensitive children in the present day? Don't know. Why did they record and protect this information? Don't know. Why did they hide the key to the vault on another planet? Don't know. Who were these aliens and how did they get wiped out? Don't know. How did the dead jedi learn about this? Don't know. Why did he wipe the droid's memory and send us on pointless quests? Don't know. And so on...I mean, there is literally a part where you're exploring an ancient tomb, and the only interesting thing that happens there is ""oh look, these people drew trees on their walls. Guess that means they want to Kashyyyk because its the only planet that has trees amirite? Now you have to go there too."" Remember how cool the Rakatan empire was in KOTOR? Yeah, so do I. 

Steer clear of this one. Its corporate Disney garbage with the same level of writing ability displayed in their litany of crappy reboots and endless spin off series like Ahsoka. Replay KOTOR instead.",1706915986,1706915986,False,4,0,0.528024256229400635,0,True,False,False

The most gripping part of the game was Cal's journey as a Jedi after a traumatic experience with the Empire betraying him, almost killing him and his master. I enjoyed watching Cal become more comfortable with the Force as he gained confidence that his mission was worth fighting for. I also enjoyed witnessing the side character, Seere's growth alongside him. However, I must say I was quite confused about how she found him on that scrap yard at the beginning in the first place.

I enjoyed the fighting mechanics as a Jedi. However, there was not enough variety in enemies; they got stale within the first three hours of the game. I absolutely hated the maps of the game. The progression of them was so in your face and forced, to the point where the maps felt artificial, and I was most uninterested in exploring them. It was so bad, in fact, that I wanted to quit the game, but its saving grace was its story.

The bugs were horrendous in the game, to the point where there were instances where I had to quit and load it again. There were also random funny bugs that were manageable to deal with. The fact I had to restart the game pissed me off, though; I was incredibly upset over that.

Overall in my opinion if you are in it for the game play its a pass however if you are here for the story I’d invest my time in this game. Ill be giving this game a pass since in the end despite the shitty maps, I did get some enjoyment from this game.

Pros 
- Story is interesting
- Gameplay is very Darksouls meets Metroidvania
- Ran fairly well on my main gaming PC. 

Cons
- Gameplay can feel unfair at times. Had to move the difficulty down to get through a few bosses. 
- Had a lot of issues on my Steam Deck. Crashes, inconsistent FPS. It's the only game I've played where updates made it worse. 
- EA launcher is garbage, and it was added after the fact in a later update. 
- Cloud saves were super inconsistent. But I suspect this is EA's fault.

I'll start with the good first.

The gameplay - The gameplay is one of its strongest point in my opinion.

That's pretty much it.
The graphics and textures are all right.
Everything else could use a lot of work.

Origin / EA App are both cancer and useless toxic spywares that we do not need, just because of this requirement, it is enough to give it a thumbs down, EA will have to learn the hard way at some point...

The map is kind of clunky, it could be a lot better.

The planets are few and limited, very linear.

The game wastes your time a lot, you can't fast travel back to your ship or to other planets, you have to waste time going back to your ship every single time.
You can't fast travel to any planets or anywhere for that matter, so you gotta waste time going into the ship and doing all the blablabla just to get on a planet.

The game doesn't have a lot of content, all we have as outfits are some ugly poncho, not cool.

Honestly, the main character isn't interesting, he looks like a Disney movie character...

Game isn't very difficult, unlike other games of the same genre, you won't be dying a lot.

So in the end, all that keeps me playing is the gameplay, otherwise everything else is a bit bad, i thought at least Kashyyyk would be enjoyable, it definitely wasn't.

In terms of gameplay, it could use some more powers for sure, but the base is there.

Something I liked a lot about this game is the feeling of progression, not only because Carl becomes better (unlocking skills and increasing his maximum life and force), but also because the player gets better.

Ana karakterimiz Cal Kestis, Order 66 sirasinda ustasini kaybetmis, padawan seviyesinde bir Jedi'dir. Order 66'dan sonra hayatta kalan Cal sonraki yillarda mekanik olarak calismaya devam eder. Bir gun arkadasiyla is sirasinda bir kaza olusur ve Cal, Force kullanmak zorunda kalir. Bunu yapar yapmaz da Imparatorluk engizisyonculari Cal'in ensesine dolusur. Gizemli iki kisi tarafindan kurtarilan Cal bu iki kisiden birisinin eski bir Jedi oldugunu ogrenir ve o Jedi'in amaci da Jedi Duzeni'ni yeniden kurmaktir ve Cal'den yardim ister. Hikaye girisi bu sekilde ve hikaye adina soyleyebilecegim seyler var. Acikcasi hikaye icin alinacak bir oyun olmasada iyi kotu siradan bir hikayesi oldugunu dusunuyorum. Ne cok guzel ne de cok kotu oyunu size oynatir. Olay orgusunde bir problem yok olmasi gerektigi gibi ilerliyor. Karakterlere isinamadim ben sadece. Normalde oyunlarda oyle cok ust duzey karakterler beklemem ancak buradakiler beni cidden sikti. Ozellikle guya eski Jedi olan karakter oyunun sonlarina dogru isin kiliciyla oyle hareketler yapiyorki insan vay demek yerine madem bu kadar gucluydun beni niye yordun diyor. Cunku karakterler oynanis sirasinda uzay gemisinde oturmaktan baska bir sey yapmiyorlar butun ayak isleri sizde. Final ise cok guzel olmus. (Spoiler)[spoiler] Darth Vader'i cok guzel yansitmislar ozellikle. [/spoiler] Tabii ki finalinde tatmin edici olmasinda son boss savasinin da bir katkisi var. Kisacasi karakter anlaminda cok da iyi degil ama oyunu oynarken sizi baymayacak kadar yeterli bir hikaye var oyunda.

[b] OYNANIS [/B]
Oyunda bir suru mekanik var. Oynanis kismi aksiyon ve platform olmak uzere iki kisma ayriliyor. Aksiyon kismindan baslarsam isin kilici ve Force kullanimi gayet guzel olmus. Isin kilicinin gorselligi bir yana vurus hissi cok tatmin edici. Ozellikle insan olmayan dusmanlara kritik attiginiz zaman onlari uzuvlarina kadar dogramak cok guzel. Kullanimi da cok cok rahat olmus. Kacma ve parry mekanikleri de oyuna guzel yedirilmis bir alistiniz mi cok zevk alirsiniz. Dusman cesitlilig de gayet zengin. Savasmak guzel ve eglenceli yani neticesinde. Platform ise biraz karisik diyebilirim. Guzel ve iyi calisiyor ancak arada sapitiyor. Ben buraya atlarim ya dedikten sonra kac kere game over ekranini gordugum oldu oyunda. Bes yere atlayamiyorsa bes yere daha atlayamiyor karakter ve bu hem stabiliteyi hemde oyuncunun sinirini bozan bir sey. Boyle bir ikilemde kalmaktansa level dizaynlari dogru durust olsa cok daha iyi olurmus. 

[b] METROIDVANINA [/B]
Oyunun en kotu oldugu yer burasi. Oyun ne kadar aksiyon macera oyunu olsada bir o kadar da metroidvanina ve bu taraf baya kotu olmus. En basta harita dizaynlari. Haritalar asiri komplex bir yapi da aslinda bunun iyi bir sey olmasi lazim ama unuttugumuz detay oyun 3D. 3D Metroidvanialarin az olmasinin sebeplerinden birisi ne kadar komplex olursa olsun oyuncu nereye gittigini cabucak kaybedebiliyor. Oyundaki harita sistemi de sag olsun ozellikle renk paletiyle size hic yardimci olmuyor ustune kostek oluyor. Dakikalarca ben buraya nerden geldim ve nerden cikacagim sorulariyla mal mal haritaya baktigim oldu. Metroidvania oyunlarin temeli kesfe dayanir ve siz kesfettikce hep gelisirsiniz. Bu oyunda o gelisme hissi de sifira yakin. En basinda kesfettikce buldugunuz seyler tamamen kozmetik karakterinize hicbir katkisi yok. Sadece yukleme ekranlarinda gordugunuz gemiye bile skin topluyorsunuz. Buldunuz 10 esyadan en az 7 si kozmetik ve bu kozmetikler insani o kadar hizli bayiyor ki. Hem asiri karmasik hemde odullendirmeyen bir sistem oldugundan oyunun yarisinda kefretmeyi biraktim. Karakter gelistirmeye bakarsak gelisim guzel olmus. Hem klasik metroidvania gelistirmeleri ve perk agacindan yetenek secme sistemi var oyunda. Bir RPG gibi matematiksel hesaplamalara girmenize gerek yok. Perk sistemi guzel. Cesit cesit yetenek var istedigini sec begen al durumu var ancak metroidvania yetenekleri daha iyi olabilirmis. En basta Ori ile karsilastirinca oyunun sonlarinda hayvan gibi bir karakteriniz oluyordu burada o durum yok. Kotu degil ama daha iyi olabilirmis.

[b] LEVEL DIZAYNI [/B]
Level dizaynlari guzel. Oyunda bazen acik dunyadan cikip kapali mekanlara giriyoruz ve buralar gayet iyi yapilmislar. Sagi solu belli yeterince komplex ve sizi bogmuyorlar. Tek sikintisi oyundaki bulmacalar. Oyundaki bulmacalar o kadar can sikici ki bir anda isin kiliciyla harikalar yaparken oyun size gel bulmaca coz diyor. Ve hepsinde internetten baktim cunku oyuncuya bulmacayi cozme hissi de vermeye ugrasmiyor. Bunu cozucem diye hirslanmaktan cok ekstra bir ayak isi, zorluk hissi veriyor insana. Ayri olarak da boss savaslarindan bahsedecegim. Boss savaslari guzeller. Ozellikle oyunun sonlarina dogru cikan iki tane isin kilici duellosu var ki bunlardan birisi son boss. Asiri zorlar ve tatmin edicilier. Son boss gordugum en zor bosslardan. Boss anlaminda gayet tatminkar. Bir de oyunda sinematik aksiyon sekanslari var. Yani olmasada olurmus ama olmasi arti yon katiyor tabii.

[b] TEKNIK [/B]
Grafikler guzel. Optimizasyon da guzel gibi sadece sacma sapan droplar giriyor arada. Duz yolda yururken bir anda drop girmesi insani baya sikiyor. Oyunun en patlamali catlamali yerlerinde drop girmezken buralarda girmesi baya garip. Ilk ciktiginda oyunda baya bug varmis sanirim ama 2022 de baya az ben bir kere gordum o da grafiksel bir bugdi.

[b] SONUC [/B]
Guzel savas mekanikleri, fena olmayan level dizaynlari ve boss savaslari derken Star Wars seven insanlarin oynamasi gereken bir oyun. Daha cok Star Wars icin alinabilecegini dusunuyorum cunku oyunun temel kolonlarindan birisi olan metroidvania tarafi baya kotu oyunda. Iyi ki oynamisim diyorum kendim Star Wars baya severim.

There's more action and some simple platforming, more story, cutscenes and dialogues as well. The writing can sometimes be Marvel-bad, but the plot itself is generally fine. Some characters, including Cal, are even quite likeable.
The game is surprisingly fun for a modern AAA title. And that's despite me not being a fan of Star Wars at all. Certainly going to get the sequel one day.
It's also a good place to start for anyone who would like to give Dark Souls a try, but is scared of its (deserved only in a small degree) reputation of a ""brutally hard game"".

[b]The Good[/b]

+ Reinvention of lightsaber combat focused Star Wars games, which greatly improves on the well established Jedi Knight & The Force Unleashed games
+ Fluid adaption of souls-like combat, that feels highly rewarding without feeling too difficult
+ Well aged after 4 years of release graphically and gameplay wise
+ Beautifully written and well paced story that leaves you needing more
+ Perfect amount of collectibles and achievements for completionists

[b]The Bad[/b]

- Below average performance optimization, bugs, crashes, hitches and stutters that affect the experience occasionally
- Expected more 'side quest' type of content, in a game world so big
- Some areas on planets are confusingly designed, I could get stuck somewhere for a little while
- Amount of unique enemies
- EA launcher

[b]Thoughts[/b]

This is a must play for any Star Wars fan, and even might appeal for non-fans because of just how fun it is. The acting is phenomenal which really immerses you to believing in the story that is being told, so it feels real.

He is ORANGE and has a SPEECH IMPEDIMENT that prevents him from pronouncing his OWN NAME. He wears a PONCHO because every planet he goes to is MOIST. He has a SAVIOUR COMPLEX because he was a BRAINWASHED CHILD-SOLDIER from a CULT and WILL MOPE over EVERYTHING BAD that happens around him even when it is obviously NOT HIS FAULT AT ALL. He is by far the LEAST INTERESTING PERSON IN THIS GAME. Yes that includes the STORMTROOPERS. He and his bunnybot BD-SM travel the galaxy on his MUPPET DAD'S spaceship, the MAN-T!TS, along with his BLACK MOM, who is TOO GOOD FOR HIM and COULD HAVE BEEN THE MAIN CHARACTER (no really there was a lot of internal back-and-forth about that). Along the way you'll meet a GOTH GIRL from EASTERN EUROPE named MERLIN who is a WIZARD and WILL kick you in the nuts and COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN THE MAIN CHARACTER. No she won't TOUCH YOUR D!CK, not in this game anyway.

It's STAR WARS, so there's lots of stormtroopers to kill, but it's also a VIDEO GAME, so your lightsaber is more like a WIFFLE BAT that glows, and you have to smack everyone in the face with it like ten times to kill them. But because it's STAR WARS there's also a limitless supply of FALL HAZARDS, and since you can use the FORCE, you can make them FALL OVER, which will NEVER STOP BEING FUNNY, even when it's your turn to FALL OVER. Since it's DISNEY STAR WARS the plot makes NO SENSE other than to string along a series of bosses with RED LIGHTSABERS, one of which is REALLY HOT. Like DISTRACTINGLY HOT. I guess Disney heard ""morally gray is when someone's evil and hot"" and thought it was a tip not satire. She's also a way better actor than COW TESTES and could also have had HER OWN VIDEO GAME.

Long story short: a great Star Wars single player experience overall, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. 

Story is great, most of the time. There are times where I felt disconnected and don't know why I'm doing this or what prompt me to in the first place. However, when it's good, especially in critical plot points, it truly delivers. Character growth is sufficient to say the least, but I felt a decline in the quality of character building near the end of the story. Difficulty can be adjusted at any point in the game, however, I didn't particularly find the sweet spot. I started with Jedi Master but soon after switched to Jedi Knight. I feel like Jedi Master isn't enjoyable because the enemies hit really hard, and when encountering new enemies, of which I have no idea what their moves are, it became quite annoying. However, in Jedi Knight, the game feels too easy for me. A lot of the time I traversed from checkpoint to checkpoint while only losing less than half my health bar without using any provided stim. Maybe I should've stick with Master x.x

Gameplay is alright. Parkour feels pretty much the same from the start till the end with minor positive changes. Combat feels weighty, parries feel great. Skill tree give you extra moves and perks to add to your kit. If I have to nitpick, the bossfights often feel more like a pairing game (especially in Jedi Master). What I mean by this is the parry and dodge system. I feel like the player need to pair the boss's moves to either a dodge or parry and when we paired them wrong we get punished hard.

DESPITE THAT, I enjoyed my time wholeheartedly in SWJ:FO. The opening scenes alr hooked me and I loved the experience.",1706016627,1706016627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The storytelling in Fallen Order is a triumph, seamlessly weaving a compelling narrative into the vast and beloved Star Wars lore. The protagonist, Cal Kestis, is a relatable and engaging character whose journey to rediscover the Jedi way is both emotional and thrilling. The game successfully captures the essence of the Star Wars universe, delivering a cinematic experience that feels like an interactive masterpiece.

Visually stunning, the game brings iconic Star Wars locations to life with meticulous detail. From the bustling streets of Nar Shaddaa to the haunting landscapes of Dathomir, each environment is a testament to the developers' commitment to authenticity and immersion. The attention to detail in recreating lightsaber combat, force abilities, and the overall Star Wars aesthetic is commendable and adds an extra layer of nostalgia for fans.

The combat system is a true highlight of Fallen Order. Lightsaber duels are intense, strategic, and immensely satisfying. The learning curve for mastering various force powers and combat techniques is well-balanced, allowing players to feel the growth of their Jedi skills throughout the game. The inclusion of challenging enemies and powerful bosses ensures that every encounter feels like a significant test of your abilities.

Exploration is a key element of Fallen Order, and the level design is both intricate and rewarding. Navigating the different planets feels like a genuine adventure, with secrets to discover, puzzles to solve, and a multitude of collectibles that cater to the completionist in every player. The Metroidvania-style progression system adds depth to the exploration, encouraging players to revisit areas with newfound abilities.

The sound design in Fallen Order is impeccable, featuring the iconic hum of lightsabers, the familiar blaster sounds, and John Williams' legendary score. It's a symphony of Star Wars that enhances the overall immersive experience and evokes a sense of nostalgia for fans of the franchise.

In conclusion, STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order is a stellar addition to the Star Wars gaming legacy. Respawn Entertainment has crafted a game that not only pays homage to the beloved universe but also stands out as a fantastic action-adventure title in its own right. Whether you're a die-hard Star Wars fan or a newcomer to the galaxy, Fallen Order is an absolute must-play, delivering an unforgettable journey through the Force.

It was pretty cool and entertaining, but I had an issue with my blocking/parrying and my dodging, to where it didn't count or read and the enemy ends up landing a hit on me.
#2 The unblockable red attacks,
The enemies loved doing these and alot of times, even though I press the dodge, it still hits me, which was pretty annoying. The purge enemies and the bosses love to use these attacks, especially the last boss, who constantly used these, ending up killing me and making me redo the fight.
#3 Stunlocking,
Did this happen to anyone else? I constantly got stunlocked by enemies, causing to lose like 90% of my health. It happened with fast attackers, example, the purge enemies with the daggers and double sided baton thingy, the 3rd and 9th sister, and multiple enemies like the baton stormtrooper commander, melee nightbrothers, and Undead nightsisters.

The only part where it feels like a lightsaber is deflection of blaster bolts (which is a lot of fun!). You can even parry animal attacks with a lightsaber (facepalm). And enemy dark jedis are complete nonsense.

Player attack animations often have a oddly long and unnecessary back swing (especially for a lightsaber... but for a regular metal sword too). I wish I could do quicker slashes and stabs from the guard position.

Looking past that, the combat can be fun. 

For context, I never played a souls-like game before (only a bit of Hollow Knight, but didn't get far in it).
I played this game on Jedi Master difficulty (3/4). I could never get a feeling like I'm getting ahead of the difficulty curve - always felt slightly behind. If that was the intended purpose, good job developers.

I got to learn the animations and the move set of every new enemy, and before I got fully comfortable with it, the game threw new and more enemies at me. I only got to relax during puzzles (which I found to be fairly challenging). There was never a situation when in combat I was just going with the flow and dominating it (I wish there was at least some, it feels good to feel powerful).

My favorite part of combat is timing parries, but most enemies have 1 or more ""unblockable"" attacks. Their animations don't differ that much from regular attacks, but the game hints at this by flashing the enemy with red color and playing a sound cue. I found this part to be arcade-y and immersion breaking. I would rather this part have some consistency and you'd have to deduce whether an attack can be blocked from its animation.

There is very limited health regen, and when you run out of it, the only choice is to meditate (at a save station), which respawns all the enemies (behind and in front of your path). On one hand, it was fun to grind this a little bit in the early game, on the other hand, before I significantly increased my health and regen ability, it was quite tedious to progress.

Personally I hate save stations. I'd prefer the ability to save any time out of combat (meditation for health recovery and enemies respawn could keep working as is).

Character upgrades are decent. They are simple and well explained, and the choice between them is not difficult but not obvious either. At the end of the game I unlocked almost all the upgrades, so there aren't different builds.

Exploration is the worst part of the game. It was quite a frustrating experience for me, because lots of exploration is locked behind abilities that are unknown to me beforehand, and I felt stuck for so long - because I couldn't understand what am I missing to ""get over there"". E.g. there's a crashed Star Destroyer, and I wished to go inside it and explore... but couldn't find a way and was very disappointed. But I was able to get in there much later, after I got a ""double jump"". Seriously, double jump??? Jedi don't double jump, they just jump higher!

If the game gave me all abilities from the beginning, it would fix my biggest issue with it (confusing exploration).

Vanity customization. You can *visually* customize your ship, character, droid and lightsaber. You find these ""skins"" while exploring. Personally I found this feature very odd and immersion breaking... why would my character bother with repainting the ship that is not even his! And I've never seen droids  get repainted in Star Wars either. Lightsaber is also a very personal and jedi don't just swap them around. I wish the feature just wasn't present.

Environments and levels. You visit a bunch of planets, each having a distinct style. For me the highlight is Dathomir. The sound design there is 10/10, and visually it's great too. It also reminded me of the other grim Star Wars places - Korriban and Malachor V from KotOR II. This is the part that tipped my review from ""Not Recommended"" to ""Recommended"". Dathomir was just great.
Overall there's lots of good quality art in the game on each planet.

Story is inconsequential, not even worth talking about. The game never got me worried about anything story-related. What a pity. Even the childish Jedi Academy story was better. But that's the state of Star Wars these days. But hey, ""inconsequential"" is much better than Episodes 8 & 9, so that's good! There's lots of bits of lore scattered around - you get a little bit of XP for collecting them and the main character will say a few words, but rarely anything interesting.
You travel with 2 other characters, but they also feel inconsequential (even though one of them is sorta important to the plot) because you only interact with them in your ship. There's also your droid, which is my favorite part of the lore\story. He's so cute and I adore the chat between him and the player character.

Technically the game is very well made. It supports ultrawide resolution out of the box (apart from cutscenes which are pillar boxed; but this isn't a cut scene heavy game).
I ran the game on an i7-8700k + RTX 2080 Ti, 3440x1440, maximum (Epic) graphic settings without dynamic resolution, and my average FPS was around 80, with rare dips to 65-70 when looking and some scenery. Graphical fidelity settings are detailed enough, but I didn't bother fiddling with them. Visual effects settings are separated from them and clearly named.
The game supports full control scheme remapping EVEN ON A CONTROLLER, WHICH IS SO RARE! I applaud for this, even though it should be a given...
I have an inexpensive mSATA SSD, and the game load times are good. However once in a while an odd ""long"" load happens.
In my 30 hours of play, the game never crashed, and barely encountered any bugs (there was 1 glitch with the enemies floating in the world models), well done on this part!
My main complaint from tech side is the EA app. Another app that I have to run and update. In my 30 hours of play (spread over a few months, such is life), i had to update the app almost every time I tried to launch the game...",1705266755,1705786952,True,0,0,0.572514533996582031,0,True,False,False

I recommend this game because:
- It is short, the 100% are easy to achieve, only costs a few nerves and 40€ (wait that's a downside...)
- star wars
- lightsabers
- somewhat you can call a character customization 
- graphics are decent
- no major bugs / lags


I do not recommend this game because:
- EA
- rubbish controls
- the holo map does not help at all 
- the story is super short with a very bad ending
- the main character gives a shit about his love interest and continues to slaughter her family 
- tried to copy the interconnected world of dark souls and failed hard
- the bonfire copy they use in this game does not work and makes the game more of a cramp

It might be one of the best Star Wars game in recent years but, is it worth 40€? no, not at all... it does not only cost 40€ but also a lot of nerves.

Wielding a light saber, is as fun and exciting as it sounds.

With trails of burn materials not only on the walls (which disappear soon after), but also on the cut slices of the objects.

The map, as it is shown by BD-1 should be made a bit easier to navigate visually.

No fast travel which makes the game tedious more than fun due to terribly designed maps, terrible map (whoa bright idea is to put a blue map with white on it highlights). Way too much map traversal, last i checked I am playing a star wars game not fucking Mario, too many annoying monsters, again I'm playing a star wars game where are the you know stormtroopers, sith etc, im not playing monster hunter.

I have this game on both PS5 and PC and honestly as a Star Wars fan this game has been more tedious, and frustrating than enjoyable for the reasons above, though I will say some parts I enjoy, Graphics, Sound Effects, there is some really cool cinematic, but the other issues just over shadow it, and it ruins it. Story isn't even that interesting either, its too short but its made to feel 'bigger' than it is due to all the map transversal you have to do, i must of spent hours sometimes just trying to work out how to get from A to B so I haven't 100% the maps at all, if there was a fast travel option to the save points then it wouldn't be so bad but there isn't even Darkj Souls game has a fast travel to save points/bonfires.

I will say I did complete the PS5 version on Jedi Master, and I enjoy some parts of the game but its more tedious than fun imo. I don't understand the identity they wanted to go with on this, if its a Souls like game then It misses the mark entirely by the above issues, and I've completed all Souls games multiple times, and 100% Elden Ring. 

Get in sale only honestly, if the above issues were not there id enjoy it more but they are, and i imagine in the next game they will still be there..... so at full price i don't recommend.",1705392860,1705472959,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

When playing as a force-sensitive character in a game, my primary expectation revolves around the fluidity of movement and gameplay reminiscent of previous Star Wars installments, like Force Unleashed. These games made us feel we were on the brink of fulfilling our Star Wars fantasies, with compelling force abilities and dynamic lightsaber combos that made embodying a Jedi a mere controller's reach away. Unfortunately, the current game takes the opposite approach.

Right from the start, players are bombarded with constant uncanny valley cutscenes prone to glitching into a myriad of pieces with the slightest variable deviation. Unskippable tutorials attempt to explain their clunky new systems, constantly detracting and pausing from the ""immersive"" experience. The unchallenging and repetitive parkour lacks evolution from the old 2000s systems, such as ""wall run"" and ""climbing vines."" Really EA? Even for those who enjoy this style of gameplay, the controls feel clunky, with the character constantly succumbing to slippery grappling animations, and awkwardly sliding off poorly constructed geometry, leading to egregious glitches. Parkour becomes the only activity between combat scenarios, or cutscenes, offering little reward to progression or exploration. The overly complex map system imparts a false sense of depth, as there's no freedom of path choice or mission selection. Every planet evokes the same vibe, save only a different texture palette and enemy variety. The promise of diverse environments, like exploring the innards of the Death Star, or exploring the jungle of Endor, leaves the experiences we wanted unfulfilled.

While the game attempts a Souls-like style of gameplay, the adaptation is a complete failure and my least favorite aspect. The progression system seems purposeless, creating the illusion that the character's difficulty to use is justified by adding ""game mechanics."" The Souls-like combat, a cycle of dodge, dodge, attack, repeat, lacks the rewarding feeling that souls-like games flourish off, and serves as a constant reminder of the tedious nature of the entire game, and the ""go find the guy who stole your points"" punishment appears as a mere excuse to extend gameplay hours, compelling players to navigate the poorly designed maze of the map repeatedly.

Acknowledging some positive elements, there are some great visual elements and a storyline that some may appreciate, but these aspects are overshadowed by the limitation of choice in what to look at and when, taken by force camera movements and perspectives. The potentially beautiful sceneries and battles lose their novelty, making players feel like they're playing a telltale-style game void of the multiple choices to impact the story.

If you find enjoyment in this game, it's possible you're gaslighting yourself or lack a reference point for quality in the gaming industry and art.

I finished it not long after posting this review.

The combat feels solid and I often panic when I have more than two things thrown in my direction. Puzzles feel intricate and I find myself sitting there wondering what the next piece of what's in front of me is for. I adore the characters and wonder what it is that they will pull next.

+ Visuals and sounds really captures Star Wars
+ Fun and reasonably challenging combat
+ Likable characters
+ Decent story
+ Snappy controls

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- A bit too much backtracking
- Saving system is unnecessarily tedious; save points are also placed poorly
- No fast travel makes collecting collectibles a real chore
- Fixed FOV; can be annoying when swarmed by enemies and you can't see them

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
+/- Holographic map is very detailed, but could really use a waypoint system
+/- Using healing stims has a delay and can get interrupted; a bit of an unnecessary layer of difficulty

Long version:
I want to love this game. I really do.
But the backtracking is annoying.
The puzzles are badly designed.
The exploration is a chore.
The navigation is horror because the map is unintelligible at best.
The combat is OK but nothing to write home about.

The one puzzle with the ball in the cage, where you can't get the angle made me uninstall it and then reinstall it because I still want to see the end of the game.. I have tried 35 hours to love this game. I have REALLY tried. 

Is it glitchy? yes.
Is it frustrating because of bad game logic? yes.

Is it still Star Wars? Yes.
Is it good Star Wars.. sadly.. yes.

SW: Jedi Fallen Order. A game you love to hate to love.

Special warning for people that have OCD/Completionist tendencies: There are many areas locked off until the end of the game that you will try to get to. Do not try to collect things or 100% maps until right before the VERY end of the game and be ready to tackle some insanely illogical puzzles that were tested 'happy flow' only. Think.. a math exam, where there are for sure 3 correct answers, but only 1 is accepted. You'll be spending a lot of time on those other 2 'incorrect' answers, just because the game likes to spin you in circles and waste your time like that.

(TLDR: I give it a 8/10)
(Side Note: I have yet to play NJ+ and beat the game on Story Mode)
Pros:
. BD-1 (the lil robot that follows you).
. Runs really well - only had one fps issue which got fixed with a restart.
. Story is simple to follow yet feels very expansive and innovative
. Lots of fun collectibles that allow a variety of customisation options for your outfit, poncho, lightsaber and BD-1.
. Although limited to five planets, there is plenty of exploration that does not feel too short.
. Plenty of variety in enemies to fight.
. Backtracking options when exploring.
. Combat is pretty decent and requires skill.
. New Game + permitting extra content.
. Characters are all likeable, especially Greez.
. Nice little nods to the Clone Wars era here and there.
. Soundtrack is a nice combo of new music mixed with the John Williams soundtracks from the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy.
. Achievement hunting is very doable with minimum difficulty - you do not need to play NJ+ to do get 100%

Cons:
. Although backtracking is available, some areas are too limited and one-way meaning you need to do more unnecessary exploring.
. Some of the collectibles require BD-1 to scan and if enemies are nearby, he will not and this can lead to skippable extras which make the following con even worse.
. Not all extras are indicated on your map, specifically datalogue entries, flora for the terarrium and most force echos. Note: These are needed for achievements so it can be annoying if you are going for them.
. There are times where the game does not elaborate on certain things which make it feel unfair (see SPOILER PROS AND CONS below).
. Some (not all) achievements are bugged - I specifically unlocked 5 achievements but they did not pop until I restarted the game and hit a save spot.
. Combat can be a bit janky when fighting multiple enemies at once, especially when you need to dodge and counter (though I may just be a bit inexperienced atm).

SPOILER PROS AND CONS (You have been warned!)
Pros:
. BD-1. Again. Best droid in the galaxy! Nothing majorly bad happens to him. He does not die.
. Yes, you can change your lightsaber colour when Kal has to get a new one. There is quite a selection and you can change it at anytime.
. Cere's backstory with her padawan Trilla/The Second Sister is very strong and makes me wonder why Reva needed to exist in the Kenobi series.
. Cere is interesting as she is a force user who is struggling with the balance of the light and dark side of the force and it makes me wonder is in store for her in the future.
. With the final Nightsister joining Cal it feels like Dathomir is concluded and nothing else can be done with it, allowing the Star Wars series to move on and focus on new worlds.
. The inclusion of Kyshykk was a great touch as we can see what the Empire has done to it post-Order 66 
. The final cameo of Darth Vader was an awesome touch! He's not even named by the others yet everyone reacts like their in utter fear.
. The ending was simplistic yet effective and showed how Cal had learnt from his journey within the force and the game.

Cons:
.Nightssister Merrin was a bit underwhelming and I think that's mainly due to her joining the crew so much later in the game - I hope though with the sequel we will see more of her.
. During the Darth Vader encounter when he grabs you, it is unclear that you need to drag your mouse to the right  force pull the ceiling down which cheats the player into an unfair death. This is due to the game not previously having interactive cutscenes with the mouse and comes out of nowhere.
. Darth Vader's cameo felt a bit underwhelming before the end as it does not leave an impactful note other than Cere almost using the dark side - it feels bit like it was inspired by Rogue One's ending without understanding why Vader's cameo was important.
. The Second Sister's fights were too repetitive, with her attacks being the same. 
. The final battle of the Second Sister was a tad annoying with the inclusion of her slam attack. This is because the game expects to dodge any attack where the enemy glows. However, in this case if you dodge you don't have enough time to do what the game is expecting you to do (which is to jump).

Chose to go on Jedi Master (2nd highest) difficulty, which was certainly a choice given I hadn't played any souls-like games for 5+ years (god damn Oggdo Boggdo was a hell of a learning curve). Made it feel so much more satisfying as I eventually progressed through certain sections. The combat feels fantastically fluid, and the parkour genuinely realistic (or as realistic as it can be for a force-powered murder machine).
I encountered minimal stuttering (3080, 5900X) with some textures, and only had two crashes to desktop during my total playtime.
The story is pretty standard Star Wars fare, but the performance given by Cameron Monaghan as Cal drew me in like nothing else. It will be a literal crime against nature if he isn't allowed to portray Cal in live action.
There are few single-player games that I would be excited to play through from start to finish again, and this is one of them.

BD-1 is very lovable and i'm definitely attached to him, he's very cute and has the same charm as R2-D2 and BB-8.

highly recommend playing with a controller instead of keyboard and mouse, my first playthrough i used keyboard and mouse and the combat feels very clunky and awkward that way (in my humble opinion). i usually prefer playing games with keyboard but this one i just think suits a controller better.

• Is it a weird episode of Shameless? Yeah this episode of Shameless is kinda odd

• Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is a third person action game set between Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One. The player controls Cal Kestis, a Jedi who went into hiding after surviving Order 66 as a Padawan, and must now go on a quest to try to rebuild the Jedi Order.

• The Good

• Using my lightsaber and force powers in combat made me feel like a powerful Jedi. Force pushing enemies to send them flying off a cliff never stops being fun, you can also pull them towards you, slow their movement so they can’t block your attacks, throw your lightsaber at mid-range enemies and kill distant enemies by deflecting their blaster bolts back at them.

• Several different enemy types including Stormtroopers and other Imperial soldiers armed with blasters, shock batons, rocket launchers and flamethrowers, wildlife, giant monsters, droids, AT-ST walkers, and Sith wielding their own lightsabers and force powers.

• Combat is challenging on Jedi Master difficulty (the third of four difficulty levels). Regular enemies feel nicely balanced and are fun to fight, and sometimes you can take advantage of Stormtroopers and wildlife attacking each other, but let’s just say the bosses are not messing around and will have you wishing you could turn to the dark side. Be prepared to die a few times while you learn their attack patterns. One thing I liked about the boss design though is they’re mostly 1v1 fights so they feel like epic showdowns against important characters, instead of the usual video game bosses where you spend most of the time fighting a bunch of respawning minions.

• The story is interesting, arguably better than some of the recent films, and voice acting is good. Cal’s droid ally BD-1 has as much personality as R2-D2 or BB-8.

• Music and sound effects of lightsabers and blasters feels like Star Wars.

• Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

None of these elements are as fleshed out or polished as in the dedicated titles it draws influence from, but they can all still stand their own ground here and mesh together surprisingly well, resulting in a combination that manages to provide a somewhat unique experience.
There's not a lot of variety in any aspect when it comes to gameplay, other than Cal acquiring new abilities and upgrades to shake things up a bit, but as it's not particularly long, it doesn't overstay its welcome and remains fun til the end.
The graphics are beautiful and environments are gorgeous. Interface is functional and fits very well thematically.
Story is straightforward, short and simple, but good. There are bits and pieces of extra lore scattered all around. Cal is an extremely likable character and the small supporting cast, companions and opponents included, are just fine as well.
Camera can be off at times and I've experienced occasional stuttering, but other than that it's a decent game all around. The only absolute let down in my eyes are Cal's mostly odd and wonky moves and animations, but that is not a huge issue. I could see the complex map design with a lot of verticality, unlockable shortcuts and backtracking due to lack of fast travel being annoying to people who are more interested in swordplay part. Personally, I enjoyed the way maps were laid out while doing main objectives, but could not bother trying to look for and pick up most of collectibles.
Besides being a good action-adventure Star Wars game, I think this is also an excellent introduction to the Soulslike genre, since it's more of a lite version - the standard more narrow and focused well thought out world with different kinds of hidden collectibles and power ups, combat, check point and level up mechanics are there, but it has 4 difficulties, no RPG elements and isn't as combat heavy.",1704738362,1704738362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only best bits are at the start. Old Darksiders1(for example) is much more cinematic than this. Get it only if you are a die-hard fan to play something star-wars themed. Anyway, it looks very cool and I want more games of hack and slash puzzle genre (but not as slow as this Jedi FO).


[b]** Why Negative? **[/b]
~Allies are all boring underdogs and There are barely any encounters with proper villains. 

~Just random mobs and mobs with bigger health(feels like videogame: Control).  | you barely meet lightsaber wielders, fair or fearful bosses, enemies just feel cheap.

~Enemies dodge attacks  | you have to wait to attack. You have more chances to get downed by 3 evading mosquitoes than a trained soldier.

~Enemies stance bar  | you can't hit their hp directly, so you wait more to attack

~Bossfights have no wind up time, are spontaneous and unstaggerable  | un-soulslike, dodge has barely any i-frames, patience for that big attack for an opening


[b]** Here's my issues. **[/b]
-    Starts off really well; but its not souls-like, its just Metroidvania: The pace is extremely slowed down with nothing to explore but puzzles and ""yet to be unlocked"" areas. This'd be fine, yes, but there is a very long disconnect from the villain and story as you spend so much time running around and... you see that door? OOOOOH nonono, you have to walk all the way around it (Similar door issue: Borderlands the Pre-Sequel).

-    Then (as a Prince of Persia Fan), platforming is brain-dead and sometimes its not mimicked enough or plain evil (there is this part with deadly pistons where you had to run on the wall to ""jump higher""; the only thing I had to search). Every guide on the internet just jumps towards the piston and goes up without understanding why. If you do a puzzle, you follow already established rules; don't add random stuff. More on this: Sometimes character won't grab the ropes, and You have to move AND look around to understand the puzzles. A lot of people are going to quit playing because of them. Similar issue game: Darksiders 2.

-    If you are a big fan of the lightsaber battles: There is only 3. Sekiro has nothing to do with this and enemies don't have any wind up to attacks. There are multiple bosses that are just normal bosses with higher health. And also (just like Darksiders 2), normal enemy mobs dodge attacks. This is the most boring thing ever, I can parry everything they throw but I have to wait to attack every single time. I perfected three lightsaber duels just for funsies (coming from playing Sifu). Not worth it; bosses attacks and my dodge are flawed. This'd be easily solved by making the block button cancel/stop your attack animation(but it doesn't).

Summary: Only (somewhat) fun I had was in trying no dmg Lightsaber duels(Jedi Master). The rest is an absolute mess. I feel if I rushed the game to the end I'd have more time spent in an un-enjoyable walking & puzzle simulator (because platforming is horrendous).",1654087871,1704680743,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Story and Presentation: (7/10)[/b]
- Not a hardcore Star Wars fan, it's just ""okay"", not sure if canon
- A lot gets thrown at you, characters, events, Star Wars lingo, for what seems to be just for fan-service
- There are enjoyable set pieces
- You follow a conventional hero's journey of a weak and pathetic main character who never redeemed himself
- The main character is a mouth breather, who always have his mouth open for some reason and talks like he just got his molars taken out
- All throughout, you've been retracing the footsteps of a Jedi Master, uncovering the mysteries of an ancient race of force users but never learned what happened to his fate
- You never learned what happened to this ancient race, you got nothing out of it in the end other than they are force users
- The ending felt like the entire journey is pointless

[b]Sound, Music and Voice: (9/10)[/b]
- The sound design basically is the only thing that saves this game
- The satisfying sound of light sabers clashing, parrying blaster fire or melting through flesh
- The majestic orchestral music playing in the background
- The voice acting and lip syncing are well done

[b]Graphics and Visuals: (7/10)[/b]
- 8700k/1080ti, 144p, High-ultra, 90FPS lock
- Constant framerate dips specially when changing areas
- It looks, feels and smells like Star Wars
- Incredibly frustrating when you enter a new area with obviously a lot of enemies, you landed, you're surrounded, then it dips
- Mo-cap and facial animations are pretty good
- The set pieces and cutschenes are pretty good
- The main character looked like Peter Dinklage, and one of your crew looked like Dave Chappelle

[b]Level Design, Structure and Gameplay Loop (6/10)[/b]
- This souls like is worse than Bandai Namco's attempt at Code Vein
- Respawn has a skewed interpretation of what makes a souls-like, souls-like. Just because you've got a bonfire save point mechanic, enemies respawning and a maze-like level design doesn't make a souls-like game fun. You get lost on FromSoftware's level design because there are so many paths that could lead to anywhere with no restriction. Here, they artificially make the player feel lost in the level design by trapping them certain areas with no way of going back.
- The most annoyingly frustrating thing about the level design is using a lot of one-way traps, if you made a wrong turn, you would end up going back to the start and have to fight your way back to where you're supposed to go
- A lot of the levels are story-locked because either your character doesn't have the double-jump yet or your droid don't have the ability to open certain doors
- There's some uncharted-esque platforming here, wall running, rope swinging and puzzle solving which adds to variety but ultimately still janky and underwhelming
- You can fall from edges by walking and jumping but for whatever reason can't fall off by rolling.
- No build variety, no armor sets, nothing to grind or work towards
- This is no action RPG, this is basically a story driven souls-like
- The only thing that saves this category is it mixes up some areas by randomly replacing usual mobs with named, mini-boss bounty hunters

[b]Character Progression: (5/10)[/b]
- There's no meaningful progression to speak of
- Every loot in the game are purely cosmetics
- Also, why put tons of breakable pots with nothing in it?
- Even on that regard, most of the cosmetics are just swapping color schemes
- Your skill tree for whatever reason is story-locked because your character got some amnesia. At some point you'll end up sitting in skill points because there's nothing to use it to
- No build variety, no stat, nothing to grind, nothing to work towards
- The only satisfying thing here is constantly modifying what your light saber looked like

[b]Combat: (5/10)[/b]
- Combat is super clunky and janky, it's the worse Souls clone out there
- I hate the half-baked dodge in these Souls clones. A single tap would do a sidestep and a double tap would do a roll. Just let me roll and give me the iframe, this is pointless as it takes you twice the amount of time/reaction to get an actual roll going. The sidestep is useless because most attacks are sweeping attacks and has absurd tracking.
- No animation cancel, your character would commit to finishing the animation which also means if you get hit and you flinched, your character will finish that entire flinch animation and also eat the succeeding hits you can't roll out of
- It uses this Sekiro style posture gauge, parrying would reduce the enemy's posture, however it regenerates to full straight away. You have zero passive skills that would help in this posture mechanic. What's super annoying about this is once you got succeeding parries, broke the guard and hit the enemy, they would launch a poised counterattack.
- Using the force in combat is hit or miss, you can't seamlessly transition to doing light saber attacks to using the force and integrating it to your combo, your character would have to pause or finish the animations. Sometimes force push would register damage, sometimes it would just knock them down. Force pull should leave the enemy vulnerable to attack but instead would immediately block your attack or doesn't get pulled close enough.
- Absurd tracking enemies doing charged attacks.
- Sprinting and landing a sprinting attack is also janky, for whatever reason your character stops sprinting and half the time you miss the opportunity to land a blow after a force push
- I ended up just putting the final boss to Story difficulty, after playing the entire game at Grand Master, it's not worth it

[b]Difficulty: (6/10)[/b]
- Played: Jedi Grandmaster Difficulty
- Difficulty is jacked and there's one-shotting
- Most of your kit are useless other than force push
- You've got basic rats resistant to the force??
- LOTs of cheap ambush nonsense coming out of nowhere
- The game pads the difficulty by placing your character into a trapped section

[b]Encountered Glitches and Bugs: (7/10)[/b]
- No crashes in 26 hours
- Absurd amounts of framerate dips all through out
- Absurd amounts enemies getting stuck, getting thrown to air
- Your character also janks and gets thrown to the air when climbing rope shortcuts
- Using the force is hit or miss and super janky, sometimes it would damage or kill enemies, other ties it would just knock them down

[b]Fun: (7/10)[/b]
- The majestic orchestral starwars music that plays in the background are enjoyable
- Visiting places like Dathomir and Kashyyk is fun
- There are enjoyable set pieces
- Playing as a Jedi, using light sabers and using the force alone adds to the fun after not having one for a decade since Force Unleashed
- For every good thing this game presents, it constantly offsets it with lots of jank
- I would even argue that this is THE worst souls like game. I even enjoyed that 15-hour indie title Mortal Shell more than this.

[b] OVERALL: 6/10[/b]

The game itself is amazing. It has enough environment variety and world development for it to may be considered semi-open world. 
The combat is satisfying, with several difficulty levels, so it is not too easy or too hard, depending on the level the player chooses, according to his skill. Not only that, but it has enough variety, mixing force powers, with saber moves. The combat does relies heavily on parrying and dodging, specially against the harder enemies / bosses, giving it a bit of a souls-like taste.
The game starts by advising the player to use a gamepad, but I'm a since forever user of mouse and keyboard, and had no problem at all to play it with the last. I did tweaked the key bindings, because I found the default key for dodging not being practical, and changed it to L-ALT.
On a final note, for those that like to aim for 100% achievements, this game is not unfair, meaning, it has no unfair achievements, like the kind that demand a lot of grinding.

Good story and characters. Great combat. Exploration was sometimes a chore and some of the environments didn't make sense outside of the context of this being a video game.  A bit on the short side, in that it took me about 15 hours or so to beat.

I love to conquer Geonosis as a Clone Trooper in Battlefront as much as I enjoy defeating Jedi as a Sith in The Force Unleashed. Choosing an era and an allegiance means neglecting other representable perspectives. Nevertheless, Jedi: Fallen Order is ONE perfect Star Wars game. The player accompanies a young Jedi apprentice in the post-republic outer worlds on a mission regarding the fate of future Jedi, which is simultaneously his journey to becoming a fully fledged Jedi himself. The world design is phenomenal; the planets are different due to their flora and fauna, while latter contributes exceptionally well to the authenticity of the biosphere. Therefore, exploring planets always feels different and allows the player to further investigate a little bit more of the endless fantasy that characterises Star Wars, even though climbing and walking are (almost) mechanically similar throughout the game. The gameplay is constituted of melee combat and action-adventure-like jump’n’climb exploration passages as well as puzzle areas, with a few cutscenes and overall positive cinematic tendencies. The story is mediocre, with too much emphasis on character relations in cutscenes, but functions well as a vehicle to explore the world – one of the two main reason to play this game. The other is the battling system. Never before have lightsabre fights felt so good and … just cool. The combat offers a multitude of opportunities to be the most stylish and badass Jedi existing, and the skill tree opens the pathway to an increasing number of sabre attacks, combos and force attacks. The difficulty can be changed during the playthrough (but I highly recommend the hardest degree). Despite that most collectables have merely a minor visual purpose and only some strengthen the protagonist, going for 100% is worth every second. Jedi: Fallen Order finds a dynamic balance between exploration, puzzles, and combat, and presents this wonderful adventure in its convincing and engaging world.

I do enjoy a good Star Wars story and game, but is Jedi Fallen Order a good game? I mean its published EA so does it have all the typical EA nonsense, of loot boxes, cut content sold as DLC, and more? Well let's get into the pros and cons of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order


Pros-

- Authentic Star Wars asethetic (the overall atmosphere has that very distinct Star Wars feel)
- Sound (The voice acting, music, and enviromental sounds are all very well done)
- Combat (Simple, but deep, various combos with lightsaber with mixed in force powers etc.)
- Story (it makes you connect with the main character and the journey which seems to be almost a lost art in most story focused games nowadays)
- Length (perfect overall game length about 15-20 hours if only focusing on story)
- No loot crates, cut content, or any of the typical EA business stuff, we as gamers have come to expect.
- Variety (traveling to a variety of different locations and not Tatooine for once)
- RPG Mechanics (skill and character growth skill tree)

Cons-
- Backtracking (while different areas are available to explore as gameplay elements are made available. There is still a lot of backtracking across environments)
- No fast travel (shortcuts become available as  you explore, but this ties back to the backtracking)
- Enemy variety (the enemy variety is very limited, storm trooper, wild life, sith inquisitors is about it.)
- Enemy Respawn (enemies respawn when using meditation/save points, some will like it others will hate it. I fall into the later.)

Overall, I was quite shocked that EA even let Respawn make a single player Star Wars games without all the typical EA business nonsense. Overall, I would give Jedi Fallen Order a 40/50 (8/10 for the traditionilsts) If you are Star Wars fan it is an absolutely purchase. Even non Star Wars fans can enjoy this as the game does a great job giving fans the Easter eggs and calls to the fandom they will appreciate, but makes the story accessible to those who are not steeped in the Star Wars fandom and mythology.",1704545409,1704548387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a die-hard star wars fan since the OG trilogy I am always looking forward to seeing new star wars content and since BF1 i've been awaiting the release of another game packed with empire-destroying, force wielding, light saber action but instead all I've gotten is a frustrating loop of puzzles and overpowered enemies. The combat is way too in-depth and like the in-game parkour system it is just as inconsistent. The story seems cool and I love the little tidbits of information you can gather about the enemies and read but the game play just kills the entire vibe. You know the type of experience you're about to have when you get 2 hours into the game, land on Zeffo and become engulfed in one of the most annoying modern-day puzzle levels a game has to offer.

It's not been a good experience and I've only been continuing to play it because of the money I spent on it but I've exhausted my time on it.

Visual and Graphics (9/10)
-> Visual and graphics are really great, its not that exaggerated. The colors are vibrant, and the lighting effects create a visually appealing experience. 

Gameplay (9/10)
->The fighting mechanics are simple, You just have to parry everything like 95% of the time
Level up to unlock other light saber moves. 
Customize your Cal, BD-1 and especially your lightsaber.
Explore different type of planets by progressing through the story.

Most frustrating part, you have to run all the way back just to get back to your ship, I remember going back to Tree of origin like 5 times just to complete the databank.

I wish you are able to fast travel back to your ship if you reach maybe 80% or 90% of the planet exploration.

Bugs:
There are couple of bugs, but the most annoying one is you have to meditate just to trigger the databank in Kashyyyk where the Bird is (for people who want to complete the databank)

As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I knew I wanted to try a video game when I finally built my own PC. I grew up watching my dad play Force Unleashed II, but wanted to attempt something newer. This was beyond the expectations I had.

The graphics honestly aren't as polished as I'd expect a 2019 game to have. The character faces and hair suffer the most. It feels like Cere is bug eyed. However, not much else genuinely looks bad. The lighting is really well done, especially reflections on armor.

Each planet is well thought out and stunning. They're fun to explore and find the secrets in. That said, the maps are incredibly confusing and way too large to navigate efficiently. A waypoint system would've done this game wonders. A lot of my time is just running around, trying to figure out where I was supposed to be going.

The save mechanic is nice but also terrible. Saving at your convenience - nice. Having all enemies respawn - not nice. I get why they do, but it just becomes cumbersome to refight all the enemies you just killed because you wanted your health refilled. Stem canisters do slightly circumvent this issue, but not entirely if you're a clumsy player.

Enemies are decently difficult. I should preface by saying I did have to downgrade to story difficulty during Second Sister's second fight. I had a really difficult time specifically with bosses. Cal also locks onto enemies and you can't turn your camera to run, which is annoying.

Controls are shit. There are so many useless powers you accumulate. It's way more buttons than most players will want to remember. I was often clicking through, looking for the right skill for a moment. On top of that, the many lightsaber attacks don't differ by much at all. The skill tree is poorly organized and way too big. There's variation upon variation of skills that you just never use. I forgot I could throw my lightsaber at all. I do appreciate, however, that skill points are fairly easy to come by.

Customization is off the charts. BD-1 skins, ponchos for Cal, Mantis skins, and a fully customizable lightsaber really elevate the experience and make it feel personalized. That being said, tracking them all down is a nightmare. If you don't have a 100% guide handy, you won't find them all, plain and simple. Already started and want to 100% it now? Prepare for cumbersome backtracking (especially Zeffo).

Fitting this story into the lore is not difficult at all. They don't change much at all about established canon, they just give you an explanation for a possible inconsistency (no spoilers here). Cal's powers are all perfectly reasonable for a Jedi of his caliper, as are Cere's.

Lore aside, this works as a stand-alone story. Cal is believable and interesting, as are his whole crew and your villains. No one really lacks character. It really does feel like an immersive universe. Yes the maps were big, but I never felt like it was dragging when I was purely going for the next goal. With all that out - the end was awful. As spoiler free as I can - a final character development felt rushed and unnecessary (like it happened just to aid another character's development), and a beloved non-game character is incredibly underpowered and sloppily added. It was disappointing, but not enough that it soured the whole experience.

TL;DR Not the best game I've ever played, but I'm glad I put the hours in. Decent graphics, decent story, decent controls. I heavily recommend story difficulty if you don't often play combat games.",1655616832,1704437988,True,21,2,0.648437678813934326,0,True,False,False

One of the standout features of Fallen Order is how seamlessly it integrates into the vast Star Wars lore. From the iconic locations to the familiar faces and the exploration of Jedi history, the game feels like a genuine extension of the Star Wars saga. The attention to detail in recreating the ambiance of this beloved universe is commendable, immersing players in a galaxy far, far away.

The combat system deserves praise, offering an exhilarating lightsaber experience that makes players feel like true Jedi warriors. The combination of lightsaber attacks, force abilities, and parrying creates a dynamic and satisfying combat loop. Every encounter feels like a cinematic duel, and mastering the lightsaber techniques is both challenging and immensely rewarding.

The gameplay is a thrilling mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense combat. The level design encourages exploration, and the Metroidvania-style progression keeps players hooked as they unlock new abilities and discover hidden secrets. The game strikes a balance between linear storytelling and open exploration, offering a well-paced adventure that keeps players engaged from start to finish.

However, it's fair to acknowledge the game's shortcomings. Some facial animations for human characters could be more polished, occasionally detracting from the overall immersive experience. While it's a minor setback, it's noticeable enough to warrant mention, especially considering the high standards set by other aspects of the game.

On a positive note, the diverse array of alien species is well-crafted, and the attention to detail in their designs adds authenticity to the Star Wars universe. The variety of planets, each with its own unique ecosystem and challenges, further enhances the sense of exploration and discovery.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order successfully captures the magic of the Star Wars universe, offering an exciting blend of lore, lightsaber combat, and compelling gameplay. While some facial animations may fall short of perfection, the overall experience is a fantastic journey for any Star Wars fan. It's a worthy addition to the Star Wars gaming catalog, delivering an adventure that resonates with the spirit of the galaxy's greatest saga.

Kinda surprised how good the visuals are. there are framerate hiccups probably related to transitioning through environments. the optimization in this game is not that great and on a high refresh rate monitor i had strange artifacts coming from shimmer objects at certain times when objects are in motion over them. i think this is because the default antialiasing is too strong and cannot be edited in the settings unless this falls under some other setting. though it can be edited directly in the conf. I have an led gaming monitor so i think it may not occur on the traditional IPS display and most people may not even notice. 

i'd say 7/10 
story is pretty good...and i got this for a big discount.
not a terrible product but should be refined...this probably won't ever happen on pc.
ill buy the sequel when it's at a similar discount price lol

The game is still full of bugs, like it's playable but I've had to restart it like 5 times bc the tiny robot closed me a couple doors and stuck me away from the main quest. And the map is useless, so much blue semi transparent overlying layers I cant't see nothing.

The combat feels orthopedic. I dance with the enemy until it attacks to parry but the hitbox sometimes is so broken that the thing hits me from a km away. And the camera is so slow and buggy that if i get close to a wall in combat that's it, I have to use the force irl to fckng know whats happening.

Also the parkour is so weird, like I see a path to follow and I try it but for some reason redhead jedi doesn't jump that, but there's no other way so i have to try it until, out of nowhere, Cal makes it. I don't know maybe I'm just bad ig...

Gameplay is okayish. Fighting feels clunky and sometimes I cursed like hell because Cal doesn't focus on the enemy I want while the camera is giving me a stroke.
If you love fighting in games like the Arkham series, Devil May Cry or similar titles this can be kind of disapointing. It's still fun to fight but not a real challenge. I only played on medium but if higher difficulty doesn't add new attacks to the enemies/bosses I stick with my answer. It is still a lot of fun to fight and it looks cool most of the time but it feels repetitive.
Leveldesign is also okayish. Some big maps, some small. Some secrets to find. Not on a difficult or complex level.

It still has a lot more hand-holding than I would like, and they make most of the combat way more forgiving than the FromSoftware games, but it was still a nice challenge at higher difficulties. Exploration was quite satisfying.

Some of the worlds had huge, expansive maps. This was really cool the first time through, but they didn't get too much faster to traverse when coming back, which really deterred me from wanting to go use my new abilities to get stuff I couldn't the first time through. Even worse, the ""rewards"" were 90% just skins. Nothing interesting or useful at all. This was very AAA to me, where people love stupid stuff like paint colors or outfits, but that wasn't interesting to me in the slightest, which left me with no motivation to track down most of the secrets.

The game is definitely pretty. I wished I could have skipped some of the cut scenes, which I couldn't find any way to do. I'm not into Star Wars, and I was mostly interested in the gameplay, not the narrative, but the game really tries to push narrative on you.

All in all, it was a good experience, and I would recommend. It's definitely more approachable for newcomers than other Souls-like games, and the Metroidvania-like upgrades to movement were a cool addition to the formula as well.

I've gotta raise the question... why does Cal run like he has a stick up his ***? Why would such a critical animation be left looking like that?",1704224548,1704224548,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The Story is Fallen Order is just a bunch of nonsense through and through - written for children. It's extremely shallow and boring. The characters, their motivations and traits don't exist. They just do things to progress the story and say things that are supposed to be funny in a vacuum with no context.

In short without spoiling anything; Cal is a Jedi, he uses force powers to help a coworker/friend in need but at the risk of exposure of being one - Good so far. Then, on his commute back from work, evil Jedi Hunters discover what he is and prosecute him; actually no - they just show up outta nowhere and then let's him run off; While Cal is running off, allies show up again outta nowhere to pick him up from a derailing train; Very cinematic - actually no, it's just circle-jerk visuals with no meaning - They came outta nowhere, refuse to elaborate, then drop Cal off at a random planet while refusing to elaborate ""there is someone here for you to meet"" - actually, there wasn't someone there for him to meet, just a McGuffin for him to find, and to tell him to find more McGuffins - Why? Just for the ""story"" to happen.

Super boring.

I will admit, game play is more Lara Croft in Tomb Raider meets Force Unleashed. There's less focus on the Force and Lightsaber abilities than one would expect. Meaning that when you enter each area, the greater emphasis was placed on the puzzle, how to find/access areas and get to where you're going, than combat. Enemies are sparse in each area, but if you're looking for combat challenge, you can always crank up the difficulty settings if you wish to truly proclaim yourself a master of the blade.

Such is the situation with my Steam account these days. - Given that you can pick this up for less than £10 these days, this is a ridiculous bargain. And yes, even despite the negativity surrounding the EA launcher requirement, which, to be honest, I've personally just learned to accept (it sucks, but do you think EA cares?)

The game is great, and for fans of Star Wars, this serves a hefty helping of fan service.

The good stuff is too long to list, so I'll just stick to the bad stuff:

1 - PC optimisation. With a pretty high spec PC, I still had moments of frame drops - Seems to be an acknowledged issue that never got fixed
2 - The 'parkour' aspect is VERY clunky at times. Seems the programmers went to great lengths to prevent you from cheesing paths. And given that you repeatedly visit areas (to progress them further following upgrades, etc.), this was understandably important to prevent sequence breaks. But with this in mind, sometimes the INTENDED movement mechanics simply don't work. Just as one example, a running jump can sometimes COMPLETELY lose all momentum the moment you take off.
3 - The ending is a little... ehhh. No spoilers, but this went for a build-up that had zero foreshadowing and ultimately ended up making the game go out with a whimper instead of a bang.
4 - The map. WHERE you have to go is clear. How you get there is NOT. You'll often get frustrated just wondering where the hell, or what the hell, the game wants you to do.
5 - Combat. The game would clearly be a bit boring if you just sliced through everything/everyone, but it's a little frustrating when all your enemies can counter or stun lock you and you can counter and stun lock nothing (and in this regard, the 'parry' system is garbage). Never ONCE did the combat feel fluid (like that which was done so well in the Batman games).
6 - Backtracking. OH BOY does this game pad the clock by making you run somewhere to pointlessly, and I mean POINTLESSLY, run back. - The lack of a fast-travel option between the meditation spots was a big mistake. I spent the first half of the game happily exploring. It got painstakingly boring when I found out it achieved practically nothing. I then spent the last half just trying to get to my objective to advance the plot as quickly as possible.
7 - Looting. Don't bother, it's 95% only cosmetics and ones that aren't actually that creative.

Overall though, and despite that somewhat lengthy negative list, this is still a solid 7.5/10. It is NOT, however, the masterpiece gaming media attempted to portray this as.

For less than £10 though, which this commonly achieves now in sales, it's a no brainer!",1704044100,1704045359,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What a horror. Don't recommend it to anybody who likes Star Wars games.

After completed it (finally) I can say the game is not what I would expect from Star Wars  Shooter. Terrible sabre duels. Linear story and most awful 3d holographic in game map.  There are no teleports and just for the sake of it got to cover hundred of miles and kill all those creatures again and again, because you wanted to unlock some ... terrible character skin or whatever bulshit. There is no feeling of those duels I had playing countless hours in SW Jedi Academy or SW Jedi Knight. No feeling of unlimited power like I had playing SW The Force Unleashed. Lastly. The game optimisation is just a joke and I have spent a good few hours just to fine-tunning this to my liking.  
I don't recommend it at all. Overall boring, weak main characters and not engaging. And fucking robot who sits on your back all the game. What a joke!

I always thought that the fantastic response to this one was mostly due to it being a decent game, but that it came from EA (post Battlefront 2 too) which made it look way better than it actually is. Turns out that is not really the case, but I still feel that it gets higher praise than it actually deserves. The response to this game reminded me a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn, which is just an alright game imo, but Jedi deserves the positive response more and is a better game than that one without a doubt. 

The game is pretty much a good ""first draft"" of a really good Star Wars game. That sounds worse than it is really but it kind of feels that way. Every part of it is pretty good, but nothing really feels fantastic, and nothing is really bad either. Movement and climbing feels like Uncharted, but I would hope for something a bit more ""impressive"" 3 years after the last one in that series. Exploring the different levels is also pretty fun, but something about it feels a bit bland to me. Combat feels pretty nice, but it is not very deep and kind of slow (very personal as I want a faster combat system when using lightsabers, even more Sekiro inspired post that game). I know that this can be explained with how Cal is not very experienced but it does not make it feel deeper or better unfortunately lol. Story is also pretty good, but does not feel that special to me. Cal is a nice protagonist though and one of the better Star Wars characters that have appeared especially these recent 10 ish years... The game overall gives the impression that the devs were kind of playing it safe with this one, and perhaps a bit safe with certain things.

But the absolute best parts of the game, or the one that truly impressed me was the graphics, sound and how focused it is. The visuals and sounds were both stunning, as well as the animation work (maybe not Cals running animation though which looks really stiff and odd). The truly awe inspiring vistas that you come across frequently throughout the game are just fantastic. But the focus of this experience is really really nice. There are only a handful of planets, and therefore levels, but they are tied super well with the unlocking of the different abilities. The skilltree is not very large, but each ability manages to feel quite impactful to all aspects of the game. And the best part is that you get everything in the game by engaging in the combat and exploration. You know, the fun parts of the game. No stores, crafting stations or even upgrade parts (like +5% resistance to fire). It feels very refreshing and nicely stripped back to its great core parts.

I was also surprised with how much customization there was as well, which was all the kinds of loot there is (except bonus points for health and force), with the lightsaber customization being a true high point. Really glad EA did not force any microtransactions with more customization, which is not beneath them in the slightest. Also very glad there is not any additional content to the game, which makes it feel more that the game is the complete package, just as intended by the developers.

There is not a lot of bad stuff to bring up, as I feel there is nothing really that stands out as bad (just as with most good stuff never being truly fantastic). But what I do really dislike is the performance and loading times, even though they do not really affect my overall enjoyment of the game, at least not as much as the things mentioned before. The loading times (tested both on HDD and M.2 NVME SSD) are always 40s to over a minute, and you will encounter them every time you die (which could be often considering where the game takes its main combat inspiration: Dark Souls). This is actually the slowest loading game I have come across, on two different PCs over the last 6 or so years (probably even longer). Really bad in my experience, but I have heard that some people do not have this issue which is nice to hear. 

And do not give me any of this that I see on a lot of forums on this topic when asking for help: ""Oh complaining about x amount of seconds of loading times? Back in my day we had to wait minutes blah blah blah"". I know. I have also experienced that before, but that does not mean we should settle nor tolerate the same poor experience/performance decades later, when other devs manage just fine. It just feels lazy. Just because you put up with something bad in the past does not justify its existence decades later.

The other big problem is the constant stuttering, which makes this the worst game in this category as well these past 6 years. I know that this is mainly a problem with UE4, but wow, no other game has ever been this bad in my experience. The only thing I hope for is that Survivor is at least better in these two aspects... 

I have heard that Jedi Survivor is basically the potential of this game realized (but with really bad performance and bugs included lol, but may be fixed) and I am actually looking forward to playing it quite a lot now, which surprised me just as much as the actual game did. A very good ""first draft"" or foundation perhaps, but not something truly special (yet). But there is some huge potential here.

If you want to play a souls like game but feel intimidated by the difficulty that souls games are known for, Jedi fallen order is a great game to introduce you into the genre. This isn't to say that the game is easy, it is however more forgiving than a lot of other souls like games and can offer an extreme challenge when bumping up the difficulty.

The game looks good, not amazing or spectacular, but it's good overall. The motion cap on some characters does look a little odd at times but isn't really a problem. The worlds and atmospheres are fun and each world feels unique and satisfying to explore and adventure. I believe the exploration in this game is good enough I actually felt compelled to gather all of the collectibles and fully explore each map, something that not every game can achieve the urge to hang around places you've already been for over an hour.

The characters are fun and interesting. The banter and interactions between characters during cut scenes in the best way possible, felt like I was watching a TV series at times. I also love that Darth Vader also feels like a genuine threat and menace, that although you've grown so much from your adventures, he's true force not to be reckoned with.

In the beginning bosses were really difficult and took a few times to beat, but as I played the game more and more I was able to block and parry quicker. I found it really satisfying when I was able to correctly counter an enemy the first time I encountered them. The game does a great job at not throwing too much at you when you're first learning, but it doesn't feel too easy either. I played on Jedi knight my first play through.

I highly recommend this game, especially with how often it goes on sale. Hopefully this review has given a little insight into what to expect, and may the force be with you on your journeys.",1703989257,1703989257,True,14,0,0.64443814754486084,0,True,False,False

First and possibly most important thing to know about the gameplay, as that this game dropped when Dark Souls series was huge. The reason this matter here is there are two core gameplay elements which, if you don't like them, you will not like the entire game. 

First mechanic is the Save Point system. There are certain places you can save, and when you do, you replenish your stim (heal) charges. 

Second goes with it, and that is enemy regeneration. Every time you save, all enemies will regenerate in all areas. Even a room you just left. 

Backtracking for Unlocks / Shortcuts. I really hate the feeling of backtracking. Even irl I'll choose a different route back just to not backtrack.  To be clear, you MUST backtrack in order to get everything. Sometimes you have to eait until you get some future skill upgrade and return. 

And about the map...

Map is hella annoying spin-it-what-level-is-this-shit-rotate-it-shit-zoom-out 3D hologram style, with no ability to place markers or follow bread crumbs. The world maps are quite good, and navigation has a Tomb Raider / LOtR feel. But navigating has the stated challenges, and they are especially immersion breaking when you need to get on YouTube to figure out how to get through some unimportant area. 

if you can swallow all that, we've got Tomb Raidery / LotR  puzzle-environments, with enemies to fight. Sweet Jedi abilities, plays so good @ 120hz 4K even on a 3060, and though lots of rails, they are really nice rails. Sound design is Star Wars perfection. It would be had not to like the game if you are a big Star Wars fan. But if you are a big full-service RPG fan, you will be let down. I saved you lol

You won't be able to feel like a Jedi. Almost all standard Jedi techniques are forgotten by the main character. Because of the story? No, because of the gameplay. It's deliberately simplified, and the level design is planned in such a way that you'll be glad that after 2/3 of the game, you finally learned not only to push objects away but also to attract them! Speaking of level design — it's boring and irritating. Be prepared to navigate the same maps several times. And it won't be like in Prince of Persia: Two Thrones; it will literally be the same path, with the same enemies, in the same places.

The plot is simplistic and predictable. Playing the game to find out what happens next? No, that's definitely not the reason. Besides, Disney's canon rules prevent this game from inventing anything new, making the entire storyline literally meaningless.

The parkour is annoying. It's not the parkour from Assassin's Creed, it's not the parkour from Prince of Persia; it's a simple solution the game designers found to prolong the gameplay.

This game is often compared to Uncharted or Dark Souls, but it's more like the four part of the Prince of Persia.",1703935008,1703935180,False,2,0,0.482972145080566406,0,True,False,False

All I really knew about it was that it was kinda similar to Dark Souls style combat with quality cinematics. What I got however, was a fantastic experience. It felt great to have a story set in the Star Wars universe that didn't revolve around the same 6 characters. All the new characters had great chemistry with each other and the storyline was easy to follow with big set-pieces and moments. Cal felt like a better character than 90% of the characters introduced in the sequel movies and the supporting cast all had their own motivations and were fully fleshed out to bring together a very solid narrative and experience. 
 
While frustrating at times, most of the time I felt pretty comfortable with the different combos and parrying enemies throughout the game. Button mashing still was a decent strategy, but the game really shined when you utilized Cal's full arsenal. I often found myself struggling more with basic enemies than the bosses, which was a surprise. Even with tough parts of the game, it never felt unfair or cheap having them beat me. It was always a result of me making mistakes and missing timings. That is the kind of difficulty in games that I enjoy rather than just stupid hard just for the sake of it. Once you get the hang of it, its a blast just carving through enemies in various ways, while still keeping an eye out for tougher enemies that can throw a wrench in your plans. 
 
Fallen Order was another type of game that I probably didn't think I would play in years and I am glad that I did because it was overall a great time. The Dark Souls-y combat still isn't my favorite, but the entire experience is good enough that I can power through and have a good time. I will definitely look to play the 2nd one at a later point just to see what happens to the characters that I was surprised to be attached to.",1703906755,1703906755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Was it Bad... Yes,
Quite a few bugs, camera angles throw you off, parry and techniques are not easy... (other will say they are)
jumping is a pain, if you are off by a few mm, you fail... (tree of origin) (oh and don't miss the feather!) And, you try getting back in the swap... on Dathomir!

- Movement/Abilities feel so clunky.

- Enemy encounters do not feel very balanced at all, either way too easy or annoying as all hell (not in the good way). And somehow, both options can even occur at the same time.

- Bosses feel so boring to fight against.

- Combat is passable, I thought the parry was fun to use. But, there is a lack of variety in the moveset for a decent chunk of the game. You're pretty much just spamming x and every now and then throw out a parry.

- Level design is fine. It isn't fromsoft tier (that really isn't the easiest thing to match anyways), but it gets the job done.

- The story's not that bad, if you're going to play this game for any reason you're probably going to play it for the story.

All and all, this is the most 5/10 game I've ever played in my life. If ""meh"" were a game, this game would be it. Get this game on sale if you want to try it, it's the only time I think it would be worth the money.

Note: My opinion on this game was made primarily though playing the game on Jedi Grand Master difficulty.

Combat is awesome, feels fluid. Bosses are either challenging or cinematic. Story's quite lovely, nothing new but enjoyable nonetheless. Platforming is clunky, and the map-system took me a long time to get used to, but does the job in the end (albeit somewhat quirky). Music is awesome, and so are the graphics. 

If you take away the Star Wars part, you're left with a Disney-friendly pg-rated version of Sekiro meets Dark Souls. Much easier than these titles, but a good stepping stone to get into more souls-like games.

You follow the journey of Cal Kestis, a Jedi forced into hiding, as he embarks on a journey to stop the Empire with a crew he runs into along the way. With the lovable droid BD-1 always by your side, you slowly regain your force powers, defeat a bunch of stormtroopers that have still not learned how to aim, and even find unique plants that you can grow in your ship! The storytelling in this game is truly fantastic, and there are a handful of truly memorable characters, but the thing that warmed my heart the most was Cal's relationship with BD-1: the way Cal truly cares for his droid-partner, and the comedic interactions between the two steal the spotlight. There is nothing negative to say about the story, it makes a great addition to the Star Wars universe.

As much as I liked this game, there are two major things which made the game unnecessarily frustrating at times. First of all - there is no fast travel in this game. At all. Not even to your ship after you've completed the game and are just trying to get some collectibles. I personally don't think there was a strong enough reason to have an absence of fast travel, other than trying to prolong gametime. Second of all - the map design. While BD-1's holomap looks cool and like something you would see in a Star Wars movie, it was unintuitive and difficult to use at times, and there is also a complete lack of a minimap, which just makes it that much harder.

Generally, this game is great. The gameplay is smooth, you can choose your difficulty level if you're chasing a challenge, and there are a number of different enemies and bosses to beat. There are some extremely cool parts of the game, and if you are a fan of the franchise, you will probably enjoy this game.",1702324300,1703788817,True,1,0,0.456815123558044434,0,True,False,False

The world they built is like, ""Whoa, look at this!"" From busy cities to ancient tombs, it's like a Star Wars postcard. Graphics? Top-notch, of course. I felt like I was starring in my own low-budget Star Wars spin-off.

Now, the lightsaber fights? Oh, baby. Cal got cooler moves as I played, and it wasn't just button mashing. The lightsaber felt like a badass extension of my Jedi self. I was into it.

Storyline? Seriously engaging. No spoilers, but the characters and their little dramas were surprisingly good. It's like they took a soap opera script and threw in lightsabers. 

Exploring was my jam. Puzzles, secret spots – they made me feel like Indiana Jones, but with a lightsaber. Sound? Iconic tunes and lightsaber hums – I was humming along. Voice acting? Not bad, not bad at all.

Story is above average, but not fantastic.

Combat is interesting, tho there's some issue, like the block frame is not the instance you press it, but after the arm is rised(no matter the difficultly.) the dodge iframe are also weird, idk how much does it have but feels like less than bloodborne or ds2 default. 
Gameplay is below average. the enemy type and puzzle and exploration are all the same from the start of the game to the end of the game. make it very boring especially half way through the game.

this game is honestly phenomenal, a semi open world game that allows a LOT of customisation (and even more with the power of modding) for me i would say this is almost my perfect SW game with a few hiccups.

where my problems lie, (which there are very little) is sometimes Cal will jank out with platforming and will not connect with the platform / pipe / rope or whatever it is you're trying to reach and can result in falling, this wouldn't be much of a problem, but you do take damage if you fall down a cliff (if you are on any other difficulties other than story mode) while the damage IS small, it is a minor annoyance that can have you wasting your limited stims (healing) depending on your health, or if you want to limit any damage taken in general. i wish this was made better.  

and the 2nd problem is optimisation could be better, i played this both on my old PC (a gtx 1050) and my new PC (gtx 3060) and it still has the same frame issues on certain planets in certain areas, i.e mainly Kashyyyk, which in a game like this where you need to time your parries and dodging, frame drops are frustrating. though having said this, this is still far more optimised and playable than Jedi Survivor.

3rd, and this was sorted in Jedi Survivor (thankfully. however i wish it had been in this game also) about half way through the game Cal unlocks the ability to have dual lightsabers (or to be exact, splitting the lightsaber in 2), but you only get to use them doing a special move, which consumes your force (or i guess stamina.) which sucks, you have different stance styles, single handed, double bladed, and not.. dual? i just always found that odd. again, this isnt a problem in jedi survivor, they added much more lightsaber stances / styles, including a blaster / lightsaber combo which is awesome, but here, seems like such a tease. 

those are mainly the only gripes i can really think of honestly. again, very minor. this is close to a perfect Star Wars game for me personally.

this game also has a lot of collectables found around the different planets that go towards customising cal with ponchos, BD-1, the ship 'The Mantis' and his lightsaber, which is the most lightsaber customisation we've seen in any of the SW games thus far. (this is now outdated with Jedi Survivor adding a LOT more customisation lol)

[b]game synopsis:[/b] this is set 5 years or so after RoTS (Revenge of the sith), most if not all jedi are believed to be dead, or being hunted, and you play as Cal Kestis, a young jedi padawan that has been in hiding since the purge of order 66, trying to live a normal life as a scrapper but after being found by sith inquisitors he's on the run and on a mission of finding himself again as a jedi and who he is as a person, and dealing with the burden of failing his master Jaro Tapal, and relearning all his previous force abilities with his droid companion, BD-1, for the sake of spoilers and not wanting ruin it for someone who hasnt seen anything on this game, i wont speak any more on the story.


[b] TL;DR: [/b] 9.5/10! A great semi open world SW game, but can be really unforgiving on other difficulties if you're not particularly good at souls-like games. on storymode: a chill experience and really fun. on harder difficulties, it is more challenging, even if you have all the patterns down, its really easy to just let your guard down for a second and get clapped. all in all, defo worth a buy.",1609193124,1703720002,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was immersed in a rich and beautifully realized world. The attention to detail in the game's environments is breathtaking, from the bustling cities to the hauntingly atmospheric ancient tombs. The graphics are stunning, and the level of realism adds an extra layer to the immersion, making it feel like I was part of an epic saga.

One of the standout features is its combat system. The lightsaber combat is incredibly satisfying, with a perfect balance of strategy and fluidity. As Cal gains new abilities and hones his skills, the combat evolves, offering a sense of progression that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The lightsaber feels powerful and responsive, making every swing and parry a joy to execute.

The storyline is a true highlight, weaving a compelling narrative that kept me hooked from start to finish. Without giving away spoilers, the characters are well-developed, and their relationships add emotional depth to the overall experience. The game successfully captures the essence of the Star Wars mythos, blending the epic struggle between the light and dark sides of the Force with a personal journey of self-discovery.

Exploration is a key component, and the level design encourages players to venture off the beaten path in search of secrets and hidden lore. Solving puzzles and unlocking new abilities to access previously inaccessible areas make exploration rewarding and adds an extra layer of satisfaction to the overall experience.

The attention to detail extends to the sound design, with iconic Star Wars music enhancing key moments and the hum of lightsabers immersing players in the world. The voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life with authenticity and emotion.

This game is a triumph for both Star Wars fans and gamers alike. It captures the magic of the Star Wars universe while delivering a compelling and satisfying gaming experience. With its stellar graphics, engaging combat, and immersive storytelling, it has earned its place as a standout entry in the Star Wars gaming canon.

[b]Cons[/b]:
- The game is overwhelmingly focused on platforming, jumping, parkour and solving childish puzzles.
- Every area in the game (well, except your ship) is a nightmarish maze (especially the planet [spoiler]Zeffo[/spoiler] which unfortunately you're required to visit twice)
- No fast travel, even after completing the main objectives on a planet you have to run back through the maze to your ship. I think I spent 20% of my gameplay just running back to the ship after each mission. Just look how popular YT videos on ""how to run back to your ship"" are.
- Completely unnecesary souls-like elements that don't quite fit into the Star Wars universe in my opinion.
- The game is painfully linear, player can't really make any choices that could impact the story or alter the ending,
- The AI of the stormtroopers is laughable. They just stand still, shooting every few seconds while shouting generic lines like ""Oh, look, that's a Jedi!"" or ""You won't escape me!"". A funny thing is that you often need to strike them multiple times with your lightsaber even when you should be able to kill them with just one slash.
- Character development feels rather unsatisfying.
- Player can't use weapons other than their lightsaber (I was hoping I could use some nice guns like in Jedi Outcast or Acedemy),
- All items that you can find and pick up are just cosmetic skins for your poncho, droid or ship. I stopped bothering to open boxes after a while.
- Lack of side quests, the game sticks strictly to the linear main storyline.

[b]Pros[/b]:
- The story is somewhat interesting (though it feels very Disney-esque).
- Good graphics, I liked the views.
- Swinging your lightsaber can be cool at times.
- Force pushing enemies off cliffs can be funny.
- Boss fights were quite well designed and a breath of fresh air after killing brainless [strike]chickens[/strike] stormtroopers.",1703284730,1703336491,False,1,0,0.498147100210189819,0,True,False,False

Positives: 
- It does not matter if you have seen the movies or know anything about the Star Wars universe to enjoy this game.
- The combat is very satisfying.
- You get upgrades and unlocks gradually and at the right time.
- The graphics are beautiful, the performance is stable.
- Although it has souls like mechanisms, it has a difficulty setting option that can be changed anytime with no negative impact. Although I did not need it since the game is already forgiving, its a good to have feature so that everyone can enjoy the game.
- The map is difficult to read, but once you understand it, it eases things.

Negatives:
- Microtransact-------- umm where are the microtransactions? This is an EA game, how could they do this? On a serious note, this is how single player games should be, no microtransactions. Good job EA on this.
- The only negative in my opinion is the lack of fast travel. Personally I don't want to go through the same areas again, but I am sure others will enjoy it. This is more of a personal issue since I do not get much time to play so I try to maximize my experience.

If you are on the edge, go ahead and buy it, you will not be disappointed.

EA had a lot to prove and they gave us something great. I like the Assassins Creed/Tomb Raider like gameplay. It compliments Star Wars very well.

 Combat took some getting used to, but once you get a handle on it, it becomes much more immersive. It’s much more tactical then most and requires some patience instead of just plowing through everything. Which to me, makes it much more unique. It’s not super hard but certain boss fights can be very challenging. Not throw my controller challenging, but enough to were I’d have to learn from my mistakes and adjust my approach to the battle. Just like a Jedi! 
It also reminds me of the old Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy Games. Worlds are all unique and fun to explore, if a bit linear, which I know bothers some but I could care less if it’s linear as long as it’s interesting. 

Story was familiar but great to play through. Pretty sure I loved all the new characters and can’t wait for their story to continue. Platforming was fun and intense at times. I enjoyed collecting all the cosmetics and learning about the new worlds and characters. All in all, I loved it. It’s the single player Star Wars experience I’ve needed for a long time.

The fight scenes are demanding which makes the game achievements even more rewarding. All in all great game, great story, insane graphics (although we are already in 2023). Would recommend any Star Wars Fan to play this game. 

One negative aspect: Especially on Dathomir there a to many creatures that you have to face and fight. Feels like a nonstop fight from beginning which makes the experience rather annoying than fun. I would have preferred more story lines on the planet or more puzzles to solve.

That's how I feel about this game.

Foremost, the props: the game looks and feels like a nice Star Wars game.  Overall, the early game play is suitably epic, has nice story building, and overall begins well.  I did start having an early suspicion that the climbing mechanic was going to be overused, and my character would likely suffer overly frequent death-by-not-hitting-the-""e""-button-fast-enough-to-climb-after-jumping, but fortunately, the re-spawn mechanic after falling wasn't punishing, and so overall, pretty content...

...right up to the point where I went to the first planet.  Somehow, I went from moving a rapid clip through the game where my meager PC/keyboard skills more than carried me to absolutely stuck.  I bought a Star Wars game, and I immediately ended up in a miniature Twister game.  I lost blood flow to my fingers -- twice -- in an effort to remember how to stun, run, duck, no stun, not heal, run, die.  By the Almighty, did I die.  

Run, jump, sorry, just didn't hit ""e"" fast enough, 
Run, jump, climb, chase down monster fighting the extra from the set of ""Starship Troppers"", get a mud-hole stomped by my backside.
Run, jump, die
Run, jump, climb, mudhole.
Mudhole.
Mudhole.

So, it is with sadness that I report the Republic has fallen, the Jedi younglings are officially #&*@'ed, and Kal Kestis and his 1/2 of a robot chihuahua are flat on their digital assets somewhere out in the universe.  This game went from fun to *#&@-you too quick for my weak skill set to accommodate.  That wasn't what caused the great purge, however.  It helped, but what finally helped zero out the bits this game used to occupy was the frequent reminder of ""There, there, mommy's boy, you can always move the game difficulty to somewhere above thumb-sucking.  I'm sure it'll be fine then.""  In all honesty, I'm sure it wasn't quite this smarmy, but after reading something like this a few times, thus is where my brain landed, and I'm not going back to find out.

So, if you like repetition, low self-esteem, yippy, coked-up tiny robots, and a chance to play a ginger in a Disney franchise, wait no further.  I'm going to take my weak gamer skills and go have fun.  Delete.",1702989844,1702989844,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

I played this game on Storymode after beating the first boss and seeing just how delayed the dodge was. They want to be a Dark Souls clone but they can't even be bothered to have TIGHT, RESPONSIVE controls. So Storymode it was. They didn't care enough, I don't care enough.

The story itself is just awful. At no point did I CARE about the characters, none of the ""impactful"" moments made me feel ANYTHING, each character is just as bland and boring as the next. The planets you travel to are slogs. You go there once, leave, eventually come back and progress further. It's like they knew Metroidvania games exists but were too stupid to understand what makes those games work.
The writing is cognitively dissonant. For example; in one part you sneak up on two Empire pilots and listen to them talk about their lives, you know them out, steal their AT-AT and get it blown to bits with them still inside, and all the main character does is act all casual about it. None of which gels together and all feels like it was written by three different people and somehow jammed together. 

And it just ends. The ending of the game just kind of happens. I was at 67% when I started tonight and ended up beating the rest of the game in less than an hour. To get to that 67% it took 11-ish hours. Just weirdly paced and improperly put together by people who didn't know what the hell they were doing.

Story: The story is intriguing, but it is getting a little tiresome to find yet another lone jedi surviving in hiding after Order 66. Yoda really missed a lot of Jedi when he claimed Leia was the only other hope besides Luke. This little cliche in the Star Wars storytelling really needs to die. 

Gameplay:Dull at best, frustrating most of the time. The combat is hardly better than an old-school button masher. The pretense of finesse for the Jedi is lost quickly when you have many, many enemies who wield lightsaber-like weapons that are faster and more skilled with them than you at the start and you never get better. The only way you win is because the game hands you victories. While you are slashing at them with your button-mashing, and they are seemingly deflecting EVERYTHING, suddenly the play slows, the game gives you a little animation, and you slice up a foe and move onto the next. Boom, you win. . . because the game needs you to progress. 

But, the combat only makes up 10% of the game. The rest is map puzzles. and ON MY SWEET BABY JESUS, these maps are annoying, overwrought, unnecessarily complicated, and act more like mazes than maps. You are required to solve puzzles while navigating mind-numbingly complicated maps. Once you realize the puzzle has little to no guidance within the game and you've resorted to Googling the answer, then you are in need of getting back to your ship or the next portion of the maps puzzles. The problem; the holo-map you have in-game is about as useful as a cheese baseball bat, and you spend most of your time running in circles trying to figure out how to your next objective. To make matters worse, there are many, many times you are trying to get around the map and find your objective where you slip or fall back into former section, which will require you to spend half an hour getting back to where you fell, only to hope you don't do it again. I have never been both this frustrated and bored with a game in many a year. 

As you are trying to solve the puzzle to progress in the game you find the game has little to no clues to help and provides extremely vague ideas. So, you eventually resort to Googling it, or stumble across it with dumb luck (Seriously, the game has in-game hints your droid gives you, and they tend to be so vague, it hardly helps). Once you've done that, you are either required to get back to your ship, or progress to the next puzzle objective. But, lo, you must find it. The map you are traveling in is so ridiculously complicated that you run in circles, often finding yourself back where you started. Or worse, you make it to a location where you can't backtrack and are forced along another even longer path back to where you were to begin with. Don't worry, they give you a 3d holographic map your droid can project. . . which is less helpful than asking a toddler for directions. So, by this point, you have run around for a good hour, made no progress and find yourself Googling answers, only to find that most people can't help you. Eventually, you discover the vague path you were meant to use and get to your objective. Several hours have passed by this point and you have accomplished little more than literally running in circles until you stumble across the answer or, again, dumb luck strikes. 

Conclusion: Writers hate a review that is simply DNF, meaning Did Not Finish. That means the reader was so unimpressed with the book they put it down without even getting through it. I rarely DNF a game, I will bull my way through it to see if the ending justifies all the frustration. This game earns a full DNF. I got lost in yet another map of theirs and spent two hours trying to figure it out and even online help was of little use. I realized I couldn't care less if I finished, so I won't. The reason I tried this game was because there was a sequel and I wanted to play them both. Well, if this game is any indication of how the next will be, I will never try it.

My biggest complaints were combat and traversal.

I found combat to be very frustrating. As someone who greatly enjoyed Dark Souls and Sekiro, I never got around to enjoying combat in this game. The game purports to emphasize parrying, but parrying is not simply a matter of timing. So many times, I'd press block, only to watch Cal continue with his attack animation and have a chunk of my health bar disappear. Sekiro made me *want* to learn its unique mechanics (having come first from Dark Souls). Fallen Order did not.

There was also a huge dichotomy in the usefulness of force powers. The typical stormtrooper, as you might expect, was pure fodder, and happy to serve as rewarding expenditures of my force bar. But there was very little between that and the more difficult enemies, who seemed to shake off force powers as if I was merely breathing hot air in their direction. Which was all the more frustrating when the game would flood you with both sets of enemies at once.

(NOTE: I tend to approach these kinds of games with a more instinctual approach. For those who tend more toward studying each enemy patiently, you may not have my same frustrations.)

Traversal was also very frustrating. The maps twist and turn with multiple levels. But rather than large open spaces connected by corridors, a la Dark Souls and Sekiro, Fallen Order is almost all corridors and rooms with intricate connections between points. There's no way to fast travel between points, nor is there any navigation system beyond the map. You can unlock shortcuts, but, ironically, that frustrated me further by increasing the number of confusing connections between areas. 

The map is a 3D projection, which, in my experience, was difficult to interpret. A bright shortcut rope for one section of the map could overlay on top of the particular section you were in, and it wouldn't be clear that you were several areas away from that rope until you've rotated the map enough times. This issue is somewhat caused by the level design; a strictly tiered map along the lines of Dead Space or Resident Evil 2 REmake might misrepresent some of the sublevels, as well as how connection points could take you from the northeast-most point on elevation-level 5 to the west-most point on elevation-level 2. AND YOU CAN'T USE THE MAP WHILE UNDERWATER OR CLIMBING. Which is a relatively minor complaint given that the underwater sections aren't terribly convoluted, but it did mean that I couldn't plan my routes until I made my way back to land.

Some more minor complaints are the aimless-feeling platforming and the inability to skip cutscenes. Specifically, there is a *lot* of platforming in this game, and so much of it feels like platforming just for platforming's sake. It felt like a huge emphasis was placed on getting you to have you crawl across multiple sprawling vertical sections over having areas make any real sense on a practical level. Which would be fine if crawling across things felt fun (like Assassin's Creed) rather than a chore to get to the next fight zone or cutscene. And speaking of cutscenes, you can't skip cutscenes. So if you're playing new game+, or had to quit before meditating at a meditation point, you'll have to sit through the cut scene again.

In conclusion, I think some people would enjoy this game--and clearly they have. But if the above resonates with you, then maybe you should avoid it. Even having bought it on sale, I really wish I hadn't. That said, I was able to force (hehe) myself to finish it, so take that for what it's worth.",1702325805,1702343714,False,5,0,0.560000002384185791,0,True,False,False

There are seven worlds that unlock as you progress the story and skills you unlock that allow you to eventually fully explore them. The game doesn't attempt to alleviate the usual problem with metroidvania-style design: usually, it feels sluggish and incomplete to explore until you have unlocked most or all of the major abilities. This is most definitely the case with Jedi: Fallen Order, most notable when you unlock game-changing movement and combat upgrades about halfway through the main story. I can forgive it for this (like I said this is a common issue with metroidvanias) but this is where my issues with the game only begin.

Jedi: Fallen Order has a high degree of visual polish and an unfortunately low level of bug-and-animation polish. This game's movement feels stilted at times and lacks the precision of control (especially in combat) that other games going for higher difficulty usually focus on getting right. As a general rule I have two categories of difficult game: one where I get mad at myself for messing up, and one where I get mad at my in-game avatar or the controls. Jedi: Fallen Order falls more often into the latter. Almost all games, whether well-designed or janky, I will experience moments that I will call 'bullshit' and feel the sudden urge to throw my controller or keyboard into the next time-zone over. I experienced a lot more of those moments with this game. Getting ganked by enemies the camera won't let me see, combo moves not activating, or the classic I-could-have-sworn-I-dodged-that are all happening just a little too often. Sometimes enemies will remain upright instead of ragdolling after death, and on two separate occasions I had to restart the game due to getting softlocked and unable to progress.

Contrast these bugs with the honestly excellent and well-fitting art direction. The new planets, ships, and characters made for this game make for a perfect addition to Star Wars canon. Exploring the new locations gave me the motivation to keep going when the game itself proved to be underwhelming or frustrating. The writing is decent and the cutscenes are well directed. But speaking of the cutscenes...

They are, and will always be, unskippable. They are sometimes a few minutes long and this unfortunately was the nail in the coffin for a New Game Plus playthrough. They occur with a shockingly high frequency to the point where I feel like they wear out their welcome and halt the pace of the game, especially in the early areas when attempting to restart.

I would give Fallen Order a tepid recommendation to the average gamer and a you-should-try-it to any big fans of Star Wars! I like this game and I wanted to love it but unfortunately it falls short of the mark. I haven't played Jedi: Survivor at the time of writing. After playing Fallen Order, I am still interested, but it's definitely not a high priority. 6.5/10.",1702178656,1702178656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The lightsaber duels are awesome until your foe executes some bullshit slow aoe move (they move slow, you move slow and the aoe moves slow) it takes you out the flow for nothing since its slow af so dodging is easy, the parry and evade actions have delay and require good timing so a lot of the combat its slowed down to compensate and that feels cheap.

I put off buying this game for a long time, because I was afraid that it was bad, full of woke nonsense and in general, since it is owned by EA, it would just kill my already fading love for StarWars. Man was i wrong. The story is good and interesting to follow and the main character Cal Kestis aka one of the few members of the fallen Jedi order, who fits the story perfectly. Lightsaber fencing is great and satisfying. Although there are few planets, they are well thought out and beautiful to explore. The map itself isn't as complicated to navigate as some people are making it out to be. The appearance of the Lightsaber can be changed in the game, which is great, by finding new appearances hidden in chests all over the planets. Another thing that can be changed is the appearance of Mantis-the ship (in my opinion, it is not that important), the appearance of the small robot BD, which is good, and the appearance of Poncho that Kastis wears, which in my opinion is pointless, because they are more or less all the same different colors. Planet atmosphere and ingame music is StarWars good. I wouldn't say that maybe this is a Soulslike game, but then again I played it on JediKnight level which is more like Normal mode. Once you learn the moves of the enemy, then it's easy. Also, the more power talents you learn, the stronger you are. Personally, it doesn't bother me because I play for my own pleasure and in my free time that I have.

Run around the galaxy (4 planets) with a handful of forgettable characters you never grow attached to at any point via a meh story as you fight clunky controls, UX issues, bad gameplay ideas from the 90s like punishing you for dying, frustrating save points esp before boss fights, slow loading after respawns, and having to repeat levels over and over again once you unlock a new ability. Watch in awe as you narrrrrrrrowly squeeze through tight space after tight space (seriously how many hours did they spend making that look nice) with your robot pal BD as you, one of the lone remaining jedi after order 66, run away from forgettable villains while you to research the places that will help you talk to the people who tell you where to go to find the clues to find the key that unlocks the thing that helps you save the jedi order hidden away by a jedi hologram for safekeeping.

update 2023: still love this game. can't seem to find any other game that does sword fighting as well as this, as fun I mean. Also, I love that they included a very myserious erie tone to a lot of the environments and story elements, like they made sure to add that part of Dark Souls too as they used it for inspiration. Very welcome. It feels like a part of the Star Wars fiction that doesn't get enough attention. Very Darth Maul eerie ancient sith knights of the old republic type stuff happening. Not all of it is perfect. It requires a reshade, imho. If you know how to use that program, you are lucky, as it can really make a game look much better. Highly recommended. Also, play on hardest difficulty and never look back. Will be a much more engaging experience.

Update: some genuinely moving moments in the story as well, like when the ninth sister talks about being tortured and the Cere story, etc. Underrated story and game.

A good story line (for Disney levels of good, anyway) and good visuals, but honestly, compared to Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy or the older combat styled Star Wars, it's lacking.  The combat system has no nuance and the puzzles are... more  about finding relevant STUFF in amongst all the visual dazzle and less about actual puzzles.  It got better as Cal developed more skills, but honestly, the character control and combat never felt fluid and powerful like a Jedi-character should.   Worse, even with all the openable short-cuts, it feels like 90% of the game is running back and forth, without any real purpose except to extend the game time.

And don't even get me started on the ""take control away from the player without warning"" cut-scenes and camera systems.  Blech.

All in all... not even as good as The Force Unleashed as a Star Wars game and that's a pretty low bar for me.  Feels like they tried to build something like JK: JA, but got so caught up in the flashy visuals that they forgot to make the actual gameplay fun.

The light-saber was a nice game mechanic, but was ruined by the fact that you get all lightsaber types in one package, diluting their unique styles into one less than stellar package.  Forcing the player to choose a lightsaber type (dual, staff, single) at each customization station and thereby switching fighting styles (fast, powerful, combos) would have made this game mech shine.

Frankly the best part of the game was how fluid and easily BD-1 meshes with the character.  It felt very seamless and added some interest to the game that didn't feel contrived, similar to the squad-system in the Republic Commando games.  

So... if you like great visuals and playing with your... droid... go for it.  Otherwise... go buy the older games and enjoy way better gameplay for less.",1701560236,1701560236,False,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

Sucks you're forced to install the EA Origin app to play the game but whatever.

Story is alright, one of the better modern Star Wars writings.
Fighting Stormtroopers is fun thanks to their reactions (dialogue) during the fights.

Fighting against bosses is all the same, you learn when to parry (hold block right before strike. Parry window increases the easier difficulty you play on). And learn when to roll/jump to avoid attacks you can't parry.

And then you attack them during their recovery, normally after they did a red glow attack or when you broke their stamina.

There's not much in customization when it comes to gameplay. You get plenty of lightsaber parts and reskinned outfits to dress up with.

First of all, the story is good. My only problem was that it ended too quickly. It took so much to get there and the ending was like if we blinked two and everything were gone. Didn't like that.

Secondly, I started to play this game on jedi knight mode (medium) because I felt like stroy mode (easy) wouldn't be fun. I was wrong. The enemies are unreasonably way too strong on medium. I literally died over and over again to the Ninth Sister and my only option was to change the game mode in order to be able to defeat her. I wanted to go back and grind because I felt like I'm not strong enough for that fight, but I couldn't. The game didn't let me :) So my only option was to change the mode to easy. It's incredible how huge is the difference between the two modes. I wonder if medium is this hard, how does the hard mode look like? 
So if you don't want to explore for 28972 hours, I recommend you to not pick Jedi Knight mode. I ended up finishing the game on Story mode, but it wasn't fun because it was too easy. But medium just slowed me down and lowkey made me bored.

Another thing is, that I often felt lost during quests and didn't understand what the game wants from me because it wasn't obvious. The idea of the puzzles in this game was nice, however it was a true challenge for my patience. I often felt frustrated while playing.

I bought this game when it was on discount. I would not buy it on full price or not even on half price. It's not that good. But for a few euros it was worth it.

And still, I'm recommending it. The story is good and I started to like everything in the end, but by then it was too late and it ended way too fast.

At some points this game made me feel like it's not for me. I understand it's supposed to be an exploring, fighting game, but it gets boring at some point if you have to do this for too long. And man let me tell you that this game was able to waste a lot of my time. I wish they added fast travel. When you have to go to a location for 30 mins just to get a few minutes long cutscene and finally feel a little joy that you are finally reached your goal, the game will tell you to go back from where you started. At least they added shortcuts, but even with those, it was still a pain in the ass. Basically I had to run from one place to the other while fighting the way too strong enemies and get some skill points. It was not fun. It lowkey made me drained. 

Not to talk about the bugs. They had more than enough time to fix them. And yet, there is a lot. Sometimes you walk into the ground, sometimes the jump doesn't work nor the force powers. Sometimes you end up being stuck on an eternal loop of death because you end up respawning on a sliding platform and can't turn right fast enough because without jumping  and not doing what you are supposed to do you can not make progress.

First of all, it runs poorly. I don't play newer games much so i'm not yet used to this idea that pc games don't run well anymore (again) on high end pcs. I have a laptop with a 3070ti. the game runs at 130 fps on a 2k screen, but has constant drops, the more i went on the more they came. it's not enjoyable on this aspect alone. 

Now, the game. Jedi FO is a mediocre work of entertainment, I won't waste your time on the some many stupid flaws, like the fact that enemies (always) say the wrong thing at the wrong time, for ex you kill one of them and some one says ""he killed them all"". The real problem is that it's so f boring. You are basically a space ninja and you spend the first 5h killing space squirrels all the time. Then you die and you have to start a big chunk over, because it has Dark Souls' checkpoint system. The story starts really cool, for the first 30 minutes, then it disappears and it's not seen since. I know it's supposed to have cool moments, I just don't want to waste useless hours to get to them, and then I guess the game ends.

The combat isn't very interesting & satisfying, the enemy animations & designs are ridiculous, and the exploration & platforming are pointless.
so I uninstall it and checked YT to watch the full game.
Please explain to me, in the name of Darth Vader why clashing two chunks of steel like a katana is more satisfying than the coolest sword in pop culture? 
even only hearing the sound of clashing sword in sekiro can make you orgasm.
From the sound design to the blood spurting, to the execution of dismembering enemy is not satisfying.
if you think this game is really really good, wait until you play Sekiro :p.
and yes, I am paid to promote Sekiro v(-,-)v

update : I was wrong about this game. after rethinking my 2 hours experience in this game, i think oggdo bogdo boss fight alone is worth to buy this game.

to start of this review i want to write that the combat system in this game is mostly good for the lower difficulties, where my problem arises is in the higher difficulties where your slow movement speed does not match the attack speed of the enemies and you are essentially fighting the game just to move your character. 

compared to games like hollow knight which allow you to move fast enough to keep up with the enemies even in the hardest content Jedi hampers you with it's incessant need for realism that it actively hampers the combat.

the planets in this game vary from interesting to blatant fan service, overall i like the planets in the game but the fact that 2 of the 5 playable areas are lifted from other star wars media makes it feel like fan service and it makes the star wars universe feel very small and unoriginal.

as for the areas themselves they are not your average empty open world with items to collect and stuff to do on each end of the map, most of the maps are closed of pathways that twist and turn sometimes back into themselves which gives it a distinct metroidvania/soullike feel and that i do appreciate.

something i like less is some of the mechanics with which you explore the areas, mainly the slide mechanic and how it just does't work most of the times, the game seems to freak out every time you jump onto one of the slides and it just seems like the mechanic wasn't coded very well or it was an afterthought.

the progression in the game is fine for the most part if you are an explorer or completionist you will find all of the upgrades on your first play-through. and as for the story itself it is just vapid nothing, nothing memorable nothing egregious just nothing.

my biggest critique with Jedi and the reason i am giving a down vote is the fact that it is a AAA game. AAA games have an obsession with making games look as realistic as possible in every aspect possible from the graphics to how slow your character moves and you won't notice how truly detrimental it is to the gaming experience until you play something like Hollow knight.

like i wrote the obsession with realism has already negatively affected the combat system but it ranges to far more stuff like the sections where Cal moves through rubble which are agonizingly slow due to how realistic he moves and there are far more examples that i can't be bothered to mention.

another thing the game does at it's own expense is the graphics, i had to lower down all the settings because the game could barely run otherwise on my mid-line PC, sure it's great to have good graphics in a game but if you can't play the damn game then what is the point.

lastly i would normally analyse the game to see if there is anything beneath the shell of this game but there just isn't, this game isn't a gem of a game that will constantly keep me playing and that will be remembered for years down the line like Hollow knight. no this game is just to be played through once and completely forgotten a far cry from the old AAA games like halo, they don't make em like they used to. 

in short Jedi fallen order is just alright as a game, the fact that it is hamstrung by the fact that it is a AAA game and the fact that it is part of star wars means when you pull it all away you are just left with an mediocre game that will not be remembered a few years down the line. 5.5\10

STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order shows us that EA has some humanity in them after all. This is basically DARK SOULS made more accessible through difficulty settings and with a much more straight forward story and universe.

You play as Cal Kestis (Who has the likeness and voice of actor Cameron Monaghan), a Jedi in hiding working scrap yards on the planet Bracca. Cal is forced to reveal his powers when his friend is put in danger. The Inquisitorius are hunting down any survivors of Order 66; a galaxy-wide purge in which most Jedi were killed. This is a canon story that shows us Cal's journey of embracing the force and making new allies in his journey to survive his hunters.

Fallen Order gives us a perfect combat system, in every way. This already great system is made even better through various difficulty settings which allow for different parry timings and more unforgiving / forgiving game play depending on what you desire. I'm a big fan of Cameron Monaghan so getting to play him in a game of this stature and high quality was really a treat. BD-1 is a great droid companion and I love how exploration-driven the game is in general.

Fallen Order has very good level design but features a pretty awful map and very little fast travel options which can make 100%-ing the game extremely annoying sometimes, since you have to go back and forth from areas you've already been to multiple times. The graphics are fantastic and the customisation is . . . Serviceable, although it would have been nice to unlock all of the lightsaber colors much earlier in to the game and have alternative outfit options to the ponchos. I understand if one would prefer to create their own character but this is a canonical story-driven game about a specific person with well produced cutscenes so that simply is not what this is if you were hoping for that. I will mention the game can be very glitchy due to the amount of freedom you have, your character will clip through walls and objects often.

Fallen Order is a great STAR WARS experience that left me wanting more. I have completed the game three times now on three different platforms on various difficulties and the game holds up well each time.

In 2010 then-president of EA said something about single-player games being “finished”. Here we are now with EA publishing one of the best and most successful single-player titles of 2019 under its wing.

Fallen Order tells an original story of Cal Kestis, an apprentice jedi hiding on a scrapyard planet called Bracca. Once he gets found by the Empire hunting the jedi and rescued by some strangers, he learns that the goal of his saviours is to restore the fallen Jedi Order. Having really no other place to go to, Cal agrees to help and embarks on a journey full of danger and failures, but also with a lot of soul-searching and new friends. 
The main advantage of the story is its characters. The main cast is not only always there for Cal, either just to chat about everyday things on the ship or to actually listen to his problems and be a genuine support on the journey, but they also impact the events of the game in a not-so direct way. Greez is being hunted by space gangsters which give you a hard time later, Cere [spoiler] is the former master of the main antagonist of the game [/spoiler]. 
Probably the most important character though, is our companion who is always there for us. Although the little droid, BD-1 doesn’t really say words, he communicates really well with Cal. The “dialogues” between the two form a very cool dynamic and really bond us with the two characters. 
Generally the writing of this game is amazing. The quieter moments with the crew members feel genuine and immersive. It’s this kind of absorbing story in which instead of saying “oh it’s a trap, nice”, you say “DAMN IT CAL IT’S AN OBVIOUS FU.CKING TRAP DON’T GO IN THERE PLEASE” 
[strike]Also, The Hot Goth Alien Cult Mommy.[/strike] 

In terms of gameplay, I'd say this is a softcore souls-like. An enemy that kills you takes your current xp and sends you back to your last meditation circle. To recover your xp you have to reach him again and hit him. Now it’s a cool attempt to make you more careful not to die and lose stuff, but it’s not really working. I was playing on second to hardest difficulty and honestly, I either did not care about the lost xp (it’s really easy and fast to farm back) or I just went and hit the guy that killed me not even because I wanted my experience back, but because he was just in the way. 
The combat is sweet. You can do parries and precision dodges or just roll around if you don’t feel comfortable with your timing. Low on health? Call out to BD to toss you a stim right into your hand. Fighting with your lightsaber lets you do a variety of moves such as throwing it at enemies or literally teleporting to them to close in on them faster. Your fancy glowstick also has a two-sided mode – it exceeds at fighting groups of enemies. It also has an attack in which you dual wield the glowstick and many players wish that this was a permanent mode. 
You can also use [i]The Force[/i]. In combat you can slow enemies down, pull them towards you or (my personal favorite, classic move) yeet them off a cliff (as a side note - many games have cocky enemies talking sh.it, and then get their asses floored seconds later, but hearing a clone yell “YOU ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO ME, JEDI"" while falling down the abyss after getting yeeted off a cliff face is something else). Powers have many versions; a charged push can throw away multiple clones or even a big troll-thing. 
The Force is also used to solve many different environmental puzzles either to progress or to unlock a secret. Outside of combat you explore several places in the galaxy. You move around by climbing some plants, wall running, swinging on some vines, etc. Cal runs and jumps (man, hopping around was just so cool to me) around in a very intuitive way and it’s all incredibly animated. What I must say though, is that swimming overall feels very off and has some really bizarre animations. 
At first visit to some places the exploration feels really natural and immersive. I hardly ever got lost anywhere, even in the more open areas, and if I was ever in trouble, I could always use the map to see unexplored paths I had left. 
Unfortunately, backtracking to certain locations to get the leftover secrets and chests is an absolute disaster. Dathomir is a great planet, it’s a challenging, beautiful wasteland with cool lore and story. Going back to it and trying to reach the swamp area again is just a sh.itshow though. It’s so unnecessarily convoluted. It even seems like in this one place, past the bridge in the village should be an opening to just let you through. Instead, it’s blocked by this little wooden wall that you can’t jump over, so you must go around the whole location. It’s a serious flaw that is not only easily fixable, but just feels like somebody just forgot to put something there. 

The game looks very good and has some amazing landscapes. It also has a photo mode to play with. Regarding animation – most of them are amazing and very creative (BD tossing you heals is just so good). Besides swimming, the only complaint would be the lack of finisher animations. Some foes only have one and others get repetitive after a while. 

Now the sound design – maaan, this is [b]THE[/b] science fiction game. The space crafts flying around, blasters shooting, things exploding, funny glowsticks swinging around. They’re not only high quality and very characteristic, but they all just have the [b]oompff[/b] you know? The soundtrack amazingly complements the vibe. It’s very movie-like. What blew my mind is that if you listen to the OST album of this game on Spotify PC, it replaces the player bar with an extending lightsaber. How cool is that? 

I didn’t really encounter any technical issues, but what’s funny is that there is an infinite jumping glitch in the game that they did not patch. It’s not really that useful though, because you skip many invisible triggers while using it and it screws up the collision and map loading. It is funi. 

I was never a Star Wars fan. This is probably my first encounter with this franchise since Republic Commando on Xbox Classic or randomly seeing The Clone Wars on TV. Nothing wrong with the universe itself, I just never really got hooked by it. 
I was never a Star Wars fan, but luckily Fallen Order doesn’t require you to be one. It’s a wonderful adventure by itself. Maybe even a good starting point into the SW universe for a newbie like myself – and don’t get me wrong, I’m in no position to say that this is a good piece of the Star Wars media not knowing the rest of it. Nonetheless, from my experience with it, I can say that it’s enough to get you hooked on.",1698869298,1700935580,True,44,0,0.798505663871765137,0,True,False,False

How to summerize it ...

- level design is bad, doesn't make any sense outside of a platformer game
- characters have no soul, no emotion, no goal, no ambition
- dialogues are lazy and blend
- enigmas are boring, it's challenging because it's dfficult to master, not because it's creative.
- we come back 20 times in the same 5 levels.
- the first level is litteraly empty
- the fun is hidding
- music is cheap
- levels too easy with only a few types of enemies with bad AI, poor attack patterns and no challenge
- excessively difficult bosses
- empty levels
- looks like star wars, doesn't taste like star wars.",1698622749,1700776403,False,1,0,0.477720946073532104,0,True,False,False

I bought this game a long time ago but only now have the time to finish this game. I thought it would be very outdated if I played it now, but I didn't and it made me want to try Jedi Survivor even more.

[b] Pro : [/b]
1. Very interesting gameplay
2. Adjustable game difficulty level
3. Interesting puzzles
4. Memorable and lovable characters
5. Has an interesting storyline and enough time to play the game
6. Easy mechanics to learn for beginners of games like this :P

[b] Cons : [/b]
1.Parry timing that is sometimes out of sync even though it is just right (Maybe because I am also lacking in this kind of model)
2. The storyline is too slow at the beginning and a little boring
3. Visual bugs in some parts of the map in the game (such as cal entering the ground when it is not mud, etc.)

[b] Conclusion : [/b]
Buy this game if you like Star Wars and are familiar with souls like model games. But it does not rule out the possibility for you fans of souls like games but unfamiliar with Star Wars. Maybe this game can make you like Star Wars  If you are easily emotional and often get angry in playing and also stupid in solving puzzles it is better to avoid this game and buy another EA game. Thank you respawn for making a good game. Btw, when are you going to fix Titanfall 2 :P

-The combat system is satisfyingly fleshed out and reasonably competent.
-Encountered minimal performance issues in the form of often brutal cutscene stuttering but rare gameplay stutter.
-Glitches like falling off weird geometry were present but thankfully still not too common.
-The enemy AI is laughably bad making the game ultimately too easy even on hardest difficulty.
-The looting aspect is dominated with cosmetic unlocks so exploring feels disappointing and unrewarding.
-The puzzles are okay ranging from 1 brain cell easy to getting stuck at most a few minutes but the droid puzzle hints are offered way too quickly, often before I even realized I was in a puzzle area.
-The story is okay with a decent sprinkling of cool Star Wars lore and has several epic moments.
-The length of the game is short with no exploration and average if you try to hit every corner.

I am giving it a thumbs up simply because of the story line and am starting to understand this is not really a hack and slash star wars game but rather like a elden ring kinda of game.

Gameplay - If you are new to elden ring like i am. technically never played such games before. i suggest you start off with story mode or jedi knight. even sometimes reducing the difficulty to story mode when battling some bosses. 

Positive points
- Nice story
- good dialogue in game
- pretty decent graphics
- certain skills feels great like a jedi. ie. pulling enemies towards you and impaling them with the lightsaber.

Negative points
- I find the combat system rather tedious as the i am feeling less jedi and storm trooper with a lightsaber
- enemies do sometimes too much dmg. or rather, the character does not allow you to take too much damage.
- at the start you have very limited skills.So during combat, it's mainly timing with blocking and 1-3 counter strikes and repeat. makes the game very boring and not jedi like.
- minor bugs when jumping around.
- fighting a lot of bugs then storm troopers.

So only buy this game if you do not mind souls liek game. or a star wars fan. But NEVER BUY IT WHEN IT IS NOT ON SALE.

Unfortunately, the game itself is pretty shallow. While you can see the inspiration they drew from Metroid Prime, Dark Souls, and a bit of Tomb Raider, it feels a bit shallow in its own implementation. If it weren't for the Star Wars charm, I probably would not recommend it. But, the environments, story, and characters elevate this, borderline mediocre, game into a fun experience... If you can get it on sale (I bought it for 3,99€).

Overall, it's a good game, and if you have the time to binge the story you'll probably have a great time. Having played the game in chunks, the gameplay feels a little flat. The progression tree is mostly passive upgrades and a few basic combos. The combat itself - up to the point I played - only consisted of light/heavy attacks with 2 lightsaber stances and dodging. The lightsaber stance being an optional unlock early on, but otherwise wouldn't unlock until much later in the story. You also unlock the basic force powers such as push and pull, as well as a unique [spoiler] slow time [/spoiler] power, but they're more important for map progression and quickly disposing of fodder enemies. 

Combat is the basic souls-like experience, dodge and hit in the opening. There's not that much variety in their attacks. You parry melee users to break their balance and then attack them, monsters and mechanical bosses are just dodge/rush loops, and ranged enemies are trivially dealt with by spamming the parry button to deflect blasters. The only exception is the shock trooper, which fires rockets that you can deflect with a force push. 

World navigation feels good for the most part. The locations look amazing, and if you've ever played a metroidvania you'll feel right at home. The routes are pretty linear with some secrets here and there, and you'll regularly unlock shortcuts that open up the map. You also go into multiple Jedi ""tombs"" that require a bit of basic puzzling to get through. The puzzles, so far, haven't been super complicated, but they also aren't trivialized by glowing navigational markers. The game does offer your pet droid to give clues when you're stuck.

Lastly, the game has plenty of Quick Time Events (QTE's) spread throughout, but the developers have been so kind to offer players the choice to skip them altogether if they find those annoying. Which I appreciated a lot.",1700127635,1700127635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a very well done game with lots to explore and collect. The campaign is not difficult to complete and there are some very cool boss fights. The graphics are beautiful and the different themes for different planets means the scenery is not getting stale as you play through the campaign. 
Light saber customization is complex with lots of choices, however customization for things like Cal, BD-1, and the mantis are lacking (you can only change the paint colors). 
However, it's difficult to acquire all the data scans for completion. Many of them are bugged to where you have to find the nearest meditation spot and return to where the scan would be (if you know where it is that is). It's also helpful to note that BD-1 data scans will not be available if you've aggro'd any creatures or enemies in the area.

Do you like jumping and swinging from a vine, dropping onto a muddy slope and sliding down at breakneck speed -- sliding until you hit a wall where you leap and cling to it, before using the Force to slow a fan blade so you can leap through to the next room? All in two seconds?

Well, have I a game for you:

Star Wars: Red-headed Parkour Guy

In Star Wars Red-headed Parkour Guy, you play a kid from that one television show who deals with his abandonment issues by slaughtering literally hundreds of people in a quest to find out the names of everyone who can also parkour.

Along the way, he deals with Spooky Magic, betrayal, characters from television shows that you may or may not know about, betrayal, and Goth Girl love interest.

Of course by the end he's grown as a person and stepped into adulthood.

All of the above is true, but it also includes amazingly charming big-eyed creatures, an adorable tiny droid superior to everyone else in every way, grumpy fat aliens, Jedi Moral Shenanigans(tm), every lightsaber color under the rainbow, and of course, stormtroopers to abuse in a number of telekinetic and parkouresque ways.

If you didn't know what this game was about, thrill to an intensely modeled lightsaber construction system that is EXACTLY THE SAME as the one you can do at Galaxy's Edge, the new Disney Theme park.

Yep, you can build the same lightsaber as the one at the real life theme park.

So is this game good?

Yes! Despite all the shades of corporate blandness compressed onto this delightful little game, it delivers an After-School Special style story in a fun gymnastics playground of parkour leaping, swinging, sliding, and climbing.

Whether you like Star Wars or not, there's a fun game all around the joy of movement, and there's a nice little story about a lost Jedi padawan seeking a way to survive in a hostile universe.

Star: Wars: Jedi: Fallen: Order is worth playing, and a fun little game that will leave you both frustrated and satisfied in exactly the correct proportions.""",1699847566,1699847566,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On the presentation/athmosphere side of things it's great: it looks right, the story is good, the voice acting is good, it does feel like an authentic Star Wars experience through and through. Unfortunately it's all dragged down by very poor gameplay.

The gameplay consists of 3 main parts:

1, Puzzles: the puzzles are generally OK. Not inspired but servicable. My only complaint here is that 0.2 seconds in to a lot of the more complex ones the game starts incessantly bugging you with ""Do you need a hint?"" prompts.

2, Combat: the combat is just... well, sh*t. Unresponsive/laggy controls, wonky hitboxes and uncancellable, long attack animations are unfortunately par for the course for these types of games, but what really takes the cake here is the camera. I don't think I've seen camera controls this bad since the early 2000's. There's a lock onto enemy option (which doesn't always work, and you usually fight multiple enemies anyway,) but even if you manage to turn it onto someone, be prepared to be looking at a wall while a stormtrooper is giving you the world's most thorough prostate exam with an electric baton a lot.

3, Exploration/traversal: there are many smaller problems here that may not be game-ruining on their own, but added together makes this the worst part of the title.
- a lot of the game areas are just way too dark. And by way too dark I mean pitch black, even when using my lightsaber as illumination as the game suggests. I don't know who thought this was a good idea, it would be obnoxious even in a horror game. I can't count how many times I walked off a ledge I just didn't see was there. And it's not a problem with my gamma settings, because other areas look just fine.
- there's a lot of Prince of Persia style jumping sections, but whether Cal grabs onto a ledge or just stoically falls to his death seems to be decided by a coin flip.
- the level design is just some of the worst I've ever seen. It uses verticality the worst way possible, with no clearly delineated levels, and overlapping pathways (ie. multiple corridors passing over/under each other.) Combine this with a map that they for some reason decided to make translucent, so you will always also see the parts of the level behind/above/under the one you're currently looking at, and it makes for some of the most frustrating navigation in any game ever. Especially on the largest planet with the most complex map, I often felt like my eyes were bleeding trying to figure out where I am, where I need to go, and especially, how to get there.
- the rewards for exploring are not that great. It's not really an open world game, but there are ""secrets"" hidden around the levels. These are: meaningful upgrades (least common,) lore bits with some XP attached (more common,) and useless cosmetics (most common.) The last one is a perfect example of less is sometimes more: if they were just removed from the game and not replaced with anything, it would already improve the experience. It's just incredibly annoying when you spend minutes trying to get onto an especially hard-to-reach platform, only to be ""rewarded"" with your 147th poncho material.
- the loading screens are atrocious long, and pretty frequent too. Sure, they are disguised as elevators, and crawling through crevices in the wall, but that doesn't really make it any better. God forbid you step into an elevator by accident when you try to dodge in a fight, because then you'll have to wait a whole minute to go up and then back down again.",1699741569,1699841545,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OK so yeah, I know the new one is coming out tomorrow, but screw it I am late to the party. I just finished this one (yes again the old one that everyone has played except me…). It is freaking awesome. An amazing experience that I really enjoyed.
The game starts off with a nice intro and a story that pulls you in quickly. I do wish there was a bit more on some characters, but they were keeping it short and focused. It is still probably one of the best Star Wars stories since the Empire Strikes back. Again, my opinion here, I like all of the old ones and even prequel, but screw Disney’s new 7-9 which I just did not like, and the TV shows are meh. Just my opinions. Alright, enough of going off topic and those are for another day. This story is awesome, and I highly recommend just playing through Story mode if you just want to enjoy a good Star Wars story.
The gameplay and graphics are also good for how old this game is. The controls work well too, and you feel powerful, but not too powerful. I noticed it has a great balance in difficulty with multiple modes. The gameplay is a bit like Souls games, but not terribly slow/excruciating like the souls’ games out there. I enjoy Souls games here and there, but this game has much faster paced action which is more to my liking.
The only thing I knock it a little on is, traveling through the maps can get cumbersome. There might be a lot of back tracking and I just wish you could at least fast travel. Also, the platforming is not bad, but could use a bit of tweaking to make it more fluid. These issues are not too bad, but really did feel a little annoying sometimes. If they fix/tweak these in the sequel it would literally be perfect!
I cannot wait for the sequel to come out. Let’s just say it is one game I am pre-ordering for sure. Overall, enjoy this great game for the time being.

[h1]The bad[/h1]

Let's beging with the bad, because that's how I started experiencing it. To make it short, this game has all the defects that an AAA game shouldn't have: it suffers from bad writing, a bad PC port despite at best decent graphics (if you don't look at the wookies), numerous small bugs... The promotion of a ""Souls-like"" game is basically just for the save system (if you die, your enemies come back... Alright.). And finally, just like every time with Star Wars, the universe is a huge, fantastic place, filled with an incredible number of different species... And we're still ending up playing as a young white dude, whose major exotic feature is to have red hair. He also has as many layers as a crepe, and could have been written by a 8 years old.

The Deluxe Edition isn't worth the price, too - a few skins for your poncho (btw, why did we have to have so many plastic ponchos, and not a single Jedi robe? I understand they went for a ""Good, Bad, Ugly in space"" aesthetic, but why the plastic?), your pet droid who has feelings, and your ship, the design of which is otherwise completely forgivable. Plus some dev commentaries, but who bothers with that? [spoiler]The only thing I feel worthy of this edition is to be able to choose lightsaber colors from the beginning - but it also detracts from unlocking that at the end, so I would still suggest not to buy it.[/spoiler]

I'll take a bit of time to discuss the technical side of things.
- To begin with, don't bother trying top playi it on a Steam Deck - the EA launcher basically prevented it altogether for me (although apparently it does work for some people). Too bad, I had basically bought the game because I had read that it was the Deck was a great format to enjoy it (which it would have been, IF IT HAD RAN)
- Even on my Windows desktop with an RTX 4070, the game suffered from heavy stutters and extremely annoying screen flickering. The heavy stutter almost made me abandon the game - it's not a very hard game, but it is timing critical, and that stutter made me lose at very annoying times. Anyway, the flickering was apparently due to a bug with the high-resolution shadows; switching the shadows to medium fixed it. And the stutter was due to a very stupid thing: the Bluetooth controller (it's not a third party, it's an actual Xbox controller so the blame isn't even there). I just had to plug it in, and the game worked mostly flawlessly until the end.

[h1]And then again...[/h1]

And yet, despite starting by hate-playing it, after episodes of exhaustion, anger and blind rage, I ended up enjoying the game quite a lot. The gameplay is nice and tight (once the stutters have been fixed anyway), the level design is really good, going back and forth feels really great. What it really is isn't a Souls-like game, but a 3D Metroivania in the Star Wars universe, which is actually great.

As a guy with completionist tendencies, the amount of stuff to find and unlock in the game is just right to aim at finding it all without getting exhausted on it. And most of the stuff you'll find is cosmetic, and how often does cosmetic content is only in an in-game chest rather than a lootbox or a DLC, nowadays?

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Despite this game suffering from defects a game developed by Respawn and produced by EA should NOT have, including bad writing and very annoying bugs even on higher-end configs, it was all in all still a very enjoyable experience. Not at full price but for 5€‎, it's 40 hours of fun: go for it.",1699802139,1699802139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★

""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order"" delivers an immersive and captivating gaming experience that successfully combines the rich lore of the Star Wars universe with engaging gameplay and a compelling narrative. Developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts, this action-adventure title brings the Force to life in a way that will resonate with both Star Wars enthusiasts and gamers alike.

One of the standout features of Jedi: Fallen Order is its meticulously crafted storyline. Set in the aftermath of Order 66, players assume the role of Cal Kestis, a young Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge. Cal's journey is a gripping tale of survival and self-discovery, interwoven with familiar Star Wars elements and characters. The narrative is masterfully paced, keeping players invested in Cal's quest to rebuild the Jedi Order while uncovering the secrets of the Force.

Visually, the game is a spectacle to behold. From the bustling streets of alien planets to the eerie atmospheres of ancient tombs, each environment is meticulously designed, showcasing the attention to detail put into bringing the Star Wars universe to life. Character models are well-crafted, and the animations are fluid, contributing to a visually stunning and authentic Star Wars experience.

Gameplay is a seamless blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and lightsaber combat. The lightsaber combat, in particular, stands out as a highlight. The system feels weighty and impactful, requiring players to master parries, dodges, and precise strikes. As players progress, they unlock new Force abilities that not only enhance combat but also open up new areas for exploration, adding a layer of depth to the gameplay.

The level design is another commendable aspect of Jedi: Fallen Order. The worlds are interconnected, promoting exploration and rewarding players for revisiting areas with newfound abilities. The Metroidvania-style progression adds replayability, as players are encouraged to return to previous locations to unlock hidden secrets and areas.

The game also strikes a balance between challenging combat scenarios and a sense of empowerment as players grow stronger in the Force. The difficulty curve is well-calibrated, ensuring that each encounter feels both challenging and rewarding.

While Jedi: Fallen Order is a triumph in many respects, it's not without a few minor flaws. Some occasional technical hiccups and texture pop-ins can momentarily disrupt the immersion. However, these issues are overshadowed by the overall polish and quality of the game.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a must-play for fans of the franchise and action-adventure enthusiasts alike. Respawn Entertainment has delivered a memorable gaming experience that successfully captures the essence of Star Wars while introducing a fresh and engaging story. Whether you're a Jedi Knight or a Padawan, this game offers an unforgettable journey into the heart of the Force. May the Force be with you!",1699774237,1699774237,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The main component of this game is story, I didn't really care about it earlier and just for the record I still think Cal as main protagonist is ugly and at times borderline unbearable prick but the story is well constructed self contained piece of extended universe with no extremely interesting characters but they all fit in nicely and probably the only one that has a potential for emotional connection of all characters is Merrin.

Second center piece of this game is gameplay. I wouldn't really call it souls-like because even though it shares some concepts (limited stimpacks, leveling at meditation points and respawn of enemies on rest) playing as a jedi is still a power fantasy, not as huge as playing space marine in w40k but still you aren't the underdog here 95% of the time. Combat is smooth with good flow and if I had to compare it to something it would most likely be the batman arkham series.

4 years after the release it still looks great and even though there are no breathtaking vistas the graphical fidelity is there and most important thing is it stays true to star wars visuals. Combine it with typically great music and traditional sound design and you get the atmosphere you would exprect from star wars.

On the other note, there are places with fps drops (not too dramatic that it would feel like stuttering but notable and a bit annoying at times) and sometimes you will see some weird collisions and hitboxes mostly when fighting enemy bigger than humanoid. And if this is still a thing for some people yes you will have to install ea app to play this.

The cinematics, graphics, and soundtrack are beautiful. The combat is tolerable, but the perk trees are the same annoying shit we've seen in all single player games in the past 15 years. And that's about it.

The rest of this is just me ranting about the story and Star Wars in general, so to keep it short- avoid this game even when it's on sale. Just watch the cinematics on YT or read a plot summary. I regret spending those 5 euros that I will never get back, because that's how much I spent on this steaming pile of moose shit when it was on sale.

3/10, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

The plot is terrible. [spoiler] So, you're telling me that we are chasing after a holocron with possibly outdated locations of Force-sensitive children so that we can, what, DECIDE TO DESTROY IT IN THE VERY LAST SCENE? Like, what the fuck was the point of everything? [/spoiler]

Cal keeps remembering THAT HE CAN DO SHIT WITH THE FORCE JUST AS HE IS ABOUT TO FUCKING DIE. It's the greatest plot armor I think I've seen in any fucking game. If you die, it's by your own fault, but this dude always either gains a new ability, or somehow manages to survive by sheer coincidence, or by external help. Cal is the world's most useless jedi, because nothing in this would have happened if other people weren't nudging him in the right direction.

And what's this obsession of the SW writers with the period between Clone Wars and SW4? Why are we continuously exploring how the rebellion started? Why should I care? I've seen enough fucking material from this period that frankly, I don't understand how it's even possible that they keep fitting new rebellion and new jedi order founders into the story. Why can't we get a KOTOR 1/2 remake? Why can't we get something from before the movies? What if I want something from the First Order period? Or hell, even from the New Republic period, however short that was? WHY ARE WE STILL OBSESSED WITH THE REBELLION? Star Wars writers just need to let go of this period, because it's the sole reason why SW is losing fans- we are tired of the Rebellion, and we want some new material in other eras. But the writers for SW are so incompetent at their job that they can't even come up with something new.

It's the same shit you've seen in Star Wars many times. A fallen jedi overcoming his past to fight the Empire, trying to look for some McGuffin, and destroying it at the end to prevent it from falling into Empire's hands. That's basically the plot of Star Wars 7. And I couldn't fucking care less.

A shame because I quite enjoy the cinematic combat system, and I think a game focused more on that could be exceptional.

Exploration is also lackluster, while the worlds do feel tight the actual exploration rewards are primarily skins.
There's a skill tree which is... Ok, in a ""the Witcher 1 had a deeper progression system than this game"" kinda way.

I dont like that hen you press hit you pause before actually hitting anything which makes acquiring a feeling of directness almost impossible i find i am hoping i will hit anything but insecure about the attack itself. Also the world is very lazy built with hardly any interactions and where they are are difficult to find valuable. Clicking a door reading a sign by your little droid.. it reeks of laziness. The landscapes can be beautiful but why on earth the game doesnt load details after a few jumps anymore is beyond me as i am playing in EPIC settings. So enjoying the view is not as good as it could be. - There is sometimes no guideline in what to do, so leaving you confused and kinda helpless: the machines you cant make working the bridges that cant be operated.. it all will work after you get a certain thing but the game leaves you puzzled for a long time.

This is game was such an adventure from start to finish. I think it took me ~1 year to actually finish the game (y'know, juggling this, other games, and my personal life). I even had my laptop reformatted and lost all my progress worth of ~30 hours of gameplay (halfway through the story). Good thing that save files were available to download online but that took me another ~10 more hours to go back and retrieve all of the chests and secrets I've collected in my first playthrough. And, believe, it did not feel tedious at all because the game itself was such a fun experience that it didn't even feel like a redo.

[h3]Graphics and Animation[/h3]
If I were to be honest, it did not have the [i]perfect[/i] animation for a game made in 2019 but that doesn't mean it was not beautiful. Sometimes BD's animation for health stims would happen but the healing would not register—I'd think it's just part of the souls-like experience lol. Sometimes the cut scenes would bug out and the voice audio would be delayed for 1~2 seconds. It was funny to watch. However, what I did love were Cal's poncho/outfit getting wet after getting out of the water and the way light would reflect against the wet clothes, and the cut scenes before and after boss fights. It got me hooked into learning more about the story, but more on that later.

[h3]Level and Area Designs[/h3]
As I've said in the title (sarcastically), I'm soooo amazing in platforming that it's what killed me more than the combats and majority of the areas are focused on that. I'd have to blame the scenery for distracting me and causing me to fall to my demise. Kidding aside, each planet triggered my desire to explore for [i]*in an excited voice*[/i] SECRETS. Zeffo was both a dream and a nightmare for completionists because: 1) it was such a huge map; and 2) well, it was such a huge map. It was like going to four different places in one map and no, I have no complaints. The transition from the aesthetics of what I assume to be was the Stormtrooper's base to actual tombs, which were two in Zeffo, did not clash at all. Everything, from landscaping to scenery felt perfectly placed and I'm here for all of it! The other maps were just as pleasing to look at. [spoiler]There's a total of six planets (in order of appearance): Bogano, Dathomir, Zeffo, Kashyyyk, Ilum, and Nur (not explorable after the final boss)[/spoiler], and me, being the completionist that I am, I looked into every nook and cranny of what I can explore on each map before actually progressing the story, hence me getting all the upgrades and stim canisters before fighting [spoiler]Malicos[/spoiler].

[h3]Characters[/h3]
Yeah, Cal may be handsome with all his scars and slipped back hair but we all know who's the real star of this game: BD-1. All the emotions can be seen on its two WALL-E-like eyes and beeping sounds. Dare tell me straight to my face that BD-1 is not adorable, I would curse you with all of Merrin's witchcraft. BD-1's lore made me feel more emotional damage than Cal and Cere's backstory and I don't even know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Regardless, the dynamics/personalities of the characters did not feel forced. But what felt forced was Merrin [spoiler]suddenly, or well slowly, becoming Cal's romantic interest[/spoiler], but then again, who am I to complain? I'm definitely [spoiler]shipping it hard.[/spoiler]

[h3]Story[/h3]
I can't really say much about the story because my playthrough of this was not continuous. Sometimes I would play every other weekend or once a month and I would have to recall of where I left off. I still have some bits of pieces of lore scattered all over the maps (the echo things that give you expi/skill points) and I'll try to go back to get them all. But, on my playthrough alone, with the backstories of Cere, Trilla, and Cal, I'd say it was okay. Not that great but not sh*t as well. I did like the progression of each act/chapter though, the going back and forth to each planet, making it more satisfying when you explore with better abilities and skills.

[h3]Soundtrack and Sound Design[/h3]
There's not much to expect. It's the typical STAR WARS vibe. But I kid you not that sometimes the bgm for fights would creep me out whenever it would cue in but not a single enemy was in sight and it happened while I was at Dathomir with all the undead b*tches.

[h3]Overall[/h3]
I'm just so happy that I decided to buy this game a year ago. Even got the Deluxe Edition and I did not regret it a single bit despite it just being additional cosmetics that I never really used lol (oh and the bonus content/artbook that I only looked at once, I think). Sometimes the boss and mini boss fights would end up being funny because it was so easy to cheese it and some can even be just tossed over to the ledge but nonetheless, I really had fun, to the point that this game/franchise is making it into my favorite games list. I just hope that the next installment, STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™, is just as good, if not better.",1699151736,1699151736,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

What I got was nothing like the other Jedi games I have, to be frank, wall running really grips my shit as being the only option to progress, or other cheesy crap that keeps me in a loop of timing just to get it right. I wanted an adventure and all I got was a pocket full of puzzles and stupid nonsensical drop boxes.

Jedi: Fallen Order is a Star Wars game that had fans eagerly waiting, and it doesn't disappoint. As a long-time Star Wars enthusiast, I was thrilled to dive into this immersive experience, and it captures the essence of the galaxy far, far away beautifully. Here's my in-depth review of this epic journey through the Force.

Gameplay:
The gameplay in Jedi: Fallen Order feels like a seamless blend of the Star Wars universe and modern gaming. You assume the role of Cal Kestis, a young Jedi survivor of Order 66, and your journey is filled with lightsaber combat, Force powers, and exploration. The lightsaber duels are fluid and satisfying, and the progression system allows you to customize your character's abilities and combat style. The platforming and puzzle-solving elements, combined with Metroidvania-style level design, provide a refreshing change of pace, making the game more than just a hack-and-slash adventure.

Story and Lore:
The game's narrative is a compelling and authentic addition to the Star Wars canon. It delves into the aftermath of Order 66, the rise of the Empire, and the plight of the Jedi survivors. Cal Kestis is a relatable and well-developed protagonist, and the supporting characters add depth to the story. The attention to detail in terms of Star Wars lore, with references to familiar locations and characters, adds to the immersion and makes you feel like an integral part of the universe.

Graphics and Sound:
The visuals in Jedi: Fallen Order are stunning. From the intricate designs of various planets to the lifelike character models, the game captures the essence of Star Wars beautifully. The atmospheric and environmental effects are top-notch, and the lighting and particle effects enhance the overall experience. The sound design is equally exceptional, with John Williams' iconic score and authentic Star Wars sound effects immersing you in the galaxy.

Difficulty and Challenge:
The game offers different difficulty settings to cater to various player preferences. If you're a fan of challenging combat and tactical gameplay, the higher difficulties will provide a satisfying experience. The learning curve is well-balanced, allowing both newcomers and experienced gamers to enjoy the game at their own pace.

Replay Value:
While the main story is engaging and offers a fulfilling experience, Jedi: Fallen Order also encourages exploration and completionism. The incentive to revisit planets, find hidden secrets, and unlock new abilities can keep you engaged even after the main story is complete.

Bugs and Optimization:
During my playthrough, I encountered a few minor bugs and optimization issues. However, these were infrequent and didn't significantly hinder my enjoyment of the game. It's worth noting that some of these issues may have been addressed in post-launch updates.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars gaming legacy. It captures the spirit of the franchise, offering thrilling lightsaber combat, an engaging story, and the opportunity to explore iconic Star Wars locations. If you're a Star Wars fan or just a lover of action-adventure games, this title is a must-play.

Is the story good? Yes. Are the characters good? Yes. Are the graphics good? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. All those questions I answered yes too but I can't help but mention some of the sheer BS in this game that really ruins the experience. At many times during my time the controls felt unresponsive, I would double press B to dodge and Cal just wouldn't. I'd hold LB to block and he'd just stand there. Sometimes, during combat, I'd press UP on the D-pad to get a Stim from BD, Cal would then say his little line like ""BD, Stim"", and then the action would just cancel itself. The maps in this game are excellent and so fun to explore, but are just ruined by the sheer overuse of animals and wildlife that jump out of the ground and annoy you. Some of those big spider and slug things were more difficult than the final boss fight. Additionally, some of the obstacles and parkour was so picky that if you didn't jump or drop at the exact damn centimetre, you'd fall off. Just little things like this really interrupt the game for me. Respawn have got to remember, we're essentially playing a movie, so it's kind of gotta feel like one.

I'm going to say ""Recommend"" for this game because I believe it is an inherently good game, but the experience is heavily hindered and interrupted by little bits of BS and annoyances which I hope they iron out in Jedi: Survivor.

Reason are CONTROLS. They are so frustrating, even random, that you cannot make a tactic out of it.
For example - dodge. It comes in 2 forms ON THE SAME BUTTON: 
1) Step in direction to avoid the attack (totally useless against bigger enemies with large swing)
2) Roll, if you press it twice quick. 
However, YOU DON'T KNOW THE DIRECTION WHERE YOU WILL ROLL. The reason is - computer executes step, but that step can EASILY go in one direction, totally different where you pressed. For example, if you press dodge + right, character can dodge LEFT, because the dodge makes more sense to do it to LEFT. However, when it comes to ROLL, he will also roll to the left, most of the times ending on the hand/weapon of opponent. 
With inability to predict what your character will do, EVERY fight becomes frustrating, even with zergs. 

What EA should've done is take OLD Jedi games - Kyle Katran, for example - and apply THESE commands. Or, better yet, play Witcher 2 or 3 and use that controls. There, you have full control over your character, as you are himself. 

Also - did I mention that there is no KEY BINDING SCHEME? You don't have any graphics for keys if you use keyboard - only controller. When game launches, it says that ""it is best experience on controller"" and turns the key bindings graphics to controller. So when starting, I was thinking that I cannot run the game because I don't have controller. And when I wanted to check the controls - you can do it only if you go to the ""Edit keybinding"" screen. And only there, you can scroll and scroll, instead of choosing in the beginning - controller or keyboard (with possible switch later, if you need) and you have graphics for your choice. As any other game has. 

Pity, as whole thing looked marvelous and graphic and story is absolutely stunning. I would give between (thumbs up and down), but since it allows only one option, I stick at down, because of all frustration I had using controls.",1698591022,1699050115,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order seemingly had all the ingredients that would make a great game – franchise with immense following, already mature and evolved lore developed through past games and other media in the franchise, and a promising development team.

Unfortunately, although the game was graphically breath-taking more often than not, shallow and one-dimensional characters managed to completely obliterate my will to emotionally invest myself to the story. This comes as a great shame honestly, as there were points in the game that managed to scratch that itch for second – just to further inflame the rash. I gave myself some thought about this, as it is seemingly unfair for me to expect the intrigue and level of detail I once enjoyed as a kid playing KOTR or past instalments of the Jedi series – just to come to the very same conclusion. It seems that whoever was writing the script of this instalment seemingly forgot that Star Wars has always been a glorified space version of your regular soap opera, filled with intrigue and sometimes dumb choices – and I say this with no grudge whatsoever, as that is one of the main reasons, I actually liked Star Wars franchise in the first place (as long as it does not cross the line of absolute stupidity). So, for those seeking a gripping story – I’d recommend looking elsewhere.

Now, about the gameplay – the only potential saviour of this game. While transversal is quite alright, the same cannot be said for souls-like gimmick of a combat system. This mainly stems from the fact that although the beforementioned combat system looked good on paper, its implementation was utterly catastrophic. Your lightSABRE feels more like a lightSTICK. Parry elements are godawfully clunky and random, whilst force powers are barely useful – and don’t get me started on lightsabre-on-lightsabre combat that is nothing but a button mashing contest. Even games like Jedi Academy (that was published 20 years ago… JESUS I’M OLD) saw more compelling swordplay. In short, I see no point for the industry to board these goddamn souls like combat train if it’s not ready to emulate that sweet *umpf* sound you exhaust after hitting a perfect parry, roll, or whatever.

Overall, I may say that I will most probably play the sequel. However, this is only due to my space addiction and a hunch they saved the intrigue and protagonist’s internal battles for later. [b]If you were to ask me if I would recommend this to anybody else, I would most definitely say “It’s just not worth the time, at any cost”.[/b]",1699031156,1699031319,False,2,0,0.526564955711364746,0,True,False,False

You WILL fight with the EA launcher that is forced upon you.  You WILL fight it every single time you launch the game from Steam.  

It will fail to launch almost every first attempt because Steam and EA launcher cannot effectively communicate because they obviously relegated this programming task, both companies, to their summer interns.  Because of this, the game experience is ruined right at launching.

It will most likely fail the second attempt at launching, after the first attempt, for the same reasons.  From that point on you either have a 50/50 chance, or you have a 0 chance.  In the latter, Steam thinks it has launched, EA launcher thinks it has launched and integrated with Steam, but no game ever actually runs.  You are now at a point where it will never launch until you hunt down the individual processes in Task Manager, kill them all, and start your launch again all over from scratch.  Again, be prepared for it to not launch properly.

Daisy chaining and integrating two separate launchers together to launch the game is the playground of terrible software engineers and incompetent company managers.  Congratulations to everyone involved in this launcher fiasco.  Truly.",1698878955,1698878955,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 I would say this is controller optimized. Some of the buttons are a little bit of a reach. A mouse with at least three programmable buttons is a must for this game on mouse and keyboard. 
Does have new game plus so im excited to explore that more later. 


Got this on sale for 9.99, Would not pay more than 25 for this game.  40 hours is a decently long game, but i for sure could have rushed it and gotten in done in closer to 30.

POSITIVES:
Looks great. Most of the time.
When you do well in a fight, it's really satisfying.

NEUTRAL:
It is fairly challenging, which is fine, though I don't always want to / have the time to spend half an hour on a single fight. Yes, I am bad at this game :).
The controls don't always feel responsive, especially when you're trying to move around / dodge. 

NEGATIVES:
The save system. Yes, it's the staple of the genre but I don't care. I hate it. Partially solved by a third-party mod which allows you to quicksave, but that's hardly ideal and doesn't work 100 %.
Backtracking. Always, all the time, forever. While using a map that's DOOM level bad.
The game just feels unpolished/unfinished. The animations range from beautiful and fluid (mostly Cal), through janky as hell (enemies, monsters especially; sometimes Cal as well), to simply frozen with objects sliding around (monsters). The environment is basically non-interactive (breakable vases - those actually made me laugh, you can also cut predefined pipes/vines etc.) and strangely empty, which really breaks immersion.
Group fights are a total chaos. Enemies just run at you or fire at you with a complete disregard for their fellow man. Which is funny the first time but feels really stupid afterwards.

Exploration is encouraged but exploration is retracing steps over places you've already been to because you need a new upgrade or force power to access the previously unavailable areas which are mainly very small offshoots or simple walls that hold an upgrade, usually cosmetic only. I should also mention that although it seems like you have some choice in which order to visit planets it's mostly a linear affair and you are strongly encouraged not to go to one of your first two choices. I ultimately didn't care for the combat, levels, nor story at all and decided to save myself the grind and stop playing. I do not recommend this game.

Gameplay: As described above, this is a single player 3rd person action game with light RPG mechanics. The main focus is split pretty evenly between combat and light platforming/puzzles as you progress through the story. I'll focus on the combat first. I did not realize that this was based on soulslike combat and so when I was thinking that man these enemies are tough on the jedi setting, it was all intentional. I had started the game hoping for some lightsaber combat like Jedi Knight 2 or 3, but this is much more about memorizing patterns, heavy emphasis on blocking, dodging and forces you to manually do a lot of the work I enjoy not doing (auto avoiding/reflecting blasts when your lightsaber is out, for example). If you like soulslike, I think you'll find this combat a little lighter in comparison, but for me it was much too much that style. The 2nd part of the gameplay is a heavy emphasis on platforming and puzzles as you explore and progress through levels. I love platformers, this isn't fun either. It has the normal jump from platform to platform, but the majority of the platforming is stuff like sliding down and timing jumps as well as wall-running with some ropes thrown in here and there. All of that sounds great, but I found a varity of bugs even however many months post launch that would ruin my platforming and made it just a grind to get through. Plenty of times I'd jump from platform to platform only to have the protaganstic act as if he had hit a wall and then stumble around and fall off the prior edge (it was hilarious on the ice levels as he'd land on the next ice slope and then look confused and shutter up the frozen slide and fall off). Nothing in the gameplay made me feel I was having fun so I give this a 3/5, only because I think the combat could be something soulslike people might enjoy.
Story: The reason I play single player RPGs is for a great story. This is Star Wars but new Star Wars so you are running into some people from the new trilogy and it looks like they were trying to flesh out the characters that were never given a chance in those movies, but the plot is still barebones. I never connected with the protaganist nor the side characters in my 7 hours. My favorite was the droid who was a perfect companion, even turning on his light when we entered a dark cave automatically, if that tells you anything. You also can't skip story scenes which I wanted to do as they pretty quickly grated on me. 2/5 as I felt no need to progress to learn more.
Music: I love Star Wars music but I didn't find the music here to be that great aside from the few usual places that you hear some John Williams. 3/5
Graphics: The Graphics were high fidelity, but the environments I thought were very lifeless. The first world that you land on was just dull, and I never felt it improve from there. Nothing I saw made me go ""wow"" and usually when i'm exploring exotic worlds or ruins I would hope to see something that makes my jaw drop but nothing here made me do that. 3/5.
Fun-factor: I just didn't find it here. Pretty much from the get-go I was thinking that there were some strange design choices made, but hoped it would improve with new force powers or movement options but after 7 hours and 3.5 planets (as I had started the one you're strongly encouraged not to go to first) I finally said enough and will spend my time with a better game. 2/5.
Overall: I know this game was received positively by many people but I just didn't get engaged by the story, characters nor worlds. And I love Star Wars, I enjoyed Kotor 1&2, The Old Republic, as well as Jedi Knight 1&2, but this just didn't land. 2.5/5. There are better games out there to experience and better ways to enjoy the Force.",1698542024,1698542024,False,9,0,0.559552252292633057,0,True,False,False

One thing that really killed this game for me, the soundtrack. Either get John Williams scores from the movies or do something original. Through out this game I could not remember a single theme or song that stuck out. They had two composers that were balancing cripping John Williams scores to sound different enough and like a dreamworks movie of blandness. For the love of god EA either pay for the original tracks or do something original it really kills a work when you don't have music that actually conveys themes or heart.

Positives:
- Decent gameplay
- Not a terrible story
- Good acting and script, people's dialog felt organic
- Pretty good collectibles, not a collectathon but worth I had a decent time collecting for story and cosmetic 

Cons:
- Odd glitch here and there (the thumping low health blood meter played through out through the credits)

A slightly derivative amalgamation of what other games in the genre have done better, in a fun Star Wars package.
The story is fun and surprisingly engaging on a replay, but it feels overly familiar and tropey. Characters are well designed but lack proper development and opportunities to interact with them. Cutscenes are spectacular, they look great and are very well animated, outside of them character animation tends to be rather stiff looking and inorganic.
The story has some great moments, spectacular set pieces, and it’s overall pretty well paced. Doesn’t overstay its welcome and has a few surprises sprinkled about. A great Star Wars adventure that can’t fully shake off a feeling of familiarity and predictability.
Traversal gets more engaging as the game goes along and the player starts unlocking new abilities, but it doesn’t ever come close to being as engaging and polished as what Naughty Dog perfected in Uncharted 4. I’ve never been a big fan of this style of platforming, and while double jumping is fun enough, it still hasn’t won me over.
Combat is where the game struggles the most. When it works properly it’s an extremely engaging attempt at bringing Souls-like combat to a mainstream audience, with the addition of unlockable combos and cool force powers. Sadly, it lacks the polish and exactitude that From Software tends to bring to their games, specially around collisions and character animations. There are plenty of combat encounters that are just annoying to get through in any of the very welcome difficulty levels because of this reason. It feels like with some more time in the oven this could have been fixed, as the bones of the system seem really solid and fun to play.
Easily the best Star Wars game in a long time. A solid foundation that I hope the sequels build upon.

In these scenarios the game puts you into a series of intentionally unwinnable fight scenes (not difficulty wise), or the AI just uses a never ending series of unblockable attacks, so you spend all your time dodging like its dark souls, and much less lightsaber-to-lightsaber clashing. 

The system itself is put together pretty well, actually. So having multiple ""you're supposed to lose this fight"" fights, at that point I just lost interest in the game as a whole.

You can make a story about someone who's weak without making boss fights that have you lose, or ""even when you win, you lose"" kind of thing. (Again, not gameplay difficulty kind of ""can't win"", but ""story"" kind of ""can't win""). 

As a side note as well, since you're a Jedi who has a range of abilities to do certain things, there are many situations where despite all the techniques you know there's often a single way to deal with a problem, with no other possible solutions or approaches (like the Dathomir Nightbrother's Village bridge, where they sit up there shooting unblockable attacks at you, with the only solution is to simply run through the middle). Its disappointing.

Just to recap though, everything else about this game is fantastic, so if you're okay with fighting several bosses where you're SUPPOSED to lose against (or be rescued from), then go for it. 

It just wasn't a satisfying experience for me.

Graphically, it's really good, but you pay for it with rather poor performance, especially when traversing into new parts of levels, but also during some combat encounters.

Combat itself is your run of the mill souls-style, meaning a lot of rolling around and dodging and parrying. Honestly, it does feel satisfying for the most part, but there are some issues with hit registration here and there. Some of the enemies also have the annoying ability to change attack direction even when they are in an attack stage where that does not really seem physically possible.

The music is very forgettable, which is a huge let down considering some of the absolutely stunning musical pieces Star Wars had over the years.

The narrative is pretty run of the mill, so are the characters, at least as far as I got into the story. Considering some of the absolute burning garbage piles the Disney SW era has spawned, a thoroughly meh run of the mill story is probably a huge win for the SW fandom.

The platforming is current-era-Tomb-Raider, but worse in pretty much every regard, and the new TR is already far from perfect. It's not outright bad, it's just a bit off. The snapping is not quite as good, the jumping is even less predictable and lacks precision, some animations seem to have a couple ""empty"" frames at the end where the character just freezes in place which makes it feel super clunky, like controlling a particularly unwieldy robot. This extends to some animations outside of platforming as well, which does impact some puzzles, etc.

Speaking of puzzles, they are not super hard to do, but the physics ones are extreme pain in the ass because object physics are not very good.

I could deal with the boring narrative, or middling imprecise ""realistic animation"" based platforming, or with the lack of technical polish, but all three? And at this price-point? Nah. The rest (music, hitreg issues) is just the last couple nails in the coffin.

Overall, it's a pretty uninspired game and what good parts it has get counteracted by a pretty noticeable lack of polish, even several years and patches after release. It's, as the kids say, pretty mid. I'd give it a pass unless you are a big fan of this type of games and Star Wars and there's a pretty significant discount at the time.

Should you play this game as a generic gamer? Yes.
Should you play this game as someone who enjoys Dark-Souls like Melee Combat? Yes

The game starts off with a great story which evolves with great character depth and growth, with a very surprising ending that noone would have expected!

PROs:

- A few planets to fly to, each with a unique fauna and mini-bosses, including a fully explorable world
- You can set your character skills however you like, there's no set path
- You can customize your lightsaber greatly
- The game included many new characters and lightsaber colours into canon (important if youre a star wars nerd)
- The worlds feel alive, the graphics are really nice and the ambience is on-top

CONs:

- I would have wished for more accessible planets
- The story is fixed, there are only a handfull of choices that you can achieve yourself - most of which aren't even game changing, just part of a conversation
- I expected a few more bosses. There are a few but not every planet has its own boss which is a downside for me. Also, you fight one boss more than three times which is a little tiring

I'd rate this game a solid 8/10. You should absolutely play this game if you haven't already, especially if it's on discount (I've bought it for 5€ during a sale)!",1698059721,1698059721,True,1,0,0.506870269775390625,0,True,False,False

Update: switched to my gaming PC and the EA app seems to have synced my save game in the background, but a version that was one week older than the current one.

It's another example in a long list, that most triple AAA games these days are not for me anymore.

Although I quite like the overall atmosphere and the lightning effects but the rest just feels stale and generic.
To many design choices which killed immersion for me.

GAINING XP:
While you still get a bit XP from killing enemies, there are random spots ( a lot of them ) where you just press a button to scan something or listen to a echo of the past and voilà you gained a big chunck of XP..................really?

Movement:
Way to many of those ""sliding down a slope"" sections where you get the feeling driving a truck with the handbrakes applied.
Jumping onto ropes or while climbing is very imprecise, especially at the end of those ""sliding down a slope"" sections.

COMBAT:
Basically it's a imprecise version of the Dark Souls combat system, but at least it looks cool.

LOOT:
In 9 out of 10 cases all you'll find in chests (after a non-skippable animation of 3 seconds) is purely cosmetic nonsense.
New colours for your sidekick, lightsaber, new poncho, new whatsoever................boring.

RIDDLES:
Tedious, simple, boring

Well I could go on forever like this, but you get the point.
I'm not going to finish this game nor play the successor since the direction the series is heading is note mine.

The gameplay is good but not amazing.
- I liked that the progression wasnt too 'hand holdy'. It tells you your main objective but doesnt walk you through every little step on how to get there. They did have hints for puzzles in case you seemed like you were stuck, but other than that you rely more on the character dialogue to figure out what youre supposed to do next. I think more games could benefit from doing that. 
- The environments and creatures were great, your typical Star Wars experience (except for the Wookies, the Wookies are hilariously ugly in this game). I didnt feel like it was very rewarding to go off the main path though. The game mostly has meaningless cosmetic unlocks, with a few areas that will benefit the protagonists abilities.
- The combat was done well. The only gripe is that they give you 4 difficulty levels, but no achievements linked to difficulty. The higher difficulty settings make things pretty challenging and I didnt want to sink endless hours into this game so I appreciated the option to flip between difficulty settings as you progress through the game.
- Unfortunately this game is a laggy mess. Huge frame drops happen anytime the game is loading something. I tried to optimize my settings and didnt get any improvements. I had the same problems on medium as I did on epic. This game has no loading screens, and loads in the next area while you are moving through transition points. A problem I noticed with this was that the game actually starts loading (lagging) before you even get into the transition area. Its awful.

Overall, I would say that this was a great game mostly because of the epic story, but wait for it to hit a steep discount because the gameplay wasnt as legendary as I had heard, and this game likes to play hot potato with your frame rate.",1696902327,1696902327,True,5,1,0.557055413722991943,0,True,False,False

Overall the game play is decent. I think the highlight for me were the puzzles and exploration. I really enjoyed the level design, how they fold back in on each other. That said, there are a number of times when I wish the clear path forward was more visible. You see 2 options, left or right, you pick right and it goes to a cut scene or boss fight, and it turns out later on when you come back, going left was a simple collectible before which you would've gone right anyways.  

Combat is fine, I enjoyed the troop fights more than anything. Boss fights I found to be annoying and too souls like. Why do I have a massive health bar if most monsters 2/3 hit you? You're supposed to be able to parry/block most attacks except when the enemy turns red, but I found that there were so many more boss moves that were also unblock-able but not flagged as such. I get it some people might like that type of mechanic, I don't. Turning down the difficulty would've made the regular combat too easy.  

Overall, it was a decent play through, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise.",1696641754,1696641754,True,2,1,0.512562811374664307,0,True,False,False

If you enjoy a tight(ish) combact system with exploration and revisiting maps you already went though, you will definitely enjoy the game.

Not as hard / tight as other Souls-like games, exploring doesn't feel that rewarding, mainly since without some specific gear that gets unlocked via the story you will keep having to revisit and explore a bit more, feeling more blocked in your exploration then actually ""unlocking"" new content or ways to travel.

The story, unless you are a huge fan of Star-Wars is completely skipable / missable, since everything you need to know about it will happen in the first and last 60 minutes of the game. The plot moves along as you expect it to move along, but in the time period it takes place in the Star Wars universe, it would be foolish to assume major changes / surprises / plot twists.

In general, 20ish hours to complete, a bit more to 100%.

However, with how glitchy and buggy the gameplay is it can be really frustrating... i.e. certain cut scenes not triggering correctly, an enemy glitching into the wall and you cannot continue and have to reset the scene, confusing instructions at critical moments, etc.... 

I liked the challenge of playing it in Jedi Knight mode when the controls worked the way they were supposed to, but when I hit the attack button a dozen times and Cal just sits there being beaten up by an enemy, then it is not a challenge, but a frustration. I was mostly interested in the story, so I switched it to story mode to give me even a chance at beating the enemies with all the glitchy game play. 

So, good story, semi-decent gameplay, but short. I finished this game rather quickly and would have loved a little more meat on the bones so to speak. It would have been nice if there was more content to the story and not as much random exploration. It was frustrating trying to find specific paths after unlocking the maps as you could not see where you had not been or how to get to certain areas.  Lots of filler content rather than story and true exploration. 

I do appreciate how it does give an open world feel while still keeping you in line for the story itself, but not worth the usual $60 - $70 most games are worth now a days. If you really want this game, wait for it to be on sale is my suggestion.",1696144226,1696144226,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game features a serviceable souls-like combat system, with a parrying system that can feel epic at times and busted at other times. But I think the mythos of the world that the Lucas-crew created shines through. 

As with all SW games, I feel like the story-telling is always stuck in the past trying to retell the stories of the movies rather than add (almost anything) to the worlds/galaxies that are new. That is fully on display in the storyline.

Even so, I really liked the characters. Even the creepy bug-eyed lady was alright by the end of the game (seriously, where is a mod to fix her eyes so she looks like the actor and not creepy as hell). In particular, night-sister Merrin was my favorite character outside of Cal Kestis.

The ending was interesting and I hope they lean on this in the second rendition. The big reveal, the lost apprentice, the lure of the dark side. All fantastic storytelling.

Lastly, it must be said, this PC port blows chunks. Forced TAA, blurry visuals with AA or flickering visuals without. The game never looks the way it should. There needs to be a remaster that includes DLAA to fix the visuals and this game would be a solid 9/10.",1696111423,1696111423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game tells a story at an interesting and exciting moment in Star Wars history, and does so while creating a brilliantly-written cast of characters that emerge as not only some of the most memorable characters in the Star Wars universe, but in the gaming space, as well.

[b]➕ The CHARACTERS.[/b] While I certainly expected Cal to be the star, I was surprised by the quality of the whole surrounding cast. EVERY character has a personality, a drive, and feel like they make consistent decisions when confronted by challenges—both the light and dark. They are memorable, powerful, and carry the game through the few areas where it struggles.

[b]➕ The VOICE-OVER.[/b] Only adds to their humanity (or alien-in-ity?)... The voice cast is absolutely top notch, and do an amazing job of adding [i]soul[/i] to each character. When combined with strong writing and motivations, they create truly iconic heroes and villains. [i](...better than some cinematic Star Wars characters…)[/i]

[b]➕ BD-1.[/b] The LEGEND… I didn’t think I’d find a new favorite droid, but I have found a new favorite droid.

[b]➕ The MAJOR SET PIECES.[/b] Throughout the game, there are several “WOW” moments that somehow manage to deliver all the immersion and excitement of rampaging through the Star Wars universe as a powerful space wizard. I won’t spoil them, but it’s well worth playing on Story Mode if only to enjoy these glorious moments! (…definitely stick around to the end of the game!)

[b]➕ EXPLORATIONS OF THE FORCE.[/b] I can’t go into too much detail, but WOW… The way the game explores the Force through flash-forwards and echoes is REALLY powerful. Again: I won’t spoil them, but they are some of the most memorable moments in the game.

[b]➕ The FEELING OF BEING A BADASS SPACE WIZARD.[/b] With great power comes great power fantasies. And while the fights can be challenging, overcoming them through practice and patience—or just slicing through a large group of Stormtroopers—feels AMAZING.

([b]TIP:[/b] As a non Souls-esque player, ‘Jedi Knight’ was perfectly challenging enough for me. I probably could have gone ‘Jedi Master’ but don’t require that torment in life...)

[b]➕ The MUSIC.[/b] Everything about the soundtrack nails that perfect “Star Wars” feel: from the instruments to the ambiance and the excitement of the battle tracks.

[b]➕ STORMTROOPER DIALOGUE.[/b] Is SO GOOD. I’d end up pausing for moments to listen to them chat because they are so, so relatable. [i](Especially the feeling when an unstoppable space-wizard rolls through and ruins your day…)[/i]

[b]➕ KILLING STORMTROOPERS.[/b] The game does a phenomenal job of making them feel *just* threatening enough, just proud enough when they manage to land a hit, and just terrified enough when the lightsaber comes out to make for a brilliantly perfect Star Wars experience!

[hr][/hr][h1]🟡 THE...""TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT""[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]〰️ LEVEL DESIGN.[/b] The world design is amazing when it’s not downright ENRAGING. It feels great when you’re exploring and following along with the story, but becomes a tangled mess of maze-like tunnels when trying to find the one correct path, an obscure collectible, or even just taking the long path back to your ship.

[b]〰️ ICE SLIDES.[/b] Get tired quickly. The mechanic has moments where it “fits” in the world and feels fun (i.e. at the very beginning), but ultimately adds little more than mechanically frustrating, pace-breaking deaths in the middle of otherwise interesting moments.

[b]️〰️ The GAMEPLAY.[/b] Overall, it’s FINE, but the controls and combat aren’t *quite* as tight as I’d expect. Particularly in a game where precision is critical, it feels like many deaths are attributed to animation locks and dropped inputs instead of mastery over your attack combos or learning the attacks of your enemies.

[b]〰️ The MINIMAP.[/b] While it’s a super cool and thematic implementation, it is difficult to read, navigate, and doesn’t paint a clear picture of where you need to go at any given time.

[b]〰️ OPEN WORLD CHESTS.[/b] Feel like an afterthought, and often feel like a thematic break in the mid-to-late game.

[b]〰️ BOUNTY HUNTERS.[/b] An interesting—but half-delivered—concept. I don’t mind that they’re in the game, but wish they had a more relevant (and less random) purpose other than breaking your flow through the world.

[hr][/hr][h1]💢 THE NOT-SO-GREAT[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]➖ The ease of falling outside the world.[/b] For as much as the game encourages the exploration of every nook and cranny, the world isn’t quite as seamless as you’d expect. It’s easy to fall outside the bounds of the world or get stuck in an inescapable nook, forcing a reload to your last checkpoint.

[b]➖ FORCE POWERS.[/b] The implementation of Force powers feels exceptionally limiting and incredibly frustrating. Whether you’re accidentally using Force-attacks or regenerating it at a snail’s pace, it’s a huge hindrance to the flow of your combat.

[b]➖ BUG: Enemy aggro can break collectible/achievement/crate interactions.[/b] An annoying bug that comes up often, enemies can prevent you from seeing or interacting with resources and collectibles throughout the world, leading to post-game scavenger hunts that can add frustrating hours to your play time.

[hr][/hr][h1]✨ THE FINAL WORD…[/h1][hr][/hr]
[i]Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order[/i] is a phenomenal game and one of the strongest Star Wars games available if you’re looking for a great story, a deep dive into the history and lore of the universe, and characters who are well-deserving of a [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1774580/]sequel[/url] to continue their journey.

It’s not the longest game you’ll play, but it also doesn’t overstay its welcome if you’re looking for a quick adventure through an awesome story. Highly recommended!

First thing I'll say is there is an awesome amount of different enemy types from imperial troops, to wild creatures, a different array of robots, lightsaber users, magic using savages, bounty hunters, and even taking on an AT-ST a few times! So no shortage of different enemy types that you will need to learn to fight and use different abilities against. Having said that, the abilities with which you get to use as you progress through the game feel a bit weak at times. Very rarely do they give you a decent advantage in combat to make them worth their use consistently. For example if you use force slow, the moment you hit your opponent they're right back on the offensive. There was no reason to ever use the upgraded version that slows for longer because of this. And the combat itself whilst for the most part is very fun doesn't make you feel like a Jedi. You can slice a robot in half with a finishing move that looks cool, but anyone attacking you with a melee weapon will just block attack after attack from your lightsaber until you've beaten down their defence meter which is infuriating. Just feels like you're robbed of feeling like an awesome Jedi in the way that past Star Wars games have.  

My main other gripe is the level design and map. The worlds you visit are pretty fun to explore but are an absolute nightmare to navigate. especially when coming back for collectables. The levels are too big for starters; they really could have cut them in half and made them separate levels. But because there are several different ways of navigating between different levels on a certain planet (elevators, zip lines that only go one way until upgrading, air vents, slippery slopes etc) it is really confusing trying to work your way around. In trying to make the game like uncharted/tomb raider they've made navigation a mess so you'll find yourself zooming in and out and rotating the map every way imaginable trying to figure out where the heck you are and how to get to where you want to go.

Anyway, super fun game. Just gotta be patient navigating the levels, and look at your enemies moves carefully for openings so you don't get stuck hitting their guard all the time. 8.5/10 for me.",1695783592,1695783592,True,1,0,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,False

Platforming is just tedious and it's hard to tell if you're being an idiot or need an ability. Sometimes you get to a hidden spot by clipping through some decorations mid-maneuver and can't even tell if that was the intended path or a glitch. Traversal abilities are kinda basic, but also infuriating in how artificially locked down they are. Can't dive two meters to get a chest? Wait until you get a breathing thingie. Not sure if you can solve a puzzle? You just need to go through 2/3 of the game for the character to literally remember he can also double-jump.

Combat is a bit rubbish. It tries to be some sort of precision dodge/parry, but the timings and animations just never seem to be consistent. I completed the game on Hard (no achievement, so thanks for wasting my time), but still can't tell if I'm just failing to see it. Half the time I fail to parry, the other half a parry works when timing was way off. But you can more or less just cheese your way through the toughest encounters with some force slow-mo.

Exploring and finding hidden stuff is just hugely disappointing. It's all useless cosmetic crap. Because you need 16 ponchos.

You also get some shoddy EA launcher that wants you to set up an account and runs on startup by default. The game takes five minutes to launch, and you never know if it's going to or got stuck. But if you press launch again, you risk the game auto-reopening after you're done and shut it down. 10/10 great feature.

80% of the game just makes you want for it to end sooner. Not sure where there other 20% are. It takes you 15 seconds to travel between planets, but three times as long to ride a shortcut elevator.

Negatives;
It's annoyingly buggy and it's not a super interesting story to make up for the bugs. 
The combat in this game is pretty bad. I've had tons of attacks not registering.
It feels recycled; It's a very average RPG game. 
Reminds me of a 2000s typical adventure game; Tomb Raider + lightsabers

Positives; 
The story is good at times, but I think this game could have been better if it was mission based and not ""open-world"".
Really cool world design on most of the planets, some better than others.
It's pretty cool being a Jedi in a game, but I still favour ""The Force Unleashed"".
Fun to play in the earlier stages of the game, a lot to learn and master.

I can't really give other nameworthy positives, it just feels like a chore to even finish the game at this point.
It feels incomplete, lacking in detail (tons of small, and some bigger ones).

But there is one overwhelming flaw with this game that takes it from being a good game and just makes it a frustration fest. That is the combat mechanics. You see in order to heal yourself, you have to stand still, wait for your druid to pop up a healing canister, and all the while be in a position to take no damage. The problem with that is, you are in a position to take lots of damage and can't sit still. There are many, many times that I have died in this game because of this. There are many instances of being surrounded by multiple enemies. Each time that an enemy hits you, you are staggered, which can basically get you stun locked and the enemies can literally juggle your health down to nothing because of one simple mistake. If you do get your self into one of these positions, because of the heal mechanic requiring you to stand still, you must then dodge roll yourself away, while these multiple enemies are chasing you, and with different timings coming at you with unblock-able attacks that must be dodged, and you can see where I am going with this. There are so many situations where you are just constantly dodging, needing to heal, and not being able to. The stagger juggling is a frustrating mechanic. That combined with the need to stand still and be completely defenseless in order to heal is what makes this game a bad game that I can't recommend.  Respawn Entertainment. The game certainly lives up to the name. The only way to get through some of these combat encounters is to constantly respawn, and just spam dodge and hope that you can get a few lucky breaks.

1172380,146602973,76561198114639980,0,15,1005,0,1005,1695077437,"This game really grabbed my attention in the beginning; I loved the intro. I was expecting a Star Wars adventure, not a bunch of 'parkour.' There's so walking and platforming and the combat isn't good enough to tie it all together. The sections between the beginning and the end of the game were quite boring. The whole middle part of the game felt lacking, with some poor dialogue and delivery. I didn't become interested again until I returned to Dathomir after Kashyyyk.

This game looks and sounds amazing. The planets, the distant views, animations (when they don't occasionally bug out), and the cutscenes—all the environments looked fantastic. The level of detail in them was astounding. I think there were only a few minor issues with Cal.

The characters in this game seem all over the place. The main crew seems great; the dialogue was fine, the animations were fantastic, and the story moments were well placed. The only time it felt off was when Cal learns about the Second Sister and returns to the ship. It seemed like there was missing dialogue. There are also moments when Cal looks really strange, like he's staring blankly or has an uncanny valley effect going on. This doesn't align well with his dialogue, which is either really good or really bad. The Second Sister was not well-executed until the end of the game. She was laughably nonthreatening until later in the game, feeling more like a generic villain saying, ""I'm evil, I'm going to do bad things, fear me!!!"" This issue got even worse with the Ninth Sister. They turned a character that could have been a teen drama joke into a villain, and it was terrible. Nothing about this character felt villainous or relatable, and they weren't even so evil that you'd love to hate them. Clearly a throwaway character, and I was glad they got thrown away so I didn't have to interact with them anymore. The story's conclusion was quite good in my opinion and the clear highlight of the game.

Aside from the story, which carried the game, there's the combat. It was serviceable at best. It just felt strange to be wielding a lightsaber and having it function like a baseball bat. Sometimes it cuts through limbs, but most of the time it might as well be smacking people over the head with it. The number of things that could seemingly block a lightsaber was confusing as well. I'm not entirely sure where the lore stands on what they can and can't cut through, but seeing them cut holes in doors but be blocked by batons was weird. I guess the in-game reasoning for this is either the Nightsister magic maces or the clone trooper energized baton. But since everything seems to block you, the game pushed me to parry everything, just waiting around to parry something if my Force meter was empty. It reminded me of some of the newer 2D Metroid games, where you parry everything, except there's no poise meter, so your parries don't guarantee a successful attack afterward. You usually have to wait around for two parries. It was satisfying to fight so many enemies at the end of the game and unleash everything you've built up, but building those skills throughout the game was not fun, and there weren't enough moments that truly embellished combat.

If you're not parrying stormtroopers, it's some random selection of animals. I love being a Jedi, traveling from beautiful planet to planet, just to fight a variety of rats. So many rats and rat-like creatures on every planet. The enemy variety in this game was abysmal. There's a clear pattern of a big creature that every planet has, along with a bunch of smaller creatures. I understand there have to be gameplay mechanics, but I do not find it fun or immersive to be fighting a goat. You're a space samurai with a laser sword, and you're fighting a goat. The clone troopers were easier to fight than said goat.

The game ran mostly fine for me; there were some loading stutters, but that may be because I didn't have it installed on an SSD. Otherwise, it was running at around 70fps to 90fps at 4K on a RTX 4070 Ti. It did utilize a lot of CPU; I am using a 2600X at 4.2GHz, which is getting a bit old but managed.",1695146485,1695146485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has a story it wants to tell, it’s going to help you get through it. If you truly want a tougher experience, with enemies that will punish you for screwing up the timing of your parries, there are multiple difficulty settings for just that – same as there is a setting for people who just want to play a fun game.

I am making it further than before, but I really feel the game play is flawed in some important ways. First: if the game design wants me to beat my head against a hard section or boss by dying over and over again, OK. I personally dislike this design choice when it's combined with tedious platforming in order for me to get back to the area I'm stuck on. I get wanting me to succeed at a section of the game, but the save points are often located in obnoxious places. Second, I really feel that they dye, dye again style is at odds with the lore of the game. There is no in-game reason for me to be dying and resurrecting constantly, so designing the game in a way where I have to expect 10-20 deaths per boss really takes me out of the immersion. It's not a good jedi power fantasy to die repeatedly to a big bat in a cave somewhere. I'm not saying the game should be made easier per se, just that the lack of a lore-based explanation for constantly dying coupled with the obvious game decision to design the game around dying really feels off to me. 

The controls really feel sluggish. I've died multiple times where I felt I detected the incoming attack and responded, but it just didn't work. 

I also find it frustrating that there's not a great way to regain resources in combat. I really like the push forward design of games like Doom. I find in Jedi Fallen Order that the inability to recover health at all in combat means that taking damage early in a hard boss fight leads to me just giving up and dying so I can re-attempt the boss with a clean start. Simply put, for me, it's more fun if after I mess up and take a bunch of damage there's a way for me to recover that doesn't entail repeating the same stupid platforming section I've just done 8 times. 

Overall, this game is incredibly frustrating. Dying over and over and over, then doing sluggish clunky platforming to get back to the spot where I can finally try again is really annoying.

Also, whoever came up with hiding boxes all over the universe and sticking skins in them as a reward for exploration really dropped the ball. They apply to 3 things and thats it..... and yeah, i found running past them  was very effective, after all, i gotta get to the next cut scene.

Jumps and platofrming is wonky, a hit or miss. I tried to do a jump 6 or 7 times, but it is so poorly made, I kept missing, and there are SO many like that. Powers work sometimes, other times, they don't. 

Fighting again, is really good, but lacks precision, so to speak. Like you could hit, and it wouldn't connect, just because. It's all over the place. Even though you dodged, you don't get i-frames. I parried, it didn't connect. Enemies are annoying and their hits connect to you VERY weirdly, even if I dodged! And I am only playing on Hard.

For starters I spent several days playing 5D chess against steam and EA app just to get this game up and running.
(To be honest it was just the EA app, nothing else, but off to a good start anyway).
For what it is worth the visuals are pretty neat, no stuttering, tearing or floating main character for me. If I should use one word to describe graphics i'd use sterile (or clinical?).
I've yet to discover more about the story itself, but thus far it seems about as imaginative as recent d+ Star wars series were(Book of Boba Fett, Kenobi et al) and that is not a praise. Storywise there is nothing that makes me want to play to reveal more of it.
Gameplay itself, ugh.  A mixed action based platformer where the ""soulslike"" tag comes from controls that are fumbly at best.
I mean that combat system is gawky, there seems to be next to none info of why something (mostly taking damage) occurred.
You should be fighting against the empire and monsters, not controls. Most likely this is due to lack of effort made in porting the game (always a good sign when a pc game recommends using a controller). I have to admit though that the guys behind original keybindings must be true sith (especially the dodge button). 
Where the game lacks in combat it completely losts in platforming. I've played my share of crappy platformers but holy cow! And i thought combat was iffy!
And also the all time classics: invisible walls. When a place (wall/ curtain etc) seems perfectly climbable/runnable but Kal just jumps up'n down or falls righ off it is frustrating af. And when you finally ragequit you'll have to go through areas you've already played 'cause only savepoints, no free save. Also who was the smart ass that thought that enemy respawning after resting is a good idea?
Maybe i'm just old but Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy were way better, can't just fathom the praise this game got.",1694539426,1694539426,False,1,0,0.503311276435852051,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is addictive, challenging at times brutal and makes you feel like you're a real Jedi. You'll need to concentrate on each enemy choosing your attacks carefully. The level design is fantastic and stunning at times. Offering lots of exploration and rewards. The puzzles aren't too challenging and the platforming sections can be both irritating and satisfying.

How do I even begin to explain this game? Well, I'll start by saying that I recommend it, but with several caveats. The only redeeming qualities are the stunning scenery, engaging characters, a few amusing lines from Stormtroopers, and the undeniable Star Wars charm.

But let's get to the heart of the matter. Jedi: Fallen Order is 94% platformer, 4% agonizingly tedious boss fights, and a measly 2% actual fun. Get ready for a relentless cycle of backtracking due to horrendous checkpoint timing and locations. The platforming, in my opinion, is poorly executed, monotonous, infuriating, and downright tedious. The boss fights consist of constant evasion and blocking, but you'll still meet your demise because the tracking is off and the animations throw the timing out of whack.

The fleeting moments of enjoyment stem solely from the fact that it's set in the Star Wars universe, and a handful of humorous lines in cutscenes. As I played this game, I clung to it because it was Star Wars, yet I despised every minute, longing to uninstall it with each passing second. It's as if they attempted to mimic elements from Dark Souls/Sekiro and Tomb Raider but managed to get both wrong.

The only time I was genuinely elated during my playthrough was when the game informed me that I was nearing its conclusion. It signaled an end to my torment. This isn't an action game; it's primarily a platformer with Star Wars slapped onto it as a backup name. Respawn should have stuck to their other titles, like Titanfall and Apex Legends.

I'm thankful that I acquired this during a sale, but I'm also disheartened that I own the game and that I've learned its true nature. The ending only compounds the disappointment, providing no reason to revisit the game.

On my rating scale, Jedi: Fallen Order earns a paltry 2/10. At this point, I'm not sure what else to do but uninstall it and find something more enjoyable. May the Force be with you, even if it wasn't with this game. I'm going to go cry.",1640672723,1694360704,True,4,0,0.544249951839447021,0,True,False,False

I started with high hopes, since I've heard great things about the story line and characters. So far though, it's been more of a combination of Temple Run and Tomb Raider; which, while not bad, is not exactly what I was expecting. I've had experience with Star Wars games across a variety of platforms, so I was expecting a similar balance of combat play style and story, Regrettably, I've died more times speeding down an ice tunnel and missing the rope to cross than I have at the hands of an Imperial enemy. 

Maybe it's because I'm not far enough into the game, but at this point, it feels like most of my time in-game is spent parkouring my way across the planet and little time spent furthering the storyline or gaining a greater grasp of the characters. I still plan on finishing this game at some point, but rather than it being an enjoyable sojourn to one of my favorite nostalgic universes, it's feeling more like a grind and when I have more compelling games in my Steam library, it's been knocked down the list of top games.",1694324502,1694324502,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The missions are an absolute chore to progress as well because they're incredibly linear and do not reward free-thinking at all.

No teleporting around the map/game like you do in Dark Souls with the bonfires so you're forced to run everywhere, (imagine having to run through blight town constantly to get from A to B, yea it's stupid and annoying af)
You can only do 3 normal attacks in a row before there's some stupid cooldown on it
The normal attack pattern can actually make you miss the enemy you're trying to hit
Enemies can hit you even if you dodge their attacks
Deflecting enemy blaster shots doesn't always work 
Dodging and then attacking sometimes has a delay on it
Attacking after dodging sometimes has a delay on it
Too many assassins creed like obstacles to jump on, through, slide down, walls to smash, jump off etc
You're forced too walk around on the mantis instead of being able to run around
Dying to the environment makes you lose health when you respawn
Mobs hitting you through walls
After using the lightsaber editior thingy Cal likes to stare at it for a few seconds making you not want to use the editor as you'll get time wasted because of an animation 
Resting at a meditation circle makes it your next spawn point when you die so if you rest at a meditation circle on one side of the map and die on the other you'll have to run, kill, obstacle course, get lost, use a trash map your way through the entire map to get your exp back
When hitting an enemy which killed you to get your experience back it'll turn the entire game into slow motion for a few seconds giving an advantage to the enemy
Dodging is completely useless as you only dodge about 30cm
Enemies have super long range attacks
Some enemies have attacks you can't dodge
Numerous bugs making you restart your game
Jumping in combat is super buggy
Delay on attacking
Delay on dodging
Delay on healing
Delay on everything
Enemies hit boxes are too small
Your hit box is too big
Enemies attack faster than you
You attack too slow
Double edged lightsaber does less damage???
Fuck Dathomir
Fuck the nightsisters
Fuck the nightbrothers
Fuck that zone
All the bosses in this game aren't fun to fight
You can't open your mini map up when underwater
You can't open your mini map up when climbing
Achievements are bugged

The main weapon of the game being Jaro Topal's broken lightsaber wielded by the main character Kal Kestis (Jaro Topal's apprentice). The biggest flaw most people have with this game is that people feel that the campaign is too short which I can definitely agree with, other than that the story is very well thought out and it helps solidify the point of the game.

My biggest problem with the game is the amount of backtracking you have to go through in each stage, its boring, im sick of climbing and making my way through the same area I've already been through 3 times before. Otherwise the game goes from good to great in any other area.

The positive: the game itself:
- Challenging fights against a variety of enemies and enemy constellations that all have their unique combat mechanic details. Lightsaber combat right from the start! <3
- A (re)spawn system that makes you think before you headlessly jump into any fight.
- Well-designed worlds: a handful planets, visually appealing, worth exploring (lots of small stuff to find), with clever platforming progression mechanics (paths and shortcuts that unlock with skills throughout the game).
- A (simple) skill system worth investing point into.
- A simple but good story.

- Requires accepting the separate EA privacy policy.
- Requires the EA software to run while you game, which requires an internet connection.
- It's impossible to skip the game intro screens, which take unnecessarily long.

From the very outset, you are thrust into a meticulously crafted and immersive scenario that sets the stage for a unique gaming experience. However, rather than plunging directly into traditional tasks, the game gently eases you into its world, providing an opportunity to become familiar with its intricate keyboard controls. It's an engaging journey, though I couldn't help but repeatedly murmur, ""Oh, this isn't a walk in the park."" Some missions present intricate mechanics that may initially feel daunting, yet they possess an underlying logic that allows players to discern their path.

**Key Points:**

**1. Varied Challenge Levels:** Throughout the game, you'll encounter missions of varying difficulty levels. Some may leave you momentarily feeling trapped in a loop, but these instances are transient. With persistence, gradual discovery, and acclimation to the game's mechanics, you'll find your way and adapt to its unique playstyle.

**2. A Game of Consistency:** Consistency in key commands is paramount, and taking breaks can lead to moments of forgetting which keys to press when you return. To avoid this, I'd recommend playing this game in a single, uninterrupted session to maintain your command over the controls and avoid unnecessary frustration.

**3. Puzzle-Driven Gameplay:** Brace yourself for a gaming experience laden with puzzles that challenge your problem-solving skills. The game often requires nimble navigation akin to that of a ninja traversing hoops. While there are moments of inconsistent difficulty, they remain within the realm of conquerability.

**4. A Stellar Star Wars Experience:** This title ranks among the finest Star Wars games I've had the pleasure of playing, delivering a captivating narrative that unfolds within the framework of constantly bustling missions.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this game presents a multifaceted and occasionally challenging journey that rewards players with an intricate storyline and a unique gaming experience. While certain missions may initially seem like puzzling enigmas, they gradually unveil their inner workings.

Even random jungle slugs and spiders will tank 5 to 7 direct hits before dying in normal difficulty. It's underwhelming. Don't give me a lightsaber early if you don't want me to slice through things and I'm getting wrecked by literal prairie worms.

By the way, we're nonstop slaughtering wildlife, but sure, we have a sPiRiTuaL cOnNecTioN WiTh nAtuRe (not joking, the phrase appears in-game as such). I guess Cal's master never taught him to use the Force to appease and calm simpler lifeforms (manipulating them seems better than mutilating them). There's no sense of justice when killing a simple beast. Give me space fascists with actual moral responsibilities, and let me try to win them back to the light at least once.

Combat is like a regular action-adventure game, with limited moves, timed actions and annoying enemy unblockable attacks that makes them glow red. Nowhere near as fun, creative or complex as the old Jedi Knight and Jedi Academy games, which had localized dismemberment, combinations, and ""anything touching the sword takes damage"" design, not ""1 attack, 1 reaction"". You are regualrly staggered by several enemies without meaningful chance to take command. It's just bad gameplay. Wait for the zombie scene where they deprive you of your weapon and you can't use the Force powers because you are constantly staggered by a swarm of green-eyed corpses.

Puzzles are fine, and dungeons / tombs are kinda cool, but not necessarily the most fun to play (for instance, it's hard to know where you aim with Force push / pull, when these are essential to solving the puzzle). Minimap is great flavor, but aweful design, switching levels randomly, and you have to retrace every level several times without any indicator, so you can't escape it. The rewards you find for exploring are snippets of Star Wars lore, and colors / skins (no exaggeration): color for the lightsaber handle, color for the ship, color for the droid, color for your... poncho. It's absurd.

Regarding progression, some parts were good, but mostly it was frustrating. Good things include killing groups of stormtroopers in villages, and some action sequences (sliding). On the bad side, a couple of times the game is taking your agency with a cutscene at the coolest moment. Why are they still doing this? Let me kill or release the boss that I just defeated in combat, or let me try to escape the laser beams of the ship that's chasing me. Very linear. Illusion of choosing which mission you do first, but no bearing on the story or equipment in the end. Soon the game doesn't even bother to make you choose destinations any more. Really makes you want to play some goofy but responsive first-person action RPG with lots of freedom.

Regarding the universe, the planets are iconic and varied, the atmosphere is one of the stronger aspect imo. A little bit bland characters, not terrible, but zero complexity or moral choice, and forget about being tempted or choosing the dark side, or grey Jedi path or anything. They talk about it but it's shallow (""Oh no, you lied to me about your padawan! Now I've got trust issues, but I'm also an orphan"", ""I could have saved him! If only I was better...

Although this game crashed so often that I almost rage quit. I rarely play modern AAA games and this is a reminder why.

Its clear that this is a big budget game, with lots of polish everywhere. The graphics are great and capture the grand scale of those Star Wars movies. The sound and music was good although I missed that classic Star Wars theme! The voice acting was generally excellent with one exception you encounter late in the game.

The game was fairly well placed with good progression of skills. One negative is that it requires backtracking to complete the game as your new skills allow access to new areas, so it can get a bit tedious.

I played it on the second hardest difficulty and didn't have too many problems, although it felt that some of the enemies had unfair move sets where they could chain stun you. I get that it is trying to be Star Wars Dark Souls but the enemy design is not on the same level.

I would recommend this as long as it is stable enough for you to play. Apart from a few random crashes I had one spot where the came would reliably crash if I moved to a certain spot on the ship. Luckily I was able to continue the game and it resolved itself, but a game should not be released in this state.

Cal Kestis is a great edition to the lore as are the various characters you meet along the way.

Some of the locations are fantastic and quite varied in design.
A fantastic soundtrack with alot of familer Star Wars strings and melodies.

Also worth noting this game has one of the best cameos in video game history, try not too let anyone spoil it for you.

Whilst not quite as good as the Jedi Outcast or Knights of the old Republic games i believe its in the top 5 best Star Wars games ever released.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a tour de force that beautifully fuses captivating storytelling, intricate gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals to create an epic adventure that will resonate with fans of both the Star Wars universe and action-adventure gaming alike.

Set in the aftermath of Order 66, Jedi: Fallen Order follows Cal Kestis as he embarks on a quest to restore the Jedi Order while evading the clutches of the Galactic Empire. The narrative is rich, emotionally charged, and brimming with Star Wars lore. The characters are multifaceted, each with their own motivations and complexities. The plot twists and turns like a hyperspace jump, keeping players engaged from start to finish.
 
Jedi: Fallen Order delivers a visual spectacle that feels straight out of the cinematic Star Wars universe. The meticulously crafted environments, from the bustling streets of Nar Shaddaa to the ancient tombs of Zeffo, are a testament to the developers' attention to detail. Crisp textures, dynamic lighting, and realistic character models immerse players in a galaxy that's as captivating as it is authentic.

The heart of Jedi: Fallen Order lies in its exhilarating gameplay mechanics. The lightsaber combat is a true standout, seamlessly blending a mix of fluid strikes, parries, and force powers. The combat system strikes a balance between accessibility and depth, offering both novices and seasoned gamers a satisfying challenge. Each encounter feels like a choreographed dance, where mastering your abilities is key to overcoming even the most formidable foes.

One of the game's standout features is its meticulously designed levels that encourage exploration and reward curiosity. Each planet feels distinct, offering a range of environmental puzzles, secret passages, and hidden collectibles. Navigating these intricate landscapes is a joy, and the Metroidvania-style progression ensures a sense of accomplishment as new abilities unlock previously inaccessible areas.

Jedi: Fallen Order showcases decent optimization. With a variety of graphical settings, players can tailor the experience to their hardware capabilities. During gameplay, the game maintained a steady frame rate, and load times were impressively short, ensuring minimal interruptions to the immersive gameplay. The only real downside that I could find to playing this on PC was having to use the EA launcher and anyone who has used the EA launcher knows how bad it is. 

Jedi: Fallen Order seamlessly blends a compelling story with captivating gameplay mechanics. Its stunning visuals, exhilarating combat, and intricate level design set a new standard for Star Wars games. Whether you're a die-hard Star Wars fan or a gamer seeking an unforgettable adventure, this title is a must-play.

I'm not very hopeful when it comes to Star Wars, whether it be TV, movies, or video games.  However, This is the kind of game I think of after Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.  Two games that were ahead of their time in my personal opinion.

I've played X-Wing, TIE Fighter, and X-Wing Vs. TIE Fighter games in the 90's along with the Dark Forces games.  Still have X-Wing Alliance in my Steam library.  I've played the original NES Star Wars games, the SNES games, Rogue Squadron on the N64, Rebel Assault and it's sequel....  Knights of the Old Republic and it's sequel as well which were absolutely amazing games that deserve remasters....

GET THIS GAME if you like the Jedi aspect.

In my opinion this feeling of absence is also egged on by some aspects of the gameplay. I personally disagree with the choice to attach a lot of ""soulslike"" gameplay aspects to a Star Wars game. Things like respawning enemies, health potions, emphasis on blocking and dodging... they all take away from the environment and make finally beating a super hard enemy feel like a chore rather than an accomplishment.

I grew up with Star Wars games and loved the Kotor and Jedi Knight series the most. This game takes elements from those games and combines the best of them. The Kotor and Jedi Knight series left a void when I finished them and this game briefly filled it. I would give it a 9.5/10. My main problem is that it feels too short.

The world design is wonderful and each location is beautifully crafted - and since I'm on the subject I may as well mention that as far as graphics and performance go, there's nothing to complain about here either. However, for all of these good points, the game has a few large and frustrating drawbacks.

What brings the game down for me is the gameplay loop and combat. I can appreciate the soulslike aspects of the game - long, winding levels with multiple checkpoints and shortcuts should have been a good thing; as a big fan of Dark Souls and other games in the genre,  learning enemy attack patterns, exploring sprawling levels and finding shortcuts should have been a fun time. However, the combat makes backtracking through each world a chore, which is only made worse by the absence of any kind of fast travel between meditation points. On paper the combat seems like something one could look forward to, but that's unfortunately not the case - attacks often seem ineffective which, considering Cal uses a lightsaber, makes little sense when you're fighting cannon fodder like stormtroopers. Dodges, blocks and parries are inconsistent, and while some enemies do require multiple parries to stagger, the fact that they can simply continue their attack chains despite being parried essentially makes the action feel useless. As for dodges and blocks, there are many cases where it doesn't seem to matter how good your timing is, you're going to get smacked around like a toy anyway, which becomes incredibly frustrating when you're up against multiple enemies that aren't immediately staggered by parries, can easily break through your blocks, or are resistant/able to counter your Force abilities.
While the combat makes backtracking incredibly frustrating, it also just doesn't feel like its worth the trouble a lot of the time. Fallen Order has a lot of sprawling maps with treasure hidden in hard to reach corners and such, however the effort needed to reach these treasures often feels unrewarding as 90% of these chests and hidden force echoes only unlock mediocre cosmetics

Overall I'd give the game a 6/10, with the positives largely resting on the story, characters and art direction. The combat's glaring inconsistencies, in addition to making the game generally frustrating to play, make backtracking and exploring a slog, and the lack of rewards for even bothering to explore the levels often makes you feel like you're wasting your time. I can only really recommend the game if you're already heavily invested in the Star Wars universe or have played Jedi Survivor ahead of this one",1692651049,1692651049,False,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

Then you do it again and again until you get bored.

 the awful combat system bothered me the whole game, i mean a game that took a lot of inspiration from Souls's games you would think it will have combat system similar to Skeiro but instead you get some poor arcade fighting movements and terrible parry mechanic not to mention some skills were useless and you barely use them if ever the entire game.
A nother thing to mention is the exploration in the game is not the best you can tell they tried to be like Uncharted or Tomb Rider but they weren't very successful at it, the map design was terrible and the tedious backtracking was a pain in the ass.
The story was Okey not very impressive though they can make it more entertaining its Star Wars after all so they could add a lot more to the story.

i do like to say the game has beautiful graphics and character design and acting (both physically and vocally) and you will get some kind of fun playing it particularly at the begging you will be interested but slowly start to wear you off with the bad combat and map designs. 

if this game will turn into a series then they better improve the combat a lot and a better map design, and maybe add lore from the Star Wars Saga to give the story more depth.

in conclusion, if you are a Star Wars fan then you probably will enjoy the game, and if you are not then maybe not too much because despite what others say you actually do need to watch the movies to have a better understanding of whats happening in the game.

overall i will give it 4/10",1692602482,1692603403,False,5,0,0.534898817539215088,0,True,False,False

[h1]Combat[/h1]
It's generally okay, has some steep learning curve but once I got the hang of it I raised the difficulty to the highest and played through most of the game with relative ease, with some exceptions along the way. However, I have many issues with the combat.
[list]
[*]It feels really [b]clunky[/b] and [b]unresponsive[/b], resulting in a lot of frustrating moments which could be avoided if only Cal responded to the commands I was giving him. [b]Stable framerate[/b] is a must. 
[*][b]Unblockable attacks[/b] are too [b]inconsistent[/b]. Even if you react in time, there is no guarantee that you won't get hit. It's not a timing issue, because there were several times I perfectly dodged an unblockable (I know it's perfect because of the slow-motion effect from a late-game ability) just to get hit by the very same attack anyway. What's more, the unblockables are [i]tracking[/i] the player, presumably to punish you for dodging too early, but the tracking angle in some cases is insane. Finally, some of the unblockables have [i]very short wind up time[/i] combined with [i]huge damage[/i]. Overall, the concept of unblockable attacks is fine, but the implementation is bad in many cases.
[*]The combat system and most enemies were clearly designed for 1v1. [b]Fighting crowds is terrible.[/b] This is a problem especially in the beginning before you get the double-saber, but it gets worse again late-game when the game decides to throw at you entire armies of annoying weak enemies. It's not fun getting hit by a blaster outside your field of vision while you're trying to hit a closer enemy, it's not fun parrying/dodging already hard attacks just to not have an opportunity to counter attack after because there is already a queue of enemies waiting to hit you during your animation. It's simply [b]not fun to fight crowds[/b] in this game. Even when I win without a scratch, it feels like I cheesed the fight and/or got lucky, not satisfying at all.
[/list]
The hardest content in this game amplifies all the combat issues. The last boss is a big jump of difficulty, but for all the wrong reasons mentioned above. An unblockable which has a very short wind up time, is very inconsistent to dodge, and which one shots you when you have anything less than about 90% of health. Two times during the encounter, the boss spawns a flying droid and spams unblockables on the other side of the map. Depending on the timing of the unblockable and the droid shooting, which mostly depends on luck, it is literally impossible to not get hit. The last boss overall is one of the worst bosses I've ever seen in a video game. Not the hardest, not at all, it's just badly designed. The devs apparently wanted to lock you out of the ending to feel you ""earned it"". I think most people are just going to ditch the game out of frustration or lower the difficulty, but maybe I'm wrong.

Post-game optional arenas are terrible because they mix together a lot of seemingly random enemies which should never be combined together. Especially when you put together the ones designed for 1v1 with the crowds. The arenas show all the issues with fighting crowds in this game. You have barely any way to deal with multiple enemies other than running, dodging, and getting a single hit here and there, on repeat, which makes for a very boring and long fight. Big crowds of random enemies kill all the fun and creativity of the combat system.

[h1]Exploration[/h1]
Outside of combat, it turns out [b]most of the game time you will spend on mediocre platforming[/b] and searching for collectibles in ugly, confusing, and illogical environments. As a reward, you'll usually get some obscure Star Wars lore, which I bet most people don't care about much, a lightsaber part which you barely notice while playing, or another god damn poncho. The main reward for me was actually the experience points, and the fact I feel the urge to 100% games for some reason. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

The game is not particularly pretty either, the environments are [b]dull[/b]. It's not that the graphics is bad, there is a lot of detail, but the art style... is not pretty. What's more, the [b]levels feel empty and artificial[/b]. 
There's not a lot of friendly/neutral NPCs, and when there are, they are just standing there. It feels like there is almost nothing but enemies and the MC in the whole galaxy. Maps don't feel like they could be real places in SW universe, they are weird and gamey. Seriously, how are imperial soldiers and other normal people traversing through the maps, if I need to use the Force, special equipment, and a lot of acrobatics just to get from one room to the next?! And they are somehow already there on the barely accessible and very dangerous platform without railings I just spent half an hour climbing up to? Even for Star Wars standards, the levels barely make any sense, killing my suspension of disbelief. The only [b]good[/b] thing I can say about exploration is the [b]puzzles[/b], they felt like how the tombs in new Tomb Raiders should've been done. Unfortunately, there is only a couple of them.

The [b]plot is not particularly interesting[/b] either. It's fine, and gets better with time, but I didn't really care. I didn't get attached to any of the characters, except the droid perhaps. The most interesting were from Dathomir, but they were not given enough screen time. It also bothers me a little how many Jedi turn out to be alive after Order 66, but I guess it's a vast galaxy after all, so it's not that impossible.

[h1]Summing up[/h1]
I can't bring myself to recommend this game. I felt like I had to force myself to play it when I started, and even after I got hooked, most of the game annoyed me. What pushed me forward was mainly the desire to ""git gud"" and the fact it's Star Wars. [b]Remove the Star Wars part, and you get a very mediocre Tomb Raider with souls-like combat, at best.[/b] Playable? Yes. Enjoyable even? I guess. If you have to play it, I can only recommend playing on lower difficulty to avoid at least the combat frustrations, even though I consider combat to be the best part. I must say, I am glad it's over, and I probably won't touch the sequel for a while as it's probably just more of the same.",1692107109,1692536137,False,4,0,0.545973122119903564,0,True,False,False

another minor annoyance because of how the game is designed; some of the cinematic camera movements are more of a hindrance than anything.

Fire your level designers and half your team or whoever is making their decisions. 

Each area/map/planet is nothing but an obstacle course of platforms. Every time you hit a save point it respawns all the enemies on the entire map. To get back to your ship you must track backwards through that same repetitive respawning mess of bad level design. If this game wasn't setup to be an annoying grind through horribly designed levels repeating the same actions and enemies a thousand times it would be over in 2 hours. 

Finding your way through and asininely BACK OUT AGAIN to your ship is like trying to solve the fucking Labyrinth except at this point I really don't give a damn if the Empire wins if this is what it takes to revive the Jedi Order. In fact if I had to do this to save my baby brother, sorry bro, you're a goblin now. In fact, dunk me head first into the Bog of Eternal Stench. I would rather stink forever than try to solve these absurd level designs.

I think I must have not done my usual research before buying this game, because if I had I don't think I would have bought it. The combat is Sekiro, the save mechanics are Dark Souls, and the level system is Metroidvania. So, you have very tricky combat with a high level of difficulty which practically requires you fight the same foe over and over again until you memorize their attack routines, a save system that doesn't let you save when you want but rather when you encounter one of the few-and-far-between save points and punishes you when you die by sending you back to the last save point, respawning all the monsters you just killed *and* taking away all the experience you just earned; and to top it off you have impenetrably maze-like levels with less-than-helpful maps. A triumvirate of rage-inducement, all with a coat of Star Wars paint.

So, why not just give this a thumbs-down? Well, two things. Other than what I just mentioned, the game was quite enjoyable. It's nice to look at (hardly cutting-edge graphically but some good character and level design), and the story and writing is pretty good. I especially appreciated that it was a Star Wars story that mostly stood on its own without being encumbered by fan service and 'memberberries (at least until the very end when [spoiler] the writers felt the need for the eye-rolling inclusion of Darth Vader - [i]so[/i] disappointing[/spoiler]).

And the other thing? Easy Mode Exists. After the 6th or so go-round with the first boss battle without getting anywhere close to finishing it (not realizing at the time that I actually was close because I only needed to get them to half-health, oh well) I swallowed my pride, switched the game to Story Mode, and got right through the battle with zero irritation. And that became my standard MO: progress through the game on Normal mode, enduring my fair share of rage at the game's various ""features"", bump the difficulty down to Easy for the boss fights to spare my poor controller from getting hurled against the wall, bump back up, carry on. Hardly an innovative approach, but regardless it worked.

So if you're looking for a single-player Star Wars game, you could do worse than this. But caveat emptor, my friend. Caveat emptor. Rage awaits.",1691874633,1691876880,True,6,0,0.61538463830947876,0,True,False,False

While the story is not terrible, it isn't the best either. In certain areas, it appears forced, with little to no character development. Don't misunderstand me, the protagonist's voice is incredibly annoying, but that can be rectified with a few modifications.

What renders the game nearly unplayable, however, are the control issues. The controls frequently fail to respond when activated. You might press keys and experience either no response or significant delay before an action is carried out. Consequently, in a game reliant on timing and skillful control use, it becomes almost impossible to evade attacks or block them. You might attempt to block, but nothing happens until after your enemy's attack connects, and then your character attempts to block. This often leads to significant health loss, and there isn't much you can do about it.

Moreover, your enemies can attack you while you're hitting them. This makes it doubly difficult to dodge some attacks as your character is in the middle of striking them. Since the enemies don't recoil, they hit you before you can even move, leaving cheesing the game AI and playing oddly to circumvent these issues as the only viable strategies.",1681747172,1691463976,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And a barely working, boring, and generic mix of every indie game on the market with a Star Wars skin was just incredible? 

Whether it be both Battlefronts that have known issue lists that are years long even before the updates with entire chunks missing, or boring flight sim games that are blatantly a minimum viable product, to mobile slot machine games. Yeah, this was the breaking point for me. I signed out.

This is all Star Wars is ever going to be. Apathy. And Apathy is death.

So to start let's talk about the graphics. They somehow got worse than 2017 Battlefront 2 (BF2), which slammed the saturation to max, smeared lens flares, and eye straining vignettes everywhere in an attempt to look better when it looked better as an almost photorealistic movie without all of that in 2015 Battlefront. 

The best looking things are the Stormtroopers, which clearly use the old photoscanned models from Dice's games, and look strangely higher quality and out of place. Everything looks incredibly mushy and like scratched play-doh. I think when Force Unleashed 2 (TFU2) had sharper and more impressive looking effects and textures to me, that says everything right there. A 2 hour long Xbox 360 game from 2010 looked much nicer and was more fun. You could stop reading now, and that'd summarize so much of this, but let's go on.

Gameplay. It's very boring. I feel like a wild monkey as opposed to an untrained Jedi. My attacks feel flat and lack impact due to some strange delusion that human characters cannot be dismembered due to the rating? So chopping up robot arms on human characters and wild animals minding their own business into pieces isn't more violent? Yeah meanwhile, Force Unleashed 1 and 2 had dismemberment and were T rated. No one cared.

You barely use the force. Ever. You are so heavily limited by some stupid overheat bar yet again like it's a chastity belt. Like the other EA Star Wars games, I give none of them a pass for this mechanic, either give me more uses or remove it and use the Jedi Knight or TFU systems. Swallow your pride. I am a Jedi. I'm going to act like one any way I want. That includes using the Force.

On the topic of enemies, they did mostly well here.

Enemies kept the one good thing from TFU and other Star Wars games, they are very vocal and act appropriately when being blasted away with a force push or the only one left. Yelling in fear or running for their lives. And there's also a lot of them, and they feel very menacing. And there's a good variety of bad guys. Good job, I expect that. Too bad they're not fun to fight when I'm wearing a chastity belt.

The combat is like Dark-Souls, but with most of the fun subclasses and interesting RPG upgrade paths missing. And as someone who has played those games before, I can tell you this is the biggest fault of this game. Dark Souls always gives you tons of ways to break the game and get stupidly powerful, which means you can basically negate the challenge entirely by exploiting engine jank and shoddy programming, or find organic tools and methods to overcome a challenge, and this has led to countless debates, that it's a meme with every new release.

But that's the fun of a game like Dark Souls. This fun part has been blatantly removed here. It's gone and replaced with a chastity belt. ""No fun allowed in the Star Wars game, otherwise it might shatter our fragile egos here at Respawn."" Might as well be this game's motto. If you were to repeat any game's mistakes, I hope it would've been leaving that fun jank in, but no, it's copy pasting the crappy upgrade system from TFU2. Of course.

So what about the story? Well, the story would've been better if I didn't have to play this boring trash, but in isolation, it's not terrible. But it's not good either.

So immediately, you start by dismantling giant ships in a scrapyard. (Sometimes foreshadowing is very obvious.) And you climb through a bunch of incredibly nonsensical gamey looking platforming sections on this clearly unsafe ship, which I'm actually fine with since it's a tutorial. It's pretty fun. They even reference Nar Shadda from TFU. I approve, good start.

Then you and your friend find a Jedi Starfighter on the side of a cruiser, and you both fall due to a cable breaking. Which makes you use the force to save your friend from dying. And immediately, an Imperial Droid sees this. Which is where the pacing of this mission goes to die. Apparently the Empire is made of Endermen from Minecraft, and they immediately find you and your friend.

Your friend is killed, and you are pushed on to a train. Which was incredibly disappointing to see EA make another game where they pull this impatient crap with the Empire basically stopping anyone from ever developing as a character, like 2017 BF2 or TFU2 yet again. 

However, the following escape section is very good. And again acted as a great tutorial, that if not for being a little gamey looking, it was very tense and action packed. A stranger in an odd ship pulls up next to the train to help you escape, but she has to take out the Tie Fighters first, and tells you to keep moving. Eventually you are cornered by a Sith, and are forced to face her in a one on one duel.

And on that note, something these games have consistently done well is the music. And this is no exception. You feel completely outmatched as she zooms around you like a Death Eater from Harry Potter. You and her clash, and then you escape as the stranger rescues you. I still don't know what it's going to ever take to just get a full game that's like the opening section of this. Because after this, it was all downhill. We go to Shrek's Swamp, and it's full of Pokemon and giant frogs. And I've lost all interest. We are now chasing ghost balls we'll never use like every stupid Jedi story Disney has made.

The rest of the game is autopilot filler where the only good thing is that it ends. It plays and looks like a janky Uncharted clone made in 2012 ported to Xbox One, because it is. The story itself is such a slog to get through, so I'll give you the highlights from now on.

-There's a big funny frog in Shrek's swamp who farts in a cave and is the only tough fight in the game aside from a cheap shot difficulty spike at the end
-You Fight AT-STs that have worse animations than 2015 Battlefront
-You fight Purge Troopers that aren't as cool as TFU, but are just ok (Probably because Dice made them for BF2 and never used them)
-You fight on Kashyyyk alongside Saw Gurerra to free Wookies, which was a much better sounding premise for this game that I would've preferred (More on that later.)
-You go to Malastare and fight a Grey Jedi, which was probably one of the coolest places to go in a game like this. 
-You also befriend a witch. They include her more than I thought they would've. But she doesn't get much development.
-You go to the planet where Starkiller Base would one day be built. That alone could have been the most interesting place to go with the story and talk about the history of the Jedi and explore their origins, too bad!
-There are some order 66 flashbacks, which are the best parts, and look better than most of the game?
-Cal has a cool force sense ability.

So closing thoughts. If this game had focused on Cal and his friend joining Saw Guerra, and struggling with his past of being a Jedi during Order 66, that would've fixed it for me. I wanted to be part of an adventure, and do something cool, which is why I liked Star Wars games. But this game focuses too much on boring crap, and struggles to be mediocre. There are very few exciting moments, and you're constantly punished for wanting to have fun as Cal is cut short from developing at every turn. Simply put, I cannot recommend this game. There is more bad than good in it. And it killed my interest in this IP. Apathy is death.",1691459424,1691459424,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pleasant surprise.
I was expecting the game to be an AAA game set in the Star Wars universe, which is always kind of a plus (let's not lie), but it actually does more than good graphics and aesthetics.
The gameplay is really good and offers many possibilities without being too complex.
Set on higher difficulties, some fights can even be a real challenge, if you're really into Dark Souls-like challenges.

Immersive Star Wars game with a deep story. Its like an improved version of KTOR. The movement and atmosphere feels a lot like a Dead Space game (just without the horror), and the skill system is reminiscent of Assassins Creed

That said, there are quite a few minute details that break immersion. Such as all AT-ST's spawned at the same time will walk in the same timing; while walking or running, the light saber does not cut through objects like it does when you attack; and player movement matches the camera, not player orientation (so if the player is climbing but the camera is at an angle, the player will jump parallel to the camera).

[h2]EDIT: I have three points to make[/h2]

(1) [b]The game is not designed to be played on the Jedi Grand Master (hardest) difficulty.[/b] Some of the boss fights are obviously designed to be ""really challenging"" for even the easier difficulties. When you play the game on the hardest difficulty, its next to impossible unless you are perfect or get lucky and find some way to exploit the mechanics. To top that, the checkpoints aren't always forgiving for the challenging stuff and [b]the loading times to respawn can be horendous depending on the location in game.[/b] I kind of want to try Dark Souls once I finish this game.

(2) [b]This game is super buggy.[/b] I think if someone played this on the ""Story Mode"" difficulty, they wouldn't encounter these bugs because they wouldn't have to exploit mechanics to complete the game, but man is this game has some serious issues. Aforementioned in my previous point, you have to play outside the box if you are playing with the most difficult difficulty. Therefore, you will encounter bugs with the AI. Some example, (a) a mob touching a wall and then flying up into the ceiling and out of the world, (b) mobs simply walking or jumping off ledges, (c) mobs not ""activating"" all at once even in small rooms. So if you enter a small room, one Stormtrooper might come to you but the rest will just watch and shout at you. These are just three of the bugs. I've been recording my play through, and [b]thus far, I've encountered roughly 20 unique common bugs that either break the game, make the game easier, or ruin the experience/immersion.[/b]

(3) [b]The default PC controls are pretty bad.[/b] I changed the key binding to be similar to Battlefront II (2017). Here is what I changed:
[table]

tl;dr This is a good, long game, but man is it buggy and unforgiving.

Game is great, absolutely one of the best Star Wars games I've ever played.  It's a star wars game that plays like Dark Souls/Elden Ring in some respects.  If you like Star Wars, and Dark Souls/Elden Ring, you will love this game.  The music is incredible, the sound effects are incredible, extremely familiar to source material.  You can really get a feel for being a Jedi.  Enjoy!

The problem is on PC you have to install the EA app, despite the fact I bought this on Steam.  It wasn't like that when I first bought it, but it is now.  Cause FUCK Electronic Arts.  This isn't the first time EA has tried to screw with legitimate customers.   Sometime after Dragon Age Origins came out, EA launched the Origin platform, and pulled all their products from Steam.... after people bought the game on Steam.  Forcing those people that bought the game on one platform, (probably because they didn't want Origin or the EA app), to have to install TWO platforms on their PC to play the game.

Electronic Arts.  You keep forcing your products/apps on customers that nobody wants, you won't have any customers anymore.  I stopped buying Battlefield games after Battlefield 4, (thought mostly cause they are not fun anymore), I don't buy Dragon Age games on PC anymore after Origins, I don't buy Mass Effect games on PC, I don't buy your cash grab SIMS games at all, I only obtain Need for Speed games for massive discounts or during free deals.  I've obtained most of the recent release EA games for free because of either EPIC games store weekly free deals, or PlayStation Plus membership free game downloads.  I'm all for competition in the market, but your products, specifically Origin and the EA App, are worse than the competitors that came before you, AND after you.  EA is so out of touch with the market they are actively trying to ruin.  Also, STOP putting micro transactions into games!  Triple A titles that cost $60-$70 do not need this toxic cash grab mechanic.  Your game is NOT free!  You made enough money off the sales!

Buy Jedi: Fallen order and the new one Jedi: Survivor on PlayStation or X Box so you don't have to use the bloatware EA App to play it.",1691272397,1691272397,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A minor complaint is sometimes I will have to press strong attack several times before any input is read. If the huntsmen boss is a scripted loss it should be at least slightly difficult.

It's not perfect - the camera moves a little strangely at times, the controls are a bit floaty, and you can accidentally skip character interactions by looking the wrong way - but overall its everything you want in a single player Star Wars game.

More of a Metroidvania with Soulslike elements (which is not an issue at ALL as far as I'm concerned, I love Metroidvanias too and Soulslikes likely wouldn't exist without them). So I'm just gonna write this as a review of why I think this ISN'T a Soulslike. Keep in mind I still recommend it. 

-less punishing in general. there are difficulty options and you don't lose acquired skill points when you die. also seems like so far the bosses aren't that big of a deal. also, stamina is not consumed by rolling which is a big deal for sure. also falling into a pit doesn't kill you, just hurts you, which is a godsend with the climbing and platforming that pops up as an occasional anoyance

-more focus on parrying, at least to be most effective. reminds me of Sekiro with the posture bars that decay with more parries. 

-completely different level up method where you don't increase stats but get new abilities and power up the abilities you do have. also ability unlocks that fundamentally change how the game plays (e.g. the first major one, Wall Running)

-a huge lack of weapon variety, which is fine, but to me Soulslikes have more than three options. plus you can switch it up on the fly. 

-the map is very different, still coiled up like a good Soulslikes with lots of shortcuts and stuff, but more focused on new traversal methods than skillchecks. plus it has a holomap straight out of Metroid Prime, which is very non-Soulslike imo.

-more focus on story and characters, with cutscenes and all. Cal even narrates a lot of what he's doing or talks to his droid companion. a much more talkative game.

-fashion kinda sucks ass. only can change poncho and outfit colors, no real customization unfortunately. fashion souls is endgame, after all. you can change up how your lightsaber looks quite a bit, but I can hardly see the thing in game so it's hard to care that much outside of color. 

So yeah it's definitely closer to something like Metroid Prime than any Fromsoft Soulsborne game, just something to know going into it. Still a ton of fun.",1630771654,1691008088,True,0,0,0.489116519689559937,0,True,False,False

My initial thoughts before playing the game were dour due to Star Wars fans around the interwebs basically shitting on the game and its story. And I can say that, from my perspective, they're wrong. Now, it's no Knights of the Old Republic, I thought the story was pretty straight forward and easily digestible. The gameplay was nothing new - if you've played Assassin's Creed or Dark Souls, you pretty much already know the controls - it suited the style of the game quite well. Also, as someone who believes game developers are trying to milk open-world games for all their worth (yet being so very shallow), this was a nice change of pace with the semi-open semi-linear style. I think this was the best choice for the game.

The worlds you will be visiting are quite varied, and labyrinthic in their design. There are collectables for those of us that enjoy collecting, enviromental puzzles for those that enjoy to be puzzled, and cool new combat moves for those that enjoy being cool. The characters are nice and the story is engaging, which is a refreshing thing for Star Wars lately. The music could be very well signed by John Williams, and there are some truly memorable set pieces.

Now, the thing to keep in mind is that the first two thirds of the game are the most infuriating cavalcade of bullcrap you will ever experience. Enemies soft lock to you when you dodge so they hit you anyways, your attacks dont interrupt them but they interrupt you, even your heals!, there is an embarrassing amount of -gotcha pulls with enemies purposely hidden to kill you, and most of the combat will be against multiple enemies, but you wont get the skills to effectively fight against them until, you guessed it, two thirds into the story.

Thats when it opens up, and with all your powers you truly feel like a Jedi. The game is not that long, so its not devastating to put up with the first half of the game until it gets good. The great parts are great enough to make you forget the bad.

it's like tomb raider, but the platforming is slow and awkward. there's no fov slider so the camera has several moments where you're sliding down a ramp and have to time a jump at the bottom of it, but you're so zoomed in that when you jump you realize you were farther away from the tip of the ramp than you thought you were.
it's like assassin's creed, but the combat is so slow that you're not allowed to cancel your own actions (once you hit block you're entirely committed, there's no cancelling blocking or attacking if someone throws/aims something at you while you're in an action)
projectiles are super weird too? when a stormtrooper aims a rocket at me i guess i kinda just... take it? you can't deflect it. if you hit dodge (no matter how early) you still get hit with the splash damage.

I did not like the mechanic of finding cosmetic loot boxes but recovering in-game lore was cool. It would have been even cooler if all the lore was done with cutscenes instead of reading, but I guess that would be too expensive for them. 

The last fight was very good. I enjoyed fighting other lightsaber users. The sound track is really good. 

The overall story felt a bit disjointed and unimpactful. It seemed to me that the game was incomplete. Also seems poorly optimized. Random frame drops were prevalent.

- Floaty controls
- platforming is just tedious
- bad writing, and Cal's voice actor can't emote
- combat is just push the button at the right time, push the right buttons in order. No strategy.

Took a break from Elden Ring to play this, and the controls are just awful in comparison. 

To be fair, I really don't like Star Wars and have a lot of gripes with that in general, so for a big Star Wars fan the game would probably be pretty good, but without the world and lore to hold me this game is just a mediocre souls-like with platforming mechanics.

Brilliant story and characters, beautifully immersive, I loved how the video sections feed into the game play - certainly one of the best tutorials/openings I've seen. Combat is OK but certainly gets better/more interesting as you open more skills. Pathing is a little confusing in places/it is easy to get lost - map is not helpful at all. Lore fans will find lots to love here. Initially i was irked by the lack of character choice (there is none) but Cal is so endearing, it soon becomes a joy to accompany him on his journey.

I have played mountains of Star Wars games and find this to be one of the best - if only it wasn't such ridiculously hard work to actually play it. It's like trying to drive your dream car but two of the wheels are square. Lots of buggy graphical issues in the video sections. If you luck out and hit the jumping-off-the-train tutorial bug it is game-breaking and you have to start again. Game does not translate well to PC at all (clearly designed for consoles only). Most will find they cannot actually play via Steam without finding the Origin work-around.

So many utterly stupid frustrations. I find this to be a great injustice for one of the most wonderfully engaging Star Wars stories to date.

First, the combat. It's at its best when you're mowing down hordes of weak enemies, particularly stormtroopers. Basic stormtroopers are a joy to fight, running through them, tearing them apart while deflecting blaster bolts back at ranged troopers. Fighting tougher enemies starts to get not as good. It's not too bad when they're solo, but when you have a purge trooper accompanied by other enemies, it's kind of a pain. You never feel like you quite have the control over the flow of battle that you should. 

Parrying is rather frustrating, as it seems random whether you'll have to just parry one attack before you can riposte, or if you'll have to parry a series of attacks. Feels bad man. Bosses are okay, but force powers feel next to useless against them most of the time, which is irritating. Lightsaber combat is fun, but you're a Jedi. You should be able to use force powers to good effect against more than just rank and file enemies.

Still, even with the issues, combat still averages out to be pretty good. It could just be a lot better.

Second, exploration. Again, good, not great. There's plenty of secrets to find, and mostly finding them feels good, but rarely do you get anything that feels substantial. Most secrets are either a skin or a bit of lore, with very rare parts of an upgrade to health or force power, or even better, a new stim canister. All the secrets come with a bit of XP, too, which is helpful, but even with that, the skins and lore feel like very underwhelming rewards. I started the game exploring pretty thoroughly, but once I finished the last visit to Kashyyyk, I stopped going out of my way to explore and just sped through the rest of the game. I would definitely not recommend 100%-ing this one, just explore as much as you find fun, and when it stops being fun, move on. There's just not enough worth pushing through to find it all.

Third, the story. Again, pretty good, but not quite great. Voice acting is quite solid, the story is interesting but doesn't feel like anything particularly special. I liked the characters, and in particular liked Merrin, but we definitely did not get enough time with her. Cal and Cere had pretty solid character arcs, as well. No real complaints about the story, just didn't stand out enough to be more than good. Very good, even.

Fourth, sound and visuals. As I mentioned, the voice acting is solid. Sound design and OST are good throughout the game. The visuals are nice, but lighting had some weird glitchiness in many, many places. Nothing that made the game unplayable, but very noticeable.

Now, for some nitpicks. First, holy Mass Effect elevators Batman. Some of them are looooooooong. Kind of ridiculous. Platforming is mostly fine, but there were enough times where jumps failed or wall climbs failed to initiate or the camera slid into horrible angles (particularly during sliding sections) that it definitely merits mention. The map is bound to BD-1, so is unavailable when he is not with you, or when climbing or underwater. Very annoying. UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES EVERYWHERE. If you put unskippable cutscenes in your game, you should be fired. Out of a cannon. Into the sun.

Nitpicks aside, the game still averages out to be good. I would definitely recommend it for fans of Star Wars, 3D action combat platformers, and metroidvanias. Just... don't 100% it. Just don't.",1690292090,1690292090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Interesting story and plot, that has become canonical, fascinating data bank and tactical guide, exciting fights and enemies, intriguing detailed unique planets, and even the irritating, but quite realistic system with steam taking or attack blocking delay - altogether have made this game so good. Of course there are little strange things, like underwater animation of chests opening, re spawning of destroyed objects after resting, and especially uncomfortable and strange inability to roll off the platforms. Also there are some little bugs, like definitely imperfect sliding. But these little problems are so insignificant, that just can not in any way affect the overall impression.

I just finished this game main storyline, and I'd say it is a mah game. the story is good, but the gameplay is a bit more desiring:
- There are no fast-travel points: you have to get back track all the way to return to the ship after reaching the far end of a mission, and you get lost many times. The holomap is not clear and cumbersome. Many of those time when I get lost, the map doesn't help, no indications in game which way to go. I went many times the wrong way for really a long time (repeating the same puzzles to reach a point) to find it is not the right way. I had to go to walkthrough videos many times.
- (I come from many many hours of Assassin's Creed game, where you can climb anything, here climbing even the simplest cliffs is not available.)
- Even now after year of the release of the game it still has many bugs, I got stuck in some places due to bugs in moving and collision detection.
- There are many sections in each planet that are unreachable at some points of the play, but will be accessible once you get a new skill and come back to that planet. I personally hate this in games, as I never re-play a game or go back to complete it 100% after I finished the main storyline (I have many many games in my backlog, there is no time to replay games), I am not a completionist.
- The game length is good (short compared to other Action Adventure games), but due to the above annoyances I mentioned I would have stopped playing if it was a longer game.

A perfect example is the double-bladed lightsaber.  The game explicitly tells you it's your main tool for engaging with groups and yet they give it to you so late in the game, after you've faced off against groups for hours with no fun way to deal with them, either be reckless and get lucky or bait out fights one at a time, and they also give it to you immediately before a one-on-one duel!

Disclaimer being it may just be a skill issue but I digress. I love Star Wars and want to say upfront that the story is amazing, however I find the gameplay to be frustrating. You can only save at designated save stations which is frustrating when you die in a boss battle and need to run from that save point to die and  run over again. The actual combat mechanics are ok but not super complex. At the time of writing this review I was stuck on the fist ""real"" boss fight with the second sister. Seeing her do cool spin moves and jumps and lunges make me wonder if those moves are in the skill tree and when I'll get far enough to do these cool maneuvers. You can't. It does make me feel like a student but the boss just seems too challenging (again maybe skill issue). I also find that the map is hard to read so when going from location to location I'll end up getting lost or going in a circle, even more frustrating is getting to a puzzle room and the real puzzle is figuring out what the puzzle is. The puzzles don't seem intuitive to me which then becomes frustrating once more.  A game that does similar things but better in my own opinion is God of War 2018.

Well, I think it was a bit underwhelming with all the hype built trough the last years. For a triple A title it still has bugs that are not game breaking but still annoying to see (those frogs just feel designed so sloppy), AI is often confused, gameplay features a lot of walking throughout areas with nothing much more, especially in the first part of the game. It just gets boring to travel to one corner of the map and then struggle again to come back to the start to the Mantis ship. 
Story feels superficial to me. It feels a bit flat and linear - is Cal learning to become jedi master, is he trying to stop inquistors one by one, is he joining the Rebels (which we see but are there just as an easter egg) - none of this gets built on and he is what is called a Pollyana - A character who is always optimistic no matter what may happen to them. Which is not bad as an idea but there's nothing more than that, which is why it feels boring.
Anyway, cinematics are executed very nicely and the visuals are great but big studios like EA like to lower standarts for starved for games fandoms like Star Wars (which for good or bad I'd like to count myself in :D) by releasing minimal quality-effort-put-in games (Battlefront 1 - eh, Battlefront 2 - lootboxes, Battlefront 2 updated - cut out from development in the middle of nowhere, Star Wars Eclipse - just a trailer, no actual game in development despite announcement which trailer was even made by outsource movie company not familiar with games, somewhere in South-East Asia, Squadrons - nobody heard or played it). My expectations might be too high but I can't call a boring game, great fun and ""best Star Wars game since Disney bought the franchise"" just because the other new SW game titles are ""okay"", does not make this one great.

This game is just not that good and its really sad because I had high hopes for this one. The awful Super Troopers instant 180 block when you attack them in the back when they were facing the opposite direction offering nothing but cheats from the enemy... Everyone can block better than you can(so much for being a jedi) and recover blocking instantly mid combat. You can't block mid combat AT ALL and get combo'd to hell and back and basically 100-0'd and the dodge in the game is just terrible and barely works while your fighting. The enemy's will 180 snap right on you after you try and dodge(behind them) their attack making the game feel as goofy as possible. I don't get why people hyped this game so much. I can't even think of a reason to keep it installed and I've played so many cool star wars games and this just isn't one of them. This is a dumpster tier dark souls rip off with star wars costumes on. I liked the exploration in the game but the combat is so awful I can't be bothered to care. Barely 10 hours in and ready to uninstall and haven't touched the game since.

The gameplay is fantastic, the lightsaber combat, while minimalist, really pays off as you unlock more of the skills that Cal seeks to regain.

The enemies are diverse and even though there are only about five planets, it is filled with such life and little details that you can't help but feel immersed into it.

The best of this game is that even though it has a requirement of 60+ gigabytes to download, it can affordable run in any types of PC. Heck, I only have a GTX1060 and a Core i7 Intel processors, but I could relatively play it at 60fps, if you ignore the bits and pieces of framedrops, here and there.

Jedi Fallen Order is nonetheless a game that pays tribute to its star wars fans, by showing you environments that feel like it belongs in star wars, combat that makes you fight and feel like a cool jedi, and has a well told story that sets it up nicely for part 2. However....It does come with its set of issues, especially in the game/combat design and game direction and level design. For example, you can be done doing a mission and now all of the sudden you have to crawl, and navigate yourself going all the way back to where you came from or sometimes you fight like a cool Jedi Master, only to be Indiana Jones the next second. Trying to solve tedious and unnecessary puzzles. For the most part 65% of the game is just you climbing, running, jumping, exploring and doing puzzles and 35% of it is just stimulating combat. Another thing I like to mention is that for a game that has the tags of a "" souls - like "" genre. It really fails to meet to that level of standards when it comes to that genre. Fallen Order Bosses/Minibosses don't have lots of variety as there are only 4 main bosses, and the rest are common creatures turned mini bosses, but more aggro. Not to mention that they are all a breeze and take from 1 - 3 attempts on Jedi Master. Even on the Jedi GrandMaster difficulty it really isnt that much of a challenge with the exception of maybe only 1 main boss. The combat while still done great, doesnt flow as well as the actual souls - like games like Elden Ring, Sekiro, Wo - Long, or Nioh. As fighting can feel clunky, delayed and the parry unresponsive at times.  With that aside however, as a star wars fan there is still much to do. As you can customize your lightsaber, unlock references and relics that tie it back to clone wars, see popular characters that make a scene in the game, unlock force powers that make you fight like a jedi and be told a well written story with good narrative that leads it up for part 2. And even after you beat the game, there is still so much to be done as you unlock rewards, and modes for when you beat the story. I will say though. If you want a "" Souls-like "" game, then find another game. If you want to play a better game then look somewhere else. If you are a starwars fan, wait for this game to go on sale. As good as this game is, it isn't worth so much to the point where you have to rush in and buy it. wait for a sale.

Nevertheless, Respawn Entertainment pulled through with this one. As many have already stated, this game is essentially a blend of souls-like combat with Uncharted esque platforming and puzzles. The game does not innovate in any way at all, which is fine. The game takes things that have proven to work and makes great use of them. The story isn’t anything that would leave you pondering about it, but it serves as an excuse to explore an unseen timeline outside of literature, ""the dark times"" between Revenge of The Sith and Rogue One. Due to the nature of the game’s setting, it’ll occasionally dabble in the more esoteric parts of Star Wars lore that could seem out of place for the more casual fans of the franchise. The game feels like a throwback to LucasArts era of Star Wars games, in a good way.

The composer has done a great job simulating John Williams’ style; everything sounds like it could've been played in the original films. Even though the OST is very Star Wars-esque, it’s not very memorable. I personally can’t tell if this game has any leitmotifs or recurring themes aside from the iconic ones that the movies established.

This game is mostly a novelty; you’re paying for a Star Wars themed ride here. It takes less than ten hours to complete the game if you don't partake in side activities. With side activities, I got about 30 hours in.

The game isn't too challenging. I played on the most difficult setting and ended up dying only a couple of times. If you’re looking for your next souls-like fix, this game probably isn't it. If you’re intimidated by the souls-like association, don’t be; as I implied earlier, the game has difficulty settings unlike most souls-like games. The game's difficulty can be adjusted to be very forgiving, anyone can experience the full game without missing out on anything.


Setting

Fallen Order takes place in 14 BBY, which is 5 years after ROTS. The Empire has now established a permanent presence around the galaxy. All the Jedi that survived the initial purge are considered outlaws by the Empire and are actively being hunted by the Inquisitors, the Empire’s solution to the remaining Jedi. You, Cal Kestis, a 17-year old Jedi in hiding, must find your place in this oppressive galaxy.

I found it interesting how this game ties together almost all forms of Star Wars media into a single package. The game pulls content from the Clone Wars series, the Rebels series, Rogue One, the prequels, and even the sequels. I've always felt like there was a disconnect between the prequels and the original trilogy since the art direction was quite jarringly different. Rogue One helped to ease that transition, but this game is probably the best bridge so far between the prequel and the original trilogy.


Gameplay

The gameplay revolves mainly around three key features: slashing, blocking, and dodging. There are also force powers, which are special abilities that consume a limited resource. The force powers are very abusable and can easily trivialize every encounter in the game. The game heavily encourages you to perform timed blocks (parries) instead of dodges. When you parry an opponent’s attack, you not only avoid all damage but also damage the aggressor, but if you dodge incoming attacks instead, it might leave you vulnerable to follow-up attacks. The dodges are mainly reserved for the rare unblockable attack.

Weapon or movement variability is limited to the one weapon you start with. The game allows you to unlock additional special attack patterns, but none of these can function as your new main fighting style; they're essentially just specializations. Think something like toggling on aoe mode to clear some swarming enemies.",1585508396,1689528955,True,2,0,0.542323589324951172,0,True,False,False

At first I was very skeptical because EA. Then when I heard a lot of good things about the game I realized it was good,
but I still didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. RESPAWN did an amazing job.

Only sad part is that EA is sabotaging both RESPAWN and themselves (what a surprise) with the EA launcher which is what is garnering most of the negative reviews. Imagine not having this absolutely unnecessary thing, this game would easily have Overwhelmingly positive on this platform which would in turn get them more sales...oh well. Poor RESPAWN.

Still, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I thoroughly enjoyed 100%'ng it on max difficulty. I hate giving money to EA as much as the next guy, but if they publish something good we have to show ""Yes, this is what we want"" and this game and RESPAWN deserve it.

Despite good voice and motion capture performances by the game's cast, Fallen Order's story is yet another unimaginative Star Wars story filled to the brim with generic Star Wars tropes and plot points that continually fails to intrigue the player throughout the length of its story.

Fallen Order's primitive attempt at souls-style combat is frustratingly janky, unsatisfying, and frankly does not fit into a Star Wars game at all. The souls mechanics in this game either do not fit into a Star Wars game like respawning enemies after resting at a meditation point (this game's bonfire) or are half-arsed like the soul/XP retrieval system after death, which does not pressure you anywhere near like it does in Dark Souls since XP in Fallen Order is abundant and there aren't many skills to invest XP into so you'll power through the skill tree early into the game.

Enemies in Fallen Order are generic and unvaried; they're either variations of Stormtroopers just with different equipment or wildlife like giant spiders, giant toads and giant rats, all of which are boring to fight due to the aforementioned janky combat.

Fallen Order's planets/environments are just as bland and unimaginative as its enemies, like Bogano which is a flat marshy swamp planet, Zeffo which is a cold and windy mountainous planet, and Kashyyyk which has been reused in Star Wars media time and time again. While playing through the story you'll unlock abilities which can be used to unlock and explore previously locked areas on planets. However, all planets are unrewarding to explore and don't offer anything unique to see or do. While you can find health or force upgrades through exploration, most of the time the only things you'll find is random junk which Cal (the protagonist) can interact with to say a generic line or two about or customisation items which just boils down to ugly ponchos all of which look worse than Cal's base outfit, some colour palette changes to Cal's droid or ship, and lightsaber parts most of which you'll never see while playing since logically you can't see your lightsaber hilt when it's wielded by Cal and thus lightsaber colours are the only customisation which actually make a noticeable visual difference.

Overall, even with a hefty 80-90% discount, I still wouldn't recommend buying Fallen Order and advise against doing so simply because it's sluggish waste of time to play and there are countless other games which do what this game attempts to do, just ten times better.",1689298298,1689298298,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Great game - you should definitely do it!!
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: well what a surprise! many people were praising the game for being great, I never was a fan of Star Wars but I decided to give it a chance... and this game right here is a bit the Arkham series of the Star Wars license I reckon! In other words, giving a new shine back to the series! If you remember good games like Dark Forces or Jedi Knight, if you were into SWTOR and the like, or if you are a fan of Star Wars, you ought to play this game! It is always pleasant to see Monaghan act in a movie or game, Merrin is adorable (romance please!), and story/narrative direction is actually very, very well done! (not a surprise though coming from God of War director). The introduction scene, and the first tutorial level, with its direction twists and camera tricks and gripping actions were remarkable.

So yes, it has a few flaws, like being a bit too short (very few levels), a bit clunky and buggy here and there, being a bit dry (NOT a single item in the game, no other weapon)... but aside from that? What an interesting, slick take on the current successful gaming genres all mashed together with a Star Wars theme!
Planet exploration and interspecies teams dialogues ala Mass Effect, check!
Casual take on the Dark Souls fighting and firelinks system, check! (on Jedi Master difficulty finishing the game was sometimes tough for me!)
Tomb exploring, smooth platforming and puzzle solving ala Tomb Raider/Uncharted/Prince of Persia, check!
Amazing scenery, pulp action cutscenes and crazy boss fights ala Metal Gear and God of War, check!

If that sounds exciting to you, and you don't expect this game to be a masterpiece, but just really cool as a week end lounging session, try it now!

So the positives first: 
- The game is incredibly beautiful and it has a lot to offer if you take your time to look around. You will be exploring multiple different biomes and there are truly some sights to behold.
- The sound design is fantastic. Well, it is Star Wars. Exactly the kind of sound design a Star Wars game should have. 
- The acting is quite ok. Probably quite good even. Well, it is Star Wars, so it is full of odd characters, often too silly dialogue and a lot of forced plot elements that might not sit well with you.
- The story is overall quite fine. It is again incredibly generic in the way Star Wars usually is incredibly generic and just walking the same tropes as so much other fantasy/science fiction media, not to mention rethreading much of the same territory as previous Star Wars content. 
- Playing on Story mode will at times make you feel like a true Jedi cutting through hordes of enemies and that can feel ok.

The negatives: 
Combat and mechanics:
- Combat mechanics are incredibly basic, yet don’t work well. Whether targeting an enemy or not, your character will often strike at air even when an enemy is nearby if you are not perfectly aligned (should not happen with a game that has fixed targeting). Also, targeting an enemy makes it oddly difficult to dodge attacks, so I ended up almost never using it. 
- Talking about controls, the game can be incredibly counter-intuitive and it is obvious the game was made for a controller (I played on PC) and that the game was not optimized for this experience. 
- Continuing the talk of control issues, the game animation locks you all the time, making dodging, parrying and fighting enemies quite frustrating. Instead of being a fast-paced and fluid combat system, you basically only have to parry, then dodge the occasional attack and then strike once you wear out your opponents parry-bar. Very, very boring. 
- The force abilities feels quite useless for combat purposes. All stronger enemies seem immune so you can only use it on minor opponents that are easy to kill anyway.
- Game is quite unforgiving even on second-easiest difficulty level. You have very little health and might die in 2-4 hits (Depending on the opponent), while having to hit even the easiest opponents maybe 4-5 times yourself before they die (and harder opponents probably 20+ times) Keep in mind the dodging/parrying combat system I described above and you might understand why it is not funny and can be very challenging as your blocks can often be penetrated. Some powerful abilities the opponent uses also feels unfair because of animation locking making it difficult to escape/dodge. 

The negatives: 
Other: 
- Path-finding and puzzles can be very, very poorly made. I don’t remember the last time I had to go online to solve puzzles or simply figure out where to go next, because so many solutions to puzzles are illogical or revolve around you finding a tiny thing that is easy to overlook, whereas the map is made in a way where it is not exactly obvious where to go to reach your mission destination. And it gets even worse when you realize that you sometimes solve very hard puzzles just go get one meek cosmetic upgrade. 
- Although the game is beautiful and is “Metroidvania-esque” in that you have to return to the same areas with new abilities to unlock and access things that were previously not reachable, the game really gives you no real incentive to do so. All upgrades (aside from skill points) and thus pick-ups are cosmetic only. Meaning that they scattered the map with tons of crates for you to open but you have no reason to open them. There are a few exceptions to this as the game also enables you to upgrade your health and force bar by finding 3 hidden objects twice (giving you ca. 25% bonus for every three you find). Finding these can be somewhat useful, just as the health pack pick-ups can be good, but 90% of the time you will simply find a small story thing or a cosmetic, meaning you probably lose out on any incentive to really explore the world. At least if you dislike the combat mechanics as I did.

The game immediately became a massive hit, generating a positive response and welcoming over 20 million players across different platforms. Considering this year’s sequel turned out to have terrible PC optimization, there is no better time to understand why the predecessor got such an overwhelming amount of praise in the first place.
Starting with the obvious, implementing a souls-like combat system into the Star Wars world was an incredible idea that got brilliantly executed. It may feel cruel at the beginning but punishing for stupid mistakes changes a Padawan into a Jedi. I have never been introduced to the famous video game series distributed by FromSoftware (or any substitute), so it was a fresh experience for me. Thanks to the combination of patience and persistence, I could gradually witness my manual and tactical progress which was very satisfying. If a total casual like me is able to beat this game on the normal level of difficulty, anyone can… especially taking into consideration the proximity of checkpoints. The diversity of enemy types resulted in me memorizing different strategies, inevitably making the gameplay more exciting. This turns every boss fight into a thrilling event. What encourages playing even more is development through the skill tree. It enables you to differentiate potential attacks and strengthen the connection to the Force. This feature works fantastically in the context of the story which centers around young Jedi trying to regain his power and establish a new order. I wouldn’t exaggerate about the main storyline being utterly moving yet it definitely delivers a purpose to explore the whole galaxy. The fragment of space that we are privileged enough to discover maybe doesn’t impress with its size but it was designed in detail. Each of the planets has loads of secrets to reveal to potential players. What emphasizes this fact, even more, is a graphic layout that simply took my breath away. Everything seems tangible and the ugliest places have something oddly beautiful about them. 
The only thing that I could consider a serious disadvantage is a map structure and lack of fast travel. As a matter of fact, I necessarily wasted countless hours struggling to return to my ship. The game was called „Star Wars Get Back To The Mantis” by more cynical players and I can fully understand their frustration. The map design can be quite problematic and, as I wrote before, there is no form of fast travel, so getting lost and wandering around the map becomes quite obvious, sooner or later.
Despite the annoying element, this video game provided me with a mountain of exhilaration. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is an absolute must-play for the fans of the franchise and casual gamers, in general, looking for another amazing adventure to experience.",1688918966,1688918966,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The graphics are beautiful and the level design is the classic ""explore the different planets to continue the story"".
The combat system is okay and not perfect nor satisfying. Sometimes bugs can occur, but no game breaking stuff.

I've nearly completed the game at this point and I've decided to revise my review. Within the context of my original review (see below), yes the combat can be frustrating, however, I switched the difficulty to Story Mode (the lowest difficulty) and never looked back. Even at this level the combat was still somewhat challenging. but it made the game vastly more enjoyable and I was able to feel immersed in the story and the exploration. I'd highly recommend doing this if you, as I mentioned in my original review, have a difficult time with ""Souls-like"" combat. Again, I've nearly completed the game now (~95%) and I'm happy to say the game has thoroughly disproved my skepticism. I found myself in awe at the landscapes and scale of the environments and set pieces. I'm so happy I stuck with it and so happy that I was wrong. 

Original review:
""This is a gorgeous Star Wars game. The environments are breathtaking and the atmosphere is spot on. My main issue with this game, and this absolutely comes down to personal preference, is the difficulty of combat. When people mention this is a souls-like they're correct. The combat is almost entirely reliant on parries and dodges. I do not enjoy souls combat and even on the easiest difficulty I find this game to be very frustrating. In my opinion, as others have pointed out, I am a Jedi with a sword made of pure energy and as such I shouldn't have to worry about constantly being on guard against nearly every enemy in the game. Enemies are almost always on par or far more powerful than myself. The various planet's denizens and wildlife are given flavor text via discoverable journal entries that explain away their resistance to lightsabers in the vain of ""this powerful creature has a heavy outer shell that makes it naturally resistant to lightsaber strikes."" If I remember correctly, Luke in the original trilogy had no problem slicing off a certain giant white beast's arm with a single swipe of his blade. I'm not asking for every thing that crosses my path to be made of cardboard, however, having the lower-mid level enemies be more creative in their approach when sizing up a Jedi and then having higher level enemies posing a larger threat would have been appreciated.

I do plan to slog through the game simply on its merit of being a beautiful world and I want to experience that part. My word of caution is to avoid this altogether if you don't like ""souls-like"" combat.""",1687534771,1688860038,True,0,0,0.537513077259063721,0,True,False,False

The platforming feels horrible, and this is a platformer.
So far the puzzles are mediocre
I was stuck on the first planet for an hour because of the horrible level design and because I was attempting to do things that you can only do after you unlocked stuff on other planets.
So far my experience wasn't good. I will probably finish the game because I got nothing else to do and because I want to see why everyone liked it so much.
The story is pretty meh as well.

Level design is really bad. The 3d map is bad to navigate and doesn't help at all.
And for some reason you have to collect memories and scan enemies. The memories arent even that good and you learn almost nothing about lore. Scan the Storm trooper. Scan the storm trooper with a baton, scan the storm trooper with a Bazooka, scan the storm trooper with a patch on the side.

If you are a Star Wars fan looking for a great story and visuals, and gameplay that doesn't overstay it's welcome this is a great option.

If you are more interested in combat/exploration I think there are better choices for either of those (souls, elden, newer zeldas ect) I enjoyed this game while it lasted, I do not have the urge to 100% it and feel satisfied with the unlocks I found while progressing.

Combat and progression are ripped straight from Dark Souls, but much more floaty.  If you really want DS type combat, just play DS as this is not as tight and nowhere near as good.

The platforming and jumping puzzles just aren't for me, which sadly are what most of the game is about.

A good atmosphere and passable combat mostly brought down by incessant jumping puzzles and platform sliding.

Graphics are nice, but on PC Port some shaders or filters cause fps drops even on really good spec machine, making it not optimized for PC. I am glad I can use non-xbox controller through steam input, because X-Box controllers aren't any good. Game itself was made for different platform, so port and configurations on PC are at fault. 

Gameplay wise it is fun to play, however gets repetative after some time. Imo game lacks interactions with neutral NPCs and non-action moments, like markets, walking amid cities, using force in conversations and such, but well, we can't have everything. As the game is, it is okay to play it and it is enjoyable. 

If I had to score it I would give it maybe 8/10 or more like 75/100 . It is a good game to play if you like Star Wars, but that's it. 

Standard mode with most stuff completed in 26h so not longest time for game either.

This game was not worth to buy at full price, I wouldn't pay more than 5-10 Euro for this game, as game is too short to pay more imo and doesn't bring enough features like customisation to consider it being worth more, in my opinion. I bought the game for few Euro, don't remember if it was 4 or 5 but would not recommend buying for more. Same with next game in the serie, I will not buy unless 5Euro or more, seeing that next serie is basically same thing as this game.",1688309284,1688820557,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game was challenging and the upgrades you get over the course of the game make combat and exploration very fun. It was fun to see a section of the map you can't get to, then getting a power up and thinking, ""I need to go back to X to see what is up there"".

One complaint is that the map system sucks, especially if you are like me and want to 100% each area for achievements. I had to pull up videos multiple times because I had no idea where to go and the map just looks like a blue blob.

It is also annoying to not have any fast travel system. I usually hate fast travelling in games, but this is not an open world game, it is very linear parkour, combat, and puzzles. If you do it once, doing it again just feels boring. Plus, there were many times where I completed an area, left, only to realize I didn't pick up a seed or something and had to travel all the way back.

Those two issues are only problems for people that are looking to 100% the game and find every little collectible. If you just want to play for the story, then these won't negatively impact your experience much.",1688682552,1688682552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.

I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone.

[Modified English variant] – You can call me Yoshikage Kira. I’m currently 33 years old. Not that you’d care, but I reside in northeast Morioh’s villa district. Also, I’ve yet to marry. In order to make a living, I work for Kame Yu department stores. After a long day’s work, I return home no later than 8 PM. I don’t like smoking, but do enjoy the occasional drink. I’m always in bed by 11 PM, and I make it a point to get no less than 8 hours of sleep each night. Before bed, I drink a warm glass of milk. It’s always coupled with 20 minutes of stretching to decompress from the long workday. Sweet dreams are the usual result of this.

I then awake as refreshed and recharged as a newborn child, ready to take on the day’s challenges. And after my last checkup, I was given a clean bill of health. For as long as I could remember, I’ve done everything in my power to live a productive life that allows me to pursue a lasting inner peace. This may be a foreign concept, but I choose not to concern myself with winning or losing, life’s troubles, or enemies who bring sleepless nights. That is how I cope with this backwards life we find ourselves living. It’s what brings me happiness in a world fraught with hardship and misery.

Jedi: Fallen Order managed to beat the odds and be a single player game from EA that isn't just good, it's great! At it's core it's an odd mix of platforming, metroidvania style level design and souls-like combat. All covered in a coat of Star Wars paint with a good dose of spit and polish. It's hard as nails at times, but it rewards those that persist and learn to dance to it's tunes. 

Storywise: meet Cal Kestis, former Jedi padawan turned scrapper. Avoiding trouble, hiding his powers and lightsabre from the empire until all the empire comes for him and he's left with nowhere to run. Cal's a very likable guy. A good kid with a lot of endearing qualities and the crew of the Stinger Mantis, the ship that saves him certain doom, are as well. If only the game gave these people room to breathe and be people for a bit. The story goes at a breakneck pace at times, giving little room for fluff. Yet it manages to put together a cast that I enjoyed and wanted more of by the end. The game lets the characters breathe during the last third and it allows the voice cast to shine. The potential for awesome storytelling is here, Respawn just need to embrace it. 

Audio and visuals wise: it's a big budget tripple A game. it's gorgeous and the devs know it. Jedi: Fallen Order will make you pause and admire the view from time to time and it never fails at making me go: ""Dang, that's pretty."" The physics and AI get wonky at times, but I can excuse it. 

All in all: a game that's worth the money and is on sale more often than it is not. Go for it if you enjoy Star Wars and if you don't, then this might just be your step into that universe.",1688608364,1688608364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good;
- Amazing audio / music / soundtrack. For me, it really made the game. 
- I'm not much of a story person in games, but I actually enjoyed it. Admittedly, I was forced into watching everything, as you can't skip scenes. But it was a tidy, straightforward narrative. 
- Graphics were really good. I ran on ultra. 
- No bugs / crashes etc
- Loved the dynamic between me and BD bot. 

The meh;
- Combat. I found the responsiveness of the combat very sluggish and frustrating. Although the combat was challenging at times, it was a good balance on the whole. The variety of attacks / powers was nice, and you can set up some fun combos. 
- Map design. Very linear. 
- Good length of game. Took me 38 hours to 100%. 

The bad;
- Chests. Collecting stuff from chests was really underwhelming. Didn't add anything. Just a few bits you can customise the look of things. Yawn. 
- Backtracking. The linear nature of the maps makes you retrace your steps. This can be a massive chore. The shortcuts don't often help much. Added to this, that maps can be a bit of a rabbit warren, and it wasn't fun navigating around them. 
- Map / No compass. I get lost easily. I found having no compass made for a lot of confusion on which direction i was going. The map I also found to be quite tricky to read on a number of occasions.

Introduction:
Jedi Fallen Order is a game that left me incredibly dissatisfied, making me regret not doing more research before purchasing it. As someone who despises the Uncharted series, I found this game to be a continuation of the same formula, with frustrating levels filled with nonsensical climbing and jumping. Moreover, the design choices for the lightsabers and helmets were particularly unimpressive. In my opinion, the game failed to offer anything innovative, and I will have to rely on extensive modding to rectify the disappointing choices made in character development.

Gameplay:
One of the major aspects that left me disenchanted with Jedi Fallen Order was its gameplay. The levels were nothing short of asinine, with endless climbing and jumping sequences that felt forced and lacking in creativity. Instead of providing engaging and varied challenges, the game seemed to prioritize repetitive platforming mechanics that quickly grew tiresome. This monotony ultimately diminished my enthusiasm and made the overall experience feel tedious.

Design Choices:
Perhaps one of the most glaring disappointments in Jedi Fallen Order was the design of the lightsabers and helmets. As a fan of the original Star Wars movies, I believe that the lightsaber is an iconic weapon that should be revered and respected. However, the game decided to deviate from this timeless design by introducing lightsabers that looked outright ridiculous. The overly elaborate and impractical designs failed to capture the essence of what made lightsabers so compelling in the first place.

Character Development:
The choices made regarding character development in Jedi Fallen Order left much to be desired. The game's characters lacked depth and failed to engage me emotionally. Their motivations felt shallow, and their interactions were often uninteresting. To salvage the experience, I will need to resort to heavy modding, seeking to enhance the characters and their stories to create a more immersive and enjoyable gameplay experience.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Jedi Fallen Order was a letdown for me. Its gameplay relied on tired mechanics, the design choices for lightsabers and helmets were unimpressive, and the character development left much to be desired. While original ideas are commendable, they must still pay homage to the iconic elements that define a beloved franchise like Star Wars. Unfortunately, this game fell short in that regard. If you, like me, have reservations about Uncharted-style games and expect a more faithful representation of the Star Wars universe, I recommend researching extensively before investing in Jedi Fallen Order.",1593925085,1688438607,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

- There is no camera speed option. It is a little too slow for me personally and there is no option to increase the camera rotation speed.
- The game does not appear to be optimized. Messing with the video options hasn't improved it all that much and that was with everything on epic as a default.
- The camera gets locked into a certain position in some situations and it is awkward to maneuver during those moments.

This game is like a mashup of Dark Souls and Star Wars. Prepare for some serious dying (and swearing), but it's all part of the Jedi training, right? The combat is all about precision, timing, and having the reflexes of a Jedi cat on caffeine. It's less about power trips and more like a dance-off with laser swords. So fun, yet frustratingly addictive!

And forget about the typical lightsaber-wielding experience where you're an unstoppable force of nature. In Jedi: Fallen Order, you'll feel like a scrappy underdog trying to survive in a galaxy far, far away.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, despite the occasional urge to unleash my inner Sith Lord on my poor controller. It's a fresh take on the lightsaber-wielding experience, where precision and timing matter more than flashy moves. So, fellow Jedi enthusiasts, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

But that's far from the truth, lots of people are craving for great story driven & amazing combat single player game. And while this game has some flaws, it's one of those great games!

This is a strictly single player classic star wars with accurate and loyal lore. It's kinda open world with different beautiful and lively biomes but still a bit linear-ish. It has a strong cast - every one of them is impactful and memorable, love their interactions!

This game has a a fast and challenging combat, esp on higher difficulties. It's very similar to dark souls mechanics at the fundamental level but also has fun and unique differences.

However, while the game does have its strong points, it falls short in several key areas, leaving much to be desired.

One aspect that left a significant impact on the gameplay experience was the repetitive nature of the game's structure. The pattern of engaging in a lengthy parkour sequence, followed by a puzzle, a quick skirmish with easily defeated enemies, and ultimately a boss fight became monotonous and predictable. The lack of variation in this regard diminished the excitement and sense of exploration that players expect from a game of this genre.

The parkour sequences, though intended to be challenging, ultimately felt excessively long and cumbersome. Maneuvering the protagonist, Cal, proved to be a frustrating experience due to his stiff and unresponsive controls. Furthermore, the color cues used to guide the player's path were often unclear, leading to unnecessary confusion and causing players to rely on the map frequently to ensure they were moving in the right direction.

The puzzles in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order provided a mixed bag of simplicity and difficulty. While some puzzles offered a satisfying challenge that required players to showcase their problem-solving skills, others felt too simplistic and failed to provide a sense of accomplishment. It's worth noting that the gratification derived from successfully completing the more intricate puzzles was a highlight of the gameplay experience.

Where the game truly falters is in its combat system. The lightsaber, a weapon that should feel powerful and iconic, unfortunately feels more akin to a toothpick in the hands of Cal. The limited repertoire of combat moves available to the protagonist left the combat encounters feeling stale and repetitive. While there might be more interesting moves hidden within the game, they often require the use of a power bar that depletes rapidly. This poor balance between the usage of powers and their limited availability led to frustration and hindered the overall enjoyment of combat.

Adding insult to injury, the decision to incorporate a Souls-like gameplay style into Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order feels misplaced. The punishing difficulty of boss fights can quickly turn into a torturous experience for players. Rather than enhancing the game's immersion and enjoyment, the challenging nature of these encounters can often feel unfair and unbalanced.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order falls short of its potential due to its repetitive gameplay structure, clunky parkour mechanics, and frustrating combat system. While the game offers moments of satisfaction through well-designed puzzles, these are overshadowed by the game's shortcomings. Ultimately, the decision to incorporate a Souls-like experience into a Star Wars game feels misguided and detracts from the overall enjoyment.

Friends, when it comes to Star Wars, I don't know a single person who doesn't remember a billion movies from this series and especially several games that were released. Although they weren't all that great (Battlefront 2), they were still quite fun to play. However, in 2019, the series got its first really great game, which enjoyed criticism and popularity all over the world, and honestly Respawn Studio, which is behind games like Apex Legends and their most famous Titanfall series. But this was quite an unexpected step, so how does the game affect me?

[b] Story [/b]

In the game, you take on the role of Cal Kestis, a scavenger on a planet occupied by the Empire, but you soon find out that Cal is actually not just any scavenger, but a Padawan from the Jedi Order who was exterminated after Order 66 (Thanks to Sidius), however, after you fight with the Inquisitors you will find one ex-jedi knight and one small veteran pilot who will be with you on your journey to restore the Jedi order, which is cool and I liked it, however, you will be faced with many challenges and mainly puzzles on your way, such as I probably never expected the connection, yes, there is the Tomb Raider series, which has been doing this since its inception, but even so, I would never have expected this in a Star Wars game. It's like you take Lara Croft, put her in the Male gender, give her a Lightsaber and move her into the Star Wars world, quite an unexpected but pleasant surprise.

[b] Gameplay [/b]

As I mentioned, this game has a really specific gameplay, which is probably clear to everyone and, above all, has already been familiar. However, what is interesting is that even as a Padawan, Cal had to hide and could not use his abilities, which also caused him to forget some abilities, such as Throwing, Pulling or even Double Jump? Well it's Star Wars we won't go into it. However, the further you are in the game, the more Cal remembers and gets his abilities back and it's really cool, but it can happen that you will be in a location where there is a Crate with accessories (which you only collect as cosmetics, there's nothing interesting about it) but you can't to get there, because you don't have a given ability to get there, so you'll have to wait until Cal remembers it and then if you remember that you left something in a location... It's crazy, but whatever. However, that's not all, for every Scanned enemy, element, item or for every killed enemy, you gain Skill Points and with those you buy upgrades to Cal's abilities. More health, Bigger Force bar, more health regeneration, interesting tricks with your Lightsaber, but there's just enough of it. To be honest, you can get all the abilities by completing the game, but you have to explore the whole world, which takes time, but it's worth it (I finished the game 5 times). However, if you couldn't do it, there is one more cool option and that is that after completing the game you will unlock New Game+ where you start from the beginning (How else) but you have all the skills you learned from the last game, which is great. However, the enemies are a bit more experienced and a lot more annoying enemies are spawned (so enjoy).

[b] Optimization [/b]

As for the optimization of the game itself, I have to admit that the developers really cared (Not like in Jedi Survivor, where the game runs at 30FPS). But seriously, this game has really great Optimization, I played the game on Ultra at 60FPS and above, so I don't see any big problem with the Optimization or the technical side of the game. The only thing that is a bit of a problem is the Dathomir location where, despite the settings, I had slight tearing and microlags which is not exactly great but it was nothing terrible, subtract a few more bugs or poorly responding terrain and you have your opinion. Some locations have really ""interesting"" terrain on which you climb, you either hardly see it or you jump on it and the game lets you fall off the map (AC Unity style).

[b] Conclusion [/b]

However, if you've ever thought about buying this game for me I can highly recommend it, in the whole 208 hours I wasn't bored once and it really is a ride from start to finish, mainly what's interesting about this game so if you really like Star Wars so this game won't let you go even for a moment, for me I was able to last a maximum of 6 hours straight, because I needed a break (Maybe it was because it was already 1AM in the morning). Well, try it, try it, if you don't like the game or it's not your style, the Steam refund system exists and you can return the game, but I think it's really not a waste of money for this game even at full price.

[b] PROS AND CONS [/b]
✔ Beautiful Graphics
✔ Skill system
✔ Variety of Enemies
✔ Great Optimization
✔ Easy to learn Hard to Master

✘ Enviroment bugs
✘ Dathomir is more poorly optimized

If I'm being picky, more variety in the customisation of attire would be appreciated because it's just a whole lot of ponchos and gave little incentive to go out and explore for unlocks. Having said this, it's purely aesthetic and not a barrier to enjoying the game.

I did find that the standard difficulty level was incredibly high, so ended up playing the game on the easiest mode to progress but the fact that this was available was great and allowed me to enjoy the game. 

New mechanics continued to be introduced at a good rate and long after I expected them to end. This was a nice surprise as I progressed through the game

It's not revolutionary but it's a lot of fun, combining many great mechanics from the same type of games you know and love - plus a bit of Star Wars on top and ta-dah! If you love Star Wars, you'll love this game.",1688140873,1688140873,True,2,0,0.542253553867340088,0,True,False,False

They also force so much boring game play over and over. For instance having to SLOWLY get back to a boss from a save point. They know you'll die but put the save point so far away. No baddies to fight, just walking and boredom. Re-spawn right where we need to be when it's clearly a battle you're expected to die a few times to figure out the mechanics. Graphics are great. Story is interesting so far. I added dodge and some force moves to separate mouse buttons to help with the bad controls in combat. Why do I need a controller with my PC? It isn't a console. With that said, I highly recommend a mouse with extra buttons. 

It is a pretty short game. I was able to complete the game with 95% completion in about 20 hours on Jedi Knight. There is an extra combat mode available after you beat the story that is challenging but I doubt I'll pick it back up now that I've completed it. Not a lot of replay value at all for me. I'd just be running around looking for cosmetics and I'm not too concerned with that at all. You can't even notice most of them when you're playing. Light saber color is about the only thing I can see cosmetically. The ponchos look like trash bags and there's only 5 outfits. Coloring the ship is ok but you hardly see it. Customizing the light saber is cool but I forget all about it once I'm back playing. Like I said, the color is the only thing you'll notice. I did take my time exploring so I found most items the first run. The map is good at showing you where you can and cannot go as you unlock abilities. I had maxed my abilities by the time I got to the end battle. Some have had to grind for a few ability points but I didn't find leveling up difficult.

To summarize. It was definitely created for consoles and the port to PC wasn't great. With a ""gaming"" mouse it will make the combat more fun. It's short and re-playability is low. If you want a decent single player game that won't eat a lot of time this is a pretty good choice.",1687371368,1688054281,True,0,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False

It has satisfying combat, parry and dodge is so great to pull off. Yanking and pushing enemies never gets old, yanking especially woth one hit strike after. Really puts you in the shoes of a badass jedi, if you are good at the combat tho.

Enemies are varied enough, each one have its own strategy to defeat. And boss fights are a test of skill that is so rewarding to beat. Just like a boss fight should be.

Characters are great especially the interaction. The last companion doesnt have much time to interact with other crewmembers but i believe it will expand in its sequel.

Level design is great, a lot of shortcuts traversal ppint to acces each sub-area. although some areas require long bact-tracking but story-wise, it's unavoidable.

The plot is interesting, and Cal's character is attractive and fun to play. The difficulty curve (if you can call it that way) is good, and progressing while discovering your ancient powers is definitely rewarding. Opponents benefits from many detailed patterns and skins as the characters design appear to be one of the most gorgeous point about this game (not especially for Cere though). Special thanks for the Bounty Hunters here and there! 'Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order' is beautiful and you will never realize, except for this game, that five planets are too few to explore. The lore and the universe are fully respected. It is a pleasure to evolve in such a colourful, complex and varied worlds. The main opponents (the Empire) are amazingly represented and evoke huge powers. The music and soundesign are gorgeous. The game offers diverse difficulty levels. It feels like being a game held by strong ambitions and all things considered, well executed.

On the other hand, there are many buggy incomprehensions as when Cal's lightsaber goes through the environment without any damage (referring to the workbench as well as other structures or objects). This goes with many collision and texture bugs and walls you can go through as you get closer to the borders of the maps. Things are made to look good when they are far away, don't try to interact with what you see in the distance. There are way too many collectibles for such a short game (the main story lasts for something like 15 hours) and you are not even rewarded for gathering all the useless objects around the whole galaxy (these are just skins and dreadful paintings). Don't fall into the trap of the deuxe version as I did because wow, this is a void of content. The cutscenes are numerous and sadly unskippable. If they do bring some depth to the story they also are full of conveniences and pathetic dialogues. If, as I've said, planets are fun to explore, they're much less fun to navigate using the mini-map, which is a real nightmare. I can't see how they could have done it better though but it still remains very hard to use properly. And why not using fast travels? Aren't the camps made to do that? The game takes years to launch, as well as going from a planet to another: don't expect to play for less than 20 minutes on this one. But in the end it is not worse than this last inconvenient: you have to use the EA launcher AND be connected to the internet in order to play, even if you have the game (as me) only on Steam! I didn't count the number of times I had to restart my PC just because the EA launcher didn't let me play... Such a mess.",1687808045,1687808045,True,6,0,0.589945733547210693,0,True,False,False

Hopefully, giving it enough time for patches and fixes to optimize it as best as possible in the process hence, the later review. I remember this game was well received and a pleasant surprise from EA's usual live service affairs. So, imagine my shock to see it on sale for $5. Never been a big fan of Star Wars and I had crossed out EA (among others) completely from my personal list after Dragon Age: Inquisition, one of the lamest RPGs I have ever played prior to Andromeda's debut, the combination was something I would simply ignore. However, Fallen Order being a well reviewed, triple A, single player title created by none other than Respawn for five bucks was too much of a deal to pass up and I jumped on it. The sequel is out and making the rounds with feedback of much needed optimization, I figured this would be the perfect time to play the original and find out if its worth pursuing the maligned sequel. The short conclusion is that I am glad I only paid $5. 

Unlike other games, you are not playing a master Jedi with powerful skills, capable of taking out a handful of enemies at once, you are instead playing as Cal Kestis, a Padawan that had his training cut short as soon as order 66 was initiated, forcing him to go into hiding in a remote planet as a scavenger breaking down warships. At best, Cal is an average Jedi, both in skill and power and this is well translated through the Souls like combat in place. While capable of dispatching lowly vermin or a regular trooper, encountering anything slightly above generally ends up being a challenging endeavor that borders on feeling like a boss fight. Cal starts out very fragile, only able to sustain a few hits but his capabilities can be improved over time as you gather experience points to invest in his skill tree but that sense of fragility never goes away so you always have to approach every encounter with some care. Much like the Souls games, defeat is inevitable and you are penalized by losing all of your accrued experience points but the game marks the enemy that killed you as a chance to gain back what you have lost if you manage to strike it once. But all too often the game tends to glitch and does not mark the enemy upon respawn, making the loss of your exp permanent making the experience feel rather unfair at certain points. Combat is also not based on your relative position and requires to player to press the right button to evade an attack, even if you managed to evade an attack by pressing jump instead of dodge the game tends to rubberband you back in position to take the hit. To add to this, enemies sink into the ground or randomly jump into the sky and the odd stutter during a wall run can lead to cheap deaths. At one point Cal's jump doesn't have the distance to clear a gap between slides and you are fixed into a loop where he continually falls to his death failing the jump. Cinematics also tend to stutter everytime the camera changes angle and the culmination of it all can lead to a very frustrating experience, especially on harder levels.  

I also think the Souls like combat wasn't well implemented or the devs didn't think things through beyond cashing in on the latest trends. While the combat difficulty can be acceptable, enemies re-spawning at rest points does not make sense since this is not a grind heavy game. Characters in Souls games can indefinitely keep leveling up and upgrade their attributes where Cal has a set amount of skills after which gaing exp has no purpose and it gets quite exhausting as you have to once again clear areas full of enemies that you had already killed. The rewards for exploration also feels anemic as you mostly unlock alternate costumes and skins with no real ingame benefits. All in all the game is a hodgepodge mess of ideas that doesn't compliment each other well with the concept of the actual game. Its not all bad, the story is quite interesting and the VO are well done but you will have to suffer through the rough gameplay to experience it.   

4 years after launch this game still suffers from issues that it did at launch and its sequel is much the same. As such I find it difficult to recommend this game at full price and would advise anyone to wait for another steep discount prior to purchasing the title. I am just lucky to have only paid five bucks for this game, any higher I would probably much more livid with its performance.",1687797583,1687797583,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being a single father to my 16-year-old son hasn't always been easy, especially with his busy schedule of hanging out with friends or endlessly scrolling through TikTok videos. It was becoming increasingly challenging for us to find common ground and spend quality time together.

My son had already experienced the wonders of Jedi: Fallen Order before, and he had shared stories of his adventures with me. Intrigued and hoping to connect with him through the game, I decided to make a Steam account and get the game for myself.

As I loaded into the game and started playing, I found myself in awe of the immersive world and intricate gameplay mechanics. However, I soon encountered moments of confusion, unsure of the best way to progress. Seeing my struggle, my son stepped in and offered his expertise, guiding me through the challenges and helping me uncover the game's secrets.

Playing Jedi: Fallen Order alongside my son was a truly remarkable experience. We laughed, strategized, and immersed ourselves in the captivating storyline together. It became a shared adventure, strengthening our bond and creating precious memories reminiscent of the joy we used to have when my wife was still alive.

This game not only provided us with countless hours of entertainment but also served as a powerful reminder of the importance of spending quality time together. It rekindled our connection and reminded us that, regardless of age, there are incredible experiences to be shared and enjoyed as a family.

I really wanted a successor to Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and while this definitely does scratch the itch of playing as a Padawan finding their place in the Force, the controls and combat animations leave a lot to be desired. Combat does not feel fluid, and while the forced animations do look good visually, it means you are unable to enjoy much freedom as you are unable to cancel animations so you're locked into this clunky dance with the AI that can be pretty hit or miss at times.

Furthermore, there are a ton of powers that are missing that you may have grown accustomed to from other Jedi games, which makes this one feel underwhelming. However, the saber combat tends to make up for that as its pivotal role in your limited arsenal.

The start is also rather rough, as the game does not give any hint as to whether or not you will be able to get improved powers, so starting areas are rather frustrating since you are locked out of exploring parts of the map due to not being able to, for example, scale a wall just out of reach. It is only half-way through the game that you truly unlock what should be a ""base kit"" of a Jedi to actually start playing the game normally.

As for maps themselves, it is nothing more than a glorified linear platformer that allows you to unlock shortcuts along the way that feed into the loop that eventually comprises of the ""open world"". You will revisit worlds, and there will be backtracking, but the gorgeous scenery sure does keep things interesting!

With those issues out of the way, the story was riveting and the environments exceptional! Character detail was incredible, with audio feeling as if you were watching the movies themselves.

All in all, if you are looking for a polished Star Wars combat-focused game, this is not it. But if you're looking for a solid world-building lore-based story experience, this ties perfectly into the original movie trilogy.

The graphics are beautiful, amazing protagonist and antagonists, all the characters were memorable in the game which I love. The level design is good but since you have to backtrack a lot if you want to get everything, navigating the map was a bit of a nightmare. I was very disappointed to find out there isn't any fast travel between meditation points. The game was a decent challenge on the hardest difficulty but once again, groups of smaller weaker enemies sometimes pose a bigger threat than an actual boss due to numbers and just spam attacking, all the boss fights were very enjoyable however. 

Overall I would definitely recommend this game to almost anyone, the only difficulty is navigating around so as long as you are not completely new to games then I'd say to give this a try.",1687360601,1687360601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. the lagging, its a single player game and it has lag? i have an alienware laptop which runs any game at full spec and this game ran like crap.

2. the collectables were trash, so not worth the time and effort to find them, just different colours nothing more, no other outfits for your character, just lame ponchos.

3. the maps were a total maze leaving you running in circles for hours just to find a container you missed,  when a map has  multiple routs you can take you need to have the ability to set markers on your map to lead you to the area you are trying to revisit.

4.  force push and double jump wasn't unlocked until very late in the game, which meant a lot of areas of the maps couldn't be accessed until then, forcing you to have to go back to each map and spend hours trying to re-find all the chests you couldn't get before, only to end up getting lost going in circles.

5. your force powers and combat moves were pretty basic, especially compared to the bosses and your force meter was too hard to fill, you could only do 3 or 4 force attacks and your meter would be empty but the bosses can just spam force attacks on you.

6. the bosses have so many moves that you cant block or parry, forcing you to just dash away and throw your lightsaber, which i found to be the best way to defeat bosses due to the incredibly hard parry timing.

7. there was no indication given that when the final planet became available if you travelled there then that was it, the game would lead to the end and you wont have a chance to revisit any of the other worlds.

8. many puzzles were just frustrating, having to force push a ball at the exact right angle to push it into the correct spot, made me want to yeet my laptop off a cliff.

9. half the game your crew talk about some creature on board your ship and you never find it and there is no conclusion on it, i saw it once hiding under the navigation holo desk and that was it, there seemed to be no point in it.

10. there seemed to be no point in collecting the seeds also.

Overall i found this game more tedious and frustrating rather than fun, compared to the force unleashed games this was terrible.
After completing the game you get 1 different outfit and still cant skip cut scenes, pathetic.
uninstall and never play it again is what i will do and there is no chance in hell that i will fork out $120 for the new game.",1687262577,1687262577,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For starters  to get from one section to the next you must complete puzzles which can be fun at first but as you play and enjoy the story they become more tedious. I can see why hardcore gamers love it but for casual people unless you want to look up a guide every 30 minutes so you can beat it, its not worth the time. Also lots of screen tearing and optimization issues. EA blotware is mandatory at all times. 

After completing the game I will say it gets better if you look up guides and skip the puzzles and play for the story. However it still falls flat until the last three missions. Then you get some guts and action the game ends and you're hyped for the next one to continue the story forward. Only problem.... its $70 and has numerous bugs. See if you can get a combo pack for cheap and play both.  Anything more than $30 for this is a waste.

However, while the game does have its strong points, it falls short in several key areas, leaving much to be desired.

One aspect that left a significant impact on the gameplay experience was the repetitive nature of the game's structure. The pattern of engaging in a lengthy parkour sequence, followed by a puzzle, a quick skirmish with easily defeated enemies, and ultimately a boss fight became monotonous and predictable. The lack of variation in this regard diminished the excitement and sense of exploration that players expect from a game of this genre.

The parkour sequences, though intended to be challenging, ultimately felt excessively long and cumbersome. Maneuvering the protagonist, Cal, proved to be a frustrating experience due to his stiff and unresponsive controls. Furthermore, the color cues used to guide the player's path were often unclear, leading to unnecessary confusion and causing players to rely on the map frequently to ensure they were moving in the right direction.

The puzzles in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order provided a mixed bag of simplicity and difficulty. While some puzzles offered a satisfying challenge that required players to showcase their problem-solving skills, others felt too simplistic and failed to provide a sense of accomplishment. It's worth noting that the gratification derived from successfully completing the more intricate puzzles was a highlight of the gameplay experience.

Where the game truly falters is in its combat system. The lightsaber, a weapon that should feel powerful and iconic, unfortunately feels more akin to a toothpick in the hands of Cal. The limited repertoire of combat moves available to the protagonist left the combat encounters feeling stale and repetitive. While there might be more interesting moves hidden within the game, they often require the use of a power bar that depletes rapidly. This poor balance between the usage of powers and their limited availability led to frustration and hindered the overall enjoyment of combat.

Adding insult to injury, the decision to incorporate a Souls-like gameplay style into Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order feels misplaced. The punishing difficulty of boss fights can quickly turn into a torturous experience for players. Rather than enhancing the game's immersion and enjoyment, the challenging nature of these encounters can often feel unfair and unbalanced.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order falls short of its potential due to its repetitive gameplay structure, clunky parkour mechanics, and frustrating combat system. While the game offers moments of satisfaction through well-designed puzzles, these are overshadowed by the game's shortcomings. Ultimately, the decision to incorporate a Souls-like experience into a Star Wars game feels misguided and detracts from the overall enjoyment.

And gameplay wise, the intro did not disappoint: fighting stormtroopers atop a moving train in a mecha space world set the bar very high. Too high. I bought this game for $5 because it looked cool and did no background research on the combat, so I had no clue it mimicked the Soulsborne games with no checkpoint/saves apart from 'bonfires' (meditation circles in this game). Apart from combat feeling clunky in an AC Odyssey kind of way (effective parry timing feels so hard, enemies can kill you in the middle of a healing animation, it can take several presses for the heal button to even register) and the dodge button (tap not once but TWICE???) feeling majorly unnatural and tiring for the fingers, dying in Fallen Order can set you back a while and severely interrupt the flow. It just doesn't work with the amount of cinematics going on. Autosaves would have been a much better save system overall. That said, there are a ton of neat moves to unlock, and though the protagonist Cal doesn't really feel Jedi-like at the start, it becomes much more fun to control him by the end, issues notwithstanding. Plus slicing through droids and wiping out enemies looks so slick in those slow motion scenes.

There's quite a bit of puzzle solving here, I've seen comparisons to Tomb Raider but no definitely not, the puzzles in Fallen Order feel a bit more repetitive and TR, Rise and Shadow did it better overall. Still, Respawn did a good job of balancing puzzles with combat and exploration and they were a nice reprieve from mashing sabers and dying over and over in battle with hostile creatures. Speaking of difficulty, I played this game on normal (Jedi Knight) even though I started off on hard because I couldn't acclimatise to the parry timing or the tendency of the dodge button to fail, and here's the interesting part: even though Fallen Order had lost its lustre beyond the introduction and felt extremely tedious with its lack of fast travel features, I stuck with it, and the development of the story ultimately swayed me into enjoying it again. If you're the sort of person who enjoys complex characters, Fallen Order has some genuinely good redemption arcs.

I think the main issue with this game is the fact that it's a great story with (mostly) great characters that is dragged down by its gameplay, combat, and level design. The story is well written, though predictable and on the safe side, that is pushed along by a great cast of protagonists and antagonists. Making this game's plot canon gives weight to its connection with mainline characters and events occurring in the galaxy not long after the founding of the Galactic Empire. Character motivations are clear and logical, including the lore reason why the main character, despite being trained in the Jedi arts, needs to relearn skills (a nice touch).

However, this game's biggest failing is stretching itself too thin with its gameplay loop, combat, and level design. The game has 3 hats that it likes to wear: Metroidvania, Souls-like Action RPG, and Story-Driven Adventure. Sometimes, this trio works, but most of the time it makes the game a mess and/or the execution fails. 

For the Metroidvania aspects, the game is rather light and instead likes to *pretend* that it is a Metroidvania. Many parts of the map require backtracking once the main character gains skills and powers, which means you will visit locations multiple times for loot alone, not to mention story (one location excluding the hub world requires at least 2 return trips after the initial mission due to the story). Metroid Prime did this with locations requiring multiple return trips because of the story, but Fallen Order does not have the same flare and execution by showing story progression and change in the world. No matter if it's your first or fifteenth time, the same enemies will be in the same places. Mobs don't get stronger or change. The only differences that the world shows are more open doors and more corridors. They're are many other games that utilize return locales with much better execution, so it only feels like padded runtime rather than for interesting reasons. The reason why runtimes feel padded is that many of the Metroidvania/Souls-like ""shortcuts"" that you create only reduce traversal by a small amount. Additionally, ""exploration"" in this game hardly requires venturing anywhere far off the main pathway and instead just ""going down the other tunnel."" Again, it stretches itself too thin by trying to be a Metroidvania without realizing how many Metroidvanias require going off the beaten path for a long time, solving puzzles, or beating optional bosses that require more than an additional 2% effort on the player's part. There are a few great puzzles to get additional loot, but ""few"" is the operative word. If you make the majority of your puzzles as difficult as ""find the glowing thing"" as if it's an Assassin's Creed game from 20 years ago, you are not making puzzles, just an object to interact with.

The game is very cinematic with many well-rendered, albeit often poorly optimized, cutscenes with stutter as they are frequently used as loading screens. The cutscenes, when not used as a loading screen, run smoothly and are a great break to the combat and mediocre exploration. Some of these cutscenes and interactions are also an attempt to put on another hat...an RPG with a morality system; however, the devs must have forgotten about it halfway through because it think there are only a total of a dozen interactions where the player has agency in the choice of dialogue. To make things worse, these dialogue options make no impact on the story, only there for the player to interact just in case they...get bored...I guess. These cutscenes, along with the Nathan Drake-style map traversal gives it the Story-Driven Adventure aspect to the game, complete with the totally not obvious paint on all of the ledges for you to climb on and illogical placements for walls that the character can wall-run. Many of these aspects matter little to the overall scheme of the game and oftentimes only serve as roadblocks to help with the poorly executed Metroidvania aspects that require some skill to unlock first. To make matters worse, the Metroidvania and Nathan Drake-style combine together to turn into moderately filled arenas with trash mobs with a few interspersed special enemies connected by empty corridors. So if the empty corridors are just filler between arenas, how is the combat?

Like the rest of this game...poorly executed. The game tries to be both an Adventure game and a Souls-like with its combat and somehow took only the worst possible aspects of both. Many of the trash enemies take only a couple of uninteresting hits from your lightsaber even in the beginning of the game, which means by the end when you have unlocked all the additional skills, health, and damage, these are not even worth fighting because you just want to get to the next story beat. Because most arenas have only a few interesting enemies to fight, the combat gets boring and monotonous really quick. The combat system utilizes a dodge roll, parry, block, and skills, which is common with Souls-like games. What it fails to realize is that the system is designed as if the game is difficult and requires strategic thinking like a From Software game when instead the devs should have realized that they should award the player with aggression given the relatively small healthbars of most enemies and many of the enemies using telegraphed attacks that take a 132 step pre-flight check and 4 business days to complete. Almost all enemies have a stagger meter that can only be broken by 2 things: certain force powers and parrying. This means that you either spend 50% or more of combat waiting for the chance to parry or you spam force powers so you don't fall asleep. Many enemies that have stagger meters shouldn't even have them because they have less HP than the total number of strikes, skills, or parries to stagger them. Because the trash mobs take so little to kill, it makes the parry system worthless. To add insult to injury, bosses throughout the first two-thirds of the game *require* the player to parry and drop the boss' stagger bar to zero before being able to do decent damage. The boss fights in the first two-thirds of the game are the only real satisfying combat sequences because they actually require quick reflexes and using the parries to get to a damage sequence. The problem is in the last Act of the game, where most bosses have un-blockable and un-parryable attacks, which means you are forced to either wait even more time between parries and blocks or just spam force push. When the combat system begins to actively prevent the player to do what the game taught the player to do, you messed up. Then there are the elite enemies, which are either just trash mobs with more health or are so spam happy with quick attacks that instantly stagger you that you are forced to spam force push, making the skill once again an instant win button. The game did everything it could to feel hard but only made the game force push simulator.

Lastly, the customization is mediocre at best, and most of them come from the player taking an extra 10 seconds out of their boring map traversal to take the other corridor to find a chest in a corner, so most players will have at least 75% of all customization materials by the time they finish the game for the first time. Sadly, most of the ponchos are ugly or just don't match with any of the three (yes three) types of clothes that you can wear under the ponchos. The lightsaber customization is mediocre, with only about 12 different styles to choose from, half of them just recreations of lightsabers from the movies or TV shows. Lightsaber colors? Oh you only get two until the beginning of the last act. Hope you REALLY like blue and green because that is all you get with the base game up until then. 

The game honestly feels like 5 different games that were patched together with duct tape. It wasted a lot of potential and its a shame.",1686974104,1686974104,False,4,1,0.538167953491210938,0,True,False,False

[*] I absolutely love the fighting mechanics in this game, so satisfying and enjoyable
[*] The animation, worlds, and cut scenes for this game elevate your playing experience to max enjoyability (even 4 years later which is when I'm playing it)
[*] Story is amazing [spoiler] and you get to see Darth Vader & trilla turn good at the end!! [spoiler]
[*] Voice Acting is excellent and good mouth sync by animators
[*] The Easter eggs are so cool and fun, for example when BD1 hacks a KX-series droid, he has a chance to beep one of the original trilogy themes made by John Williams!
[*] This game is tagged as Souls-like and it definitely is, but it's such a good entry into the genre. It's not as hard as sekiro and there are options to change difficulty if it gets to hard for players
[*] Just the right amount of enemies scattered across each level
[*] No overly hard collectibles to collect for the completionists
[*] Fun achievements
[*] lots of new light saber and force mechanics that you can obtain through the skill tree to make your play-through easier & more fun

[h1] CONS [/h1]
[*] What the absolute fuck is the fire storm-trooper. He's so hard to kill. I'm salty asf.
[*] Some bosses are unreasonably difficult and the bounty hunter arena is SUCH a pain in the ass, half the time I restarted when I got killed by a bounty hunter just because I was afraid I would have to go through that shit again. But I guess that's just a key feature of souls-like games.
[*] Not going to lie, wish we had more worlds
[*] Map system is not super, it can tend to get very confusing about where you need to go and what areas you haven't fully finished yet (ESPECIALLY ON ZEFFO YIKES)

Overall, great game, even better Star Wars game. I've always been a supporter of Respawn since Titanfall 2 and boy they sure didn't miss with this. The animation and voice acting is smooth and the story is beautiful. The actual playing is even better and is addicting. I don't know about its replayability though because I've only just finished the game. There wasn't a single moment where I was getting super bored of the game and burnt out unlike some other games (looking at you ghostwire: Tokyo and Metro 2033). I am whole heartedly surprised this game didn't win GOTY.

[u][b]VERDICT: 9.8/10 This game is amazing for not only Star Wars fans but Souls fans and gamers overall. With this game 4 years old now it's on sale all the time. But even if it's not on sale, I would strongly recommend buying this game. Only thing keeping it from a full 10 is the map system and the bounty hunter arena.

Even Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 1 and 2 are so much better that I don't understand why this game is the way it is. There is a power pole, you can't cut it. it's just that sometimes you come across cables or plants, and you cut them through.
  Bullet deflection is fine too, but that dodge thing is killing me.
By the way, the game is designed directly for the console. So obvious that when playing on PC. I don't know if it will bother you, but it bothered me a lot.
Other than that, the story was so unnecessary dramatized that it made me nauseous.
The characters you don't care about talk to you, etc., the background stories of the side characters that are very uninspired.
The second game looks a little more promising. Maybe I'll play it, but this game disappointed me greatly. I don't understand how people love it.
You come to an area, you clean the creatures, you climb etc. accidentally fell down, the creatures you just chopped are in front of you alive. If you don't have a job, cut it off again.
Oh, and there's that ridiculous robot coming. That robot weighs at least 5-10 kilos. We also carry that robot on our backs, saying, come on, jump on my back and I'll walk you around.

Combat is great, it's super fun learning the weakness of enemies and how they work. Force powers were fun to mix into combat, but I kinda wish there were a larger variety of enemies.

Even though the story has some fantastic moments, like running through a moving train from the Empire, exploring a crashed Republic Venator ship, getting jumpscared by huge spiders, controlling an AT-AT, climbing up a huge tree with multiple crashed Republic ships, sliding down muddy areas while being chased by an Inquisitor, all the flashback scenes, running away from you-know-who, I thought most of the characters were bland, especially Cere, with Cal being slightly less bland than Cere, and Greez being slightly less bland than Cal. I actually really liked Merrin, but she's only a main character for the last 30 minutes of the game.

There are a good amount of upgrades that are useful, but a lot of the upgrades I got that included new moves were ones I never ended up using.

Running around, platforming and exploring while doing the story is fun, but really annoying when going for collectibles, since most of the maps are atrocious to look at, and some of the back tracking is very, VERY boring. If you missed any collectibles on your first playthrough, or just missed it while roaming around after the story, and then reach a point where you can't go backwards, you'll have to go all the way back. This was especially annoying when going through Dathomir, which has tons of areas where you can't go backwards, and some enemies that are a bit tougher than other enemies.

Although I liked customization, I didn't think anything was different enough. I get the customization options for the Mantis and BD-1, but for Cal all you have are different colored outfits and different colored ponchos. There's zero details besides the colors that get changed, which I wish wasn't the case, and I personally think that most of the lightsaber parts look horrendous.

I also think new game plus kinda sucks. I understand certain force powers being locked to story progression so you can't skip major parts in the story, but force echo upgrades should have been carried over (which only increase the amount of force and health you have), and whenever Cal heals his connection with the force, all new upgrades should automatically be unlocked.

8/10

First of all, the graphics are out of this world. The planets you get to explore are so realistic and beautiful. I felt like I was actually traveling through the Star Wars universe! The attention to detail is incredible, from the stormtroopers' armor to the lightsabers, everything looks sooooo awesome.

But the best part is being a Jedi. I mean, come on, who doesn't want to be a Jedi and use the Force? You get to play as this cool dude named Cal Kestis and go on this crazy adventure. The lightsaber battles are so intense and thrilling. I felt like a real Jedi knight, slashing and blocking those enemies like a total boss.

The story is like a rollercoaster ride. It's full of twists and turns, just like in the movies. You meet awesome characters along the way, like BD-1, the adorable droid who becomes your best friend. The voice acting is top-notch, and the dialogue is so well-written. It's not just a game; it's like being part of an epic Star Wars saga.

Oh, and did I mention the puzzles? They are challenging but super fun. You have to use your brain and figure out how to unlock doors and activate switches. It made me feel like a genius when I finally solved them. Plus, there are secret areas and cool collectibles to find, so it's like a treasure hunt.

Now, I have to admit, there were a few bugs here and there, but nothing that ruined the overall experience. The game is totally worth it, even with those minor issues.

To sum it up, Jedi: Fallen Order is a masterpiece. It's like living your own Star Wars adventure. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is epic, and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you're a fan of Star Wars or just love action-packed games, you HAVE to play this.

Being a jedi is as much climbing and swinging around on ropes as being proficient with a lightsaber and the force.  Decent story with fun cameos.  Combat and meditation system definitely takes notes from the Souls series without being as unforgiving.  There are difficulty sliders too, so those interested in something Souls-like shouldn't feel too intimidated by this game.  There aren't any real stats to micromanage either, so you don't really need to worry about building a poor performing character.

I'm personally happy to see the souls-like mechanics get fed back into the game development system and start exploring the genre from there.  A couple of the borrowed souls mechanics don't really have a lore explanation beyond some arm waving, but I'm of the belief that not every game mechanic needs a lore explanation if it makes the game more fun.

At this point the game ran pretty stable on my 3060 & i7-7700K.  A few crashes here and there, but my save was never corrupted and I was easily able to hop back in an continue where I had left off.

The parry timings are really weird and most of the enemies have hyper armor/poise in their animations. Fighting against multiple melee enemies can be pretty lame and getting surrounded is pretty much a death.

Let me talk about the things I liked about this game.

Some of the level design and art work is absolutely amazing. It truly captured the essence of Star Wars.

From a technical perspective, there are no issues whatsoever, other than the fact that there is double DRM to have to deal with - Steam and the horrendous EA App. There were no issues running the game at 3440x1440 resolution in borderless Window mode (excellent), and I was consistently getting over 120FPS on the highest settings.

Platforming is quite well done, especially in the good levels of the game.

I should have loved this game but I don't.

Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a Souls like game, and this is the first of its kind that I ever played, and this concept is completely new to me. What I realized after playing this game is that for a Souls like game to be enjoyable, at least these two things need to happen -

The level design has to be very good. This is because there is a lot of backtracking involved. Under usual circumstances, one or two bad levels can be overlooked, but in a Souls like game, this problem is compounded because the player will end up revisiting the level more than once, and this can be very frustrating.

Enemies should be fun - not to be misinterpreted with easy.

The biggest problem with this game for me is that the game fails at both - the level design on some planets is not good, and the enemies are not fun.

There are a total of 6 planets in the game, and two of those planets are fun, and the rest are not. Less than 50% of the game that did not appeal to me.

- Bogano - Decent.
- Kashyyyk - The absolute worst.
- Zeffo - Excellent.
- Dathmoir - Could have been great, but ruined by enemies.
- Ilum - Decent.
- Nur - Excellent.

It felt to me that I spent most of the game fighting bugs, spiders in particular. As someone who has arachnophobia, this was pure torture. It got so irritating that I played these levels at 1920x1080 in windowed mode, without sound.

Just to give an idea, one of the objectives on the wookie planet is to climb a tree, and you get to fight bugs on the way to the top. It felt like Avatar Fallen Order. To drive the point home further, you even hitch a ride on the back of a bird. It absolutely did not feel like a Star Wars game. Add to this, there is a part of the game where you play without the lightsaber. It really made me question the intent behind this design.

After trudging through these levels, you get to play in a sci-fi setting with a dual lightsaber and it just reminded me how much fun this game could have been. I kept asking myself why the entire game wasn't like this. Is there a mystery audience out there that want to fight bugs and zombies in a Star Wars game?

Exploring a planet and looking for collectibles was out of the question because of the tedious design. Also, this game has the worst map screen I have ever seen in a game. This over engineered mess is truly a marvel of awfulness.

In addition to the bad level design there are very annoying things about the UX, for example, saving the involves mediating, which will is a painfully slow process of waiting for animations to complete. Its cool to look at twice, and then it gets very old.

The story felt weak and contrived. Nothing about the voice acting felt convincing and the cliche dialogue did not help - the usual Star Wars dialogue. The game suffers from plot armor, a character that should clearly died does not because of this kind of lazy writing.

I should have loved this game, but the bad level design, and enemies made me not enjoy it. If none of this bothers you, then you will have a lot of fun, as it is a technically competent game. I paid $4.79 for this, and I am not upset about that, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy this game, because I did not have fun and there is no reason to spend $4.79 to not have fun.

Verdict - I don't like it.",1685851488,1686335005,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

It's an old school puzzle platformer style game with a not very good melee combat system and basic RPG character building elements. It seems to be trying to rely on the Star Wars name for success rather than relying on being a good game. It has a cinematic story and seems to have a high production budget, but not a lot more. The endless jumping and scaling puzzles remind me of the old Tomb Raider games of the 90's. It has good graphics and a visually appealing game universe but the game itself is just not my style. If you like trying over and over and over to solve a puzzle or get through a fight, when you die and have to start at what usually equals 1/4 to 1/2 mile away, every single time, then this game is right up your alley. I can live with some games with checkpoint style game saves, but this one is too much. The only things that felt modern about this game is the graphics engine and the price. In my opinion, the only thing this game did well was piss me off. I am very disappointed and am actually looking to get a refund, which I don't normally do.

While the game received widespread acclaim for its engaging storyline and challenging combat, it is not without its flaws. In this essay, we will explore the areas where Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order falls short and examine the aspects that hinder its full potential.

One of the notable drawbacks of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order lies in its technical performance. The game suffered from occasional frame rate drops, glitches, and inconsistent loading times, which could disrupt the immersion and negatively impact the overall experience. Such technical shortcomings hindered players from fully engaging with the game's narrative and exploration, often resulting in frustration.

While Fallen Order attempted to incorporate puzzle-solving and platforming elements into its gameplay, it often fell into a pattern of repetition. The puzzles, although initially engaging, became predictable and lacked the complexity to challenge players consistently. Similarly, the platforming segments felt formulaic and lacked the innovation needed to keep players engaged. A greater variety in puzzle design and more inventive platforming sequences could have elevated the game's overall quality.

Exploration is a vital aspect of any Star Wars game, as it allows players to delve deeper into the rich lore and iconic environments. However, Fallen Order's exploration elements felt underwhelming. The worlds lacked a sense of true openness and discovery, often guiding players along linear paths with limited room for exploration. This constrained approach left players longing for a more expansive and immersive exploration experience within the Star Wars universe.

While the protagonist, Cal Kestis, is well-developed and engaging, the supporting characters in Fallen Order suffer from a lack of depth. They often come across as one-dimensional and fail to make a lasting impression. Greater attention to character development and more meaningful interactions with the supporting cast would have added emotional weight and further enriched the game's storytelling.

In a game driven by an engaging narrative, the absence of meaningful choices is a missed opportunity. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order follows a linear storyline, leaving players with limited agency in shaping the outcome. The inclusion of impactful choices and branching storylines would have given players a sense of ownership over the narrative and heightened replayability.

Despite its flaws, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order remains an enjoyable and immersive Star Wars experience. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the areas where the game falls short. Technical issues, repetitive puzzles, limited exploration, shallow supporting characters, and the absence of meaningful choices hinder the game from reaching its full potential. Recognizing these shortcomings allows for constructive criticism and the potential for future improvement in subsequent Star Wars titles, providing fans with even more memorable and satisfying gaming experiences in a galaxy far, far away.",1680180526,1686217899,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Let's talk about combat, the combat for the most part is a blast and I don't have any complaints besides some of the hitboxes being absolute a double s. You will have to actually battle back and fourth most of the times, not too difficult, but unless it's on Story Mode it's not really a piece of cake either. Some people do complain about you not feeling like a Jedi, but I also feel like they lost some of the point with it especially since Cal lost some of his way with the Force and is slowly relearning some of his abilities along the way, sure I wish I felt a little more powerful, but I definitely wasn't expecting him to be a Starkiller.

Story is really good, like top notch. I don't wanna spoil anything even if the game has been out for a minute. Just play through it or watch it on Youtube or something. Performances are also really good with actors like Cameron Monaghan (Cal), Daniel Roebuck (Greez), Tony Amendola (Eno), Debra Wilson (Cere), heck even Forest Whitaker (Saw) makes an appearance, just a really great cast.

I really love the way the levels look in this game, just like any other graphical aspect of the game these also look amazing and help immerse you into the game. Only really issue I have is when you complete everything and you wanna go back to grab all the collectibles, the amount of backtracking you have to do is absolutely nuts especially when you're on Zeffo like woof. It might've helped too had BD's holomaps actually been helpful, but they aren't and they start to get cluttered making navigation an absolutely pain, I wish they would've included some sort of fast travel options even if it was oh at Level 1 or Level 2 etc.

Also can we all just say f**k the EA launcher, like my god does this thing kill performance, my game would stutter and would have performance issues all the way through the game, one time the launcher crashes never opens and the game works fine, and you know what happens? My game is actually playing at a consistent framerate, like wow! And I had played through like 3 hours before I realized hey achievements aren't working..... cause they're tied to the EA launcher ugh. I did end up replaying to get all the achievements, but this isn't how this should work, when I order my game on Steam I do not want to have an additional launcher, had I wanted to play on EA I would have bought it there, it's absolutely nuts how many companies do this especially when it cuts performance in half.  Just play the DRM-Free version that's included, like for real, especially for the Linux homies.

Would definitely recommend this, one of the few Star Wars properties under Disney's control that is actually really good. Now all we need is to allow more studios to come up with their own single player stories or bring back some titles like 1313 and I'll be the happiest person alive. Also f**k the EA launcher.",1686181842,1686181842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The sound of the lightsaber gives you goosebumps. It's great that we can change the color of the lightsaber whenever we want. There are different combo techniques and it's fun to use them on stormtroopers. 

  The game's not over yet, I'll travel to damn Dathomir again. I enjoyed the game very much during the time I played it. However, however, I have so many positive things, I also have negative thoughts.  

---For example, we move back and forth between planets a lot. To get to a place on one planet, we have to go to the third planet to learn and come back again. It's a little annoying.

--- Another one is that NPCs are so stupid. Especially the stormtroopers :(

--- I had a hard time understanding the map and after you finish the mission you have to go back the same way, often by different routes.I wish there was teleportation between save points. It's a bit of a waste of time. 

I played the game for 20 hours and enjoyed it, even though it has its downsides. Especially BD-1 is very cute, our savior. It was really sad to see a different angle in the Order 66 scenes. I hope Cale can find a companion, he looks so lonely and desperate. It's a really good game for those who love the Star Wars universe, I'm looking forward to the end.  May the force be with you guys.

A historia é simples mas bem divertida, tendo um bom desenvolvimento do protagonista e personagens bem carismáticos.
O gameplay eh inspirado em souls like,
O combate de sabre vai de ataque fraco, forte, bloqueio, contra ataque e esquiva. Levando também em conta que temos a barra de bloqueio, caso ela for quebrada ficamos vulneráveis (isso também serve para inimigos).
Usamos o BD 1 para jogar as curas, ele também serve para ajudar na exploração.
Também temos os poderes da força que podem ser usados tanto para o combate como para desafios de plataforma e resolução de puzzles.
Ao derrotarmos inimigos e explorando conseguimos xp e pontos para serem gastos na arvore de habilidades, são bem variados mas alguns são bem meia boca.
Os planetas são bastante únicos, os mapas são bem amplos para exploração e sempre abrindo atalhos para melhorar a movimentação e facilitar no vai e volta.
Alem de conter muitos segredos e upgrades de vida, força e itens de cura.
A variedade de inimigos eh grande, além das forças imperiais cada planeta tem seus próprios tipos de inimigos, também podemos encontrar caçadores de recompensas e criaturas lendárias. Isso sem contar os chefes principais que são muito bons porém tem poucos.
Em questão de bugs tem alguns.
O que mais incomoda é quando os controles de ataque demoram para responder, e entre outros bem aleatórios. 

Enfim é um ótimo jogo de aventura.

8/10!!!

The story takes you on a bit of a treasure hunt of sorts, which leads you to a few different places, some already seen in Star Wars, and some new locations too, where you'll find main character Cal being roped into a few smaller storylines, and all the while being hunted by the sinister Inquisitors. There's some great moments here and there, especially with its Williams-esque soundtrack and small connections to the wider Star Wars world, but the plot itself is just okay, and while it would have been nice for it to be a little bit more involved in the game, it serves its purpose well enough to prop up the gameplay. The characters are equally middling - whilst they all have distinct personalities and great chemistry, there's very little development, and when it does happen it doesn't feel well set up or earned. 

That said, gameplay is where Fallen Order really shines. It blends the exploration and puzzle solving of games like Tomb Raider with Souls-like combat (or so I'm told), including its own array of challenging boss battles. There's a plethora of new skills, abilities and force powers to unlock as the game goes on, as well as the learning curve of the combat creating a rewarding progression experience. The maps are well designed, although a little bit bland to look at, and there's a lot of fantastic action sequences. Collectables and upgrades will keep you coming back to places you've already been after unlocking new abilities, and more of the maps open up for exploration. Customisation is there, both for the player, companions, and most importantly the lightsaber, although the limited range of options leaves it feeling a little shallow. Other than that, there isn't much left to say except it really is just a fun, solid experience that doesn't drag on and doesn't feel too brief.

There were many positive reviews for this game and even though I knew that some aspects of it were not to my preference, I saw it on sale and decided to give it a chance as I am a huge Star Wars fan (or at least I used to be before Disney). 

The Pros: The game looks great, but almost everything does these days, and with the kind of funding it had I can’t give it to much credit. The facial animations are top notch and I can easily understand the emotions of characters, even if they are not human. The audio is also excellent, and while nothing stood out to me from the music, it didn’t irk me either. However, this is where my enjoyment ends.

The Cons: The combat is terrible. If you enjoy games where it is hard to control your character or interact with the world then you may enjoy the challenge (i.e. Sekiro but unbalanced and a stupid camera). The timing for actions and the camera positioning are inconsistent at best which lead to many frustrating deaths. This is my biggest issue with the game as I was frequently dying, not due to a lack of skill but an inability to interact with the game the way I wanted to. In combat my camera would end up facing behind me, I would get stuck on objects, and the timing was all over the place. I became frustrated with the game when I should have been frustrated by the enemies I was fighting. Essentially, if you can’t buy into this style of combat, then you will not enjoy the game as it accounts for most of the content.
The story never grabbed my attention (and was rather cringy). The concept of a Jedi padawan who escaped from order 66 and wants to rebuild his order while finding their place in the world is interesting, but is has one glaring issue. To some extent, without evening finishing the game, I already know the ending. He fails, the empire becomes even more powerful and the atrocities they commit continue to increase in scale. We know this from the events of the original trilogy and it gives a feeling of futility to the main characters actions, and therefore mine. To be fair, I have not played much of this game and I do not know the ending. My point is, after 3 hours, I simply do not care enough to try and find out. The individual stories of the characters never made me ask why or want more dialogue, but instead I found myself asking why I couldn’t skip cutscenes.
The maps/environment are my last major gripe with this game. Yes, it is a game and I get that in some ways it will be unrealistic, but Fallen Order takes is unable to find a balance. It wants to be taken seriously in the cutscenes and then drops that as soon as you are in control again. The multi leveled, compact environment has something new around every corner (even though much of it is locked until later) but it does not feel like I am in the Star Wars universe. The difference between serious moments in the Jedi temple contrasted with the completely unbelievable landscape surrounding is frustrating. 

Overall, Star Wars Jed: Fallen Order is not a bad game by any means, but for me, it is not enough to recommend to others.

EDIT: This game is Star Wars. Unlike so much of recent works, this game has that Essence of Star Wars that hit's home. Do I still dislike the controls. ABSOLUTELY, but the patches have improved things substianlly (plus mods). This Star Wars Story is is hidden behind its gameplay being a barrier to entry that I wish was more adjustable. HOWEVER, this is Star wars beginning to end and I regret not sticking with it to experience it when it released (Fuck you developers for your buggy and inacessable release). PS. I love this story developers. please make more Star Wars (fuck Disney).",1604599848,1685947005,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

-poor collectibles. (""its a stormtrooper helmet on the ground"", ""broken vase over here"") that you will spend a lot of time with because;
-No fast travel on each planet and Dathomir really needs this. Especially at that dumb elevator that looks like a rope and that gets locked at the bottom when you take it down so you have to go the long way around each time while trying to navigate the messy hologram map.
-Played the game through three times and it got more boring with each playthrough.
-I got my moneys worth, and I also ended up buying this on steam so I can have my games on the one platform. Got it for free for upgrading my cpu originally. Had I not gotten it for free back then I had no interest in ever playing it.
-So why did I play so much (around 50 hrs) if I didn't really like it. Well it has its moments in the story and the gameplay is kind of fun even though quite janky because its Respawn and they turned an engine from a first person shooter into a third person action game. Even though I'm not a true fan I can appreciate Star Wars.
-That is also my main point why I ultimately disliked it is that if you have played an action adventure game before in your life this is as action adventure as it gets and nothing new here, fights with certain enemies tend to get boring in the end.
-If you are interested in buying this I recommend playing [u]only[/u] [b]ONE[/b] of the [i]""Jedi:""[/i] series' games', considering they will probably make a third game and trilogy for Cal Kestis. (even though Greez is a more likeable character for me, where's his trilogy hey?). Because each game will literally be the same, so pick which one you are most likely to enjoy. Just my suggestion.

[u]Another Tip:[/u]
Another tip I have is if anyone is interested; when you are getting a free software deal along-side your PC purchases. First thing you do when it arrives is ask for the redemption code straight away from the retailer and they might send through two different codes, the one they were meant to send, and the new ticket that you sent and asked [i]them[/i] for. This happened with me and I ended up getting two copies of fallen order as well as a subscription to free games and doubled my bundle offer to two months of EA Play and playing EA's collection of games. Which I ended up using to play my favourite game I have ever played in the Dead Space series for the first time.

Cal is a regular Jedi that survived Order 66 and is now struggling to survive in a world dominated by a dark Empire, but he is no Luke Skywalker, he isn't the Chosen One and he doesn't have any deep connections to the force. He was a regular Padawan that now lives in hiding, afraid to take action while trying to survive. And that's why his story has so much meaning to me. Because everyting he goes through feels natural. When the game starts, he has to learn everything he was taught from the ground up, since the trauma he went through during Order 66 was so strong it damaged his connection to the Force. He isn't quick to trusting Cere or Greez and is waiting for their actions to speak for them, but he wants to leave this life of hiding in fear, so he takes action and tries to help them as best as he can.

As the game progresses, he becomes even more likable. His interactions with the others always feel real, specially with Cere, who basically serves as his new Jedi Master.

But we all know about Star Wars and its lore, how's the gameplay? 
Honestly, it's pretty good. I am a sucker for games that allow me to change fighting stances/styles on the fly, so the fact that I have two lighstabers that have completely different moves and attacks makes me pretty damn happy. Every move has a nice feel to it, the speed and strenght of the attacks feel adequate, they are a lot more realistic but satisfying nonetheless.
There are a few gripes I have with the combat, though. I think the game would benefit heavily from things like super armor during certain moves, seeing as they not only cost Force to use but also are not instant and require some wind up first, it's very common for you to get surrounded, try to use a special move to get some space but end up doing nothing because you got hit, and now you're in a situation where you're still surrounded, but have less health and less Force to use on special moves. 
Also, the souls-like combat with stamina bars and parries would go well with the game if not for the fact that you're constantly getting attacked by multiple enemies at once, making it very common for you to go on a parry-chain where you're just parrying attack after attack but can't damage anyone because the enemies just keep coming. Which also wouldn't be a problem to deal with if certain moves made for crowd control had things like super armor to make it a more viable option.
This is a lot more present in things like late game encounters and combat challenges, but as a guy that likes to dissect combat mechanics and take them to the extreme, it feels kinda sad that I can't explore this game's combat further due to cracks in the design.

But overall, the combat is very fun and it does the ""making you feel like a badass Jedi"" job pretty fucking well

Other things that are very much worth mentioning are the open world, which not only looks absolutely gorgeous but is also very well made. All of the planets are very easy to tell apart from one another, which really brings the whole level design together.
I would've liked for the game to have fast travel, though. It would've been a lot easier and less time consuming to have easier ways to travel around the map, specially for planets like Zeffo and Dathomir, which are either really fucking big or too linear, creating a lot of difficulty when traversing some areas for later, post-story exploring. Hopefully they include something of sorts for the next game.

Oh, and the story is actually pretty interesting, the things some of those characters go through really resonates with you and makes you cheer for them during happy moments but also feel their pain when the time comes. I played the game twice, and one specific scene made me cry during both playthroughs, and although I can be a softie for these types of things sometimes, this game really does a great job at portraying strong feelings, be them of sadness, happiness or even terror.

If you like Star Wars, you'll probably like this game a lot. If you like hitting shit with laser swords you'll also probably like it a lot. I know I loved it and so did my girlfriend, and that makes it good enough for me to recommend it.",1685932799,1685932799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is a bit cliche but the environments are engaging and interesting and the force holos do a decent job of giving the world life and makes it feel like you are part of something bigger. There are unskipable cutscenes and time wasting dialogues (especially on the Mantis) that can get a bit annoying. The use of force is well implemented and is fun to use in fights and combos without making it feel overpowered. The combat overall feels good and is great fun, but the boss fights get a bit boring and samey towards the end. The water sections are boring and the game would've been better without the ability to dive underwater.

Apart from gameplay there are no in-game purchases or micro transactions and that deserves praise on its own. There are some visual bugs (mostly textures pop-ins and stutters) and a few funny glitches, but nothing bad and I didn't experienced any game-breaking issues or crashes during my play through. The EA launcher integration is annoying and, combined with unskipable and slow EA logo, makes launching the game take ages, but once you are in the main menu getting into the gameplay is fast. There is a good amount of customisable settings in the menus that allows you to turn off annoying or unnecessary things (i.e. turning off QTEs).

For me story completion took about 18-20 hours of playtime playing at a leisurely pace. 100% with all achievements took me around 26 hours. There is replayability with newgame+, but I don't really see the point other than using NG+ to complete the achievements.

Overall the game is a good experience and would recommend to anyone who enjoys souls-likes and likes the Star Wars theme. Maybe skip this one if you are a Star Wars fan but don't like playing souls-likes.",1685906987,1685907557,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a shame that the last few minutes of the story kind of crapped the bed, but overall up until excluding the literal VERY END of the story it was an amazing ride.

Gameplay-wise it was a good time, but the force-awakens games from 10yrs. ago did force powers MUCH better and were more fun. Force powers in this game are adequate to get the job done but weren't anything spectacular. The dark-souls fighting mechanics are at odds with the power ups and combos - the enemies can too easily interrupt you mid-attack, basically nerfing almost all the cool combos and attacks that you've built up throughout the game save for the most basic enemy types. That again is where the old Force-Awakens games shined in that once you were fully powered up you could rip through enemies like a hot knife through butter! Other than the most basic storm troopers and rat-things you never get to enjoy your whole toolbox of abilities in a truly satisfying way, and that goes for right up to the end.

Visually it's absolutely stunning, and if you've got good hardware ( I'm running a 5900x/6800xt combo that runs the game native 4k with all the settings on ""epic"" - and the graphics on those settings live up the ""epic"" naming scheme) it's basically like being in a starwars movie. almost 4yrs later it is every bit the graphical equal, if not better, then a lot of contemporary games.

- Getting two shotted by bosses
- No fast travel at all
- Confusing maps that are layered. 
- Poor objective markers
- Collecting ""poncho"" skins for your Jedi

- The running is very glitchy and it pissed me off a lot. 
- The story is average in terms of creativity and originality.
- Another game where dodge/parry/attack rinse & repeat is the way to win. 
- Started it a while ago, got bored, stopped, and came back (beat it in 14 hours). 

Gameplay: 7/10
- Less horse poop than dark souls; difficult at times, but not too hard. 
- Combat is designed in a way that you can only effectively light attack, any thing else will get you killed.  
- Running is the most glitchy and broken thing I have ever witnessed. 
- Sometimes the jumping after sliding would send me into a random direction causing me to miss many basic jumps.
- Blaster projectiles travel too slowly, so I used a mod to speed them up and it was more fun. 
- Deflecting blaster rounds is very satisfying.
- The bosses for the most part seem to be unable to land their empowered attacks and will miss even if you don't dodge.
- Combining many combat styles into one mechanic was interesting, but doesn't really work imo.
- Even basic enemies can stop your combo attacks and animation cancel you; thus they are useless.
- Only 3 'real' boss fights. 
- The puzzles are sometimes difficult to understand, but for the most part they are meh.

Story: 5/10
- We do not get enough planets imo, only like 5 (from memory).
- Cal cuts himself off from the force as a plot point to gain 'new' abilities.
- Very basic Star Wars plot here.
- Hero survives Order 66, finds crew, goes on mission, learns about self, beats boss. There is really nothing else to it.
- The main characters are acceptable, but not unique; we have seen stories like that many times before. 
- Merrin decides to join you before the last mission for no real reason; and does basically nothing. 

Final thoughts & final rating: 6/10
- I did like what this game had to offer, I just think that it is probably only worth around $30. 
- There is also no reason to play again, other than if you want to play new game+, to stomp on higher difficulties.",1685763932,1685764073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The controls take some getting used to but what I like is that the port to PC doesn't involve a massive number of keystrokes for the movement and combat. The limited number of keys works well for combat and the abilities and there are not many keystroke combinations to remember.  This being said, the enemies are tough on Normal skill so patience and figuring out how to beat them is required.  I like the combat, it's realistic, and the light saber/force ability combination produces some satisfying kills.  There's a particular trick to defeating a boss that involves what to do during a boss's ""unblockable"" attacks.  I won't spoil it by revealing it here but it's counter-intuitive, that's all I will say about it.  The map takes some getting used to but once learned, it's actually quite good for getting around the levels.  The skill tree is cool, there's lots of character upgrades available.  Graphically, the game is nice, it looks good but it's not quite the photo-realistic stuff we are getting now.  Also, your rig has to be fairly powerful to get good frame rates and avoid stuttering.  I'm using a 1080 Ti still and it plays the game fine, just some stuttering in the cut scenes.  The story is good, Cal Kestis is a good character to play and the Empire is quite evil and nasty, as it should be.  My only frustration with the game is actually moving around.  There are a lot of movement puzzles and sometimes those slow the game down a bit.  All things considered, though, I am happy with the game and I intend to play the new one as well using the skills I learned in this game.

I bought this game in a sale due to apparent high recommendation, but after playing for 2,5 hours, I decided to delete it permanently from my HD.

As a long years of experience players on RPG, I tried to play on the highest difficulty. From the beginning, I died some times... but I thought that it was because I was getting used to the mechanics.
But as the game went on, I noticed a severe problem on the responsiveness of the controls. Many times when you block/dash/attack, it just ignores!!!
The last drop was when I was trying to kill a big but easy monster. I died more than 10x because I could block or dash in time. I even tried to lower the difficulty, but again, the issue persisted.

I think a lot of people love this game, and I understand why, but I just personally cannot recommend it.

Reason being is simple; for a game that relies on precision of action and reaction to enemy attack pattern the combat system is not nearly precise enough, and the latency on some actions, especially blocking, are maddenly sluggish and inconsistent. I have spent hours trying to beat Dark Souls bosses and never felt as frustrated as I have with bosses, and even more difficult regular enemies, even when I 'easily' overcome them. It just feels off and bad, rewarding spamming slow and pull to punch through enemy guard far more than tight blocking and attacks; enemies stagger, but then don't randomly on the same attacks; some unblockable attacks are stupidly easy to avoid, and others are virtually impossible, the enemy giving almost no telegraph time or honing in on you despite how well you time a dodge; and most frustratingly is when you try to transition directly from a block to an attack and the action is just ignored.

I don't claim to be a high reflex gamer, but lowering the difficulty, while allowing me to brute force my way through sections, felt just as unsatisfying. Again, I WANT to like this game, and hope the sequel is a bit tighter on controls, because it's ALMOST THERE, but it was a constant fight to finish this game, and one of the final boss battle literally has me walking away from this game.",1685735824,1685735824,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Set in the Star Wars universe, the game tells the story of Cal Kestis, a young Padawan who survived the purge that destroyed the Jedi Order after the events of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.

The game's storyline is one of its greatest strengths. It is engaging, well-written, and immerses players in the Star Wars universe. The characters are well-developed, and players quickly become invested in their journey, rooting for them to succeed.

The gameplay in Jedi: Fallen Order is also exceptional. It is a mix of exploration, platforming, and combat, with a skill tree system that allows players to customize Cal's abilities to their playstyle. The combat system is particularly impressive, with lightsaber battles that are both fluid and challenging.

The game's graphics are stunning, with impressive attention to detail and a variety of beautifully designed locations. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, with composer Gordy Haab creating a score that perfectly captures the essence of the Star Wars universe.

Overall, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a fantastic game that does justice to the Star Wars franchise. Its exceptional storyline, gameplay, graphics, and soundtrack make it a must-play for any Star Wars fan. The game's combination of exploration, platforming, and combat creates a captivating and challenging experience that is both rewarding and satisfying. In my opinion, it is a 10/10 game that deserves the praise it has received from both fans and critics alike.",1685700375,1685700375,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Read the old review if you want, bottom line is the game just doesn't feel good to play. The parry timing is simultaneously too lenient and too unforgiving at the same time. It feels like the parry window exists between where parry windows should exist. You don't parry right before they swing, and you also don't parry right as the swing would hit you. You parry during the start of the swing but not in the middle of it, which makes parrying feel SUPER janky. Enemies will barely even be starting their attack yet they get parried but a claw or bite that's right about to hit after you've had adequate time to react? Sorry, we wanted to make this game have memorization based combat, common sense means nothing here.

Attack patterns are as unintuitive and ""just learn the patterns by dying to them a bunch"" as you'd expect any artificially difficult game to be. I wish it wasn't a controversial statement to say that memory based combat is not good combat. Horizon Zero Dawn is a hard game (when at max difficulty) but it doesn't derive it's difficulty from arbitrary timing in animation. You see that you're about to get hit, you time your dodge, you reposition. It makes sense. If you ask me, and here's another controversial opinion (at least among ""souls-like"" games), it's satisfying to be rewarded for trusting your intuition. Note that I'm not saying it's satisfying to be rewarded for mashing defensive options, but when I time my button press for what feels like the right moment just for either the windup animation or the hitbox itself to linger and hit me after I dodge? That doesn't feel good. At all.

You can have a good combat system without it relying on me memorizing timing. I wish this longtime trend would die but games keep doing it. I understand the satisfaction of learning the flow of a fight... in moderation. Yes, learning the dance is rewarding, I personally even enjoyed fighting Melania... the first 100 times. This game feels like the subsequent 300 attempts every time a fodder enemy weirdly pivots without moving its feet, hits me after it's done swinging, or ignores my parry because I was ""too late"" (in this context, ""too late"" translates to ""the moment a parry would occur"").

Here's the old review from 2019:

The primary gameplay mechanic is dying. The game takes an average player 20-25 hours to beat from what I've heard, I beat it in 12 when I set it to the easiest mode so I could just enjoy the story (yOuRe hAviNg FuN WrOnG) aka you're supposed to spend 7 hours of your time doing nothing but dying... great game 2/10. Story wasn't worth it either but at least it's pretty.",1609651072,1685686493,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The world, combat and gameplay that they provide in one long story is admirable. Probably one of the best, if not the best game EA has ever made, or even the best Star Wars game ever made. Cal shows that even though Disney is very restrictive with the creation and characteristics of the Star Wars franchise, the allowance of the character growth and story shown feels original and not a marketing method, on part of Disney. A showing that Disney still wants to feel as family-friendly as possible, is that the dismemberment only occurs for non human enemies(The Beasts, monsters, etc). Even though that restriction is understandable in some way, still the combat feels as fresh as in a Star Wars game could be. The souls-like combat allows for many combinations of movements, while still not being an easy to learn combat style. You cannot just go swinging your sword like a frickin maniac without getting hit, or even dying if you get attacked by multiple enemies. Now, the world that the game provides I think, as a Star Wars fan is incredible. The planets shown are known by the most hardcore fans, and the little force echoes or the secrets give more info on the deep lore of each of the planets. The customization is a great way to allow the player to feel more like Cal, personalizing the Poncho, the suit color, and even the BD1 and The Mantis paint job. But the most important customization tool is the lightsaber. Every player has a totally different way that they want to have their lightsaber, in color, switches and many other characteristics that someone can change. Incredible, as Greez´s plants. The last point that I want to say is that the story could be, if I'm not mistaken, canon, happening before the events of Episode 4, but after Episode 3, which could potentially make Cal come to live-action.

My last words...

""A really well written story, with a great combat and connection to the original material, showing that Disney isnt always so bad...""

Enemies can chain-stun you repeatedly, and not give you an option to even stagger them once.

The mechanics of the game were comfortable and smooth, and I really enjoyed the abilities you earned over time making your character become a ""force"" to deal with; you could noticeably feel your character improving over time after you had unlocked abilities. The negatives where there was no real loot system, and the few things you could loot where junk of no real use at all to your characters performance. The big negative for me was it's linear game play. I played A Plague Tale which is a liner game, but it's creators somehow managed to avoid it having a linear feel to it. The creators of Jedi: Fallen Order failed at this terribly. I felt like I was stuck in a hallway unable to turn right or left for 95% of the game. The world was just to small and presented very few (if any) exploring possibilities.

It's an insidious plan, like all Sith's plans. EA grafted a broken EA launcher that requires an EA account, and doesn't work. I tried over and over, with multiple mails. EA just didn't want me to play the game I bought. I can only imagine the mad laughs the EA Sith Lord was having at my expense.

I was about to yield and refound the game, EA Sith Lord victorious.

Yet, there was a flaw in the Sith plan for Jedi Fallen order. There isn't just one executable, there is also another! By relinking steam to the executable ""SwGame-Win64-Shipping.exe"", I was able to flank EA's Evil third party launcher and play Jedi Fallen Order.

Upon launching, EA's abomination of a broken launcher pitifully asks to be installed. By standing fast, and following the force, I can push the X and close the abomination. The game finally launches. I shall rebuild the Jedi Order, despite EA Sith Lord best effort to prevent the Jedi from raising from the ashes!

EA Sith Lord planted many more traps. The unskippable cutscene at the start of the game can be foiled by renaming Content\Movies\GARBAGE_Default_Startup.mp4.

Anyway, its a Star Wars game about being a Jedi (add it to the list) but unlike most jedi games its both significantly challenging, and feels quite satisfying when you do pull things off in a skillful manner. If they were going to pick anything to make a Sekiro clone in terms of gameplay, this was a really good choice for it. Force powers have tangible use in gameplay and can be quite helpful in combat with some opponents (particularly some Dark Troopers, force powers can turn an impossible encounter into a trivial one), and you can deflect blaster bolts as seen in the movies. Overall Respawn Entertainment (NOT EA they are a publisher, not a developer, get your facts straight FFS) nailed it in terms of gameplay.

In terms of story...Well it occurs in the events in between SW episodes 3 and 4. Aside from that, honestly, its nothing special. It wasn't bad, but not particularly good or outstanding either. Its typical star wars writing in other words.

It's story rich, with great detail and superb voice and performance capture by known Hollywood actors. 
But it's also great fun, and really HARD on the hard setting (many games are still quite easy even in hard mode). You have tons of fast paced lightsaber action, parkour and climbing, huge slides and wall walking, big (and small) boss fights, and often fighting multiple enemies at once.

Every enemy and every boss requires a specific strategy, this isn't a button mashup kind of game. At the beginning, when facing stronger enemies on the harder game settings it can get a bit frustrating and you die a lot and fast (two mistakes and you're dead kind of fast). Timing is really critical and using the correct powers and skills at the right times, and difficulty scales with your progress so the game doesn't become easy in higher levels (but you don't die as quickly at least lol).

STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order is an incredible exploration, combat, puzzle, story rich and adventurous game, journeying into the Star Wars universe. Not only does it feature new and incredible locations, but also brings back locations from the films and shows, such as Kashyyyk and Dathomir. The story is very well written and executed, with the cast of voice actors doing an outstanding performance. Respawn really did a good job with this one. So much for EA claiming single player titles were dead.
The Story is by far the best for a recent Star Wars game, making the Battlefront II story look terrible compared to this. You play as Cal Kestis, a former Jedi in hiding on the planet Bracca, where even in the opening sequence of the game, Respawn added a whole motherlode of eye candy such as Tie Fighters, Probe Droids, Republic Star Destroyers and even a Sarlacc Pit! In the game you journey across the stars to find various artifacts to help you on your perilous quest, while also being repeatedly halted by various adversaries who have other plans for the fruit of all your efforts. A brilliant, well contained story that really knows how to entertain and please its audicence.
The Gameplay feels smooth and well refined, with important skills being unlocked throughout the story. These skills determine which areas of the map you can access, so if you get stuck somewhere it might just be because you haven't progressed through the story enough. Unlocked skills really change every fight and the boss fights really do feel like bosses. Highly recommended is unlocking more stim packs, as these are crucial for having a good experience and not dying all the time.
The Music is incredible, sounding just like it had come straight from John Williams himself, with some scores even coming from or being influenced from the films! Truly makes you feel in a Star Wars experience!.
Overall, STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order is another incredible game from an incredible studio. The achievements are all quite easy to achieve but require some research and guides, but don't take too long. The game also features a new game + mode where you can use cosmetics from a previous save but start the story over. A very fun and amazing game. Highly recommended!
STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order gets a 9/10.

In other words, there's a way to make this enemy less annoying to fight, but you haven't unlocked it yet, and you don't know that it exists.

The second part is when you realize that there's literally no point in fighting most enemies. Your health is limited between checkpoints by the number of stims you can carry, so it's to your advantage to run past everything and not fight it so you can save your stims for encounters that you're forced to have.

The third annoying part about combat is how reliant it is on the parry system. That means that most of the time you're just waiting the enemy to attack so you can parry and counter -- that is, if parrying can even lead to a counter. A lot of the time, a parry won't immediately lead to a punish, because their block meter hasn't been fully depleted. When that happens, it feels very anti-climactic and contrary to a nice battle flow because even though you've just countered, you can't do any follow-up attack.

You're also given force powers, but aside from a few obvious push-pull scenarios, it's not obvious what you'd actually do with them. If you want to watch someone on YouTube describe how to min-max the force powers for each individual enemy encounter, go right ahead. I'm sure there's an optimized formula or method for that. However, a better and more intuitive combat system would have let all force powers range between mildly and very effective depending on the scenario, rather than being some rock-paper-scissors type of effectiveness, or achieve nothing other than briefly interrupting the flow of battle at the cost of force with no benefit whatsoever.

So yeah, cool story, great graphics, mostly annoying combat.",1685425731,1685425731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Introduction:
In the vast landscape of gaming, few experiences rival the sheer joy of immersing oneself in a captivating single-player game. Among the countless titles available, one game stands out as a shining example of excellence, weaving an unforgettable narrative and delivering exhilarating combat. This review aims to shed light on the remarkable journey I embarked upon and address the misguided opinions that undermine its brilliance.

Captivating Storytelling:
One of the hallmarks of a remarkable single-player game is its ability to transport players into a richly developed world, enveloping them in an engaging story. The game in question masterfully accomplishes this feat, leaving players spellbound from start to finish. The narrative is expertly crafted, with well-rounded characters and intriguing plot twists that keep players eagerly pushing forward. I found myself emotionally invested in the protagonist's journey, experiencing a range of emotions that few games can elicit. The game's ability to weave a tale of such depth and complexity is a testament to the developers' dedication and skill.

Exhilarating Combat:
While an enthralling story lays the foundation, no single-player game is complete without satisfying gameplay mechanics. In this aspect, the game excels, delivering combat that is as breathtaking as it is satisfying. The fluidity of the controls allows players to effortlessly execute intricate moves, creating a seamless combat experience. The game strikes the perfect balance between challenge and reward, providing moments of intense action that test the player's skills while offering a sense of accomplishment. Each encounter is meticulously designed, encouraging strategic thinking and providing a plethora of options for dispatching foes. The combat system is a true work of art, showcasing the developers' commitment to delivering an exceptional gameplay experience.

Misguided Criticisms:
Unfortunately, no matter how exceptional a game may be, it is bound to face unwarranted criticism from a small fraction of players. It is essential to recognize that negative reviews often stem from a place of misunderstanding or personal bias rather than objective analysis. One common criticism revolves around the game's playtime, with some arguing it is too short. However, this viewpoint fails to consider the game's focus on quality over quantity. Each moment spent in this meticulously crafted world is packed with meaning and purpose, delivering a concentrated dose of entertainment. Judging a game solely based on playtime overlooks the immense value that can be derived from a carefully constructed experience.

Additionally, it is crucial to highlight that those who criticize without fully understanding the game's intricacies lack the credibility to undermine its excellence. By dismissing their ill-informed opinions, the developers can remain focused on the game's true audience—the players who appreciate the artistry and dedication poured into every aspect of its creation.

Conclusion:
In the realm of single-player gaming, this particular game shines as a beacon of excellence, offering an unforgettable experience that captivates from beginning to end. Its superb storytelling and exhilarating combat mechanics set a new standard for the genre, leaving players in awe of its brilliance. While negative reviews may attempt to diminish its worth, it is vital to recognize the misguided nature of such criticisms. This game deserves to be celebrated and cherished by those who appreciate the profound impact that a single-player journey can have on one's gaming experience.",1685410315,1685410315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Good:
-Music is phenomenal
-Combat is enjoyable, yet challenging
-Storyline is semi-engaging
-Lightsaber combat is especially fantastic
-The scenery from the different worlds is beautiful - it was pretty cool to see such stark differences in the planets

The Bad:
-Level system is pretty dull
-I wish there were more 1v1 combat - there are 3 or so that I can remember in the game and those are the highlights
-Seer is annoying
-I wish the game would explore more of an open world concept (especially because the planets are gorgeous!), or at least have some decisions that could impact the game, but it is a very 1-lane type of game",1685381609,1685381609,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The level design in the game seemed interesting to me. Visually, it's not bad and has its moments, but it quickly becomes tedious. Probably because everything is tailored to the characters and the plot, which turned out to be quite predictable. Difficulty! Here is where I had a little issue. I changed the difficulty several times. On one hand, it's interesting to struggle in some boss battles, but on the other hand, it becomes tiresome to kill the same dummy enemies for the tenth time. And honestly, towards the end of the game, I started feeling bored. I stopped getting into the plot too much - I just wanted to finish it quickly and forget about it. There is a story and characters, of course, but they didn't really resonate with me.

This game is not that. It's more adventure/exploration/puzzle with an actual story that makes more sense than the narrative of both TFU games. While I'm no fan of Disney these days I do appreciate a good canon, story-driven campaign in games. It's beautiful to look at and I think the story itself is decent and comprehensible. 

Now for the bad.
The controls are a little more awkward than I'm used to but I've gotten the hang of it. So that's not so bad.
Now, I know a lot of people like puzzles and I personally don't mind them. With that being said, some of the puzzles in this game can be a bit convoluted. 
My biggest gripe, but by no means the worst I've seen in any video game, would be some of the bosses. Specifically the ""hidden"" or ""secret"" bosses. They have some janky hit boxes and sometimes even get stuck in a loop of attacks that can't be blocked. Even this is inconsistent and doesn't always happen with even the same boss. For example, the Albino Wyyyschokk boss on Kashyyyk has an inconsistent hit box on it's attacks. One moment I'm dodging all of it's unblockable attacks and the next I'm killed by it when it's attack lands a couple feet in front of me and does not actually connect, meaning I should not have been hit. Another time I will be able to narrowly dodge with mere inches between us.
Lastly, this game has some performance issues like stuttering. They aren't too bad and eventually clear up on their own. 

All-in-all I think it's a good, solid Star Wars game worth checking out, especially if you are/were a fan of TFU I & II, despite being different. I do very much recommend it despite its few flaws.",1685363752,1685363752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game play is a great Souls-like, but thinking about the fact that you are supposed to be playing a Jedi... Cal is the slowest moving Jedi in existence.  By the end of the game you'd think he would have gotten faster and become a solid Jedi, but you'd be wrong.  I suppose that is what Survivor is intended to provide?  Doubt it.  Still looking forward to Survivor though.
I started playing on Grand Jedi Master, but I didn't have the time to ""get good"".  I just turned down the difficulty so the bosses weren't ridiculous and enjoyed my time.  Had played on Jedi Master the whole time, I could have cut about 15-20 hours of gameplay off.  I really tried to make Grand Master work, but it just wasn't worth it to me in the end.

The combat is almost Souls-like but lacks the depth and complexity to really compare. It gets the basics done fine so combat isn't bad or annoying but it's not particularly enjoyable either. Enemies have cheesy unrealistic behaviour like instantly snapping towards your direction, which is especially noticeable when you Force Slow a giant frog and run circles around it and it spins like it's a compass and you're the whole planetary magnetic field. Not only is it silly, it also negatively impacts the gameplay experience somewhat because it means you can't use knowledge and skilful positioning to dodge attacks like in Souls games. This is just one of a few things that really separates this game from being a true Souls-like with good combat. 

To be fair, the combat does shine at times, particularly when facing the lightsaber-wielding bosses. They are well designed and difficult without being unfair, and the fights look great too. The game should have had more of that, rather than all the random wildlife which isn't anywhere near as interesting or fun to fight. And lore-wise it's just ridiculous a random sheep or bug can be an actual threatening opponent for a Jedi. 

Another issue is the revolting overabundance of ""squeezing through small gaps"" sections, which sometimes last upwards of 30 seconds, of just holding forwards and watching your character ever so slowly and painfully squeeze through. Just what the Souls-like genre was missing. To add insult to injury, those sections are often placed just after a checkpoint, meaning that dying forces you to endure the whole squishy ordeal all over again. Fun.

The environment design is especially fantastic. This is a modern Triple A game that actually looks the part. Facial models and animations are also top notch. This game has a ton of climbing and even puzzle sections so I would say it's actually much closer to Uncharted/Tomb Raider than any Souls game. There's also high octane set piece moments straight out of Uncharted and those are great. As a cinematic story driven single player experience, the game is good. But as a Souls-like, it misses the mark. Honestly, I think it should have dropped the Souls elements entirely and fully committed to being an Uncharted-esque game, which is what the game was better at doing. 

Overall, it's a good game and I'd give it a 6/10, but unfortunately the entire experience was ruined when I got jumpscared by an emoji and fell off my chair and banged my frigging knee elbow.

Puzzle platforming is interesting but sometimes it just gets in the way and become repetitive, would be cool if some parts were more streamlined or more easy to maneuver like parkour dying light instead of prince of persia platforming with linear paths.

its cool, just sucks that the combat is not that fun and the story only gets interesting on the middle to finish, also its linear so no choices.

in the overall pretty terrible rpg, okish combat with very low customization (theres double sided lightsaber but thats it)

i played the game with deleted game intros, female cal mod with custom outfits, a custom droid and companion skins. It was a bit interesting but that wasnt enough to keep we playing a game with no choices and the same narrative experience as all the streamers that played the game on launch.

This review contains very minor spoilers

Definitely one of the better Star Wars games of the last decade. Strong recommendation for any Star Wars fans. Souls-like fans may enjoy the game but may also find the combat to be lacking.

Visually, the environments are beautiful and diverse. Most enemies are well designed and animated. Cal himself is a bit of a trainwreck, with a handful of goofy animations (running in particular is just awful) and the remainder of the main cast isn't much better (Cere's eyes look as though they are going to bulge out at any moment -- even in the trailers).

The soundtrack, as with almost every Star Wars product, is on par with the best. The main theme is beautiful, and the backing tracks thoughout the game are new and refreshing, while at the same time classic Star Wars.

The story is on the shorter end (you could definitely finish it up in 10 hours, but I spent a decent chunk of time exploring.) That being said, it's a well written and paced, with some non-offensive new additions to the canon. There are several compelling voice acting performances, and serviceable but predictable villains (seriously, you could probably guess their motivations within the first hour -- this isn't breaking any new ground narratively)

As for the most important factor, gameplay, it's fairly good. I played through the game on Jedi Grandmaster (the highest difficulty) and jumped back down to Jedi Master (the recommended) when completing the remaining achievements. Both modes offer responsive controls, satisfying parrying and dodging, and enemy attacks feel fair other than a few glaring exceptions. The game also puts a heavy emphasis on parkour and terrain scaling - most of it is forgiving and decent fun. Some collectibles require somewhat precise jumps that can be slightly annoying.

One definite complaint about the combat is the flashy special moves - most of them are entirely worthless because of long charge-up times for mediocre damage. Your basic heavy attack uses your force bar, which is a questionable choice as it almost feels like you're being punished by the developers for finding an opening for one. There are a few special moves (notably the move that allows you to swap saber stances) that do extremely high damage and will end up being what you spam to take down tankier enemies. Its disappointing not being able to mix in a number of different moves because your force bar is so limited throughout the game, and the consequence for missing is almost certain death on the highest difficulty.

That being said, the main boss fights are quite fun and decently challenging. The optional bosses are all reskins of normal wildlife you can encounter with amped health and damage, stuffed into small arenas to give them artificial difficulty - they aren't fun nor are they interesting.

As for the completionists out there, you will almost certainly need to use youtube videos showing you optimal paths if you don't want to spend 100 hours on this. Missing a single collectible is a huge pain as there is no fast travel in the game. There are also achievements that fall mostly to luck like the bounty hunter ones.",1685089431,1685089431,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The planets are really intricately designed, so they can be really tricky to navigate, and the map does not help. I would sometimes have to spend more time trying to find my way out of a level than progressing through the story. 
Story is good, and all of the character writing is great, and I really liked the casting.
Character customization is a little sparse, but this was something which was fixed in the sequel.
Combat feels like a slower (and clunkier) take on the Sekiro combat model. Fighting an enemy one-on-one feels really satisfying, especially once you have their attack timings down. Trying to fight multiple enemies at the same time felt overwhelming; they could overlap attacks, and your block recovery animation means you can only perfect block the first hit. 
Overall a positive experience, but I won't be going back to play through it again any time soon.

[b] THOUGHTS [/b]
I have been in a gaming slump for a few years, I'm going to be honest. Most of it has been just casual depression and not having any interests even with gaming. This year I started making some healthy life choices like quitting alcohol, getting on HRT for gender-affirming stuff, trying to spend more time outside. I have found myself surprised (though it's not unbelievable) that my interests like reading and gaming are also coming back. Having said this, [u] Jedi: Fallen Order [/u] was the first game I've picked up in quite a long while. I played it on the 2nd easiest difficulty and found the story rich and inviting for a welcome back into the gaming world. I know it's an older game, four years at the time of this review, but it was a welcome treasure in my life. Cannot wait to play the next one (as well as start conquering my playlist).

Visually, the game is nothing short of stunning. The devs clearly spent time meticulously crafting breathtaking environments that range from ancient temples to lush forests.

While the gameplay in Jedi: Fallen Order is undeniably satisfying, it does come with its fair share of challenges. Combat requires precise timing and skillful execution, presenting a learning curve that may take some time to conquer. It's worth noting that certain encounters and enemy AI can feel unbalanced, resulting in occasional frustration. Nevertheless, the immense joy derived from executing fluid lightsaber attacks and counter.

The puzzle aspects of the game felt a bit half-baked for how many of them existed in the game - the sheer amount of times gameplay was interrupted to complete a mandatory force push/lift puzzle started to feel obnoxious.

Unfortunately, I had a slightly underpowered GPU for my monitor's resolution at the time, so I shelved the game and decided to come back after an upgrade. Well, that upgrade has come and I remembered this game was in my library. So I install all 50-god-forsaken-GBs and go to launch the game.

""No,"" says the EA Desktop app. ""There is an error on our end"" which translates into I cannot play the singleplayer game on MY end.

I tried all sorts of troubleshooting suggestions online and finally found one that worked: Do not use Steam. Launch the game directly from its directory.

So I launch into the game and I am presented with a message that the game is best played on a controller. That's fine, I had one in my hand already. That was my plan the entire time. It would help if the buttons respond, though. I use the keyboard and mouse (and quickly realize why a controller is recommended as the menu is almost unusable with KB+M) to check my settings. I restart the game a couple of times and still the best I get is the my thumbstick moves around menus but none of my button presses register.

Off to the internet I go again and find few suggestions for this particular problem. Nothing works and all of the solutions seem to assume one is launching the game from Steam. I can't fault them for that assumption, it would be the natural course of playing a game purchased through Steam. The only suggestion sounded promising was to disconnect USB devices until maybe the game decided that the game controller was the game controller, but I was exhausted. I was defeated.

I have played 5 hours of the game. I remember it looking pretty good and playing fine. I would love to confirm if this is still the case. I would love to finish the game. Yet, I cannot. EA has decided that simply buying the game is not enough. I must install their insipid launcher. I must suffer through shoddy design decisions. I am a year or more passed being able to get a refund.

[b]C[/b]

[h1]Quick Summary [/h1]
There are two camps of people, those who have played Jedi Knight Series and those who have not, that will decide how much you will like this game. It’s now the second best Jedi videogame. The story is better than it should be given the publisher, Disney reboots, and AAA standards that I’ve grown to know will always disappoint. Luckily the game is just good enough in taking the tropes of popular games and reskinning it to please Star Wars fans that want to pretend to be a Jedi one more time.

 [h1]More in depth: [/h1]
[list]
[*]The STORY WAS WAY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT WHEN COMPARED TO BOTH THE RECENT MOVIES, can’t go lower than rock bottom I guess and most AAA games, the theme of failure and forgiveness hits in a couple scenes. Wished they focused more on the relationships of Cal, Cere and Trilla, the interactions were so few and far between with a lot Cal being alone with boring “audio logs” that did world building stuff, but with so many and nothing of interest to me, at least it doesn’t get in the way. It was more personal with Cal and Cere, and would love to see the bond in a sequel and the cast return.  The story is more than passable when compared to the average game and it was published by EA, see EA let a developer do what they want and they will make a good game, so please don’t fuck this up like every other franchise. OVERALL THE CAST IS A WELCOME ADDITION AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE A SEQUEL EVOLVE THE CHEMISTRY FURTHER, INSTEAD OF BEING MOSTLY EXPOSITION OR MAGUFFIN. Star Wars is loved for the characters in the world, not the other way around. Also it acknowledges the prequels and uses some of it instead of ignoring it to make it better.  2 for 2 with Mandalorian as well

   [*]   The WORLD AND EXPLORATION has I think 5 or 6 planets to explore, they are mostly for exploring to get new powers and the weirdly purely cosmetics only secrets with the rare HP boosts and bosses. The worlds are populated with animal, environmental hazards, fun and interesting platforming, with some actually good puzzles that I didn’t expect seeing as the target audience is for. I would say that this is better than the action in this game from a design point with a lot more challenge and fun varied stuff to do. The robot companion BD-12 is as always with star wars pals, cute and got that charm.

[*] SPEAKING OF BOSSES the main ones are mainly pretty weak and feel again generic with mash buttons and they block waiting for some QTES in some of them, can we stop with that. The final boss is great and feels more like an actual fight, the bounty hunters are the standout for sure. They aren’t a huge variety in them as I found them all, but they feel fresh and fun to fight even if for the most part they aren’t a challenge, well I am a Jedi and they don’t use lightsabers. I would love to see this expanded and used as a template for how the bosses should go, just make them have more than one or two attacks and an actual challenge
[*]COMBAT IS OVERALL THE WEAKEST PART OF THE GAME FOR A COUPLE REASONS, FIRST THE GOOD. I like the variety of enemies, each one has something to mix up the formula and keep it fresh throughout the game, very similar issue I had with Control and is usually the case with AAA games. None are really challenging with most of them having just one attack or defense, like can’t be pushed, has heavy unblockable attacks, rapid fire guns and more that I would of loved to see pushed further for those wanting a challenge, with most enemies being placed in a manner that fights never required heavy planning. I do like that this follows the same design as Sekiro with parry and stance mechanics that I hope become a new norm in sword based games.

[*]NOW THE BAD PART OF THE COMBAT and this is coming from some that has played a fair bit of games including Jedi Academy, Kingdom Come Deliverance. Sekiro, Furi and now Ghostrunner, this game is a pale imitation for both fans wanting to feel like a Jedi and have meaningful swordplay. If you want to know why those are great and this isn’t, the reviews for each are below. I don’t think most people will disagree on the combat feeling like a reskin of just about any major Hack and Slash game like Assassins Creed, even the great God of War reboot, or the other standard combat system like the Batman series. So that points a picture on how the combat feels. So if you haven’t played any of the standout melee games I’ve mentioned, this game will be better for you most likely. I get the game wants kids to play so you can’t chop humans up and they get around that with robots and animals being able to get slashed and boy does it make a MASSIVE DIFFERENCE IN FEEL. Also max difficulty doesn’t make the game that much better; I do like that each bump up makes the parry window less forgiving. Other than that it’s artificial stats.

[*]The FORCE POWERS being the staple of what makes a Jedi game standout look to Jedi Academy for how to do it perfectly. Here you do get a watered-down version with the sith ones gone and I can see that for story and character reasons. Most of the time I used them is for the metroidvania style exploration to push, pull and freeze puzzles to progress. This is fine as it breaks up the pacing of the game and might go into the realm at times of feeling like a Tomb raider vibe instead of A Jedi vibe, but it’s better at it than the game that are known for it, so kudos Respawn. Heavy attacks never felt like could be used it’s long timing and short windows. THE FORCE POWERS FOR ME CAN BE SUMMED UP IN USED ON CANNON FODDER TO CHEAPLY GET THE FEELING OF POWER INSTEAD OF EARNING IT BY USING THEM IN YOUR ARSENAL TO OVERCOME THE ODDS AND BECOME AN ACTUAL JEDI.

     [*]    TECHNICAL ISSUES AND PRAISE:  I had to reduce to 1080p with a GTX 1080, seems to be poorly optimized for stable above 60 fps at 1440p. Crashed twice, once during the final boss fight, has a lot of stutters that happen. It’s one big load at the boot of game. It does mask its loading very well and hope to see more games do this, by traveling in the ship instead of just a normal loading, and tight going through tight crawl spaces during gameplay, which is standard, but noticed it way more in this game than most.

The combat system is satisfyingly challenging, requiring precise timing, strategy, and the effective use of defensive maneuvers and offensive combinations. The lightsaber battles are truly epic, allowing you to unleash your inner Jedi or Sith as you face formidable adversaries.

The attention to detail in Fallen Order is exceptional. The game's visuals are stunning, capturing the iconic Star Wars aesthetic with meticulous care.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a gaming masterpiece that flawlessly captures the essence of the Star Wars universe. With its stunning graphics, immersive gameplay, captivating storytelling, and exceptional acting, Respawn Entertainment has created an unforgettable experience that will leave fans and newcomers alike in awe.

Let's start with the graphics. From the moment you step foot into the galaxy far, far away, you're greeted with a level of visual fidelity that is truly breathtaking. The environments, whether it's the ancient forests of Kashyyyk or the bustling streets of Nar Shaddaa, are meticulously designed with incredible attention to detail. Each planet feels alive and unique, immersing you in its beauty and danger. The character models, especially the protagonist Cal Kestis and his companions, are rendered with remarkable realism, bringing them to life in a way that feels authentic and true to the Star Wars universe.

The gameplay of Jedi: Fallen Order is equally exceptional. As Cal Kestis, a young Jedi on a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you embark on a thrilling adventure filled with intense lightsaber combat, challenging puzzles, and exhilarating platforming. The lightsaber combat system is deeply satisfying, allowing for precise strikes, parries, and Force abilities that make you feel like a true Jedi. The platforming sections are well-crafted, requiring skill and agility to navigate treacherous landscapes and uncover hidden secrets. The inclusion of Metroidvania elements, where exploration and backtracking are rewarded with new abilities and upgrades, adds depth and replayability to the game.

One of the standout aspects of Jedi: Fallen Order is its captivating storytelling. The game's narrative is a gripping tale of redemption, discovery, and the fight against the dark forces that threaten the galaxy. The characters are well-developed and engaging, each with their own unique personalities and motivations. Cal's journey is filled with emotional moments and unexpected twists that keep you invested from start to finish. The story seamlessly weaves itself into the larger Star Wars lore, introducing new elements while staying true to the established canon.

The acting in Jedi: Fallen Order is top-notch. The voice performances, led by Cameron Monaghan as Cal Kestis, deliver a level of authenticity and emotional depth that enhances the overall experience. The interactions between characters feel natural, and the dialogue is well-written, immersing you further into the game's world. The cinematic cutscenes are beautifully crafted and showcase the talents of the actors, bringing pivotal moments to life with cinematic flair.

In terms of game mechanics, Jedi: Fallen Order shines in its balance of combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The skill tree system allows you to customize Cal's abilities to suit your preferred playstyle, offering a sense of progression and mastery. The integration of the Force powers into combat and puzzle-solving is seamless, providing a satisfying sense of empowerment and creativity. The level design is cleverly crafted, encouraging exploration and rewarding those who venture off the beaten path.

In conclusion, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a triumph in every aspect. Its stunning graphics, immersive gameplay, engaging storytelling, and superb acting come together to create an unforgettable Star Wars adventure. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a newcomer to the franchise, this game will transport you to a galaxy far, far away and make you feel like a true Jedi.

The only major downside is gonna have to be the rewards in the chests in this game. I fought early on the game some mini boss in the first planet for a poncho really? Upside to that is I got some training for the combat of the game.

First of all, we have no fast travel system. this game has 'bonfires' all over the map and you have to walk your way towards them each time. what makes this so much worse is that you get new powers that allows you to further explore a map. Meaning if you remember a place you couldn't get to before there is no quick way to get there, you have to slog through all the entire level.

There are also parts of the map that just don't load the actually platforms and you just fall through. And these aren't even particularly difficult to get through. in one dungeon i wanted to drop down to the lower flow instead of running around the entire dungeon (See criticism above), but when I landed on the platform that was solid before, I fell through the level. There are also entire ships that you would think you could jump on, but you will just fall through. Thankfully this game doesn't send you to a bonfire when you fall, but what can happen is you fall through a platform trying to find secrets and you have to start the level over again, because for some reason there IS NO QUICK TRAVEL! ugh.

Whenever you open up the game you have to deal with about 90s of intro music and animations playing at max volume. Think of CIv 6, and how only after you reach t he menu do you volume settings kick in. There are also forced 'load times' between planets. The reason why a game like mass effect had long ship animations was to allow the game to load. I didn't install this game on an NVME SSD to have to wait through fake load times.

there are also some strange animation things going on. One of them is just cosmetic, when you open a container underwater the container rattles around even though your droid doesnt enter. Others are kind of game breaking. the first miniboss monster you fight (toad looking thing) can just completely break its AI after a jump attack. or sometimes it just flies off into the heavens.

The basic gameplay loop is pretty good and the exploration itself isn't bad but the issues come up too frequently and takes away from the enjoyment. since this game is pretty old now it is safe to say these issues will never get fixed overall an EA/10",1684692083,1684692083,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are great, the fighting, animation is ok as well, the sounds are good too, it could have been an awesome game, but the story, the writing, the acting is so contradicting, that I couldn't enjoy a moment from it while gameing.

Spoiler:
We got a googly eyed jedi master, who turned it's back to the force ""lost, his connection"", but then chops down everyone with a lightsaber.

We got a night sister who attacks us furiously, but after we slaughter all of his brothers, she joins our side.
We got a pilot, who has a ship and never worries about anything, does not mention his pay, does not complain, no matter how many times we need to fly from one point of the galaxy to the other, or for any reason.

Oh boy.. I coul d go on and on. The wrioting is awfoul, it lacks any reason and immerison. It makes the whole experience unenjoyable.

First of all, this is an [b] updated review[/b], with +50 hours, after the review I made in 2020. And [b]after[/b] playing STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™, so the opinion might not be ‘fair’(?), but here I go.

[b] My thoughts about STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order™ [/b]

I love this game. When it first released, I was fascinated by everything on it. The story is well written, absorbing, entertaining, and all the characters are compelling. I remember craving for a game a la Tomb Raider (which I also love), where I could explore, collect things and get maps to 100%. This game delivered. Cal felt like a Lara Croft, but with a lightsaber.

The cinematics and the music are on point, and so is the action and gameplay*. The environments of each planet are beautiful on their own way, and having to unlock abilities to resolve puzzles makes the replayability of each planet a fun experience. The way it fits in the canon of the STAR WARS universe is even better. My only negative thought, and not about this game honestly, but everything EA:

[b] Requiring the EA App in order to play an EA game has to be the most absurd and infuriating thing I’ve experienced in videogames. And not only EA does it, but it’s sincerely annoying. Stop. Please. [/b]


[b] Do I recommend STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order™? [/b]

Yes, as a must, honestly. But also, please play it before its successor. Sounds like a stupid request, but the improvement in gameplay on the second one is so big that if you play this one after, you won’t have as much fun and you will even feel some things kinda… rusty.

STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order™ is Respawn's and EA's single-player game that, despite the little amount of faith from the publisher, has achieved great success in the world of Star Wars and games in general. The main character ( Cal Kestis ) is played by actor Cameron Monaghan, and the game itself features many voice actors we know from other Star Wars media, e.g. Dee Bradley Baker.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
The main plot is survival in a galaxy overrun by the Empire, and as we are a Jedi Padawan, this will not be an easy task. The game will lead us through several iconic planets that we have seen in TV series and movies, and each of them will give us new environments, enemies, and plot threads. Over the course of the game, we'll fight Cal's traumatic past and his uncertainty about the future, allowing us to see some cool visions, and visit the Clone Wars era to regain our abilities in the Force, eventually transforming into a true Jedi Knight. The characters themselves are very well written, Cal is a really multi-layered character, and the great acting and dedication of the actor playing him really adds a lot. He's definitely one of the best characters in Star Wars, and I'd love to see him in live-action someday. As for our companions, they are interesting enough, not only visually different, but also have different views on the galaxy, given that each of them played a different role in the Clone Wars, which ended up changing their lives for rather worse. Moving on to our main enemies, which are the Inquisitors, their characters are cool, and even cooler if you read the comics about their whole institution. The very end of the game is a great climax, and a good excuse for a juicy cameo. The only downside to all of this is that the game's main antagonist is quite a frequent enemy, which makes our subsequent interactions with her less interesting, not to mention that the cutscenes are the only barrier that makes most of the game's characters even able to survive until the end credits.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Still very solid, but here I start to have slight problems with the game. But first, the positives. I really liked the locations we visit, there is a good amount of them, they have many nooks and crannies to explore, different collectibles, and different enemies, and even though there aren't that many in the game, they are either stormtroopers or local animals, they are nicely modeled and original in their combat roles. Coming to the combat itself, I really enjoyed it, the game is well-balanced, it's not easy, but it's not impossibly hard either. And no, it's not a Dark Souls clone, the best example of this is that parrying is more important than rolling around like a lunatic. The developers really wanted to give us a lot of opportunities to approach different situations in different ways, using lightsaber powers and combat forms, and they managed it, every fight can be exciting, giving us a lot of freedom. Going to the lightsaber, it's fun to swing, it's fast, but you can also feel the power of its strikes. It's just a shame there's no dismemberment ( at least when we are talking about humans ). A nice detail are also the comments of the opponents, who will actively comment on their situation and what is happening around them. However, I also sense a large portion of ludonarrative dissonance. The point is that although it's not a Dark Souls clone, this game follows the same logic of combat and bonfires, which are meditation points in this game. What was explained and made sense in Dark Souls is not here. Why do stormtroopers magically respawn in the same places every time we meditate? Can the Emperor's new generation of stormtroopers reproduce like amoebas around building corners/caves every time we take a break? And why can't I cut through doors with my lightsaber like Qui-Gon Jinn in episode 1, does the Empire have such a big budget that they installed beskar doors specially in case one of the 200 living Jedi in the entire galaxy decides to show up at that random planet? And why when fighting opponents with a higher health bar, a cool lightsaber fight turns into a baseball bat swinging where you have to pound and pound this opponent endlessly as if he wasn't just getting slapped in the face with a sun-surface-temperature lightsaber? I know it's a game, and it had to be done that way, but it's a bit inconsistent with the concept. At least the bosses are cool. What's not cool though is parkour in my opinion, there's a bit too much of it, and it's not smooth enough for me to enjoy it, and combined with the rather annoying puzzles, this game quickly turns into Tomb Raider: Space Edition. Which isn't cool though, because it's a Star Wars game after all, and I personally want to fight swarms of enemies and mow them down with my lightsaber, and not use my brain that much for these 20h. Maybe I just don't like puzzles and jumping from wall to wall every 2 minutes ( probably because of my total lack of patience ).
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
Despite the very good graphics, the game is very stable, there is no problem with FPS, and it does not crash to the desktop. Bugs are rather non-existent. The music is obviously standard Star Wars music, so that's always a plus, as are the sound and visual effects.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
Although not perfect, it is certainly one of the best Star Wars games on the market. A game that wasn't as good as it could have been because of EA's lack of faith in singleplayer games. I'm glad, however, that this game showed their mistake, and that Cal will soon have a whole trilogy of games under his belt, where the potential of the universe will develop dramatically ( and I'm still keeping my fingers crossed for the live-action version, but looking at Disney, it would be a total Russian roulette when it comes to quality ).

It was a great experience. 

- Combat was nice, unless i got ganged upon, improved when i got the two-sided blade upgrade. Wish there were more bosses. The AT-AT fight was fun, too bad it only happened once and cannot replay. 

- The story was great. Better than the Rise of Skywalker. 

-Map system was good. Especially important for a Metroidvania game. Sometimes i wished there were some ways to fast travel between save points, some other times i gotta give credits to the map design for linking the deepest end of the map back to the spaceship, so travelling back was not too frustrating.

- Dark Souls-like but easier: Souls-lite(?). No need to grind, loved it. Death was not too punishing, loved it too. Chests are for cosmetics only, no in-game currency, THE BEST.

- had some visual glitches during cutscenes. Cal was holding his lightsaber without his hand touching. Looked weird but nothing game breaking. Got pushed out of bound one time during the final boss fight though.

- a little bit of post game content. Not enough to make me want to start NG+.

During my 5 hours of gameplay, I was mostly jumping and climbing, that's it. The combat system in this game is kinda bad tbh, since the enemies are not different in terms of their attacks and combat mechanics are nothing special. And the thing, that I hate the most in this game is that, after finishing the main quest on some of the planets, you simply cannot return to your ship using the same path, that you used back when you just landed on the planet, so you will spend minutes returning back to finish the level. And another problem is, that exploration doesn't pay off, and I mean, that if you find a hidden area, it will have a crate with just a lightsaber customization thingies in most cases, and those custom mods for lightsaber don't do anything. So exploration is just pointless in this game. To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed, I expected more from this game, It's one of the few games that I didn't like in the last couple of years.

For pretty much exactly 20 years now my favorite Star Wars games (and two of my all-time favorite games in general) have been Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast and its successor Jedi Academy. Those two games have everything that a nearly perfect Star Wars game needs: A serviceable story with the distinct Star Wars atmosphere and some awesome cameos of Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca and Boba Fett, appropriate presentation that faithfully follows the movies, varied and action-packed leveldesign and last but not least absolutely revolutionary lightsaber combat that was unmatched at that time and still holds up well today. Nevertheless, even the best games start to age at some point, so I had high hopes that after all those years Jedi Fallen Order would finally pick up the staff as a sort of spiritual successor to the old Jedi Knight games and be the new best Star Wars game for the next 20 years to come. But oh well, it seems that the Jedi Knight series continues to comfortably sit on its throne: Jedi Fallen Order completely failed to fulfill my expectations by a very long shot. 

I have exactly three positive things to say about this: First, the presentation is beyond any doubt. Grafics, sound, voice-acting and animations are great and the opening chapter really gets you pumped with its cinematic staging. Second, Cal Kestis and his little droid are likable guys. Cal reminds me a bit of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and is a cool guy to play as. Finally, the numerous possibilities to customize your lightsaber are every Star Wars nerd's wet dream.

As soon as you get to the gameplay though, Jedi Fallen Order goes rapidly downhill. The game showed me first hand, why I have absolutely zero interest in Souls-like games: The combat is...meh. Again, the animations are top-notch and it is fun enough to throw Stormtroopers off ledges with force push, but all those boring, repetitive battles against all those generic animals and weird alien critters, with this combat system that i think is more of a glorified variation on quicktime events than anything else, is not exactly fun or engaging. It's rather annoying. If only the enemies wouldn't respawn everytime you meditate at a safe point, but oh well.

The biggest fault is the poor run-of-the-mill metroidvania concept, with it's confusing, irritating leveldesign and poorly copied Assassin's Creed parcour movement. All you do is stumbling around in those drab, lifeless, convoluted levels, opening chests that barely contain anything else than superficial cosmetics and then get lost or confused by one of the awfully designed puzzles. The leveldesign really killed the game for me. On Zeffo for example, the third planet you visit, I spent about close to two hours (including a peek into a walkthrough) just figuring out the proper way how to backtrack to my ship. Everything in those levels looks totally samey and the godawful map doesn't help jack-sh*t. Take this monotonous, bland and boring visual design of the environments plus the respawning enemies, add some more ridiculously annoying gameplay gimmicks (oh those slides, they make my blood boil) and voilá, you've got yourself some mediocre wannabe-Metroidvania gameplay that just feels horribly wrong for a Star Wars game. It's really a shame, because on some very few occasions Jedi Fallen Order has some worthy Star Wars moments, for example when you arrive on Kashyyyk in the middle of a fight between the rebels and the empire and hijack an AT-AT to wreak havoc. What could have been if only the game had more of this and less of all the b*llsh*t I mentioned before?

Jedi Fallen Order just steals some elements from other successful titles like Dark Souls, Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider, Uncharted and various Metroidvanias, slaps the Star Wars name on top and there you go. It does some things decent enough, but nothing really convincingly well. As a huge Star Wars fan who waited two decades for a proper Star Wars action-adventure with a focus on storytelling and lightsaber combat, it's a tough pill to swallow and really hard to admit, but Jedi Fallen Order is just one of those style-over-substance games, that is not really bad, but feels hollow and bland and is just downright boring and confusing for some long stretches. If only I had played this sooner, I really would've thought twice about pre-ordering Jedi Survivor Deluxe Edition for 90 g*dd*mn m*therf*cking Euros, but I was totally conviced, that it was simply impossible for this game to be anything else but absolutely great. I thought this was going to be on the very top of the Star Wars game food-chain, alongside games like Jedi Knight, X-Wing and Knights of the Old Republic. I was wrong. Very wrong.

So, if you have the same misguided expectations as I had, turn away from this game and never look back because:
This game is not about fighting breathtaking lightsaber duels against mighty sinister Sith Lords. It is not about evolving all the way from a measly Padawan to a powerful Jedi Knight, and it sure as sh*t is not about saving the galaxy from an unspeakably evil of epic proportions. 
It is about traveling back and forth between the same handful of completely lifeless planets in the most boring and drab corner of the Star Wars universe to collect f*uckin ponchos.

Fallen Order is a great third person action game that tells us the story of a Jedi Padawan that escaped the purge of Order 66 and is now on a journey to regain his powers and to rebuild the Jedi order. 

Visually it is a pretty nice game, the scenery is amazing and the characters as well. You will feel an immersed vibe because the whole game is full of action, full of intensity and very cinematic. The combat and movement mechanics are pretty great too and most of the areas and puzzles are cool to play with, the planets available to explore and where the story takes place are diverse, different and allow you a proper sense of exploration, since many times you will not be able to go from A to B because you did not unlock this power or that feature (you get the picture, normal game locking mechanics).

But the important thing to retain is that Fallen Order is without a doubt a great game and I fully recommend it! 
Quick last minute note that I believe that is relevant to many of you, if you do not wanna pay full price you can wishlist it and wait for a price drop, since it frequently appears on sale or you can subscribe to EA Play and enjoy it through there.

I have to mention the big game breaking bug I hit after going to another planet 20 hours into the game. I couldn't see anything cause a lot of the objects and the floor in front of me disappeared, 3d models that strecthed through the whole map into the camera.

here are two videos which showcase that:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDrpm9P5w-g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27bpmbCGt4A

first off, the game still stutters due to shader compilation issues during the game.

gameplay is pretty good, the jumping is janky and you will miss a ton of jumps, small bugs here and there like corpses spinning around, clipping through the floor and NPCs sinking slowly into the ground.
some enemy placements early on is really unfair if you don't do them in perfect order and save your force.
got stuck in a few places cause of the collision, only a game restart solved it.

in my opinion the gap between the third and last difficulty level is too big, there should have been another one.

The gameplay is made with controller in mind. If you like the typical ""reaction"" based gameplay where you have to press a button upon action of enemies, this is a game for you... for me it wasn't. 

Without liking the gameplay, the story and game world have to compensate to keep me immersed in the game. The story during the intro together with good world building did indeed a good job. Unfortunately, this only held up until the game left the linear section of the intro and released the player into an open world section (presumably the main part of the game).  Here, the story did not progress at all and simultaneously the world became extremely scarce. (Not a lot to search for, lots of running). I did not continue playing the game from here.

This is probably a game for console players with controllers, who generally like (re)action-based game mechanics like jump-and-run. It is not for people who like fps games or rpg.
