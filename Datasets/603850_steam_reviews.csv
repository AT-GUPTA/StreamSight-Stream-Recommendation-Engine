1. More timelines to pick from. I don't want much, but things like the Cold War or WW1 would be amazing.

1.1. If this game got a working workshop, creativity would explode. Imagine being able to download someones mod securely and not needing WinZip for it.

2. Formables. This game has a great amount already, so what this game needs is formables in more deserted parts of the map. What  I mean is that a lot of countries without formables aren't played as much, so engagement in multiple countries could increase a lot if they had more things to do.

There's a lot of content with minimal depth, and so it feels you're simply paying for an experience on figuring out a new strategy game. It's something I enjoyed, but that can also be a downside if mechanical depth is more your interest; due to the number of variables you have control over.

The AI is super simple, and obviously cheats to make up for that fact. The AI also has murderous tendencies where I've had seven different countries declare war on me without any reasonable proximity, all at once. Once these wars are going, there's a reasonable chance that the AI can and will keep throwing troops at you with no chance of winning, and no chance of surrendering to spite that.

It's also a very buggy game with sometimes game breaking bugs, and minor nuisances bugs feeling very common.

I wouldn't recommend this to be a go-to strategy game of choice.
This is more of a starter strategy game, or side-game if your game of choice is losing its luster.

However, it's definitely worth the money for the time you can get out of it.",1707922634,1707922634,True,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

The recent name change though, oh good lord. It doesn't do the game good, as it's about countries, and is not about following history. It's like calling a Fort a Field, A fort is well defended and commonly hard to breach, A field otherwise, is wide open to walk through. The original name ""Age of Civilizations II"" is much better of a representation, and does it good.
Still, please play this game if you enjoy this Genre.

Edit:
This game has not aged the best, lets establish that. This game is still fine but has not been updated in years, and still has a surprising amount of bugs. I'm not going to say you shouldn't try this game, but before you do please accommodate your mindset to it having aged without much maintenence.

This game is a strategic in-between to the extremes of Paradox games like HoI4 and the board game RISK. It's also a game with many customization options that are easily accessible. For example, if you have an issue with a formable nation requiring too much land, there's a way to change it. You can also make your own start dates, your own countries, your own leaders, etc. As a single player experience, it is absolutely incredible that one individual made this game by himself. While, yes, this is a mobile game port, it's a REALLY GOOD mobile game. It deserved being put on PC just as much as Polytopia.

Unfortunately, multiplayer is heavily lacking. The only way to play with multiple people is with a ""Pass and Play"" system, which works on mobile fine I guess, but for PC it's terrible. There's also no Steam Workshop, meaning that if you want to use things created by other people, it requires a lot of effort and troubleshooting to get right. That certainly applies to making maps for the game as well. It's possible, but requires an external program, a lot of trial and error, and knowing what files need to be edited. The game would benefit heavily from having a map creator built-in, but that is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

The biggest issue, though, is how buggy this game is. It certainly takes some getting used to, but while most can be avoided when you get the hang of things, some will pop up every time you play the game. I don't blame the developer, who has likely put as much time in the game as he wanted to and wishes to move on, but it'd be nice to see this stuff fixed. If relations with other nations reset to 0 after turn 1000, or the names go completely bonkers, or the screen starts randomly flashing, you're simply just gonna have to deal with it for now. If you don't buy it because it's buggy, I can't blame you.

HOWEVER, if you are thinking about buying this game, I think you absolutely should. It isn't a perfect game, but if you only care about single player, this game is worth more than its price point would even indicate. Those flaws are very outweighed by the game's positives. You buy this game to create scenarios with little effort compared to many other games. You buy this game to create an empire without having to learn thousands of in-game systems. You buy this game to do WHATEVER you want to do. This game will fall out of many's favor as they begin to prefer other more complicated, less buggy games, but personally I think this is a grand first step into playing strategy map games.

UPDATE: Since AoH3 is releasing sometime in the future, many may wonder whether it's still worth buying this game. Everything above still applies, and I honestly think this will still be a good first step strategy game after RISK. AoH3 is moving into real-time instead of a turn-based system, is likely adding generals, army compositions, techs, laws and reforms, more provinces, and god knows how much else. If AoH3 delivers on everything, I'd recommend it as a step 2 more than likely. Also, the original Age of History is bad. Do not even bother trying to find it.",1680264134,1705413061,True,35,1,0.79447019100189209,2,True,False,False

I'd overall recommend it for its price, and it has a lot of features that I feel like are missing from other history / conquest games. Forming new nations after taking land, forming unions, and releasing new puppets are all amazing features that make this game a lot more enjoyable.

10/10 for its price.",1664577091,1705088446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Age of History II is an immersive strategy game that allows players to rewrite history. With a vast selection of countries and scenarios to choose from, but offers a bad gaming experience. Whether you go diplomacy, warfare, or economic strategy, this game anyway make you go on war with everyone.

There no attention to historical detail. History going by his way, it's adds a layer of intrigue to each playthrough. The gameplay may be intimidating at first, but by time you will understand all tricks of the game.

Overall, Age of History II is a horrible for fans of strategy games and history gamers. But anyway this game can interest by his easy gameplay, whether you're commanding mighty empires or a city.",1560265351,1703677075,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Easy to learn
- Highly Customizable
- Built-in Scenario Editor
- Can run it easily even on a potato PC
- Turn based gameplay
- A Europe, World, and Asia map
- Easy to Modify files

Cons:
- Minor/Less Game breaking bugs
- Major/Game Breaking bugs
- Zero game fixing updates
- Pretty bad AI
- Turns at times take long

There are many bugs, but there's only 4 (that I've found) that are Game breaking.

1. The UI disappears, and the map starts flashing (I've sometimes fixed this by pressing Esc.)

2. Save games don't work (I've fixed this by loading other working save games)

3. Turns freeze (I have no clue how to fix this)

4. Game crashes when you load a save game (Happens when a save game is bugged, usually fixed by going into the games files and removing the latest one.)

Overall, I really enjoy the game, and would recommend it if you can deal with the bugs. It's easy to learn, but hard to master. I also recommend that you play with mods, since they make the game experience much better. However, since Lucas never fulfilled his promises, there's no workshop. However, there is a forums page where you can install mods. So overall, pretty good game I guess. 7.5/10",1703641353,1703641353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's start with the AI, it's beyond infuriating. The in-game artificial intelligence is as dumb as a sack of bricks. They engage in wars that make no sense, wars they can't possibly win, and refuse to surrender even when you've occupied 80% of their territory and just want a couple of provinces. It's like dealing with an army following orders of ""no step back,"" reminiscent of the Soviets or the futile defense of the Reichstag by the Germans.

And don't even get me started on the technical issues. The game is riddled with bugs and crashes. The forced autosaves, which you can't even turn off, cause constant disruptions, leading to frequent crashes. Sometimes, the game decides to fling you across the map for no apparent reason, making it more of a frustrating experience than an enjoyable one.

The sheer annoyance caused by these technical problems has reached a breaking point for me. It's disheartening to see a potentially great game ruined by the negligence of the developers. The lack of support, combined with the numerous bugs and the infuriating AI, has soured my experience to the point where I no longer have any desire to continue playing.",1702308707,1702503133,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The A.I need serious improvement . I could occupy an entire country, want a single province, yet they still refuse peace with me. I could be at war with someone across the map for 100 turns, because they refuse peace despite us not having fought a single battle. The AI will also have very little army in most tiles. Then have 7500 Troops in a random tile. They spread out like a cancer if they make a single breakthrough with the 7 thousand troops they randomly have in one tile. 

Next, I hate how I will randomly be directing my troops, then for some reason the game flings me over half way across the map. I don't think its a problem on my end because I have never experienced this before. 

finally, the tutorial is confusing and unhelpful. On top of that, I still dont know how to stop my troops from moving someplace. Once they are set it wont let me move them away or someplace else. I say this because the tutorial didnt bother to teach me IF it is even a feature.

The prices you've applied to Turkey seem like a joke. As a country, we didn't switch to the dollar; Steam switched to the dollar to keep prices stable in Turkey and prevent constant fluctuations. What you should have done was convert the price you applied to us into dollars. In other words, the price would have remained the same, and we would have purchased it in dollars. This was what Steam communicated to us. Despite knowing our low purchasing power, you would never make sales at these prices. You can't manipulate Turkish gamers in this way. Good luck.

If you are looking for cheap and simple strategy game and you always wanted to play some games like this one but they were too hard for you - this is where you should start. Yet, this game is not even close to being perfect strategy game.
[hr][/hr]
[h2]Advantages[/h2]
- Game is really simple. You can learn every mechanic in less than 2 hours of playing.
- In my opinion this is best looking game of this kind. Simple and realistic. You can really feel like strategist over a war map.
- Description of the game is lying. This game is really easy to master...
- ...and that makes it perfect as entrance to the world of strategic games!
- Game has a lot of scenarios, maps and settings so you can make it easier/harder.
- You can spend a lot of time in the game. 
- You can recreate Roman Empire and get achievement for forming Australia-Hungary XD
- Cheap
[hr][/hr]
[h2]Disadvantages[/h2]
- Game is simple and easy to master so you will have no challanges.
- A lot of bugs. Your army can sometimes disappear or after too much time on the save the diplomatic relations are broken.
- No updates 
- No realism in the game. Unrealistic economy, diplomacy, amounts of units. Head of the country can live like 300 years.
- There is multiplayer in the game but it's really bad. The mechanics of the game make multiplayer gameplay really slow.
- Music and audio isn't really good. You can hear the main theme in a lot of youtube videos.

Very little strategy if any (basically the country with higher numbers wins), AI is dog-water and just declares war/makes peace seemingly at random, and diplomacy is bare-bones and easily exploitable, just to name a few flaws. Also, for one reason or another, the dev went completely dark and the game hasn't had a proper (as in any update that isn't just a new pointless scenario) update in around 4-5 years, so what you get now is pretty much what it's always going to be. Its a shame too, because I think if this game got some polishing and actual content updates, it PROBABLY could've been a really fun game. The only reason I still play it from time to time is that it's a kinda decent time waster, but even as a time waster the bugs can be really annoying and even game breaking. If you're looking for a well designed 4X grand strategy game that can rival HOI4 or EU4, this definitely is not it.

Clicking on buttons I managed to move some armies but they evaporated before they arrived at the destination. If they lost a battle somewhere it did not make the news!

Such a great game that really beats all other strategy games in my opinion that is unplayable. It would not take long to fix this either. Just very unfortunate. Very buggy game. IF these issues were fixed, it would get a 10/10 BUT since the game is not really playable, I give it a 2/10.

[h1] Description [/h1]

[b]Age of History II[/b] is an indie game created by ≈Åukasz Jakowski about trying to conquer the world as a country of your choice. I got acquainted with this game in 2020, and until now I play it from time to time with long breaks. There's not much to say about this game, except that you can play many scenarios (e.g. 1440s, Napoleonic Wars, World War I or World War II, or Modern Day), create your own, edit countries, gain the entire world and achievements... and basically that's it. 

The huge downside of this game, which in my opinion ruins most of the fun of the gameplay, is the AI of other countries - it is terrible. Imagine that you play such Sweden and suddenly out of your ass such Congo sends you a diplomatic insult, and such Kazakhstan declares war on you. Kazakhstan, declaring war on Sweden. The worst is when, as a result of a war between other countries, the borders are changed to heavily chaotic and unrealistic (so-called bordergore). Oh, and there's also the situation when the state you're at war with has territories inside another state with which you don't have good relations. Because of this, that state blocks you from gaining a province, through which you can't end the war.

Other than that, the game is great and there is a lot of fun with it. I recommend playing it when you are bored.


[h1] Ratings [/h1]

[b]PC Requirements: Small .[/b]
Small requirements for low-resolution maps.

[b]Gameplay: 7/10[/b]
I love the idea of me being a leader of a country, and trying to conquer the world, and that's additional 2 points for gameplay. Otherwise, it's very repetive and could have been created better. WHERE IS THE UPDATE, ≈ÅUKASZ?!?

[b]Soundtrack: 3/10 [/b]
I'm not hating on Kevin MacLeod, cause he's a legend for making all of his songs free. It's just the soundtrack consists of literally 15 nonoriginal songs. And it loops. So after having a playing session for 3 hours it becomes so painful that I need to mute the music and use my spotify / some YT essays.

[b]Graphics: 7.5/10[/b]
They are not that bad, but not the best either.

[b]Difficulty: 3/10 [/b]
The game is VERY easy to learn and a little bit hard to master. It's very simplistic.

[b]Game Time: INFINITE + Fan content: 2/10[/b]
You can play as long as you want, so it's infinite ig. Also there is almost none fan content (mapping is NOT a fan content of GAMES).

[b]Price: 8.5/10[/b]
Fair price, could be a little cheaper.

[b]Overall: 6/10[/b]
Even, if it IS one of the games that I grew on, I can't give it more than 6/10 due to all of the bugs and stupid AI in this game. Still waiting for updates, that aren't even happening. I'd reccomend playing if you

As i was aiming to get 100% achievements, i begun to loathe everything about this game, from the UI to the AI. The only saving grace is being able to cheese most achievements by starting hot seat games with a ton of players for the specific goal of getting certain achievements, and some regionlocked scenarios still allowing you to form annoying unions (like australia-hungary).

Now, in hidnsight, as much as I did have some amount of enjoyment playing it as a kid/young teen, I must admit this this game is honestly...bad.

The graphics are a no-brainer. They look awful. The world map is actually the color of vomit unless you either cover every square inch of the planet with country land (which reminds me of something I'll get back to later) or download a mod to make the graphics better, hopefully also one which fixes the disgustingly bad province borders and lack of content in this game.

The mechanics are dull, repetitive, and buggy as hell. To take out a loan, all you need to have is a certain number of arbitrary points, which mean little in the grand scheme of things, and are usually not even indicative of how well your nation is doing, usually they just mean that you 1. haven't done anything, which includes: diplomacy, loans, changing your capital, changing your ideology, going to war, moving troops, raising troops, colonization, tribal migration, etc. (Pretty much everything in the entire game is lcoked behind a pricetag of these points) or, 2. you happen to own certain high-value provinces which, I might add, are pretty much all in very questionable locations across basically only the western world or China. Meaning it's borderline impossible to successfully play and dominate as a non-white or non-China nation, especially in the modern day scenario, which I might add is not only very outdated (which I'll let slide since the game hasn't been updated in years) but also have some...VERY poltically questionable choices. So, Mr. Lukasz: You placed a ton of valuable provinces in Russia, labeled Putin's regime as a democracy, and made them essentially unstoppable unless you have already conquered basically all of Europe or Asia first? I see what you did there, you dirty bastard. (Okay, but in all seriousness, the ideology part of this game means essentially nothing other than ""ooh, look, my flag changed!"" and is imbalanced in a way that essentially makes it pointless to even be certain ideologies, and the way that nation power is calculated is skewed in a way that literally can never produce historically likely results.

Now for the gameplay. I already touched on some of the functions of the game already, but one of the biggest flaws in the gameplay is that there is absolutely no strategy. The only way to win is ""big number beat small number"". There are never any underdogs except through the rare case of sheer luck by conquering/colonizing their small neighbors. Now let me ask a question. If I am at good relations with another country, have an alliance with that country, hell, even have a literal non-aggression pact with them, then WHY WOULD THEY DECLARE WAR?! I am completely convinced that there just actually is no AI in this game, and that Lukasz set up a twelve-sided dice as the nation AI's, with at least eight sides being ""randomly declare war on random neighbor and then die"". Also, the zoom feature sucks and having a turn-based grand strategy game only works in the Civilization series, not in an EU4 clone. 

Now this is just my personal opinion (which is allowed to exist on reviews, by the way) but although I was mostly cutting Mr. Jakowski some slack when I used to play this game because of his English non-first-language status (some things are misspelled, including some country names, a few country names even have missing characters or incorrect text formatting), and because of the game being kind of old and outdated, the choice to force you to literally assimilate other races of people (which, from the scream sound effects that play when you execute the action, makes it seem like you're purging them) is alarming. There is no such thing as multiculturalism in this game and I'm concerned for how that will poltically affect the minds of people who play this game nonstop. Okay, political BS over.

Overall, I could go on for hours about how this game frustrated the devil out of me, but I digress that it would likely be a restatement of what I've already said.

For the love of whatever god or lack thereof you believe in, do not play this game. Go buy Hearts of Iron 4 or Crusader Kings 3 and learn how to play. Please, for Pete's sake. There are thousands of quality mods for those games that could give you whatever experience you could dream of in a map game. Or, if you're a more casual player, get one of the games in the Civilization series, it doesn't matter which one. Please leave this mobile game port hunk of junk alone and save your five dollars up for a better game. The pricetag of the aforementioned better map games is absolutely worth it. 

And if you're too young to afford them, just literally don't play grandstrategy games. Kids shouldn't be simulating a modern day WW3, they should go have friends in the real world. 

Play a better game or touch grass. Your choice.",1589306902,1695231123,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is almost akin to ""my first Grand Strategy"", something you could use to introduce newcomers thanks to its approachability and free-for-friends remote play hosted multiplayer. But I'd definitely not recommend it to people who play HOI4 or Crusader Kings to get their rocks off.

Balance is finicky - it took me a few goes to start winning a game on normal difficulty but then there was nothing in the entire game that could threaten me.

For some reason, starting unit counts are randomized, so I might get none and other nations get hundreds, restart, totally different setup even with identical nations. This is one of the more noticable way AI exploits the game in an asymmetrical way.

AI will throw themselves into a situation they can't win as if their programming tricked them into thinking it would work. Repeatedly. They're not really trying to outsmart you just throw numbers at you regardless of your own. They rarely split units, or reinforce smaller numbered forts. They almost always attack even when they should be on defense.

Tying movement points to construction building means you can't build as many things per turn as you could otherwise, and if gold excess is such a problem you need to artificially limit how much I can spend per turn, then lower how much gold is given out lol.

Regarding naval movements; units can enter islands from the sea but cannot enter the sea without a port. THERE ARE A LOT OF ISLANDS that are isolated territories so have fun building a port for every single one.

Regarding the game's says-on-the-tin-simplicity: It might be too simple. There's only four things you can do; build something, make or move units, fiddle with economy sliders, and (really REALLY barebones) diplomacy.

Another thing that annoys be is that if you select a territory, then click another, it'll try to move the units even if you didn't hit move. It's really annoying and makes it hard to skim through territories, which should be easy.

I dunno. It's a cheapy and might be fun to remote play with your friends, since there's only one copy needed it's the cheapest multiplayer grand strategy there is. But the simplicity, fiddliness and wonky difficulty makes it very difficult for me to recommend for solo play, but I found it a lot more approachable than HOI4 so, it has that going for it.",1693471778,1693471778,False,29,3,0.645705878734588623,0,True,False,False

I remember playing the first game on bus rides back in high school and it was great for setting simple goals and accomplishing them. This just feels unfocused.

Playing tall is also very fun clicking on every single individual province to build a building it's almost like most games don't have a building system to prevent having to take 10 minutes to industrialize your country. I was also invaded by Nigeria, Angola, Iraq, and Belgium which I completely love because it makes absolute logical sense that Finland an Afro-Arab country which is a historic region of the Benelux should be apart of these nations. The only war that I had against ai aggression that made no sense was against Norway because I don't see how an Afro-Arab country which is a historic region of the Benelux would be apart of Norway in any way at all very unrealistic. And after this game I honestly wanna try playing on a higher ai aggressiveness level because all that was at the lowest level and I'd always find myself getting attacked by some random ass nation half way across the world who would send their entire army just to take me over dedicating their whole economy to see the end of my nation when I've never had a diplomatic interaction with them prior and I really didn't care about them trying to play tall that game. And untill now I have never appreciated the Eu4 and Hoi4 building systems so much being able to click on a building I want to build then provinces to build them on which is a lot more efficient then clicking on one province then the building one province then the building on province then the building and so on. I also cannot wait to try out using max ai aggression so I can be invaded by multiple nations half way across the world like Tonga, Guinea, Bissau, Afghanistan, Bhutan, El Salvador, and more while playing Lithuania. The ai makes it seem like I insulted their whole blood line attacking me constantly with such hatred. I mean maybe I'm stupid because from school I was never taught how Finland is a very integral part of the Iraqi state but I believe that this game defintely can justify how that makes sense I probably never learned enough history about how Finland is a very integral part of Belgium, Nigeria, Angola, and Iraq just as it would make sense for Bulgaria to invade North Macedonia.",1692203652,1692204706,False,13,9,0.556223809719085693,8,True,False,False

The game is good. i have 1 major problem that ruins the whole game and that is the saving game problem.
every 50 turns, it auto saves but saving it manually will not actually save it. you exit the game, thinking that you would return to that game you left, but end up 45 turns behind which makes wars confusing because now you gotta do it all over again.

There are lots of little mistakes as well but i don't think, they are too big of an issue.

Still a 4 star game in my opinion.",1692169793,1692169793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Throughout several occasions I felt I was on a ""trip"" completely detached from my body... A freaking good game, sorta addictive. 

Most of the cases I applied a merely simple tactic which proved to be efficient in continuously striking deep into the enemy's lines. Advancing towards the enemy's frontiers, and maintaining a well-coordinated push, utilizing the principles of blitzkrieg and recruit in every single turn. Simultaneously, having a backup plan to secure the territories are being conquered. Once a province is captured, strong defensive units are left beind to impede any counter-attack. A ""worm"" tactic in steps. One army is always followed behind by another aided with recruitment.

At this game the learning curve is relatively gentle, allowing players to gradually grasp the complexities of the game as they progress. However I would not play it while suffering from ADHD... just these loads of details and attributes, not for everybody.

Customization is superb though I must say, being able to create nations, edit them, as well as redesign the map completely is great, I haven't played with those mechanics but those who want to create a world of their own, do a bit of self RP and all I can see them enjoying. (I haven't tried to rehaul or edit the Earth map of this game so I am unsure if you are able to do this, but I was able to create my own nation in this game).

Overall I can see someone enjoy this if they like creating their own universe or nations, though to me trying to get the achievements is such a hassle, it was more challenging with the random AI behavior. I won't say it is as Easy as Hearts of Irons IV but the customization can make it easier. It is just simpler than Hearts of Iron IV and not too complex as the description says. It did challenge me a bit (loved and hated the challenge it gave me).

Currently, it seems as though it has not been updated for about 2-3 years. Unsure if it is worth the $5 but seems reasonable than Hoi4 DLC's and all lol. So up to you if you want to give it a go. I am unsure if I want to play this in the future but maybe if I get the inspiration to create a world and other nations then I probably would come back to it.

I've pretty much mastered this game, and I'll tell you the worst part about it: this game is shallow. The work is excellent; Lukasz did a great job making this sequel a significant improvement from the first game, but if you have a pc that can run it, you can just play Crusader Kings 2 for free or buy another strategy game with much more depth, the most similar to this one coming to mind being Europa Universalis 4. But, if you are forced to play this be it by system specs, zoomer brain, or platform, it's a great time waster. you can spend tens of hours doing different little strategies and just messing around. Guides online will tell you how to edit the game to put in your own fantasy realms to play with, Vassals are very satisfying, It can feel like I'm commanding and expanding an iron curtain of sorts. You can scatter or solidify and paint the map as you like, within the confines of the bulky provinces. With mods you can truly make border art with tens of thousands of provinces. Hearts of Age of History 2 on the AoH2 website is phenomenal with more advanced coding to include capitulation and a truly terrifying China on such a large map. For Lukasz or someone else wanting to speedrun the achievements like I just did; There is a bug with the AI. If you release a vassal that was never on the map before, they will always give you infinite money so long as they like you enough. This coupled with the inability of the AI to ever trade away land makes the game less enjoyable overall. This bug coupled with another that manipulates saves allowed me to get all achievements other than the conquering ones in less than 4 hours. Congrats and thanks to Lukasz for this game. Entering and exiting the editor after exiting your game will make a temporary scenario, with only the world armies reset. You can then make a new game where you left off, circumventing the save break that can happen after too many turns. Finally, it would be wise if another sequel is made to make the player lose the game when they reach 0 provinces automatically. If in an alliance, or sometimes just on your own so long as you're the defender in a war, you can convince the AI not to take anything, ask for reparations, or otherwise.",1688341206,1688450600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game does it all, if you want WW2 this game got it, if you want 1444 EU4 start date this game got it, if you want to play on another planet you can. You can make your own maps, scenarios, countries, etc... But this game is still ass. It has huge potential but developer just abandoned game, ever since i got it nothing was added or changed (maybe 2 or two scenarios that i played once and never again). There is so many annoying bugs. For example if you annex vassal while they are at war every territory they occupied in war will become their owned land and they will have truce with you, instead of annexing vassal, removing them from you and transfer land they occupied to your occupation. There is bug where country names go all over the place and you have to turn them off. If you are at war with x country, and x country gave military access to y country, and you attack territory of x country while y country troops occupy that province, they will declare war on you, this might not seem like a big deal but it is game breaking sometimes. You might not understand what i wanted to say, but point is that there is too many game breaking bugs and annoying bugs that will never get fixed, there are exploits that will never get fixed. 

Where is workshop page that was promised back in 2018? I first played Age of Civilizations when i was 12, when this game came out i bought it right away, but i guess that developer saw it more as quick money grab rather than passion project he will work on.

Step 1 editor. Editor in this game avaible you to do many scenarious ,but you can upload scenarios from other player. You can edit contry , scenarious, evens leaders maps and more.

Step 2 playing this game is not hard as you think. Is very simple. Is not like hearst of Iron or other games like Hoi. This fact allow yoo to relax in first minutes of playing.

Step 3 You can play with your friend or someone else togeter on the same computer.  There is a way to play multiplayer, but it's a bit complicated.

Step 4 Very low hardware requirements.

Step 5 Small price



Why not:



Step 1 The game no longer gets updates and it's kind of dead.

Step 2 Bugs... Not many ,but still.

Step 3 Stupid AI




Neutral:



At least half of the achievements can be cheated

Can be played on most PCs without problems
Strategy game that doesn't require a PhD to play
Several different mechanics to keep the game entertaining
Different ideologies with different effects
Relatively large modding community which adds different systems and nations
Several scenarios
Relatively accurate historical maps
Formables which create a goal to aspire to
Many languages supported
Create custom scenarios, nations, formables, and more

Negatives:
Abandoned by developers
Either lose immediately or conquer the world after several hours
Several systems are underdeveloped and easy to manipulate
Easy to reach 1st place on the leaderboard
Formables have little effect other than changing names
After some attacks on a country, they will either summon a billion units or have nothing
AI is extremely unpredictable

Presonal review: 8/10. The game is fun in the beginning stages of it, but loses that flare when you keep going after your win is practically guaranteed. I'd rather use modded versions, because that community is still alive and adding new things to the game to keep it fun and difficult.

It's the prefect game for those of us who like grand-strategy map games, but do not want to spend 13 hours just building up an army to get crushed 40 minutes into your first war. The longevity of a single play-through depends heavily on 3 factors 1. How strong is your country at game start? 2. What difficulty are you playing? 3. What do you want to conquer/accomplish?
Campaigns (playing as one country in a continuous game) can last anywhere from a few hours to a week or 2.
The only major criticism I have is that on the lower difficulties, when playing as a nation ranked ~40th-1st it is very easy to get so powerful that basically nothing other than massive coalitions feel like a challenge. Id recommend always playing on at least regular (avoid beginner) difficulty for play-throughs as nations ranking in the top 40 powers.",1562197594,1687218553,True,3,0,0.5215110182762146,0,True,False,False

It still has glitches, very much so in the ""Age of Civ"" mode where you get to go from a one province to an empire. It also lacks a great amount of common sense features. If your vassal gets attacked, you have to manually declare in their defense rather than being pulled into it. You cannot integrate vassals, you have to either attack them (and cause any other vassal see you as evil) or ""form a union"" which only worked once with an ally in my playthrough. Even though my vassal was at +99, they still denied.

Original Review Below

I played the first game A LOT on the app store (Google Play - Samsung) and consistantly had a fun time and beat the game on world conquests. While this game is pretty similar, but with more depth I never go anywhere with the games I play and I just end up getting bored over and over again.

If you liked the first you might like this, if you want a much more simple Civ 5-esque then this might be good, but honestly I find it boring nowadays.

I still play Rimworld / Civ 5 &Civ 6 / EU4 / CK3 and more of the 4X / Conquest games so I haven't fallen out of genre.

Also, the Dev need to update more. Its on par with the mobile of the first game, but its a much too little for a PC $5 title.",1604097766,1685377322,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At the FULL whopping price of 4 euros and 99 cents I imagined the risk was low and took a chance.
The expectations were low and I imagined that if it was not up to my liking then no harm done.

The game speaks of ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" and indeed the game is not too difficult getting into; quick look through the tutorial and off I went.
1200 start as the Mayan culture, found myself warmongering through lands yet still making an effort building up my civilization through research and investments as well as building defenses.
1 day, 12 hrs in and I now have my Mayan realm stretching from modern Mexico down to Nicaragua owning nearly all of the land and having vanquished at least 2 very powerful enemies that were a very hard challenge.
I only stopped playing because of my other passion: Formula 1 and the race that was about to start.

In short I can highly recommend this game if you are looking for a cheap and fun strategy game!
It's not the most intricate or expansive game in terms of ways to develop your realm but for this price you shouldn't expect it to be!
So far I can really enjoy and endorse this game, especially at this price and from what I have experienced so far I would have even been ok with paying double the amount and would still have given it a recommend!
With several scenarios / era's / important events in history to play with. there is a very high rate of replay value.

Every now and then I come back to this one, hoping that the community has working solutions for the built-in deficiencies, especially the save and load bugs. No solutions have been found, and the game has actually gotten more buggy as tech changes. It used to be rare that people had problems loading the game at all, but now it seems to be the dominant problem.

My thumbs down has to stand. The developer carried this project 95% of the way and ghosted. As of now, it's been years without a captain or updates, and there are still 1500 people in-game on a Monday morning. Incredible. I would milk this cow while making a bigger one for the fans. My fascination with what the hell is going on here is unending. I hope the dev isn't dead.

:::Original Review::
It's been years, and this otherwise wonderful game still suffers technical issues regarding saving and loading, among other not as severe issues. There appears to be an ineffective level of garbage collection happening, resulting in bloated memory use over time and an eventual crash. The auto-save feature eventually breaks and begins attempting to save, unsuccessfully, every turn. Turning off auto-save in favor of manual saving is useless, as upon loading, your game will be different, down to the empire you're playing.

Check my time playing. I did try to make this work out. For some time, I managed to jury rig it enough to be able to play, mostly through using a specific map and game settings. What I had to do is lengthy, and worked maybe half of the time, and does not work on the test version.

In the end, it's a broken product that shouldn't be sold if the company isn't going to support it and release patches to fix crippling problems in a timely way. The discussion area is littered with save/load issues, and the test version is in development hell. Good outcomes, so far, have not been a thing.

They went 95% of the way and called it quits, it seems. I can't recommend this product. What a shame.",1621345795,1678714843,False,21,0,0.645532011985778809,0,True,False,False

It's really fun for the first 5 hours, but then it becomes repetitive because it's almost impossible to lose‚Äîeven on the hardest difficulty. The AI complexity doesn't change at all, you just have a harder time making money so you're an easier target. But being attacked can be avoided by just spamming ""Improve Relations.""

That's it, that's the entire game. It's just spamming buttons and colouring your map. The only reason why I currently have 50+ hours played is because of the formable nations (Italy ---> Rome), but even that gets old really fast considering how few of those formable nations there are. Some of the greatest and most infamous kingdoms and empires are even missing.

Not to mention this game hasn't seen a proper update since 2020, so there's plenty of annoying bugs such as your camera randomly jumping to the corner of the map, or the names of nations getting jumbled.

This game also loves to throw random declarations of war on you, even though the nations are worlds apart. Sometimes I can't even tell where the invading country is, because the game doesn't mark it. That way, all you can do when a speck of a nation attacks you, is watch in bafflement.

At the end of the day, Age of History II is a good game if you're scared by Paradox's complexity, but the cons outweigh the pros, and you will get bored really quick.

Edit to answer OYOLORWT:

Well, a hundred people have a hundred differing opinions. If you enjoy the game, good! But it feels like I discovered the entire game in just 10 hours, the rest is me goofing around.

With such a small (actually non-existent) complexity, what is there to do? I genuinely wonder what you did in the game for 300 hours.

If you play through the tutorial for some 15 minutes, you've already mastered the game because there's nothing else to do here. Just MS Paint this map.

I understand that this game is made by just a single person, but compare it to HoI 4, for example. I've actually seen some people say that HoI 4 sucks compared to this, which is factually wrong. HoI 4 has bigger complexity. You actually have some objectives to strive towards to. You have regular soldiers, tanks, planes, ships...

In Age of History II, if you have 1000 soldiers and your opponent has 500, you win 99% of the time because this game only subtracts these two numbers. It doesn't take into consideration that a single soldier can kill 10 units or die with zero kills. That's how ""complex"" this game is.

I may sound like a brat, but unlike some of you, I have some standards when it comes to realism, tactics and overall entertainment.

Had to put it here because Steam only allows comments under 1000 characters.",1676736970,1678134696,False,48,6,0.646492242813110352,29,True,False,False

Now the bad things the game has not had an update in a wile, and there are some glitches in the game that can be annoying but the thing that am the most not happy about is that there is no workshop what for a game like this is insane i have to hope not getting a virus wile downloading mods and for a game that this dry to not a easy way to download mods is needed. Now to little problems dosen't have from the start a WW1 scenario and dosen't have a dosen't 1000ad that are needed. Also i wish there would be more maps focusing on continents like north and south america and africa [i know that there is already a eruope and Asia maps]. And more stuff to build in provinces like train rails that could move you troops faster but cost a bit of money, canals like the panama and Suez canals, more leaders and leaders changing with time also update leaders to some counrtys, better UI really needed, better multiplayer is needed really.

I'm not sure how this game got all the positive reviews it currently has. Maybe it's thanks the the legions of Polish accounts with only this game in their inventories, leaving generic reviews like ""good game"", ""great game"" and ""good game buy it"". Smart one dev, nobody will suspect a thing.

Let's move on.
A handful of time periods to start in, sure. Yes, you can pick pretty much any civ you want. So you've picked a civ. What now? Now it's time to abuse the infinite amount of bugs and oversights and take over the world!
Oh yeah, regarding the ""bugs and oversights""...
Puny one-tile AI civs can spawn in thousands of troops that clearly exceed their population. You can ask any country to go to war with another and offer nothing in return. They don't care, they'll accept it anyway. You can vassalise most of the world just by threatening to invade and they'll never call your bluff. If you're at peace for what the game deems to be too long, two random countries will declare war on you (I was very intimidated when Bahrain and Singapore declared war on my North African Empire, believe me!). You can repeatedly invest in the local economy of one province and practically generate infinite gold.
Saves often break, causing your hours of map painting to be completely wasted.
Cancer is apparently an infectious virus.
Within a few months of Covid emerging, coronavirus gets added as another disease in the game. Yeah, that was in good taste. Don't focus on the game-breaking bugs or anything, add new diseases instead.

""Fix the bugs, fix the bugs!"" the people cry.
""Nah lemme add another map and scenario instead"", our valiant developer says.

In the following, I will explain why it did and under what conditions it can do the same for you. Like probably not that few players of this game, I originally came from the Paradox Interactive section of the Grand Strategy genre, and therefore there'll be a little bit of a comparison in my review, hoping that this will help to distinguish the specialities of Age of History 2. 
Before getting to the positive aspects of the game that caused my rating, let me briefly mention the problems present, because no game can be without flaws, and I want to be potential buyers to feel well-informed. One of those flaws are of course bugs, of which there are some that I've run into multiple times, but not that many overall. The most bothersome I can think of is the bug that makes the player's units disappear from an occupied province after a peace deal, but that doesn't happen anywhere close to often. Another downside of the game is the almost complete lack of historical flavour, because after starting a campaign from a historical setting, there's really nothing to accompany the player through the centuries and supplying a feeling of change, progress or specific characteristics about each era. There are some mechanisms like exploration, colonialism and a simulation of the Holy Roman Empire, but other dynamics like the French Revolution are missing. The focus is clearly on the 1440 starting point which is also presented as the main scenario whereever you look. This kind of simplicity is defining for Age of History 2, as it aims at a streamlined and basic experience. It therefore doesn't offer any precise micro-management options or deep and realistic simulations, like other games are known for. Also being known to the aforementioned Paradox camp, I sometimes notice myself missing a greater range of functions and an in-depth world simulation, but I want to talk about Age of History like it is and what that means.
Depending on the perspective, this last point of critism can be seen as no disadvantage at all, but instead as one of the core strengths of the game. It actually closed an empty space in the Grand Strategy genre, by presenting an antidote to the massive and demanding PDX canon and allowing players to experience basically the same dynamic, just on a simplified level. As long as it's not about having a micro-detailled and convincingly close-to-life historical cosmos, this game can satisfy all desires, from the typical world conquering quest to trying out alt-history settings. By allowing that, Age of History proves a very friendly game when it comes to the economy of the player, as it's not demanding in terms of real-life resources.  This makes it a perfect substitute for all who lack the time, money or nerves to get into more complex games. Given that it runs like it should, it's one of those games that can only hardly disappoint for what it costs.
The second great advantage is that the game grants the player a lot of freedom in managing thing like he wants to. Not only is it possible to edit many of the visual elements, like names of provinces or colors of countries, to his liking, but the options to get creative are enormous. The player can change existing material like scenarios, countries, leaders and the such, or create his own easily, all of that inside the game. Especially when it comes to creating a scenario, there are a lot of parameters open for adjustment, even some pretty demanding ones like the relation numbers between nations or the make-up of province populations, that demonstrate how simplistic or not this game really is. But it isn't necessary to get into it that deep, there are more important and easier to handle setting like alliances, armies and the such when it comes to editing scenarios. Another feature that actually doesn't come into play before that are events, as there none in the game at start, like I already mentioned when discussing the negatives. But it's possible to use them and the effects can be quite significant, so that's another plus. In the end, it's up to the player whether to create entire fictional realities from scratch and map out every little detail, or just to quickly set up a simple scenario to try out ideas and how certain constellations would play out. It's the closest thing to a historical sandbox that is known to me.
Those are the two main strengths of the game from my perspective, and their combination is what makes Age of History 2 so worthful. As someone who loves to experiment with alt-history settings, it allows me to do exactly that pretty easily while at the same time also offering a lot of potential for precise micromanagement. If your interests like simmilar, chances are high that you'll also be satisfied by what the game offers. To finalise my review, let me briefly list some smaller positives that help this game shine and evoke the enjoyment that it's brought me:
The map is really well-designed. At least when looking at the standard map, it quickly becomes obvious that it was created with the goal in mind to display multiple historical constellations. The borders of provinces fit very well to the different eras and nations, making it easy to play historically. Despite already playing for more than 4 years, I haven't really tried out the other maps (except for the meteorite Kepler, yay), so I can't really say anything about them, but the fact alone that they exist, and also a map editor, as far as I know, is pretty astounding. Another strength of the game is that it never fails to provide statistics and overviews that are easily accessible and help understanding the situation of the world. For instance, there are lists of the wars taking place at the moment, of the population numbers of countries, the casualities of epidemics and much more. Even though some UI elements aren't really harmonous in terms of their size, the graphics are overall well designed and nice to look at. As long as one doesn't expect the same level of stunning beauty that some newer games offer, Age of History is completely sufficient and supplies colorful and expressive as well as clean and comprehensible maps. For me, it meets the perfect balance between nice-to-look-at images and essential substance, it provides both the stories and the style for the alt-history scenarios made.
So, even though my review is somewhat specific in its focus on the main features that I use and its repeated comparisons with the undeniable Paradox competition, I believe that I was able to shed light on the specialities of this game and the ways to use it efficiently that result from that. Being convinced of its quality while at the same time acknowledging the problems present, I felt that I should finally honor this exceptional peace of media and by that pay it back for the hours upon hours I've spent with it. Despite some flaws, despite the lack of certain mechanisms and despite the fact that the developer has stopped to publish patches, the benefits clearly dominate.",1620062615,1676412745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Completely abandoned by sole dev with several actually game breaking bugs still in the game, presumably features instead of bugs. Your game won't last more than 2k turns because if it does, your relations with other nations will break and this bricks your save because you cant declare war or do anything.

The AI is barebones and is often persuaded by 27 gold pieces that their ""neighbor"" from South America offered them to declare war on you, the player. Even though the south american nation is offering 27 gold to an AI in Europe. To declare war on you..
It feels designed to screw you, and only you, the player over.  These checks and bribes are all done in one turn as well, so you can 90% of the time savescum and just... not go to war with a bribed AI.

However, barring that, the game is incredibly easy to cheese after getting a slight grip of all the mechanics. It being turn based means you also have to micro tens of things in one turn for every turn you play, so every save just becomes a microfest that makes HOI4 multiplayer look like a silly spelling bee.

The game also crashes whenever it feels like it, so you better hope you had an autosave.
Age of History II also has a crippling lack of quality of life features. Colonization is easily the most egregious example: you have to manually colonize every province, which, let's admit it, gives you a lot of control over borders and how pretty your nation looks... but it's not fun when you HAVE to click 2 million times on vastly differing places, making it so you're in for actual carpal tunnel syndrome.

The ai also does not have any preprogrammed checks in peace deals like ""will this be an enclave completely surrounded by someone else's land?"" and so bordergore is the norm... prepare for a headache. And also, stronger AI nations sometimes chill out, letting small minors become stronger... there's just, nothing to be found here. Every AI is a speedbump for you to go over, some are stronger than others but they're still just speedbumps.

Diplomacy is also garbage with AI insulting you diplomatically, lowering your opinion and severing relations, to be frank, absolutely RANDOMLY. Even your own created puppets will insult you and if the relations go into the negatives, they'll suddenly start craving freedom, and declare it. There are more diplomatic options than, say, HOI4, but they all suck and only one is worth using: declare war. What does that say about this game?


The combat, which you will be experiencing for 90% of the game, is also just hot garbage. It's 100% ""who has more numbers?"" with a little bit of ""well you're on a mountain so the enemy needs a couple more men to kill you"" sprinkled on... but it is genuinely 99% of the time just a matter of having more men than the enemy.  There are also thousands of provinces ingame, which you will have to manually capture for a 'world conquest'... I never got farther than conquering a continent before I was either stopped from playing by the 2k turns bug or sheer boredom of knowing I'll beat anything through a war of economics anyway...

Recruitment is only possible on owned provinces, so have fun pushing deep into countries (you cant see how many troops an enemy has unless a tile has a watchtower) with your 3k men hitting the AI's 24k man stack and dying... resulting in the collapse of the invasion because you can't recruit in occupied territory.
Like, this game has one bad design decision after the other just everywhere.
Colonization is too accessible, with it being too easy for even minors to get colonies outside of Europe. Every game will have minors chill about and most likely go for anything that's neutral territory... so, Africa, America, Pacific, etc...

The game easily gets boring and tends to become a power fantasy. I do applaud that the game lets you choose what provinces/tiles to release puppets in and even lets you create your own puppets' flags but this isn't nearly enough to overcome the game's several flaws. In fact, this flag creation is a bit barebones with lacking symbols and flag backgrounds. The flag customizer itself is also janky.

While it is a ""Lite Paradox Game"" that's easy to pick up and have... well, 'fun' in heavy quotation marks, it's still just a bit too lite. It's a game that makes you want to think its not that shallow, that it has depth - but fails at it, and it shows. About as wide as a puddle, and as deep as one.",1666518426,1674577717,False,84,12,0.719069898128509521,0,True,False,False

 1.Being able to select more then one provinces for stability and happiness because currently it is very time consuming to have to drag the bar up every time for every province that needs to be converted so this update would be greatly need.

2.Adding modding support, This could be a great feature considering the fact that people can add their own features to the game such as (nukes), (their own countries), (and much more)

3.Adding a world war 1 map i have seen a lot of talk about people wanting this so this should be added just cause it feels like it should be part of the base game and it fits in pretty well.

4. I know you heard this a a billion times but, I would be awesome if you added mutilplayer
this might be impossible with the way you coded the game or you just don't feel like it is worth the trouble but if you could you 100% should add online you don't have to add public server even you can even make a id for the server and have people join like that.

MY THOUGHTS: I would like to finish by saying this is a great game that has been abandoned by it's owner I the community as a whole would be very happy if he came back to do at least one update that has one or more of any of these features.

3And God said, ‚ÄúLet there be light,‚Äù and there was light. 4God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5God called the light ‚Äúday,‚Äù and the darkness he called ‚Äúnight.‚Äù And there was evening, and there was morning‚Äîthe first day.
6And God said, ‚ÄúLet there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.‚Äù 7So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 8God called the vault ‚Äúsky.‚Äù And there was evening, and there was morning‚Äîthe second day.
9And God said, ‚ÄúLet the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.‚Äù And it was so. 10God called the dry ground ‚Äúland,‚Äù and the gathered waters he called ‚Äúseas.‚Äù And God saw that it was good.
11Then God said, ‚ÄúLet the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.‚Äù And it was so. 12The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13And there was evening, and there was morning‚Äîthe third day.
14And God said, ‚ÄúLet there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.‚Äù And it was so. 16God made two great lights‚Äîthe greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19And there was evening, and there was morning‚Äîthe fourth day.
20And God said, ‚ÄúLet the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.‚Äù 21So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22God blessed them and said, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.‚Äù 23And there was evening, and there was morning‚Äîthe fifth day.
24And God said, ‚ÄúLet the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.‚Äù And it was so. 25God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
26Then God said, ‚ÄúLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.‚Äù
27So God created mankind in his own image,
in the image of God he created them;
male and female he created them.
28God blessed them and said to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.‚Äù
29Then God said, ‚ÄúI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground‚Äîeverything that has the breath of life in it‚ÄîI give every green plant for food.‚Äù And it was so.
31God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning‚Äîthe sixth day.",1616861417,1673729204,True,0,0,0.467032968997955322,0,True,False,False

You get a lot of notifications for wars, buildings, investments, etc.. but you can't right click to dismiss then, you have to manually left click them (Right clicking ended up having me move random armies to places I didn't want, wasting turns), and there isn't a mass-dismiss for them either. This becomes increasingly problematic when your mapmode gets changed consistently when clicking through the notifications.

I like having a scroll bar for things relating to the economy, but troops definitely need a 25%, 50%, etc.. button, otherwise it's just too taxing to micromanage.

On the topic of micromanagement, dear lord. Each province allows you to construct individual buildings, as well as to invest, set up festivals, etc.., which is neat, but there isn't a larger panel that allows you to see all the provinces you have a specific build available (Ex. all provinces that you can host a festival in at once time), so having to click each and every individual province to, using the festival example, host a festival every seven turns. Likewise, for festivals and investments, an option to set favourite provinces would be great.

Lastly, I decided since I was going to test out their in-game cheat system and was impressed on how the cheat system actively makes you not want to use it in regards to the ""army"", ""movement"" and ""money"" options, and without being able to set an actual value, the default makes it woefully inefficient, and rather tedious to use

Overall, I'd say this really wasn't worth the purchase, even on discount. I didn't like some things about it, but I'm certainly going to uninstall for now.

-the AI¬¥s strategy is so bad, its just ""replicate in all possible territories and be a pain in the A##"".
-The AI is just randomly generating diplomacy answers (Eg.: a +72 relation civilization sends insults and plummets your reputation with him).
-The AI pulls troops out of its a## to defend a territory,(Eg.: im attacking Beijing and China Recruits 10000 Units, making the game more impossible)
these are all the problems with the AI. heres the gameplay itself:
-the combat system is bad. its just basic maths.
-Repetitive gameplay (declare war, annex its territory).
-its almost impossible to create a  Superpower by yourself (mostly because AI problem one and two).
I think i just said all the bad parts of the game, heres the good parts:
-there are formables
-not bad graphics
-Map editor
-customizable Autosave (you should see my face when Endless Space 2 crashes and need to load up an autosave +20 turns before the crash)
thats all for now...

It also was extremely easy to setup, unlike Hearts Of Iron IV which, for me, couldn't be ran because the Paradox Launcher broke.

The game is overall fine. It can get a little boring from time to time though, but I'm glad I don't have to manage a million things. I basically used my imagination for a lot of things within the game to spice it up a tiny bit to make it a bit more interesting for myself as there aren't really a lot of things to do or really experience. As for bugs and glitches, there is somewhat of a decent handful of them, however, these can be easily fixed or just ignored. If you enjoyed a water-down simplistic strategy game, this is it.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

The mobile version is a port, thats why its buggy on mobile.

Only things that should be implemented:
Changing other countries Ideology.
EG:
You create a Country to be a vassal and pay you,
But they wont become the Ideology you want them to be.

or for puppetting countries, et-cetra.
All of these issues can harm your baseline game which would be changed in reality.

But overall this game is pretty awesome for being abandoned years ago.",1668212985,1668212985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The difficulty system is completely broken and the ""Legendary"" difficulty is as easy as the ""Normal"" difficulty.

-Trades: you can get a country to declare war on another country for 1 coin.

-Sometimes a country would randomly declare war on another country, even though the countries are a continent apart.

-The game randomly crashes (not consistent)

Pros:

+ Easy to learn, controls either from mouse or keyboard (shortcuts)
+ A few notable maps, such as: Europe and Asia
+ You can be any nation you like
+ You can create your own nation ranging from name to flag
+ Form civilizations, such as: Prussia as Bradenburg 1440 or USSR as modern day Russia
+ Manage your treasury, such as: Taxes Goods and Economy
+ Full control of your diplomacy, such as: Vassal Taxation, Change of gov and loans
+ Highly mod-able, such as: Create your own type of government, modify nation flags and names, modify the world background, cursor etc... (It's all easy to do once you watch some tutorials and ask the community)
+ Create your own scenarios and custom form-able civilzations
+ Decent amount of replay ability (Just look at my hours!)
+ Spectator mode

The Middle:

~ Gameplay is mostly the same, who has the most units wins the duel. Very simple, I don't mind it but maybe you do
~ Early game is interesting and the most fun, once you become the no.1 nation you are pretty much unstoppable, which can make it a bit boring
~ Not enough victory condition options
~ Leaders never die
~ Mobile Port

The Cons:

- Handful of bugs in this game, even game breaking bugs that ruin your saves BUT you can avoid them
- No more updates are being received, which means this will remain broken and not receive a WW1 scenario in the world map
- Music gets repetitive fast
- The AI is either too difficulty or too easy, no real balance

Overall this game with it's game breaking bugs, repetitive music (which you can replace) and simplistic gameplay has managed to suck me in for 500+ hours!

-The community super nice and active (specially on reddit), in fact it's the [i] [u] one of the best fanbases i've been in [/u] [/i] . 

-The game is also ultra-customizable at a point where you can change the intensity of the nation's colors in the map, how visible are occupied provinces... You can even create your own scenarios and formable nations with it's own flag desinger that, with enough time, you'll be able to do wonderful flags and use them with the countries you play. Have you ever wanted to create a ""Polish-Mauritanian-Brazilian-Taiwanese Commonwealth"" Even with it's own unique flag? Well, you can!!

-The achievements are all extremely easy to obtain, but that's only if you want them to be easy or not, cause' there's a lot of ways of obtaining them.

-AoH's community also offers a sizeable category of mods, such as bloody europe, conquerors, the new era...

[h1] CONS [/h1]

-The game's got some bugs that rank from mere visual bugs [spoiler] like countries names showing above their territory and not inside it. It's not something specially annoying [/spoiler]... To some very annoying ones [spoiler] like a bug where your cursor gets ""stuck"" somewhere in the screen and when you move the camera to any direction it automatically goes back to where it was pointing before, thus making the it impossible to play, forcing you to restart the game[/spoiler].

-The last update (at least since i posted this review), was launched on the 22nd of Dec. 2020, and with the developer completely out of touch with the community, it's basically an update-wise dead game, pretty much like [spoiler] TF2, being alive only because of it's community [/spoiler]

But overall, I recommend this game.",1658202263,1658202263,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1657743441,1657743441,True,99,21,0.741225600242614746,0,True,False,False

Army management becomes a nightmare once you have a moderate army, plus there is only the concept of terrain in this game but no modifiers exist apart from the attack penalty you get when navally invading.
Come back and fix your game Lukasz or else I'm assuming you ran away with the money we gave you.
Overall I've given 200+ hours into this game and it's still somewhat enjoyable (especially with a friend playing on the same computer).

[list]
    [*] aoh2 is a bugfest, the developer literally does not care about this project anymore. i haven't tried mods and i don't intend to, the model of relying on modders to fix your game is wrong and shouldn't be encouraged. i tried to like the game and at some point i even enjoyed it, but the game breaking bugs just got to me. it hurts especially because the worst bugs happen on long term games, which is incredibly demotivational. 
    [*] the ai is absolute garbage, your alliances and vassals will only bring you down, the decisions made by ai are bs and seemingly random. 
    [*] the tutorial of this game is crappy, the wiki is not helpful at best and non existent at worst. some mechanics are still unclear to me as they were not explained properly in any way. in some games figuring out the mechanics yourself works because it is part of the game design, where in aoh2 this is just poor execution and it hinders the core gameplay.
    [*] speaking of the core gameplay, it's not great. the ui is unintuitive and sluggish. moving your troops around is an absolute pain if you have an army of any size. move your army on accident? great, you can't cancel it now. finding and selecting dispersed troops is rage inducing. generally if you want to do something that affects multiple things at once, you're not gonna have a great time.
[/list]
there are probably more things that i could say or mention about this game, but i think that i get my point across. feel free to correct me on anything that i got wrong, but this is how i feel about the current state of the game, which will likely not change. i haven't tried map editing or scenarios, but i don't want to and i think that it will be a similar experience to regular gameplay.",1656850142,1656850142,False,2,0,0.534883737564086914,0,True,False,False

I'll name a few:

- Save games can get randomly corrupted, this happens extremely frequently and you wont be able to access the save back.

- AI spams a ungodly amount of troops, making wars very annoying to partake in.

- You can get declared war on by a country from continents away, even if you don't even border them, this sucks if your playing as a small nation.

- The relations system is broken. You can have relations at 100 and still get war declared on by that country for no reason at all.

- And lastly what I would say is the most annoying bug in the whole game. The last redeeming factor of this game has to be the custom scenario maker, its easy to use, and has lots of potential. Sadly, there are random times when your editing a custom scenario and all the events get messed up and don't work. When this happens you need to manually fix every single event for the annexations to work properly, if you have a custom scenario with many custom events then this is really not good to have. My suggestion is that if your going to play the game and make custom scenarios, only edit your custom scenario once, because if you edit it more than that you might just have to reset all your custom events. You can lose many time that you put into custom scenarios.

Sadly I will not recommend this game in its current state as it is abandoned. If you want to try it out, go ahead! But there are many, many, bugs.",1631076827,1656157811,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. When attacking Rebels, troops will sometimes instead simply convert to the rebel faction instead of actually taking the province, while this hasn't happened many times in normal play for me, it happens almost every time when using rebel nations in edited scenarios.

2. Needs quality of life changes, when typing pretty much anything, there is no way to go back and edit the text, it must be completely deleted and rewritten. The custom flag system for the nation maker is annoying with its overlays being unmovable. There is no easy way to tell what alliances exist or people are in, at least I have not found one.

3. Diplomacy can sometimes be annoying, I have not found a way to remove/end a union made with a nation. When in a peace negotiation, it does not say whether or not the enemy will accept or reject or why so.

4. The event making is absolutely horrid. I have not found a logical way to create an event and have only had one work for me through sheer luck, and even then it was partly wrong. There is no explanation as to how all of the parts of the event making process interact or what they even do. I have been unable to consistently get events to trigger based off anything other than ""civilization exists"" which instantly grants the event. The province selection in the event making process can only select multiple if you use the brush mode. 

5. I don't remember the last time I heard about an update or bug fix for this game.

While I am sure there are other complaints for other reasons, those are the most apparent for me.",1656034486,1656034534,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here are some of mine tips and tricks.
- If you are lossing a war and you need help call an AI in the war trough trade.
- If you are playing eternal war defenitly pick either a insalnd nation or a nation that is in one of the side and suroundet beetwen few or week states ( Or both for the best ending)
- And a misstake a lot of begginers make is that they do not invest in economy through ""Investing"".
You can do that by : Clicking and a province
                                  Selectiong ""more""
                                  Scrolling down
                                  And finding the ""invest"" Icon

Sometimes the map wont load, sometimes the game lags even on a 6 core cpu, sometimes one civilization is ending diplomatic relations with you without any clear reason(I wish that I could get the reason behind an civilization`s diplomatic relations end)

If I want to cheat and add some army on a province I have to write ""army"" in the console TEN TIMES just for 3000 troops
I know about the sandbox mod but I didnt wanted infinite money so I had to use the army cheat

actual game content is fine for a newcomer to this style of gameplay but quite lacking for anyone else - if you dont have the money or computer specs for a paradox grand strategy then this is your cheap knock-off version lmao
AI is broken, maps always end up looking nonsensical, there are an astounding amount of bugs/errors - every time you think you've seen them all, another one pops up. i won't go into detail as many other reviews have.
this game is definitely most suited for the mobile market, however the steam version does allow a few more features such as modding.
these days i only ever use this game for its map editor which, despite the many bugs, is actually quite decent comparative to most editors out there. i recommend playing with mods, but beware as most mods with promise are abandoned.
overall, buy this if you want a decent map editor or if you dont have the money for a paradox grand strategy but still need to scratch that itch (alternatively if you feel those games are too complicated for your taste, which is completely understandable as i was in the same boat previously). please note i really respect this game as it was exactly this for me - a simpler, cheaper version of a paradox game i brought back when it was released on mobile after already having played the original age of civilizations games, and it was quite fun for a while. i just cannot recommend it in its current state as it has been abandoned for about two years now.",1653818974,1653818974,False,9,0,0.608154118061065674,0,True,False,False

Developers just released it and leave it away. After many years of playing this game on mobile, I said to my self lets try it on other platform maybe it could be something different and with more content, silly me.
There are many major problem with the game that makes it super easy and boring and also some times a pain in the ass.

AI is really a joke, seriously. Because of the dumb A.I. you can win the game in any difficulty, like for example when you are just a weak country and a random other country attacks you, you never need a good ally to defeating them, just go and trade with other countries that are neighbor with your enemy and that's it. They wont take or want any thing to start a war. they will just accept. 
They accept to declare a war and ruining their own treasure and army and they won't accept to give you a military access even for massive gold. If you don't call this an stupid A.I. then what else could be?

There are many mechanics in this game that could be massive changer in the whole gameplay but they are only usable for decoration like changing government type or technology level. I see no difference if they wasn't in the game.(the diplomacy mechanics are even bigger joke to count in here as problem)

It gets more funny when the game gets easier when you choose a small country. As you choose bigger and more powerful country, the game gets harder. Economy, treasure, army, population and any other things that kinda useful are controlable easier if you have smaller territory and that is a huge buff for you, becuse controlling these things would leads you to victory. In bigger countries you cant barely see a growth in your economy .

And something that really bothered me is the way that AI choose to expand territory. I need a holy water to cleaning my eyes after a looking at the map after 200 turns.

This game is only enjoyable when you zoom out to see how well you painted the map. And that's what this game is, a map painter, it has almost no depth to its mechanics and overall is very shallow in gameplay. Now, if there is an instance where I can recommend this game is as an introduction to the Grand Strategy genre (at least like Paradox does them. I haven't tried many games from other companies yet). This game changed my life (no exaggeration) by showing me a new game genre, and today Grand Strategy games are the ones I play the most. It hurts a little to review this game negatively because of how it changed my life, but at least in this state, I can't recommend it to everyone. The game needs a lot of reworking for it to be actually fun. It tries too hard to be simple, but strategy games can only be so simple before they start being a moving map. If this game started to give up its simplicity for more in-depth gameplay, I could recommend it.",1604702745,1651981571,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

He came back after seemingly just straight up abandoning the game, added a single new map to the game without adding anything new or fixing any bugs, then seemingly just abandoned the game again.

Even without the bugs, the mechanics are very shallow and are not very fun at all.

I sincerely regret paying even a single cent for this piece of garbage, and I can almost guarantee you will as well.

The only good thing in this game is the editor, but with how awful the game itself is there's no point in using anyways if you won't have fun with anything you make.

Update May 2022: Stumbled upon the game in my library after a long time, decided to give it another chance. Immediately ran into the exact same game-breaking bugs on my very first session. No substantial updates in over 2 years. This developer is completely incompetent and the fact that [i]anyone[/i] likes this game when it is so laughably terrible truly boggles the mind.

I'm struggling to beat normal mode because countries with much less income and economy than me (despite the fact I am usually a massive power) these small AI countries somehow maintain armies much larger than mine, replace their losses much easier than mine, and for some reason the game favors the AI moving first (even if I'm the aggressor in the war)

Why not lower the difficulty to easy, like the casual you are, you may ask?

Because easy makes the AI so brain dead it should be named ""sandbox"" on easy mode the AI barely makes armies over 100 troops and just barely does anything of note.

AI cheats, difficulty feels artificially inflated, easy mode is sandbox.",1651062888,1651062888,False,12,13,0.492488622665405273,0,True,False,False

The gameplay and mechanics aren't extremely original compared to games like hearts of Iron IV and so on, but I brush past that, what I see is a game that managed to find a foothold in the saturated genre of war games. The mechanics like army recruitment, province stability and military upkeep gets the game the sweet spot of just the right challenge, although, this does diminish late game (after you take about 40-50 percent of all provinces) when due to the sheer size and amount of economy enables you to recruit hundreds of thousands and still be able to keep a stable income. Which is why I personally dont play a scenario all that much after achieving about 50 percent of global provinces, I think the most fun and engaging part of the game is the beginning, where you slowly pick off smaller city states and build your way up to empires. The attention to detail with each and every scenario having accurate placements of countries in distant and fuzzy times, for example the 14 hundreds scenario, the age of fuedalism, at first I thought it'd just place in half effort countries and city states with a general area, but actually it was extremely accurate, looking at say the island of Hibernia (Ireland) It was extremely accurate with the placement of the multiple controlling regions of leinster, omagh, ulster etc. etc. Even when there was very little documentation of Ireland in this time period, you can tell how much care and passion was put into the detail and historical factuality. And oh how I love the strategy aspect. You usually prepare WELL for even small invasions, as countries have WAAAY more military than you probably expect, long borders are usually the hardest to fight wars on, as your army is spread out across the whole front leading to it being almost impossible to stop a massive army going through one province instead of sparsing out like you had done. The glitches are surprisingly rare for a game that hasnt been developed on for over a year so no complaints here
All in all, really fun to play at the beginning, should've been more done to make sure it's entertaining the whole game. 7/10 
Hope this helps :D

The game lets you control any nation starting in 1440, though the starting options can be customized. The interface features a lot of map modes, but they are difficult to scroll through and movement orders can be issued by mistake. Movement points limit the number of actions per turn, though this only becomes an issue with very large empires. Units can be recruited and moved, while buildings are placed to increase growth and research rates. The budget can be adjusted to produce more taxes, production income, or population growth. Research points are used to provide a bonus in several areas (population growth, administrative overhead, military upkeep) and unlock better buildings. Diplomatic options with other nations are standard (alliances, defensive pacts, sending insults or improving relations), and the AI is decent enough. Age of Civilizations II is more approachable than the Europa Universalis series, but its relative simplicity means there is less to do during times of peace as you wait for research to complete.

Firstly I do enjoy this game. Despite its lack of development, and buggy nature, the developer did go out of his way to make it possible to edit almost any aspect of the game, allowing for unique experiences each play through. 

The thing I enjoy the most about this game is especially its easy game play, which usually makes me come back to it when I have nothing better to do and I want to waste some time. And its even more fun crafting stories from the setting in-game. The controls allow for quick actions, with everything quite easy to do.

I remember playing AoC I on my phone every day, and the moment I found out AoC II was coming out on PC I knew I had to buy it. I was waiting for this game to come out for around a little over a year (2017-2018), the date the game went on sale (2018) on its first day I bought it without hesitation, I was really eager and impatient for be able to play it. I remember that on the date of its release here on Steam the game did have errors (bugs) however the developer released an update approximately a week after the game came out to fix those errors and bugs. However, as far as I'm aware and I remember there have only been 2 or 3 ""major"" updates to the game, after that, Its pretty much abandoned. Don't get me wrong, it's a simple strategy game, where you have the freedom to create your own civilizations and scenarios and modify almost everything you like, but it also left a lot to be desired. The game hasn't gotten any updates for months (or a couple of years), and there are still a lot of bugs and errors to fix, which unfortunately don't seem like they're going to be fixed by the developer. If you are looking for a simple game where you can make your own stories to your liking, this game may really be for you, but if you are looking for something a little more complex and much more strategic, this game is not for you.

I played the first one for hours in high school years ago on mobile, and that's kinda where the problem lies, this game is just a mobile game for PC. This is also the game i would default to in the event of an internet outage, i don't think I've ever once played while connected to steam.
It is insanely good at killing time when there is absolutely nothing else to do but it pales in comparison to the depths of real strategy games on steam, such as EU4 and Crusader Kings.
I've played every sub-genre of strategy game out there, from halo wars to pharaoh, from Rome Total War to the aforementioned Paradox titles and of course, age of empires, this doesn't begin to weigh in to their category.

For ¬£4 you're honestly just better off saving for something else, there is barely any replayability in this, and if there was, it wouldn't make up for the fact that you end up killing your eyes looking at the dull shade of map constantly.

Every game is the same, pick country, click, move slider, click, next turn, click, move slider, etc etc until you ""win""

As my ability to play more in depth and better designed games has increased, my opinion of this has decreased equally.

This game is mostly just an idea (which is quite good) without anything else. This is not what I would call a satisfying product. While there is some nice elements, it is just ""paint a map with color crayons"" like most ""Grand Strategy"" genre, yet this has no deep. The game is laughably easy with unexplained elements that seem to do nothing. Not enough money? Just increase tax. The biggest challenge is playing until finishing a scenario, there is no real reason to do this, it is empty. While I can see this as a nice few minute game, it is not something I would spend much time. No elements of real strategy just do it until it'll be over and for the whole map. Nothing is impactful but money, that can be easily got. If you seek a game to play for a long time, it is not this game. While I would say this: I do not really have problems with my purchase, it is not enough to keep me entertained. The only good deal for this game would be on sale or if you have no other game to buy and are not moved by paying low for an boring title, that is all I have to say.",1646600164,1646600261,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only way you can develop strategies is if you can understand the rules. This game is full of unexplained rules and hidden probabilities. Development, industry and population is all somehow related, but how? No clue.

Everything is expensive, expensive investments make little difference, stuff like population growth are glacial in speed. Diplomacy gives no feedback. Huge empires start with a fraction of the population per province compared to small states to balance the game somewhat. One of the most popular ai activities is starting 'coalitions' against random states. Don't get confused from EU4, a coalition is more like a war declaration from Civilization. It is often completely unprovoked and just means that every member starts a war with you individually.

The game tries to implement too many features from other games, but fails to make the core game loop fun.

If you want something like this that isn't a bloated confusing mess, buy the age of civilization mobile games. They do the core game loop way better, with population and industry growing way more quickly and war being more fun and rewarding.

It's quite a good game and it's nice to play it. However, if you play a ancient scenario, it's quite annoying. 

i.e. If you play a 1400 scenario, and pick something in America, you will end up playing with a tribe, which is fine. But, if you want to grow to the province close to yours, you have to spend 50k gold and have an 1000+ army, which is insane for a tribe considering you are already spending money to improve your tech, or economy or even population.

So it's mostly hitting space and lots of waiting before you can do anything.

The same applies to Modern World and picking a small country, but for this one, I kinda understand. And yet, you can always declare war to your neighbour and conquer him in order to grow, or if you have a port, you can conquer another country in another continent.

I started a game playing as Macedonia, and after conquering Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro and parts of Tunisia(shared with Netherlands) and Benin, I had to give up Benin to Marrocos, which was their allies. lol

So I was the 40-ish best ranked country in the world and started to get hard to pick another place to grow that would not stand much a chance to conquer. Conquering takes lots, lots, lots, lots of money.

I don't know if the Dev made an update and broke the game or had a really promising EA run before abandonment or what, but I wouldn't keep what I played tonight if it were free.

This is a simple game with really basic strategy, In addition unit types, research, pretty much everything is abstracted, which sounds great if you want something quick where you don't have to think too hard. But Age of History II is so unoptimized that it runs slower than most of my complex strategy games. It literally takes longer to open the title and load a game than it did to download it.

The icons on the map are absurd and unadjustable. I can't see anything. I'm playing as England and the icon where it tells me how many troops I have in London covers like 3 provinces. I can't see Ireland at all... it is completely buried under castle icons and flags.

I'm constantly getting popup messages about crashes and failure to load.

I have to exit the game using the Task Manager.

The dev abandoned the game a long time ago.

A few years ago the game was a decent, playable experience with few bugs that were annoying, but infrequent. Now, however, the bugs have been amplified and are now extremely frequent - making the game completely impossible to play if you wish to go for a long game.

At a certain point (around 1500~ turns) diplomacy will completely break, leaving you unable to either improve relations, or lower them. Another a bug that was introduced recently (and by that I mean around early 2020) was the inability to even save your game once you reached the late game; how does something like this happen you may ask? Neglect. The developer has completely abandoned this game and the community that has formed around it - he has been begged for YEARS to fix his horribly broken game, only to silence people who criticize him on his own forums.

Rumor has it he's making AoH III, a game I will not be spending my money on given his track record. If you want to play this game, I recommend you go to the forums and download a modded version of the game for a far better experience because quite frankly, this is a scam.",1559247204,1642452554,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

- so many bugs that are never going to be fixed because of the previous reasoning
- ai is dogshit
- combat system is dogshit

Firstly, this game seems to be abandoned by the creator, so any bugs found are something that you either need to hope someone found a solution to or know how to fix yourself. Second, visually this game isn't very good. Normally I can brush that off as it doesn't need to be hyper realistic or detailed; however in this case it is an actual problem as the sheer amount of pixelated crowns, castles and flags make it nearly impossible to actually tell what your clicking on in the area of Germany. lastly, this game feels lacking. It feels less alive than the board game Risk. I respect the work that was put in, I know that this didn't have the same size team if it had more than one person at all working on it. Maybe it isn't very fair to compare this game to other games like the Total War series or the Europa Universalis games but it still is competing with them, on a store front, asking for money.

Whilst, yes, I don't play a lot of games for long periods of time (I play for leisure mostly), I am still an avid and experienced player when it comes to strategy and especially 4x strategy games. From my point of view, this is a rather simplistic game.

But be aware, this is not a bad thing at all: Its a great game for people who want to experience light strategy but don't want to think much, and its a great game for people who want to get into strategy games. It also can have its charm for experience Grand Strategy players; Its simplicity make it a relaxing game to play after breaking your head for hours playing HOI4 or Stellaris.

When it comes to content, it does lack: It soon becomes repetitive, and it doesn't really matter what nation you play as they are all the same from a technical point of view. But that's really the only major negative.

All in all, 7/10. Its good for its simplicity and user-friendliness, but it lacks in content outside of eras and different maps. I Will applaud it though, as it is an indie game, and definitely has its merits for being an indie game.",1572721680,1638396907,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The actual gameplay is very simplistic:
_______________________________
-Economy is basically just bigger economy=more money. The biggest issue I see with this is that in long games where you might want to roleplay smaller states just invest infinitely into their tiles and they get insane levels of economy. This is a huge issue in the 1440 start date with the HRE states. I've seen Ulm have like 60k economy which is absolutely insane for a ""city state"".

-Development just allows you to invest money into tiles easier and build economy more. It isn't really interesting.

-Taxation is always capped at a certain level and ideologies play an insignificant role in changing the rate you can tax at before your population hates you. So yeah Ideology is mostly just aesthetic.

-War is repetitive since its just whoever has a bigger unit stack that wins. There's no quality aspect and terrain has practically no effect in combat. Peace deals are super annoying since if you have a vassal they will actually take territory for themselves and mess up whatever plans you had for the land you just conquered. 

-War declarations are solely based on ""opinion"" where the lower the number the more likely you are to be declared on. Sometimes you'll have coalitions of nations declare war on you that make no sense. For example: a Japanese warlord, Poland, Tuscany, and whatever other random nation that hates you might declare war on you for no reason whatsoever other than that they all hate you. This can get annoying, really quickly.

-Assimilation is just click button, spend lots of money, and people happy in 50 turns.

-AI is dumb and will stay at war with another nation for a really, really long time until their enemy is usually completely beaten.

__________________

So yeah. I've spent around 2+ weeks of my life playing this game at the time of writing this. The game needs some work, but that doesn't mean you won't have fun with it. It's a fun thing to kill time with or when you want to create some custom scenarios and mess around in them. I enjoy it quite a bit.

The part of this game I've loved the most is the custom map and nation creator which is actually pretty fun to mess around with and make your own scenarios with. I've tried to script events into my scenarios as well, but there are some glitches with the scripting and some commands just don't work at all. In order to script a set peace deal it takes a great deal of effort and you have to hope to god that the AI doesn't make its own border-gore (which if you leave the game running for like 50 turns it will). So yeah if you want to try that go ahead, but scripting events has a learning curve and I still don't think I even fully understand it. It's just functional enough to script a decent start to a scenario if you want to.

Some general tips:
-Put AI aggressiveness at 50% (the lowest) for a more sane experience.
-if you want to annex all of the land you just conquered but you can't since you don't have enough war score, just vassalize the nation and lower your opinion of that vassal until you can demand annexation (they'll accept if your army is at least a bit bigger than theirs). Then release a vassal again and adjust the borders how you want.
-This game is all about population. If you have a large population, you can make big armies, which means you win.
-Play sandbox mode if you don't want to bother with money and just want to Role-play empire building. Sandbox also lets you end wars with AI instantly so it's a lifesaver if you want to avoid constant declarations.
-You can add your own formable nations and I recommend you do.
-If you script events into a scenario: DO NOT observe it as a spectator or else your events will break and you'll have to fix it manually.

Overall: 8/10

Recently tried Remote Play Together and it's actually pretty fun.

*EDIT at 117 hours* after learning some things* The research I did seemed to denote that the game was abandoned and it's a fun game when it's working but has an unhealthy amount of game breaking bugs that make it either unplayable or just boring and pointless to play. If you wanna chuck $5 at this game, be my guest as it isn't much of a waste but it is a very broken game and probably won't be fixed anytime soon or at all ever. I enjoy playing it because my saves usually work but I've had quite a few break with the game breaking bugs. Not a nice feeling when all your work is flushed.

I was able to play 105 hours before running into a game breaking bug. Look up ""Age of Civilizations 2 save bug"" or ""Age of Civilizations 2 diplomacy 0.0 bug"" and you'll see more info about the bugs. Straight up makes the game unplayable or pointless to play. The developer replied to a few people back in late 2018 saying that he was looking into these bugs and going to try making a fix. It's January 2020 and these bugs are still present.

-very simple and easy to learn
-large map type variety and scale
-scenario editor/creator
-can be modded

Cons: 
-can get VERY buggy, sometimes ruining a game save or making it unplayable
-allies will want some land after a war even though they didn't do anything
-AI overall is terrible (you will be at war with some nation across the globe with no way of them knowing you, countries will try to expand by declaring war on countries that they don't border, which create awful borders, and the AI can barely win a war)
-Game is too easy, difficulty only changes the amount of troops they have
-for some reason, when the age of exploration occurs, obscure, small nations start colonizing big areas like the Americas and Greenland, but big nations like the British Empire or France won't
-borders are too sharp and make the modern scenario look kinda bad 
-can get boring after a while due too lack of content 
--AI peace treaties are horrible (will almost always have exclaves)
-High Difficulty is Unfair (higher difficulty just increases troop size, not skill, which means a 5 province nation will pull 10000 troops in 1 turn compared to my 10000 I saved up for 10 turns)

Overall, game is way too buggy, worst AI I have ever seen in a game, and lack of content make the game feel very unfinished, but when it is working and the AI isn't having a seizure, it can actually be kind of fun, but I wish there were more things to do like manage technology (tanks, guns, etc.)",1620962460,1631940711,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Instead of being a great game, Age of History 2 is a sad story of how a developer wanted more money out of a beaten corpse:

There were promises of:
- Religions
- Better colonization
- Better and more important Holy Roman Empire system
- Better coring and population growth systems
- BUGFIXES
- A lot more flavor and uniqueness to nations

And a while back, during the pandemic, ≈Åukasz just decided to change the name and trick people into thinking that this is a brand-new game. No, it isn't. If you buy this, you are supporting a lazy developer that does not care about his fanbase.

This game is only decent for phones because there is no competition. On PC? Buy Europa Universalis IV.

The ""modding"" community for this game can't fix any bugs or add other system easily, if at all, because this game is made in Java and the developer has not released any source code, so people are limited to making newer/bigger maps and different scenarios with a somewhat lacking event maker.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

The game is cheap and all the music is just amazing and fits the ambiance. Even though the main strategy for this game is easy to learn, the way how the game works is what makes it special.  You can visualize your relationships and have a clear understanding of who is your enemy and who is your friend. Everything is logical and when you understand the game, you will have a good time messing around with the stats and economy of your country. 
My favorite part of this game is how dynamic the wars are and how tricky they can get. You have a lot of options in-game like changing your type of government, moving your capital, creating a vassal, changing your country's name, and other things. In-game, you have an entire ""window"" with tables and graphics where you can see how is your country compared with others and it is amazing.

[h1]Neutral[/h1]

The game's interface is not bad, but it could be better, specifically the menu and it can get confusing when you are changing advanced options. The game gets so confusing that when I was exploring all the options and tools I ended up changing accidentally the population growth of some provinces and there was no option to make it all default again. After that, I had to reinstall the game.

[h1]Cons[/h1]

Now, it seems that this game is awesome, and the idea is amazing, but it lacks the basics.
The game is buggy in a way that it can easily destroy some progress, or you will have to re-open the game to play again. I will say some bugs:
[list]
    [*]One time the game interface simply died, there were only flashy colors. I couldn't do anything and I had to close the game, losing some progress;
    [*]Sometimes, randomly, your units simply perish, and it can affect your game badly;
    [*]If you annex a country and they have units on water, there is a chance of the units stay in that position forever;
    [*]On long games (+1000 turn) there is a small change of all countries' opinions reset to 0 and you can't improve your relationship.
[/list]
Probably there are more bugs that I simply don't remember right now. 
This game needs a real Steam Workshop. If you want more scenarios or mods you have to go to the creator forum and download those via other links. After that, you have to put the mod files by yourself into the game files. All of this is just dumb considering that Steam created the Workshop to made all of this much easier.
I bought the game almost 2 years ago and, as far as I remember, there was only ""one big update"" that changed the name of the game, deleted all my civilizations (like 300 hours gone, thank you), and only added 1 map, that honestly, I think no one asked for it, with some scenarios, while after that there still bugs. I'm not saying that the developer is not working hard, I just think that if he can't handle all the work, he could maybe get some help, because, being honest, this game without bugs, and with the Steam Workshop implemented is worth a lot more than 5 euros.",1617835160,1628270918,False,39,0,0.744532525539398193,0,True,False,False

Go for it, wanna restore Austro-Hungary in 2000 GO FOR IT! This game has so many possibilities, it's extremely affordable and simple to understand. It also has pretty fun achievements that make pretty wacky history the only major CON for this game is a lack of updates and repetitiveness!

Keep in mind that there are no barriers to absolutely snowball after just a few wars, so it gets boring quickly. I wish the map editor wasn't complete balls as well, I have no idea how the world map was made with such a crappy tool (not talking about the in-game editor).

As for mods, good luck navigating the screwed up forums, they're infested with Wumao bots.

Warfare is not very interesting, because defense is a matter of spawning as many units as you can using money so they can get killed the next turn. In other games of this nature, it's made more interesting by making unit organization a part of your army building, or they make at least more than one unit to play with to make combat more interesting on a tactical level. In this game there are just numbers which represent your army. While yes, it makes AI easier to program, it's at the cost of making warfare absolutely boring.

Diplomacy is just a simple matter of a general opinion number. It lacks depth because there isn't much which can affect this number.

Technology is broken in this game. Basically, if you can invest a lot of money into research you will easily have better armies and economy than nearly everyone else.

Managing the economy is a matter of spamming money into development and production buildings. Use money to get money, hardly any strategy in it at all, and possibly the biggest factor in the snowballing problem.

Notice how everything in this game is centered around money? Yeah, that's quite possibly this game's biggest failure. Money is how you build armies. Money is how you research. Money is how you get more money. Basically, if you can snowball hard into economy you will win as nobody can stop your overwhelming cashflow. How do you get money? Simply by pressing the build buttons. There's no strategy in it.

Oh, and for all of you people who are saying that you got into this game because you couldn't understand any paradox game, then I'd say that you'd be better served by a game like Civ 5 or 6 because they're not quite as complex but have a similar depth.

I can't really classify this game as a strategy game because there is hardly any strategy to it. If you like painting maps, then get it. If you are a paradox sucker and are just curious, then I'd say I probably got more use out of this game than I did a meal for the same price, so get it to waste some time. If you have a potato PC and you want this game to fill the void of all of the paradox games you watch on YouTube, then it's probably better than nothing. But don't get this game expecting a very enjoyable strategy game.",1626820044,1626820044,False,0,0,0.460704594850540161,0,True,False,False

But i can't recommend this game, if you  have the money for this game get it only if you expect this:

Country Managment:
The country menagment is literally three bars for the nation spending (that you can set to the pre-marked settings and forget about them) and province stabilty (you need that to not let develop rebels in the province) and that's literally it, libraries, workshop, you really don't need that (it only gives you small buffs, for only that province)

Diplomacy:
Diplomacy is literally useless in this game, whatever you do it will not matter and the diplomacy is driven by nothing (countries 37546 miles away will hate you and will even declare war on you for no reason whatsoever). 

While you have a massive empire the majority of the times countries with one province will not accept  your ultimatums it gave me a sensation it was coded  to be that way.

Alliances are literally just to get the achievements, if you want  alliances to work expect to give your ally some of your provinces and money to buff them.

AI:
The AI is literally the worse AI i have ever seen in a game, decisions made with no sense, war started without interests, the game is even coded that if you are not at war for a certain time two random nations will declare war at you.

When at war this is the plan of the AI: have a province, try to invade with even 1 troop the provinces sorrounding it. This forces the player to play with a one line front so that in doing so you block the AI, and good luck if you forget to defend a province, the AI will break trough your lines and create a mess made of small troops in every  province. Speaking of, the AI will  always  try small attacks  from  the sea even if it is right in the middle of your country. some of the longer session are really frustrating because of the AI.

Smaller countries will SHIT and i mean SHIT out troops, you need at least the triple of troops you expected to conquer them.

I still can't understand what decides which country will attack first. The majority of the time you will spend 2 minutes to make a plan to attack some provinces and then the AI will milk troops in said province and attack first breaking your lines.

Ally AI is laughing stock, it will be like the normal AI but even if they have massive armies they will leave provinces not defended this makes war with allies three times longer because the enemy will always break their lines and make a mess. Also while the normal AI can go through water just fine ally AI will take like 10 years to do a naval invasion, it's really frustrating for example while invading russia or any country that have some islands around far from you. Oh and don't expect to have puppets when you are in an alliance, they can  attack your puppet and then all the alliance will be screwed up, even the game won't understand what's going on.

Bugs: 
The game is not full of bugs but there are serious ones, for example one that will erase your troops, not  kidding, you have 5000 troops in a province and then poof vanished from existence. Another where the Bars that control the nation spending will often bug out and reset themself  causing instability and rebellions. Some minor bug i can think of is that the names of the nations will  often slide upwards doing a mess on the screen, kinda annoying, and will force you to restart the game to put everything back in place.


The game, for now,  is an unbalanced mess with idiotic AI. Now,  it would be fine if this problems would be patched up, but this game is currently abandoned by the creator, until some serious fix will be applied don't spend your money on this even if it isn't that much.

I don't want to judge no one, even because this review i made is kinda shit xD, but the only ones who i can recommend this game to are people that don't know or mind nothing about game mechanics, or those who get a boner from seeing their nation cover earth.",1625943456,1625943824,False,105,20,0.812644541263580322,0,True,False,False

ENG: I‚Äôve really enjoyed the game so far and I‚Äôve spent a lot of time with it. There were times when I woke up very tired in the morning as I had been playing this game long enough in the evening because I was very tied up. Although my mood was gone now. I wanted to do an Event scenario for myself, (I also did many others) and I was done with half of it for approx. and then I found a bug that made it impossible for me to play with Russia (I discovered it when I was doing events for the Russians) as there was no revenue. I recently had to reinstall the game due to a technical issue and that was what permanently discouraged me. Everything I've done so far is lost. All my saved games, scenarios, and things inside the Editor. By that, I don‚Äôt mean to say you don‚Äôt buy it or it‚Äôs not worth the ‚Ç¨ 5, now (it‚Äôs worth it anyway) because like I said, I really liked the game, so far until the mistake.

(Disclaimer: ""Money"" and ""Gold"" are the same thing, I might get mixed up a little in the review)
Age of History 2 (changing its name from Age of Civilisations 2) is one of the most simple turn-based grand strategy games out there. From the economy to warfare to diplomacy, everything is easy to understand. There are few mechanics in this game that take time to learn. The game also offers a wide variety of nations to play as, as well as multiple scenarios ranging throughout history. There are two ways to win the game: conquer every nation, or get to tech level 2.0 before everyone else. The tech victory is turned off normally so in the scenario options, you will have to turn it on (if you want). 

Gameplay:
The gameplay of AOH2 is quite simple (shocker, right?). Declare war on nations, lead your troops into battle, if you have more troops you'll win, get the province and eventually take over the other nation. I recommend always annexing them fully if possible, but there are a few times where that isn't the best option.  After annexing them you will have to assimilate the provinces using gold in order to keep them from revolting. 50 turns of assimilation will usually stop any future revolts. As diplomacy goes, pretty simple. You'll get diplo points every turn, use those points to increase (or decrease) relations with neighbours. You can eventually ask them to become your ally once relations are high enough. You can also ask them to become a vassal or unite with you, but vassalization hardly ever works and you are almost certainly gonna have +100 relations + ally in order to unite. It is important to keep in mind that you can only unite once (So far I've found). The economic aspect usually relies on you investing in your own provinces using gold, or waiting for them to grow naturally. You will get gold every turn, from your province's economic score (production), and from population in the form of taxation. Economy and population go hand-in-hand, the more of one, the more of the other usually. Population will grow naturally as the turns increase. Population is essential for warfare (can't have troops without people), so you need to be aware of it and where your population centres are. You can also build buildings in provinces that do a variety of things such as increase population growth or allow sea access for troops. As for as research goes, every point of research (0.01 point) will allow you to increase a skill in multiple categories. For example, you can increase the amount of money you get per month from taxation. The game also features colonization, a powerful tool that let's you gain more provinces without war. You can only colonize provinces that are neutral or wasteland that you border or can reach via the sea. In some scenarios, you cannot colonize without turning it on via options.

Other features:
Some other features of AOH2 include different maps, custom nations, formable nations, region editor, scenario editor, event editor, renaming of nations, and a bunch of other minor graphical changes you can make. As you can see, there are a lot of customisation in this game, which can make for some challenge if the payer wants (ex. start in the arctic as a custom nation).

Exploits:
Oh boy, here we finally are, the exploits. Let's start with some basic ones;
-(This one might not count as an exploit, if so, it is a really powerful strategy) Colonize as much coastline as possible, and then colonize the perimeter of a box, ending on your own border. This will effectively create an area in which no other A.I can colonize within. Once you have the gold, it is yours for the taking. This should greatly help with the expansion of your nation, because you can do it in more areas, and effectively claim any area you incase. This exploit really starts to show if you can manage to colonize the entire coastline of say.. South America.

-Investing in one province over and over again can make you a lot of gold very fast instead of dispersing it throughout your nation. As you gain more gold, investing it into one province will increase your gold gain. But if you keep doing it over and over again, you will quickly find yourself making a ton of gold off of one province (don't forget to increase development in the province too every once in a while, it will make even more gold!)

-Trade agreements: oh man this one is REALLY broken. In a trade agreement you can do things such as; sell provinces (don't even try to buy them the AI will never give it to you), ask to form a coalition, or by far the most broken thing, ask them to declare war on someone else. ""What's so busted about that?"" I hear you ask? Well, it's just that you can pay them very very little in order to start an entire war. You might as well just ask them to do it for free. This exploit really shines when you have a big neighbour that you want taken down a peg or two.  Just ask every one of their neighbours to declare war on them, and watch the chaos ensue. You can effectively be the puppet master for WW3.

Bugs: 
Now we are onto the bugs section. Bugs are quite hard to come by, but they will start to show up at around turn 2500 (if you make it that far). Once you are past that turn limit it seems like the barrier to keep bugs out breaks. There aren't many, but some are annoying.

-The 0 opinion bug. Seemingly for no reason past turn 2500 most nations on earth decide that they should be set to a 0 opinion of you permanently. This means they are less likely to attack you, but good luck on getting allies once this one hits.

-The troop disappearing act. This one also seems to come into play at any point after 2500. It is very rare, but sometimes, when troops are on a preset movement path to a province (move here function), they just decide to disappear off the face of the Earth. I don't know why this happens, but I have lost 10's of thousands of men to this one. (at least you don't have to pay troop maintenance anymore)

-The 'Corrupt savefile' glitch. This one is very weird, like the others, happens anytime after turn 2500. Sometimes once you come back to a savefile it just doesn't load, at all. It looks like you just lost potentially hours of your life to a glitch, worry not, the solution is simple. Load a different save, exit, and come back to the original 'corrupt' one. Save works fine again. But the real annoying part is once you find out that the glitch will persist on that save forever. So, you will have to load another save and go back to the original every time you want to play it, it's just annoying.

-Flashy nation colour glitch. I don't know if this one also happens after turn 2500, because I have only had it happen once. It has only happened when I tried to change my nation's colour, after I did, my nation stated to have a colour seizure. I learned to never change my nation's colour after that. Thus I never experienced that one again.

Final thoughts: 
After what you just read, you probably think that this game is sucks and is bug-ridden, but you've probably noticed that 370+ hrs played for me now. Yeah, I really enjoy this game, possibly too much. It has a simplicity that not many other grand strategy games have, and that makes it really easy to just want to come in and play a quick campaign, see what you can accomplish. Once as England, I managed to almost entirely encase North America, which allowed me to have complete control over it. You just can't do that in EU4. Just a few hours ago I started as tribal Kongo in 1444 and 700 turns later, I am a great power (and even colonized a bit of Oceania and South America). Again, these things will basically never happen in EU4. You can rise to power as almost any nation no matter the start location or date if you know what to do. Even the regular powers such as the Ottomans, England, Korea, all can have fun campaigns. For that, I can't help but to recommend,

You can't recruit specific army types ie. infantry, cavalry, artillery etc. You just decide the number of new recruits! 

No fleets! Yup, no visible ships at all... You just move your number (land army) through the sea towards your destination. I guess they all swim together?

During war, you can't see the number of enemy soldiers in the neighbouring province. You're forced to attack blind. Only then you realise either the enemy army is actually 5 times bigger than yours, or nearly non-existent and you wasted your money to build a huge army.

Also, regardless of enemy army number, even if it's 10 times smaller than yours, after your initial attack on them, the ai manages to divide them into almost 1 man tiny divisions and conquers all of your provinces that you did not have an army in. The ai keeps spreading these 5 - 10 men divisions in all directions like a virus into your empire in no time.

Diplomacy is very limited. Conquer or vassalise. 

For tech and research, you only decide how much you want to invest. You don't get to decide what is being researched...

The few pros.
- It's fun to paint the map a colour of a country because it appeals to my desire to conquer the world.
- Can run on a potato
- The scenario editor allows you to make the game more in-depth than the base game.
- Has a local multiplayer hotseat mode, which not many games do; so that's pretty cool.
- You can watch the history of a game after you complete it. Pretty fun watching your empire grow.

CONS
- Shallow combat system, of which the deciding factor is numbers. No significant terrain, building or actual placement required. Just whoever has the bigger army.
- Shallow economy - It's essentially invest in specific aspects of the society and become the 1# economy in a few years (slightly exaggerated). Not to mention the ai don't invest in particular parts of the society.
- No events or anything, making turns really shallow and dull. 
- No online multiplayer, which could probably save this game.
- Stupid stuff like just going ""I guess I'm Fascist now"" (in the modern scenario), no political meddling required, no international backlash or any coup, revolt or anything like that. 
- The colonisation system is garbage, just throw money at a province until you get it, literally nothing else.
- No revolts or rebellions. There might be, I think  I recall it being a system, not that I've ever actually experienced it.

It is a good game. A good game I can't get the grasp of, but a good game nonetheless.

Scenario possibility is limitless, and you can put together your own if you want to. This, along with the included scenarios, make this game a very replayable game.

Though all these scenarios must come with one disclaimer: It is not an easy game. It takes a lot of work to get used to some of the keybinds, which, if you know them, can make your life a lot less complicated.

You also must recognize that you have to balance an economy and a strong military, which is quite difficult to attain the perfect balance if you are the interventionist that I am in these games. I tend to always invade nations around me rather than stabilizing my economy, which eventually will lead to my country being taken over because my military could not be sustained by my total basket case of an economy.

Don't get your predictions high before playing it because this is one unfinished game filled with bugs and even though the community constantly pleads the developer to fix these bugs and give updates the developer turns a blind eye on even the simplest thing that could be solved easily but this lazy prick instead tries to still cash on some European map on google play while he could easily put it in the main game.

 Overall a total scam that you should be aware of before buying it.",1590101964,1621055364,False,62,0,0.700354456901550293,0,True,False,False

It can be buggy, I've had entire save files deleted before during random updates, but honestly it's not that devastating to just start a new one. depending how you play you can really overdevelop a very small country, or just increase your pop and money through conquest so any game could last as long as you feel like. By the time my country grows large enough to take on the rest of the world at the same time i get bored and start as a new country. the only thing i really don't like is the assimilation system, i like the concept but it becomes a chore to do end game after you conquer a country, i wish it could be a one time investment. Also the vassalage system pretty much never works, but I don't feel it's a big deal since it wasn't something i didnt really care about. It really does a good job as a casual strategy game. might take a few times to learn how to avoid random giant countries stomping you out, but worth learning.

[b]Age of History (Civilizations) II Quick Review:[/b]
This is a quite interesting and cheap game (2400 CPL). If you like strategy games you lose nothing for purchasing this title, it's quite straight foward (simpler than other games of it's kind such as EU4) and can get quite addictive if you spend a few hours learning and practicing (I have over 200 hours on record by the time i write this review). I strongly recommend playing with your own country as the feeling of nationalism makes the experience even better. Playing with mutiple countries at once does reduce the difficulty curve a little bit, but it's really up to which countries you pick at the beginning, the agressivness and difficulty of the AI and the allies you chose (and make). It's not the same picking Andorra, Georgia and Kiribati allied with Trinindad and Tobago as picking the United States, France and Germany and ally with China and Russia, though i would say it's definitvely possible to win a game no matter which country you pick, if you know what you're doing and the game doesn't bug, which is my next point.

This game has some bugs that might make you ragequit such as the interface not working at times and forcing you to restart the game, game crashes or armies getting stuck for no reason, but most of these can be reversed/avoided  by either using the autosave feature or saving each turn so you won't lose that much progress if those bugs were to happen.
I dare to say that with some bug fixes and new content and features (no more maps please), this game is worth more than it's current price.

[b]Final Rating: 6.25/10.[/b] 
Has some gamebreaking bugs that can make want you to refund the game, but if they get fixed and gameplay is expanded this game has a lot of potential.

p.s. Botswana, Chile, Kiribati and Spain best alliance ever.",1619899986,1619901256,True,21,6,0.53416597843170166,0,True,False,False

-rename your nation
-change the location of your capital
-more in depth economy system rather than pure factory allocation that is hearts of iron 4
-a more in depth diplomacy window allowing for more meaningfull interactions with your neighbours.
-form unions with nations and diplomatically too! 
-playing as an economic powerhouse and not expanding your borders at all is actually viable.
-however for the war interested players it has a good army mechanic
-AN EXTENSIVE editor allowing you to create new map configurations or edit existing ones(alongside the already included maps) create new nations to play as (or edit existing ones) either by forming them, (you can choose which nation can form nations) or by creating a scenario with the new nation in it, as well as creating new leaders for your new nation in wich you can add bonuses to your new leader and select wich nations within the game (including custom ones) will be led by this new leader.

TIPS
I have played this game to a point where I can easily go to 1st or 2nd rank in just a few turns after atleast 100 turns. But it requires that you take help from a powerful country either being their vassal (so that you hardly go to war) or be in alliance with them.

To make your game experience easier or better you can use ""Trade request"" to make countries fight ""proxy wars"" for you and in that time you can adjust your needs accordingly- you can go to war against the country that is stuck in many wars but at the risk of running into a powerful country that instantly declares war against you.


GLITCHES:
=> The glitches I stated earlier in the old review still persist but I have found workaround them. I prefer not to take a country with lots of provinces at the start to avoid economy bug.

=> The opinion 0 bug is sort of a blessing in disguise as the allied country after 3000 turns starts to send you continuous insults after you are done with war. But with 0 opinion bug this ""getting insulted by your ally"" (explained below) game design, stops being a pattern.


This ""getting insulted by your ally"" is not a bug but a game design which is done to reduce the power of an alliance as the alliance between an AI and the player country is easy to quickly turn the game experience stale as you can easily sweep through several games. 
Trick is to be in continuous wars as the insults only come when both allies are not at war together.

=> City names do not persist with a save. However, if you change the name of your civilisation it persists in the save but the list of ""load game"" will show original names of the countries.

=> The country splitting into 2 or 3 different countries is not a glitch but a rare game design that may occur (usually occurs in small countries that have come out as rebels from a war torn civilisation or a vassal with weak stability) which results in 2 different or 3 different civilisations of same cultural identity and nationality but with three different forms of government. Like Malaysia splits into a democracy and communist regime. I wasn't as knowledgeable of this game design back when I had just been through 100 hrs of gameplay but now I understand this game design very well.

=> Opinion 0 is only a blessing in disguise in case of the Alliance insulting game design. However, this opinion 0 bug makes things stale and boring in future turns. As countries would stop sending you insults, countries won't go to war with you (unless your ally nation goes to war with them or there are only a handful of Civs left which forces AI to make 0 opinion countries go to war against each other), you cannot have 'free military access request' because the opinion cant be changed. The best way is to do a ""trade request"" where you offer the country amount that is a significant percentage of their economy like 20 or 30 percent and then only they will let you go through their territories.


I STILL WON'T RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS GAME BUT I PLAY IT BECAUSE I LOVE THE PROGRESS I HAVE MADE SO FAR AND THERE IS MORE TO LEARN FOR ME FROM THIS. BUT FOR THE ONES WHO DO NOT LIKE SLOW  ""DEGENERATIVE"" GAMEPLAY IN THESE STRATEGIC GAMES WON'T GET ANY THRILL OUT OF IT.


================ OLD REVIEW BELOW ==================

If I had known that the developer of this game has stopped working on making bug fixes to this game, I would've never bought this game. I find these kinds of game very entertaining and I love them but this game could use a lot of bug fixing and changes (like addition of multiplayer). The developer did ""promise"" on making bug fixes in 2019 but after that he left the game completely. The game has several core bugs. The very bugs that ruin your game experience. I will list some of the major bugs in a below list. I may not list some of the bugs that I haven't yet discovered because it has only been 100 hours.
BUGS:-
1. Opinion (in diplomacy) between countries sometimes falls down to 0 and sticks to it. You cannot do anything to change The only fix is to start a new game and you will lose all of your progress but it is recommended that you go with a new run as there won't be much action after this bug comes up. It has become very frequent for me lately in the game. THERE IS NO FIX UNLESS THE DEVELOPER MAKES THE CODE OPEN SOURCE OR MAKES THE CHANGES HIMSELF.

2. ECONOMY BUG: This bug is very annoying especially if you get a large country such as India or China. I once got India and even before I could start doing something major after 5000th run I noticed my economy was going up like other countries. I noticed 90% of my provinces were down to 99 economy and I couldn't even raise them by investing in them. I found the fix which was to abandon them and then recolonise them. I was successful in doing so but not at the expense of losing my rank from 1 to 30 in just a few turns because I would also get slapped with a lot of wars.

3. Saved games. I once saved a game but I lost it. I don't have much details because it only happened to me once. It also could be my negligence but I have read several forums in this game which have had save games problem a lot.

4. City name changes and civilisation name changes revert back after loading saved game. This is a consistent issue. After you make changes to a city or civilisations name, the settings revert back to the original names after loading the saved game. This is a very in-your-face issue and the developer never made an effort to improve these bugs.

5. TRADE REQUEST BUGS:-  Buying of Provinces is impossible. I tried this several times when I was in low income economy civilisations. But now in one of the current runs of the game I am at an economy of 119 million Economy and I have around 200 million gold (yes I am at inflation and know how to deal with it). I tried trading for a province which was at 99 economy from an allied country with which i have 100+ diplomacy points and tried giving them all of my 200 million money but they still refused. So far none of the countries let lose their provinces even on trading 200 million golds. Weird, It's a useless feature then. No country likes to give back Gold if you offer them your province. They will take provinces with no money to offer which is weird even when you try to deal with high income economies that can give money for your provinces.

6. I am not sure if this is a bug or not but in one of my runs as India I had allied with Pakistan, China, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Malaysia went to war against its own allies and did not even split from the Alliance which is weird. After the 100% defeat of Malaysia, for some reason all countries could not occupy Malaysia and it was left for good and was still part of the alliance. Weird. 1000 runs after the war, Malaysia split itself into three ""Malaysias"", all of them had same names but three different colours. I noticed that this also happened with one of my vassals (Afghanistan) and both countries were at war with each other as well. I know this sounds far fetched but this literally happened.



I don't label any developer badly quickly but this developer has kept the game in steam despite several bugs and despite the promises to fix bugs in early 2019 he hasn't made an effort even after 2 years of the game being alive on steam and people still pay for this game. He is still eking money out of this game even though there are several bugs in the game because people still buy it. Heck, I bough this game in late-2020 because a twitch streamer was playing this back in mid-2019 and I loved it's game-play back then. I still play this game because there is no better alternative.

I would give it a No recommendation for people who cannot deal with the bugs that ruin the core gameplay experience and 2.5/5 rating.",1610932235,1617738201,False,3,0,0.503286123275756836,0,True,False,False

I started playing as little Croatia, and just kept recruiting and conquering and before I knew it I controlled all of Europe. I loved the historical aspect too, you can play as any nation and restore them to their former glory and to their greatest state by taking over lost provinces and reforming the nation under their old name. Very cool. I restored the Russian Empire, Austrian Empire, Austria-Hungary, and formed Italy. All very fun.  It was fairly entertaining. I 100% recommend this game if you want to feel like a powerful world leader because it seems like u could start as any country and completely take over if you're strategic.",1617097940,1617724490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even though it's not updated much and has a few rough edges, I still have fun playing it. The game is basically boiled down to improving your provinces and using a risk type combat system to fight wars. So now with that summary of the game out of the way, I'll show you a quick list of the pros and cons about the game.

Pros-
-Simple when you understand what you're doing.
-Has a large variety of bookmarks (Not only has stuff like modern day and WW2, but also has stuff like the American Civil War and the Great Emu war)
-Has a custom country and bookmark creator.
-Has a few mods that can be found on the AOH forms.
-Has 2 ways to progress through turns. (Has a next turn button and a timer like paradox's grand strategy games)
Cons-
-Can have some glitches.
-Has a ""paradox"" tutorial.
-Can get boring for some people.
-Has a couple exploits that make the game a little less difficult.
-Not as in depth as paradox's grand strategy games. (Paradox focuses on one time period, while this one is all throughout history)

So is it worth $5? To me, yes. Some other people just think it's bad because of bugs and the dev ""Abandoning"" the game. (He barely updates, but he did release the Asia map a while back) I kind of ignore the few bugs I run into and got a mod called ""addon+"" to add a few more civilizations and bookmarks. This game has been fun for me for 100+ hours, and I hope it's as fun to you.

I give Age of History a 7/10 because it's really fun, but has a few rough edges.",1616901733,1616901733,True,5,0,0.590271651744842529,2,True,False,False

The game has all the expected map game features: Spectator mode, Nation builder(with a built-in custom flag designer), minority oppression mechanics and oodles of map based fun for you and your family.

Bugs: There are a couple but they are hard to get, for example if you try to commit peace twice the peace offer will sometimes cancel itself entirely having to make it over again but that's no big deal, the bigger problem which is very hard to find is when you annex a vassal and their units stay behind the only three countries that like to do this are: Macedonia,Laos,Khmer Union. And really these are all the bugs I could find

Opinions: So I have a few critical opinions of my I'd like to share, first off their is no Cold war,Great War, which is a big part of modern history. Now my second opinion is that you can form a country without certain requirements other than land like for example you can have a Horde Soviet Union or a Communist Austria Hungary, and now I know this is your own fate but still I feel like to form a country you should at least change your ideology to the country's last ideology instead of being something weird that doesn't make sense like a Horde Soviet Union. Third Opinion this game needs more formables, I had to make most of my for example to form Persian empire I made Iran have to form a much more expanded Qajar (at its peak) to form it or a Republic of china for Taiwan to invade China.

-Make your own leader, scenario, civilization.
-The already made scenarios can be customized.
-The game is cheap and fun.
-You can edit game files.

Things I don't like about this game.
-You are unable to turn AI aggression to 0 for more realistic scenarios.
-AI is pretty random most of the time declaring war on you even if they are way weaker and don't border you.
-Sometimes the game will crash randomly after changing some files around that shouldn't cause crashes.
-Lack of updates.

First, there needs to be a few more things to monitor, only needing to focus on money gets boring, and I know there's happiness, but that's too easy to keep at 100%, there should be things such as food, natural resources, etc, and you could make it so each region has a resource in them, and you could even base it on actual real world resources, like oil in the Venezuela, or iron in Sweden, and the game wouldn't even have to change much, less food=lower happiness, less resources=less trade, simple.

Second, please, PLEASE update the AI system, you cant coordinate attacks at all,the AI just throws troops at the enemy basically, trading provinces is impossible, even with me giving more than getting, the AI never changes government type, so if it's a horde, its going to stay that way, no matter the size, wealth, etc, they are so slow to build their economy and troops, often times, they will want peace, the terms are fair, I agree with them, and then they just, REFUSE?? So now they are spamming peace terms, and they will still refuse, every time, 300 turns later, still refusing, and you cant choose to just, not look at the terms, so every. god. damn. turn. you gotta look at these stupid peace terms, accept, only to get rejected once again, and keep in mind, you can go through 3000 turns in a few HOURS, so it gets really annoying.

Third, more maps please, preferably WW1 or the Russian Civil War, it gets boring after a while with so many similar maps.

Fourth, different kinds of troops, and it could be based on era, if you move into a different era, new kinds of troops, like chariots during the Romans, or tanks during WW2, because it kind of makes you feel like you're fighting with spears and swords in modern day, when its the exact same combat game play during the ancient Greeks.

Finally, please make an option to turn off leaders names and pictures, I really enjoy playing Germany in WW2, but don't want to be associated with Hitler, a crazy mass murderer, or Stalin, the cruel dictator, or people who I have never even heard of, this game is meant to make you feel like you're in control, so having the actual president of the USA staring back at you kind of defeats the point.

Really, fun game, no glitches or errors in the actual game so far, just gets boring after a while.

LMAO) and flags. This is everything what's positive about this crap! If you download, You better start praying to at least see game menu without black screen or other sh*ts, You see game menu? Great you can start making America Great Again (or other country). Wars are broken (Fun fact this game is mostly about wars by the way) You invade some country but for some reason bot will almost always attack you first! (Yeah because example when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 polish troops attacked Germany first - This is Fu***ng Game logic) Watch out! Because you lost one stupid province and many turns have gone sh*t trying to bring them back! (If this is Russia or other bigger country [usually more than 100 provinces] ...... just load previous save for your own good) or if you're LUCKY you'll move first or isn't too late you have chances to save your progress definitely faster! I don't know why he could ruin that awesome idea for game! (If you decided to buy it anyway (my pro tip try to attack enemy provinces with ports first, because they won't come behind, except military access! You're welcome) Don't recommend! 
Results:
+ Interesting idea for gameplay 
+ Available adding your own: Leaders, Countries, Flags, Events (I don't know what it is LMAO), Pictures for leaders, Changing your country population and development
+ Cheap
+ If you want to download heavy game you've got something to do meanwhile XD

It's simple to take in hand. And ahistorical war may happen.

To do the combat quite simple take 1 or 2 loan at maximum hire as much troops as you can and roll on them.
Beat them as fast as possible and then wait war exhaustion go down (defensive war tick at the same speed for defender and attacker (so bullshit))

This game is amazing. ""yeah yeah how amazing can a 5$ game be?"" well it's great. It satisfies the weird urge we humans have to see a map painted our color. The replayability is huge, i'd argue you find just as much replay value in this game as, Minecraft or Terraria. It's like a paradox game, but actually fun and gets straight to the point. One of the few games where you can go from a 1 province nation, to a glorious Empire in no time. The graphics leave a little to be desired, but thankfully theres few mods out there that change the map up and of course, add many more scenarios. That's another thing. The mods make this game epic. my first 200 hours was without mods. 

However, i been praising this game a lot, but lets get to the flaws. The man who made this game, hardly updates. couple times a year if we're lucky. He also added no DLC, which, this game came out in 2018, and it's [CURRENT YEAR] so you'd think we would've gotten some DLC that add in more scenarios. Yes there are free mods you can install, but most people won't install those mods, for whatever reason, so they may only play a dozen or so hours and never play again. Wish the maker of this game would give us updates, or least be honest with us on if he's given up or not on this game. Also the editor for this game, is difficult, so don't think you can rush in and make a custom civ, with (custom) flag and leader in seconds, cause you won't. 

All in all, its a cheap, fun, addictive game that i strongly encourage everyone to buy, if you're a fan of map painter like games. For the price of one cheeseburger, you can get hundreds if not thousands of hours of play-time.",1549509848,1610608651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ability to easily customise scenarios, civilisations and many more is great, this is probably my favourite thing to do and making historical and alt history maps are fun to try out. 
I will say though there are a few bugs in this game, I haven't found too many and I usually play this on a shitty school laptop. The ai in this is not that smart and can often annoy you and mess up your games (although if you play it smart you should be fine). The final thing I would add is the developer of the game seemed to of have abandoned the game for a really long time then has made a return with a new asia map very recently so if you do purchase it do not expect consistent updates.

The graphics are decent considering it is a map game, but personally in a map game you shouldn't even mind about graphics.
The HUD is pretty understandable and even without the tutorial you will still understand the game.
Let's talk about the good things:
Economy: This game has a pretty simple but nice economy, there is nothing better than turning your nation in a super power by just investing in provinces, it is pretty rewarding and it doesn't force you to conquer land to become the strongest nation in the world.
Nations: You can play has a lot of nations, want to play as the roman empire? AoH has got you covered. Want to play as that turkmenistan nation in the 1400? Fell free to do so.
Editor: The editor is what makes the game special, you can make: events,nations,scenarios,disease (through modding but modding is really easy),ideologies (modding again but it is extremely easy),leaders.
Meh things:
Vassals aren't that useful: Vassals can declare war, they act like an indipendent nation by exception that they will most of the time accept your request to join wars and they will give money, but other than that they are pretty useless.
Diplomacy: Diplomacy is actually pretty good but some things are broken and/or unexplained (cough cough unions cough cough), you will never be able to buy a province even if you offer them thousands of gold and it is pretty broken.
Exploits: Exploits everywhere! Maybe i should unite this with the diplomacy section but i wanted to divide it. This game is extremely bugged, you can literally request an ally to invade his friend (even if it is stronger) and he will! This brokens the game in the worse way possible: you got invaded? just ask 300 nations to help you in the war.
Bad things:
The combat: THE COMBAT, THE FUCKING COMBAT. In a game where conquering is a big part of thingies you can't make combat so bland. There is only one unit type: infantry, that's it.
Combat is extremely boring and frustrating, as you can divide your 100 army in armies of 10 and you will be able to conquer 10  provinces, have a good time trying to catch those bastards!
Combat also brokes any logistic and logical law: a small nation that invades russia through siberia with a 11k army and then just stands there. No logistic problems, nothing! This is extremely frustrating.
In conclusion:
The game is very enjoyable,even with the broken diplomacy you can do a lot of things and you will spend hours trying to turn a country in the strongest country ever, i recommend it because of its editor and other thingies.",1605718691,1605718691,True,1,0,0.508670508861541748,0,True,False,False
