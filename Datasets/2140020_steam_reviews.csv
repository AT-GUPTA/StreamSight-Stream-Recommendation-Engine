One campaign i started with 4 archers 6 knights and 4 maceman against 20 spearman, 8 archers, 6 knights and 10 pikeman in a fort.

Let me preface this by saying that I've played Stronghold since I was 4~ years old when it came out.

There is so much to say about this game, I'll try to say as much as possible while keeping to the point. I am a massive Stronghold fan, always have been, I think I've bought 5-6 or so copies of the game, be it for different Steam accounts, or gifts for friends, or buying it also on GoG etc. etc. I've always enjoyed and loved this game and it's a game I keep returning to and always will keep returning to.

Finally after 20 or so years Firefly have finally made the sensible choice of returning to their one working games in their IP. The thinking is sound, you iterate on the old product and you offer improvements in order to offer a more attractive product and get sales.

What does this remaster offer this time around? 

A new campaign. It's pretty good. The campaign itself does not warrant the price though in my opinion, so wait for a sale if you can. Part of the reason why I think it's not good enough is the fact that I find the level design to be lackluster at times. Stronghold is a game often described as ""castle sim,"" revolving around building castles, but annoyingly enough I feel like most map designs heavily encourage people to just build a wall or set of fortifications between point A and point B to defend against enemy attacks, which to me does not encourage much strategic depth and thinking. It truly is a shame because the maps themselves often look great but the gameplay does not differ much from map to map when the only difference is ""build a wall and some towers to block off this cliffside,"" ""build a wall and some towers to block off this peninsula"" or ""build a wall and some towers to block off this mountain pass."" I get that this might come off as nit picky but I can't help but feel like I expect more when we're paying for the development of this remaster.

New remastered graphics. I'm torn on these. This is subjective, but in my opinion the new graphics fail to capture the charm that the old game has. It may very well be due to the nostalgia of having played this game for 20 years, but it just doesn't feel right to me personally. However a point on the graphics that is not subjective is that they have not done a great job with the animations for some units. For whatever reason they chose to replace/slightly change the graphics of the swordsmen and the knights, which is fine (though me personally I thought the old ones were more charming, but again, that is subjective,) but what really stands out with them is that the framerate of these two units is simply way too high, and the movements of them completely lacks any sense of weight. I strongly prefer the look that the old swordsmen had for example, because they felt more powerful simply because they looked like they were heavy. The new swordsmen almost sort of look like they are sliding across the surface. The knights as well look like they are moving way too fluidly and unnaturally, and also they weirdly lean back into their saddles.

This remaster has multiplayer support. That's a big plus. Get it if your friends are nagging you to play with them, if you want I guess. If you can disregard the other points that I've already made.

This remaster also introduces a few new bugs. That is to be expected of course when the game is remade in Unity, but it's just a bit disappointing to see both your melee units ignore battering rams that could have been destroyed before they reach your walls. Same way that it is also disappointing to see a siege tower get destroyed, but still see enemy units use the ""destroyed"" invisible siege tower to scale your walls in a completely unfair way and kill your lord.

For these reasons I simply can't whole-heartedly recommend getting this game. I still recommend people to get the original when it's on sale, but if someone asked me ""should I get Stronghold: Definitive Edition?"" I'm probably gonna say no.",1707930267,1707930267,False,6,0,0.533621370792388916,1,True,False,False

Stronghold: Definitive Edition is Stronghold 1 we all love, but vastly remastered in many ways to fit the modern standards. Refreshed visuals (they look gorgeous, by the way) and music; new features; Steam Workshop; multiplayer integrated with Steam; a lot of quality of life improvements; and many more... All of that without affecting the core mechanics of the game itself and, of course, its brilliant atmosphere that surely made a lot of older players fall in love with this game back in the day. Not to forget the fact that the game works like a charm.

This is clearly the best way to play and experience Stronghold 1. It doesn't matter if you played the older versions of the game in the past, or perhaps you may want to check out this fine classic at last. ""Definitive Edition"" is truly worth its name. It also reminds us that Stronghold 1 is not only the first video game of the well-known Stronghold franchise, but also that - even after all those years - its gameplay holds up as a great classic castle building simulator. And like I mentioned earlier, the Definitive Edition's improvements and new content, really make the difference, if compared to the older versions of the game. They allow players to experience Stronghold 1 in all its glory and in a pleasant way, fitting the modern standards.

It's really not that special, but it is more optimized for new computers. No need to mess with the resolution. I also haven't really seen that many bugs aside from a few annoying ones like a rock being here, or not being able to build on top of bushes, but I now think the latter is intentional. 

The best parts of the ""definitive edition"" is that you can adjust more things control and hotkey related. They also changed other things like the main menu and designs of certain things. Most of the time, I don't even notice the difference between the improved designs of buildings and whatnot. The original campaign is basically the same, but the colors look like they were too defined and bright; however, while I prefer the original look for the cut-scenes and character portraits, I'll admit that the new look doesn't look terrible. It is strange how Sir Longarm and Lord Woolsack's portraits have a golden hue to them, but all in all it's not so bad. 

     The best things about this remaster is that you can zoom in and out more freely, adjust hotkeys as you like, and a grouping mechanic which is actually quite helpful- but don't use the number 9 option because you'll get those units stuck in that slot without being able to adjust it. I suppose they apparently added the Steam Workshop and such; but honestly, as a game, it's not much better, and the new content isn't worth it.

   There were times I would be in annoyed wonderment; like, why the heck can't I build stuff other than quarry's on top of the stone reserves? Where did such a dastardly idea come from? Why doesn't a Cathedral or Church add a small bonus like before? How come the new maps weren't that well refined? I can't build something in a perfectly well-enough sized spot because of a single-dot of uneven ground, rock, or bush? When was it that you couldn't build on top of bushes? Not trees, bushes of all things. How come my ranged units require so much micro-management at times? The original stuff is still just about the same or as good as in the original, but some stuff makes the game annoying.

    I finished the first part of the new campaign, but it's more of a pain than anything fun and engaging. The story is extremely lackluster, unfortunately the VA's performance is somewhat lacking, and the missions themselves are terrible. The maps used are more of a pain than not as well. The fighting on said maps are annoying because of the enemy troop placements, like they have two or three missions where you go through this maze-like map to get to the end. The first one wasn't so bad, but there was one where I almost wanted to just stop because of how bad the design and arrangements were. To be clear, the maps mostly weren't hard, they were just tedious and tiring. They say the new campaign is made for ""veteran players"", but it was such a pain and nothing like the original campaign. 

If you like more modern and adjustable, and maybe like anything and everything new from Firefly even if the new missions are just a pain and wearisome, then you probably won't care for this remaster's shortcomings. I would recommend just getting the original because it still has a lot to offer which is what most of this one is anyway, and it's quite a bit cheaper. I almost want to fully recommend it, but I didn't particularly enjoy everything that's new. More of a painful experience than a fun one regarding the new content, but I can't say the same for the original. I will always be glad for the original content. I wish I could give it a 3/5 stars kind of rating, or a neutral one. It's good, but essentially only because of what was already established beforehand.

tactics;
game mechanics at their core are the same as the legacy games (SH 1 and ST Crusader), but arrows feel like they are nerfed somehow; an archer/crossbow army is not the answer to all problems in this game as it used to be in the legacy games, so be careful of that in your tactics. 
By consequence; Macemen just became a whole lot scarier Lol; a unit of crossbowmen can no longer stop an equal force of macemen without breaking a sweat; no, the macemen will tank the crossbow bolts long enough to get to the crossbowmen and they will club them.
Spearmen are now actually useful and they can actually hold their own against better melee units when they outnumber them like 5 or 4 to 1. Can no longer just wade throw hords of enemy spearmen with a very small force of armored units like the legacy SH versions. 
In general: it gets some getting used to, but it feels more.. right. each unit in the game has its uses now. The Leather Army tactic (crossbowmen and macemen only) still worms well, but other tactics are just as viable now.

Economy: 
much more limited on where and how you place your mines and quarries, so a mining economy is impossible on most maps now. 
Ale is maxed out at 4 popularity, and religious buildings are all but useless and are now actually a hindrance as the peasants will ""demand more"" without you gaining any extra popularity out of it, and you will actually lose popularity if you delete them to switch economy later on, so just don't bother. 
Max tax is capped at 20 now, so no more 24 tax and max popularity perfection builds.
In general; the economy feels more limited and slower, but it is much more agriculture based, and this feels more realistic for the middle ages ",1699388969,1704674476,True,0,0,0.402825772762298584,0,True,False,False

I have to say that was (and still am) a huge fan of Crusader (2002). Played hundreds of hours as a kid and also spent some time as an adult. Keeping that in mind - I can't say that I was overwhelmed by Definitive Edition. It's okay, I guess. It's not a completely new game, but seriously, players didn't want a new game. They wanted playable, slightly updated Stronghold and they got one. Could it be better? Maybe. Should? Naaah, strategies are great as they are. 
I really miss custom skirmish (yes, I didn'd have any friends, so I liked to play with computer opponents and those battles were hilarious, imo) and the whole ""Arabian"" part of the game. 
Also flat mode in DE works reeeeally strange. And microcontrol could be better, mine was bugging a bit. 
All in all, that's good old stronghold with slightly better graphic. Nostalgia hours are waiting. If you liked it in 00s - you'll like it now; if you're like me - Crusader's fan, maybe it'd be better to wait Crusader DE. I wait :D

The game feel no diffrent from the original, which unlike other ""remasters"" these days, is fine (since the original was good from the beginning).

Thought there are still some little things that shouldve been fixed, added or carried over from Crusader instead of making it identical to the original game (like clicking on resources in stockpile menu to enter marketplace section, auto-sell funtionality, auto-fire on pitch floors, tree removal without woodcutters etc...)

I'm writing this review for you guys - not the game or devs. I'm writing it in the hopes that on those days when you just don't feel like playing the latest AAA (or indie) trending game, you might consider giving this classic a try. It really is worth the chance, and if you can get it for under 10 bucks, it's a steal. And I truly think most people will like this one a lot.

Like strategy games? Like City/castle builders? You need to buy and play this if you never have. And if you've played it in the past, you owe it to yourself to play it again. 

Is it the type of the game that will be your top ten favorite? No, probably not. But it absolutely will give you dozens to hundreds of hours of fun. It's virtually bug free, being from the era when games were completed before they were released. Everything works. Maybe the UI isn't super modern, the graphics (although updated since the original release) are mediocre, and the music is... the music is better not mentioned. The story line is lighthearted/silly and relatively simple. You're not going to find any masterpieces of story writing, or outstanding characters that you think of fondly 10 years from now. That's not what this game is, and it doesn't try to be.

What this game is, is a very straight forward city/castle sim and strategy game. You gather resources that you use to build your defenses, your industry, train troops, and keep your peasants happy. Nothing is super complex about the systems. There's no research trees, or requirements you need to reach to unlock things  (though the campaign unlocks new buildings, resources, and weapons as you progress). Build wood or stone walls towers and gates in any design you wish. Make multi-leveled defenses, and employ designs that are segmented and redundant to help fend off waves of enemies. Train archers, spear men, mace men, pike men, crossbowmen, swordsmen, and even mounted knights to defend your castle and settlement. If that's not enough break out the siege weapons like catapults, trebuchets, ballistas; and traps, boiling oil, and war dogs.

Some of the missions have you go on the offense, taking a limited number of troops and engines and assault the enemy, but for the most part, you're the one building and defending (in the campaign.) Additionally, there are some extra campaigns that add some newer features, buildings, and challenges - new maps, new tactics, and dozens of more hours of game time. 
If you decide you just want to design and build your dream castle and throw endless enemies at it to see how your design fairs, you can do that too. 

I hope that if you decide to give this one a chance you find it as much fun as I did. It really is a great game.",1703916666,1703916666,True,25,0,0.732333898544311523,0,True,False,False

Firefly was originally conceived in 1999, consisting of just two co-creators Simon Bradbury and Eric Ouellette, who spent their first two years together creating a game that aimed to merge both the City Builder and Real-Time Strategy genres. They accomplished this in 2001 with their first release – Stronghold, which released to critical acclaim and commercial success. The game became a surprise hit and due to its popularity led to several sequels including the fan favourite Stronghold Crusader in 2002. Both of these titles use a 2D isometric game engine which is comfortably the best way to experience the series, the Definitive Edition uses the Unity engine as a wrapper for the original game. 

The Stronghold series has been tried and tested over the years through different pathways, however sticking close to the original blueprint is what makes it (in my opinion) most grand. A blend of British charm and replayability made this series such an instant hit, combined with innovative castle building and visuals. 

The Definitive Edition enhances the original experience with remade artwork, modernised gameplay, high fidelity sounds and workshop support. The visuals are so crisp and smooth, like rewatching an 80s/90s program in HD. It’s absolutely fantastic. 

I will never tire from watching routine work processes in Stronghold – let’s take the art of making bread: watching workers harvest wheat crop, who then move the wheat to the keeps stockpile. The young workers then take the wheat from the stockpile and transfer it to the mill. Once flour is milled, the young workers take the bags of flour back to the stockpile. The bakers then pickup the flour and transfer it back to their bakery, where you’re able to watch them create food for the castle, before being placed into the local granary for storage/consumption. What I’m describing is the absolute charm of the game: watching the beautiful synchronisation of routine jobs throughout the castle is nothing short of scintillating and it is through this charm that makes the game richly excel. 

The Definitive Edition includes a new 14 mission campaign, along with a new historical ‘Castle Trail’ which sets 10 unique scenarios to delve into. The campaign itself was fine, I preferred the Castle Trail as it proved to be more challenging (I’m looking at [i]you[/i] Heuneburg) nonetheless my entire experience so far has been incredibly rewarding. Now that I’ve attained 100% completion, I look forward to the post-release schedule - at least two major free updates coinciding with paid DLC. [i]The Winter Update[/i] is set to contain new economic missions and maps, and will release alongside the [i]Swine's Bay[/i] DLC. [i]The Spring Update[/i] will include a new Castle Trail and maps, and is set to release alongside the [i]Valley of the Wolf[/i] DLC.

Buy it. It’s brilliant.",1703665069,1703665069,True,95,0,0.872511327266693115,0,True,False,False

one of the missing point that i wanted badly was a proper new campaign with new animations and new story.

to give some context, one of the key thing that separates stronghold 1 vs stronghold 1 crusader (which made me like it to play both at times) is not only the environment (desert vs grassland-mountain), but is that in stronghold 1 there is CGI and animations, and a nice little storyline. Maybe sounds insignificant, but having some sort of storyline with new animations that can ""immerge"" the player is essential for me that i like single player game,

stronghold crusader instead, has no storyline at all, if not for some small little campaign with narratives told by unknown voice, which makes in the end a ""soulless"" game, and the main thing for a solo gamer is just to finish the trail of 50 challenges without any story,lore,world behind it. it's a good skirmisher game, but ends there.

now, context ended, if this new version of stronghold 1 is with new small campaigns, but without some story, CGI, jokes,animation, you name it, for me is hard to appreciate the work despite small budget considered, because having an interesting storyline with animations was the key point of stronghold 1 vs the crusader one, and i want to believe that animations now are not so expensive and hard to make like before, so they could insert something new over there.

there are new small features of course, but does not change the whole game completely. on top of that, feels little bit glitchy, and of course IA has not been changed/improved as developers said before, so the difficulty of the new campaign relies on multiple/ultra fast/non stop invasions, rather than the intelligence of the enemy AI

The pathfinding is horrible, probably even worse than in the original. Base construction is clunky. They didn't implement PvE skirmish against bots, which leaves you to play the campaign (or multiplayer).

The campaign has fun characters (""The Pig"", ""The Rat"") but the missions are horrible. Most of them don't give you freedom how/where to build your castle, which is half of what the game is supposed to be about. The other half would be sieging an enemy's castle. However, in most missions the enemy has no fortifications or buildings on the map whatsoever. Instead, his units spawn at a pre-defined spot on one side of the map to attack you.

And if you thought the pathfinding of your own units was bad, you will learn that the enemy's units are even more stupid. ""Sieging"" your castle means that they just walk into range of your crossbowmen to be slaughtered. Successful attacks would require the AI to coordinate the movement of ranged, melee, sieging and supporting units, which it doesn't seem to be able to do. This makes the game so easy that you start to wonder why you're building fortifications at all.

There are some glaring gameplay bugs in this version, and I think Firefly could have easily playtested  this before they released to solve them. The fact that they didn't, AND the fact that they've already announced the 2 latest parts of the campaigns to be behind a paid DLC (making me have to pay more to get the entire story), makes me see this as a fast moneygrab and not worth my attention.

First the good:
2 new campaigns, awesome! I loved the new variety, and the scripted events on some ""make your way through this map"" missions were a fun addition to my stronghold experience.
Steam multiplayer looks like it works. This is a nice addition, but frankly, I loved stronghold for the singleplayer aspect so I didn't care much about this one.

Now the meh:
There are new sounds in this game. They are nice, but volumes are all over the place. Additionally, sounds are stereo by default. One of my ears is deaf, which means that if I play this game with a headset, I will not hear the announcer say that I am being attacked when my keep is to my right on my screen. Very annoying, but I get that they didn't put up this accessability as a priority. Sad though, that I didn't have this problem in the original game.
Click-Hitboxes of units are all over the place. it's harder than in the original to put units closely next to eachother, because you will probably select a unit you didn't want if you give a move order near it. This can be alleviated a bit using the new ""modern"" rts control scheme, where your RMB and LMB commands are shuffled a bit, but I shouldn't have to evade shitty hitboxes by changing my controls.
Improved visuals are nice in theory, but they look so much similar to the old visuals that there is not much reason to prefer these over the stronghold HD ones. 

Now the ultra-bad: 
There are some very dumb programming mistakes in this game that were not in the original.
First off, in the Jewel campaign with the Snake. They wrote some new AI for this game, making them prioritize gatehouses above ""the weakest part in the wall"". Unfortunately, when I do not build a gatehouse at all (because why would I want to walk to my signpost?) the AI... does not prioritize anything anymore. The enemy soldiers just stand still. If they feel REALLY motivated, MAYBE they will decide to stand still under your walls while getting pelted by your archers. Means I can win almost all ""hold out until last battle"" missions if I just wall off the signpost area. Very easy to spot bug, very dumb that they didn't catch it, very gamebreaking.
Additionally, there is a bug in the siege mode. If I select a map, then switch to attacking side, then back to defending side, and then start, I will have no army attacking me and I will instantly win the map. Probably the attacking army gets set to 0, because you can select a custom army now as the attacker in a siege. This means that at least it not unplayably broken, because if you do not switch between attacker/defender, the attacking army will be there like normal. Still, very dumb bug. Come on, firefly programmers, you can do better than this.

All in all, new campaigns are nice, but Firefly ffs hire some proper software testers.",1702748168,1702748168,False,6,0,0.574859678745269775,2,True,False,False

The unit control itself is very simple, with only 3 behaviors that you can set a unit into: standby, defensive, and aggressive. What it lacks in unit complexity, it makes up for in scale, as controlling hundreds of archers is a normal occurrence. They also have a lot of options for combat outside of unit type. Elevation is important because your ranged units have better accuracy when placed higher; moats are important because you can better defend against sieges; oil pits are important because they could allow you to defeat far superior units using a lowly archer firing a burning arrow.

But before I write anything I want to address the elephant in the room; skirmish. There is not skirmish mode in Stronghold DE. There wasn’t a skirmish mode in the original stronghold, because there was not a Skirmish AI. The developers have said that is was unfeasible to create a whole new AI, and would instead focus on remastering graphics, animations, music, voice acting, multiplayer functionality, and adding new content. I get that. I forgive the game for not having skirmish mode, although I am admittedly disappointed like the rest of us. Even without skirmish, Stronghold DE offers a great amount of content. I’d wager if this game is successful, they will remaster Crusader, which had a skirmish mode.

The “remaster” aspect of this game is apparent. The animation and graphics quality has greatly improved. It offers a refreshing visual and audio experience for those coming back to the game, and realizing all the small details you may have missed due to the old graphics is a joy for those of us who grew up on Stronghold.  I’d recommend the game for this aspect alone, especially at the game’s low price point. 

It’s also worth mentioning the QOL improvements like barracks rally points and new hotkeys that modernize gameplay. 

There is ton of content. Not only do we have all the content of the original game, but we have a new military campaign and castle trail as well. Mission creation tools allow for community maps and missions to be shared, adding content. The road map promises two cheap DLC’s in the future, adding new campaigns for the cost of a cup of coffee.

Haven't played all of the new campaigns as of yet. From what I have seen I'd say it's okay but not great. Not a fan of the new micro missions.
I would have liked more changes to the OG campaign though.

I like new features like finally being able to choose your color and use that in the campaign - the irony of playing black and then seeing the Wolf use blue is not lost on me.

There have been complaints about missed chances with new features like Skirmish etc, I don't really agree with those as that has always been more of a Crusader thing than classic Stronghold, especially if you take the revamped economy and other changes of Crusader into consideration.

Starting in my childhood, through teenage years, university and now still as an adult.  I have basically done all there is to do in these games.  

For those of you who will be returning to this franchise, the redefined graphics, animations, framerate updates and overall re-make make this feel like a brand new game.  I found myself falling back in love with the micro-management of setting up a city, growing your resources and armies, and then just sitting back and watching the people of your castle work.  The reasons that I fell in love with these games in the first place decades ago.  There is so much familiarity with the setting, gameplay, soundtrack and animations that it feels right at home, but the upgrades make this feel new and exciting. 

If you are new to Stronghold this game will be an absolute treat, and I envy the feeling of experiencing this wonderful world for the first time.  It provides just enough to learn how to play the game, but requires the ability to micromanage economy, resources and military in order to really thrive.  

In about 25 hours I managed to wrap up the new Economic and Battle campaigns at Very Hard difficulty, and I found a few of the missions quite challenging.  If you are new to the game, they will be difficult!  But the ability to scale the difficulty makes this game great for all ages and skill levels.  Just enough challenge with a massive sense of reward at the end of every mission.  I took my time and just enjoyed the environment, the hustle and bustle of your castle. 

The only complaint that I have is sometimes when commanding troops to move or attack, you loose your troop selection when telling them to move to a location and have to reselect them and try again.  I don't remember this happening in the older games.  A very minor detail that doesn't effect the gameplay overall.  

I'll be able to spend another 20-30 hours on this game without feeling game fatigue or repetition setting in, meaning it is a 20-hr game for a seasoned vet looking to rip through just the new campaigns, or a 50+hr game for someone just looking to enjoy all of the options that are available: starting on the old campaign, continuing into the new campaigns, playing the Castle Trail, and enjoying the world builder and Castle Builder modes.  

I hope this convinces you to buy this game, as it is 100% worth it!!!

All of the most annoying problems of Stronghold are still present here - the maps are still too small to have proper building freedom in multiplayer, any tower can still be manned with absurd amounts of soldiers by exploiting unit clipping. Townsfolk still annoy you by constantly blocking placement of buildings and walls. Mod support is still not a thing - Steam Workshop is for custom maps only. AI Skirmish isn't there as well, though the game has enough content to replace it, so the problem is not that critical.

Even though the remaster is not what I really expected, it still is the one and only Stronghold - a great game with lots of high quality and unique mechanics, wonderful art, sound and music and fantastic atmosphere. The campaigns are great, the siege / assault / economic missions are a very entertaining challenge.

In all honesty, this is a cool upgrade with some additional content that I have yet to play. But I'm leaving a negative review because of what this is.

That ended just about when SHDE was released and I was attracted like a moth to light. Here is the point. Not for Anno 1800 did I resurrect Favorites; the idea occurred to me as I was playing SHDE. Now both of those games are back in Favorites because, well, so far I love these two games immensely.

Accidentally removing engineers from siege units is an issue

TRYING TO DIG A MOAT IS RIDICULOUS
moving into range and attacking does not exist, 

Map Editor Actions and Conditions are lackluster, so much more could be possible if that would be extended with a more dynamic approach, like marker swap, buy/sell only goods, wolf routing, bear attacks, predator spawning, bandit attack duration, good/bad event duration, min/max event intervall, etc. its just not fun trying to create custom missions when the editor only allows basic actions. To summarize: it's a map editor not a mission editor.

The graphic improvements are noticeable, but not drastic or jarring, the original charm is retained.
Original voices (50% of what made me love this game as a child) are still there.
The controls feel good, but unit patching is a bit hit & miss, AI are even more hit & miss.

The new content in the form of two short campaigns was... okay? Not terrible, just not very in depth.
One mission requires hitting several objectives quickly as regular 'easy' attacks from various signposts will be followed by one that will be very difficult to survive - even on the lower difficulties, and impossible if you weren't prepared for it (I wasn't, and I'm not sure the game really warns you about this well enough)
The two campaigns focus on the Rat & Snake's counties, but with much stronger unit comps than they seem to have in the original campaign. New intros & voice acting supports the new content.

Multiplayer as a built-in is nice, can be iffy with connectivity (Still easier than the old way), but lots of player made maps and a couple of updates have improved it so far.

[b]For people who haven't played previous versions;[/b]
If this is your first Stronghold game, this version is probably the best option as it's a little easier to play. 
Stronghold Crusader is often referenced as a better game - largely because the AI can build their own castles, which they CAN NOT in this game. The strength of Stronghold is the narrative campaign - which Crusader doesn't have.
A series of well sculpted missions with excellent writing & voice acting in their intros. The military campaign starts of easy and learning, introducing new elements, weapons and units in line with the story progression. 

It hasn't aged perfectly as a game, but I feel the main campaign holds up very well, even after years of re-playing, I didn't skip the intros, and thoroughly enjoyed them. 

The economic campaign sucks, but individual 'Invasions' and Economic maps are pretty fun, the sieges are cool, especially if you're familiar with the castles.

Many players of the original are disgruntled that this version hasn't imported features from Crusader, but that doesn't make sense to me personally, I got more or less what I expected, a polished, more playable (and OBS capture) version of the game from my childhood.

I do love Crusader, the skirmish missions, mercenaries and variety of AI lords, but can only hope that the success of, and support for Stronghold DE will lead to Crusader DE in the future.",1701409341,1701409341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's acceptable for 1v1 matches with friends, but playing against other players and joining their matches is nearly impossible.

I'll talk about the achievement No.. Really... You Are a Monster!. You have to kill a whopping ONE MILLION units, even on a extreme difficulty free build game I ran for many hours, I got ~10-15k kills in over 3 hours, free build becomes dull to me after 5 hours max and there's no AI skirmish to make it an entertaining grind and there are so few multiplayer lobbies... Not like you'd get even 2000 kills frequently on multiplayer games.
So! I made a map (you can find it as Cheesy Demon in the workshop) where I got  ~80k kills every hour, I started with ~40k kills, left the game running then went to bed and woke up to ~980k.

Although my review is positive because I genuinely enjoy Stronghold games, the game is still VERY green, double clicking units is odd (sometimes it actually selects all the units of a type and sometimes it selects 2-5 units, moreover it selects ALL the units on the map, not just the visible ones on your screen... had to rearrange 800 archers twice because of that lol). Units even on aggressive stance will sometimes not react to enemy presence, moreover they will return to their original position before re-engaging in combat if they don't touch another unit asap. You can't add units to control groups through CTRL+Shift+# unlike many RTS games, you have to open a small window and click a button with the units selected or just re-do the whole group, which is bad if you want to split 1 type of unit in multiple groups and readjust their size.

And there's even more stuff I could point out but I'm not sure they'd be a valid point to make.",1699468223,1701105824,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

-The classic stronghold with higher resolution and several improvements.
-Achievements add an extra layer of challenge.
-The inclusion of automatic trading is a significant plus, streamlining economic management.

Cons:

-Disappointed by the absence of cooperative play in multiplayer.
-Expected the return of the original narrators and a new campaign with their iconic voices.
Unfortunately, the new campaign features only one new narrator, narrating the story through journal entries before missions, which can get monotonous.
-The missions in the new campaign, however, introduce a fresh format, such as navigating from one side of the map to the other while rescuing units along the way, adding a new dynamic to gameplay.

Overall Impression:

Several quality-of-life updates make the gameplay more comfortable, like seeing a small arrow as an indicator if your popularity changes, or enabling right clicking orders for the troops.

Set in medieval England, it offers a blend of strategic military campaigns and city-building elements. Despite its promising premise, the remake may not entirely live up to the expectations of fans of the original.

Overall Score: 6.5/10

Graphics/Visuals (7/10):

The updated graphics are a noticeable improvement over the original. However, while they are good, they don't stand out as exceptional. Sure, the fire looks prettier, but thats not exactly adding a lot of value when the game is missing features that were in the original (looking at you, skirmish mode).

Sound & Music (8/10):

The remastered music, returning voice talent, and the contributions of series maestro Robert L. Euvino are notable highlights, adding depth and nostalgia to the gameplay experience. The sound is honestly the best part of the remake.

Story & Narrative (7/10):

The storyline, with its focus on medieval England and the challenge of uniting the kingdom against various lords, remains engaging. However, it doesn't bring much new to the table in terms of narrative innovation. The new campaign isn't all that great as it lacks the castle building elements in a majority of the missions. It just gives you a set amount of troops and says ""Good Luck!"". The main feature of the game is all the building elements, but it shoots itself in the foot by giving you missions you can't use it.

Gameplay & Mechanics (5/10):

While the gameplay stays true to the original's spirit, the absence of the skirmish mode is a significant drawback, especially for players seeking a single-player challenge. If you aren't playing multiplayer, there is no way to simply build and fight another kingdom, which was the funnest part of the game.

Replayability & Content (6/10):

The game offers a decent amount of content with its military and economic campaigns. However, the lack of variety in game modes, particularly the missing skirmish mode, limits its replayability significantly.

Innovation & Originality (6/10):

While the game attempts to bring classic RTS gameplay to a modern audience, it doesn't introduce substantial innovations or improvements over the original, making it feel somewhat dated. While I get thats the point, when you bring an old game back with less features than it originally had, its gonna be a bad time.

Technical Performance & Optimization (10/10):

The game performs just fine. No issues.

Value (6/10):

For fans of the original, the game might hold some value at $15 USD, but the absence of key features and lack of significant updates may not justify the purchase for new players or those looking for a comprehensive RTS experience. You are better off purchasing a previous installment in the series. I can't help but feel like this is a bit of a cash grab.

Final Thoughts:

The definitive edition of Stronghold nostalgically revisits the classic RTS, but it falls short in delivering a fully satisfying modern remake. The absence of popular features like skirmish mode and the lack of significant new content make it a mixed bag. It's a game that might appeal to die-hard fans of the original for its nostalgia factor but could disappoint those looking for a something more. 

If I could give it a mixed review, I would, but I can't recommend the game in its current state.

- Compared to HD, the graphics don't look that much better. Moreover, after 15 minutes of gameplay, you completely forget which version you're playing. I deliberately opened both HD and the Definitive Edition for comparison. There's no noticeable difference, except HD costs 1 euro, and the Definitive Edition costs 15 euros.
- Furthermore, HD feels even better because the animations in the game are quite clunky. It's understandable for that time and that image quality. In the Definitive Edition, they slightly improved the image quality, but the animations remained the same, now they look out of place.
- The quality of the game environment is questionable. If before everything was clear - where the cobblestones are, where the trash is, and where the impassable cliffs are, now eyes hurt from mixed up picture. The environment now lacks consistency. It seems as if it's stitched together from assets of different games.
[h1] 2. Game Engine. The good old Stronghold. [/h1]
- Gameplay-wise, it's the same game, with the same bugs and the same imperfect engine. The game has quite a few bugs, although they are not critical:
-- Soldiers clip through the tower into the jagged wall and remain stuck there forever.
-- The stone quarry storage sometimes spawns on an inaccessible cliff next to the quarry.
-- Sometimes food producers don't see the granary and consider it inaccessible - you have to delete and rebuild it.
-- Another bug - order archers to shoot an area. When they have their bows drawn, order them to shoot at single enemy. If before they couldn't reach him or shot at him in the general area, now all arrows fly precisely to the target. Cheese as it is.
-- If you want to overcome a cliff and are allowed to build - construct a wall cell right on the edge - now you can build a staircase on both sides of the wall. And your farmers no longer need to make a detour through half the map to get to the warehouse.
That is not all, just what I have quickly recalled.
- The controls in the game are a kind of torture. You won't be able to select one unit from a crowd from a bird's-eye view - always 2-3 fighters will be highlighted. And selecting all units of the same type with a double click in this situation becomes impossible. If you're controlling a group of siege weapons - you'll often accidentally move engineers out of them because exiting the weapon and moving are done with the same right mouse button.
- Another topic is the game engine and the way range is calculated. As a player, I NEVER understand where and from where my archers can shoot. Sometimes I calmly shoot beyond the towers, sometimes I don't reach the point where I should theoretically hit.
[h1] 3. Game Engine. The good old Stronghold. [/h1]
Quality of the New Campaigns and Gameplay in General.
- In short, the new campaigns are like a slap in the face. The missions feel as if they were made by a child. Some missions are simply long and disrespectful of the player's time, while others are absurdly simple and feel like a joke. Out of the two campaigns, there are 2-3 missions that genuinely spark interest. The rest are unclear fillers.
- I'll note a positive point here - missions where you have to first capture a castle and then hold it are a good addition.
- I want to address the developers - you should prohibit engineers from pouring pitch while standing on the ground. Because any mission where the player has access to pitch turns into a circus. Just place 3-4 engineers with pitch near the sighpost, and the entire enemy army will burn obediently while the AI is on timeout.
- The AI in the game is generally weak. Stronghold is not a game about castle building. It's a game about building 3-4 large towers right next to the sighpost. While the AI is on timeout, archers destroy any army. The solution to this problem is simple - allow the construction of defensive structures only within a radius around the bastion.

[h1] 4. What conclusions do I want to draw? [/h1]
All the negativity outlined above is not really the fault of the developers but rather the legacy of the old game. We love Stronghold for some of its bugs and cheesy mechanics. However, in the updated version, I would expect more than just improved graphics.

I'm glad I got to experience this iteration of the game, but I don't believe it's currently worth the money, especially considering you can buy HD for 1 euro. What would I expect from a refresh of such an old game?

-Overhaul of the engine regarding range calculation.
-Display of shooting range.
-The ability to set formations for squads. Try stretching your archers into a line now - it's not an easy task.
-Improve the AI; it's currently a sad sight.
-In multiplayer matches, add the option to play against AI + the ability to complete multiplayer scenarios.

However, I have a feeling that the developers simply wanted to quickly make some money, so we may never see these improvements.",1700992977,1701023392,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]The Jewel Campaign[/h1]
Two small campaigns with around 7 missions each. These are Campaigns where you fight the Rat or the Snake and there are different themes to these levels such as Build and Defend, Siege or Survive, free captured troops and get to the objective. It's fun and new. 

[h1]Castle Trail[/h1]
This is a series of 10 Siege or Defend the Castle levels with no time limit like the campaign.

I spent countless of hours, enjoying the previous games, but this one is definitely a major letdown. At least, objectively speaking. The original game is almost a quarter century old, and always had some shortcomings. Glitching issues, pathfinding problems and such. In the early 2000s we easily overlooked this, but it's shortcomings became painfully obvious when I played the game again.

Which means, that FireFly Studios didn't really do anything meaningful with the game, just gave it a graphical facelift and that's all. I didn't expect major overhaul, fully expanded campaign and such, but to be frank, not even minimal effort was put into this game.

- Unit pathfinding is still abysmal and seemingly at random, especially in larger groups.
- Moat filling is still annoying, units stretch out as wide as possible, exposing themselves to danger.
- Even with aggressive setting, archers/crossbowmen sometimes fail to shoot at targets, you have to micromanage them.
- Last, but not least, shitstain mission design stayed. Hello Mission #15, Carving the Path. Here, you can only cheese your way through, exploiting AI and map design like in the originals. I mean seriously, what would it take to fix the map here and there to give an angle to attack?

- Upgraded visuals
- Remastered music
- Modernized control
- Multiplayer mode
- Additional campaigns

Cons = The cost of staying true to the original
- Simple AI. The difficulty of the game lies in the number of enemy troops, not their attacking strategy.
- Game mechanics. All the flaws in the original that you used to abuse the enemy are still in this game. 
- Skirmish mode. I know that this mode was not in the original, but why not adding it here?

All in all, the price is justifiable to ignore the cons.

To the FireFly Studios (from my honest opinion), this is a great opportunity for the team to realize the next direction.

Not to say that there isn't a natural sense of challenge in this game, as the option to choose your difficulty is of course welcome (not sure if that has been the case with original Crusader, I haven't played the original in many years).

The updated textures are gorgeous, the smoothed out frame-rates are something to get used to but it is a welcome addition that sees a revival of something so classic and close to my heart. It is absolutely wonderful and I wouldn't ask for anything more other than skirmish mode.

This a great addition and truly the definitive way of playing Stronghold, however as a fan of both the original and Crusader there's a couple of things that I have to say.

PROS
-the game runs well and for a definitive edition it doesn't require a PC with big hardware.
-the new animations are great.
-this definitive edition has follow the good example of Aoe 2 DE, respects the original as well as improving everything that made the original good.

CONS
-The multiplayer as of now (the date of this comment) is still laggy and it seems the Firefly team needs to work on regions because some matches are unplayable until the player from a different region is defeated or quits.
-I hope the Firefly team brings some of the features that they had on Crusader to this multiplayer (faster speeds on production units and with bigger popularity stats) as well as more customization for multiplayer profiles (emblems and custom Lords) so if you exclusively only play Crusader the multiplayer experience is gonna feel slow.
-There is some glitches, however. I cant bring myself to call them ""bad"" given that these glitches are found on the CD/HD ver. Such as: peasants dying if a building is set up around their walk path, chickens and animals climbing on towers and walls or being on top of buildings, called them fateful or annoying that is up to the person reading this.
-I hope some of the classic features get an improvement, peasants will still give their lives to drop off cheese or bread and I hope their AI gets fixed on that, peasants also will die if a gate is closed in front of them which for vet player is not a big deal due to this being part of the OG, but if these things occur on the Definitive Edition which is marketed as the gateway to the Stronghold saga I believe these glitches and outdated AI can stay in the past.",1700953789,1700953789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Definitive Edition mostly leaves intact what made the original game so outstanding, and the new visuals are definitely nice for the most part. So far so good.

The lack of a Skirmish mode like a lot of users pointed out isn't really the issue here. While it's nice to had it backported from the sequel Stronghold Crusader the game could easily do without that provided the Singleplayer content excels over it. And here's the thing. The real problem is what got added into the game, or what which didn't get changed.

The main campaign of 21 missions is awesome... But it has 3 awful missions in it centered around you commanding forces to take over a castle. While the missions aren't really that hard on Normal and still fair and doable on higher dificulties it's just an annoying nightmare to deal with those 3 siege missions even on Easy. They're totally not fun in the slighest and you're going to have to rely on an insane amount of saving and loading to get through (in comparison the rest of the missions can just be easily cleared without saving). It's completely out of contrast. While that was always part of the original game too it's a missed opportunity the devs didn't do some proper playtesting. How about considerable more troops, or fewer traps and forces for the opponent on Easy. That's what Easy is for.

There's also the economic campaign. It's fine and fun in it's own right, but it has some extremely annoying design going for it. Most hurdles thrown at you come in the form of events, like fires in the fourth mission. Not only erases it all your building in a blink of an eye, but your popularity just nosedives below 50 in a matter of seconds, meaning you have no way to get back up. Especially if your grannary goes out of stock too. The thing is... These are events. You could build water wells to quench the fires but it has to be one of the most useless buildings there is. Forget about trying to clear out the fires in time. Since the events occur at set intervals you keep making saves, and optimize for the best outcome prior to the fire starting. Bandits are fun too. Not because the bandits itself are that much of a hassle but because they obviously have to impact your popularity too. And they raze every structure in your path, and you can forget about your own forces making it in time unless you already had towers and walls set up in time.

Speaking about bandits... There's a two new smaller campaigns added into the Definitive Edition... And I feel mixed about it. When it's just a normal mission, it's fine for the most part, but I don't get for example why they rely so much on the economic-style campaign events such as bandits and fires as well. The original campaign didn't do that. And to make things worse, about one-third to half of the missions are siege missions... Yes... The exactly kind of missions you hate so much. It doesn't help that Stronghold doesn't have the cleanest gameplay to control your army with. There's no Attack Move for example like in Age of Empires II. Melee units don't tend to position them in front of your archers. Stuff like that. While none of this was an issue for me during the regular campaign, it does become an issue when mission design makes it it's core.

The two new campaigns also lack the same interesting storytelling the original campaign had. While the storytelling was nothing groundbreaking, it was charming with figures such as Sir Longarm, Lord Woolsack and the four villains. Showing the map of England (thank goodness my language sticks the default England map) shifting it's balance of control was already one of my smaller pleasures when playing Stronghold back then. The new campaigns? Forget all of this. Just a background with some scrolling texts. You don't even get to see in the mission overview which new features you got access to in that mission. It just links to the guide now instead. This was another one of those smaller things that added up to the experience.

Half of the original campaign is mostly focused on these invasion missions where you build up your fortifications and hold out for like 3 or 4 waves of attacks. And while these type of missions are generally fine and fun they generally don't last long enough in the 2nd half of the campaign. Don't bother trying to set up a whole infrastructure. By the time you done so the final wave has already started. The problem is that once you reach the second half of the campaign your ability to make more complex infrastructures increases too, yet... These missions last just as long, except with stronger and more enemies. It's best to just focus on the essential, boosting your popularity through good things, raise the taxes and buying the weapons from the Market. Producing them yourself just takes too long in missions this short. Maybe this was always the case, but I felt like the original campaign could have been rebalanced here and there. Especially with the mission you have to defeat the Snake you notice why there isn't a Skirmish mode in this game. The AI controlling the Snake is practicially braindead and all challenge in that mission mostly comes from invasions from the Pig at set intervals.

There's also some other stuff here and there that doesn't make sense. Why aren't Black Monks recruitable anymore from cathedrals? Did I miss something? Was boosting popularity through religion always that useless? Even with a dozen chapels you barely boost it. Do the townfolk always get in the way when I want to place buildings? Why are minor obstacles on the terrain such a problem now to build structures upon? Especially if you get into missions with barely any space to build. Why do my towers and gates instantly tear down when a new invassion happens if I build them too close by? The game already prevents you from building too close to signposts, so why do they get torn down instantly when I am allowed to build?

It's just a shame the original Stronghold couldn't had been better than this. You probably don't want to buy the two new DLCs if their quality is more of that of the new Jewel campaigns in this versions. I feel like a Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition would have gotten away much better with it even if it had the same lack of polished fine-tweaking in some areas and meager new campaigns. It has a Skirmish mode at least and given they keep things as they are, even if only for the Skirmish Trials it would had been an absolute positive.

Before I end this on a sour note. I really love Stronghold, and for the price this Definitive Edition is sold at you can't really go wrong with it (even better when on sale). What's there to love about Stronghold is still there, and even if it's only the original campaign it's still very much worth it (if you can resist slamming your keyboard trying to do those siege missions that is). You just need to know what you're getting into: a singleplayer campaign experience, which is perfectly fine. I just wished some more attention was given to the new content and the game was a bit more rebalanced. Some missions are simply too easy. Others too short. Others completely sucks. And others are just too frustating through it's events.",1700917028,1700917028,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

While I never played the original, I have always been a huge fan of Stronghold Crusader and moderately a fan of the other Stronghold entries. It's the most like Crusader, and I mean this as a huge positive, both games have similar/same animations, characters, units, and music. The feel this game, and Crusader, capture is unlike any other game in the genre. You do not get games with this much charm, unique and smooth gameplay, or music as good as this. This is Stronghold done right! I love the updated graphics and how smooth this game runs!

I am hoping the positive reviews and success of this definitive edition show Firefly that Crusader would be just as much, if not more of a success! I also hope it highlights how much Stronghold 1 and Crusader features are valued while they create their next big Stronghold title.

I do have some complaints:
1.  No Skirmish mode - The original also did not have this mode, but this mode is arguably the mode that keeps players playing the longest and allows more replay ability, especially for those who don't like playing against real players online.
2. No AI in multiplayer - There is no option to face AI in a multiplayer match, only real players. This just stopped at least 2 people I know from buying the game. I wonder how many others? As I mentioned above, there are players who do not like playing against real players, and having AI in multiplayer would have allowed the game to reach a larger audience and as well add more replay ability.

I love this game, I can't wait to complete the campaign and all the addicting challenges Stronghold is so good at, but coming from Crusader, which had skirmish and the option for AI in multiplayer matches, I felt disappointed that I will inevitably complete this game and have little reason to return once I finish the missions. Whereas if it had those features, I'd play this for years with my sister. I am hoping they update to add one or both of these features, but I do not have my hopes too high.

All in all, it's a great and true remaster of Stronghold 1. If you're a fan of the original and/or Crusader, pick this up and play! Show the developers your support for this incredible gem of a game.

here was we should have gotten:
maps size increase: 
to at least 800x800 (if not 1600x1600) everyone that played in the good old days through hamachi or gameranger knows that in 8 player maps there's literally barely any space once the game gets rolling and ballista balling each others towes is kinda meh
fighting balancing:
the abc of sword vs pike vs cav and ranged could've really used some tweaking. i would've really like to see cavalry get an evasion stat since ranged still mows down everything and has to much hp for cut through once cav gets to it. why not give cav a one shot mechanic to archers like that actually kinda makes sense being charged at in full armor
unit positioning:
why was drag to line unit placement not implemented to this day if you want to make a defensive line in  open field once needs to micro a lot just to get a line set up not to be flanked. even for placing units on walls this would have been a really nice non invasive add.
economy:
why not add a few things here and there... oxen for iron mines as well as stone big houses for example anything really i am aware its the definitive edition but it could've used some defining not simply recycling 100% 
campaign:
I mean even if you kept all the same maps you could have still changed the map or updated it not this pixel clutter we had 20 years ago. even added a few additional maps to it to give player choice since game development has actually changed since then. 

whats not even working:
ranged units now have the active targeting circle red even though they are out of range and cant actually shoot the target which makes for really weird encounters. in some campaign maps a single bush hinders 15+ archers from shooting because there is some odd LOS mechanic with it that was not there. this lets me believe you didn't even test your own maps tbh.

your proposed roadmap confirms the cash oriented approach even more, from what i see all we will be getting is campaign DLCs for probably 7-10 maps which tbh I can slab together in a few hours based on the current quality. sadly you we won't be getting access to the game files through workshop just mapsharing which kinda sucks because i know the modding community would fix most of this in days...

but ey at least you got the money... I am wondering what you'll do with it... probably crusader definitive edition since ey why not slab another 20 out of the franchise",1700833970,1700859592,False,2,0,0.493403702974319458,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of good UI improvements (autotrade makes managing your economy slightly more streamlined without ruining the fun of build planning) and the new half-campaign is decently challenging. There's a lot less sitting around and waiting in the new missions, which will appeal to new RTS sensibilities.

I do think the marketing campaign around the new missions has been a bit misleading. They've been advertising the new missions sets as being themed around our old favourite villains of the series, but they're not really. The villains were characterised by their difficulty, their VA's fantastic performances, and the units they threw at you during the campaign. None of these internal consistencies have carried over. Just a personal bone I'd like to pick, the missions are still good (the Peninsula castle build was a highlight).

I feel really bad giving this a bad review but the game needs to be fixed. I will be happy to change my review once the product owner and dev team fix a few things and add some additional features. 

Here's what Firefly needs to do in order to give fans a Minimum Lovable Product:

1. Multiplayer games ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SHOW PING - we are almost in 2024 and playing games with people far away. Showing ping will prevent us from starting games with laggers/bad connections. That is a quick patch/fix and will improve the experience of many players. It may even solve the lag issue if we prevent it in the first place.

2. Allow buildings to be placed where peasants/soldiers are in the space. Modern RTS games allow this and it shouldn't be too hard to code an update.

3. The developers need to figure out why there is still bad lag and drop outs even after recent patches. There are many RTS games where this isn't an issue in 2023 so please figure it out and investigate. A re-release means you actually work to re-release and modernize code. If the lag is a player host issue, figure out a way to improve the code and make it more efficient.

4. Multiplayer staging screen should show map download progress indicator to both players and admin

5. Multiplayer needs more options as to what is permitted/not permitted. It should allow the admin to turn on/off mangonels, onagers, certain infantry weapon classes, walls, etc. otherwise everyone is just working off of honor system/a gentlemen's agreement

6. Multiplayer needs to add an option of PT (Peacetime) in the game so nobody can attack until X min (20 min, 30 min, 60 min, etc) 

I love the game but you can't just put out a game 20 years later and try and collect holiday gift money without ""modernizing"" the experience.",1700754320,1700754966,False,21,0,0.614767253398895264,1,True,False,False

Stronghold: Definitive Edition is a fantastic game. 
It offers a plethora of Quality of Life improvements, multiplayer through Steam, and additional campaigns. 
However, I must give it a negative review due to the absence of skirmish mode. I'm aware that Firefly Studios has repeatedly stated that this feature wouldn't be available at launch. 
Frankly? I don't care. If they wanted the game to be played and fondly remembered for years, the lack of skirmish mode is inexcusable. All the excuses about budget constraints or lack of resources don't matter to me as a devoted Stronghold fan. I want a game that lasts for years, not to tell my friends - sorry, we can't play together against bots because someone thought it was a brilliant idea not to include this feature.
Best regards, and I hope that Firefly Studios wakes up and implements this, even if it's in the form of paid DLC",1699794517,1700739104,False,4,1,0.49084588885307312,1,True,False,False

I supposed i can say something now that i finished all the mission. While, i have to say the nostalgic google is in effect for me. I also cant say there is any other strategy game that feels like stronghold. if anything this refresh it and open it to new player to the genres, the feels of somewhat basic but satisfying castle building and even if basic combats still enjoyable to some extent. the game is slower and enjoyable to not be sweaty tryhard. you can look at little sprites of your people doing their chores to your ever expanding granary, stockpile, armory does feel good. 

if we look at grand scheme of things. you can say, this is very bare bone as i have played the more active combat focus stronghold crusader, the more complex needs of managing castle from stronghold 2 or newer installment. i do think this still holds up for being an enjoyable campaign albeit a bit dragged out sometimes. 

From Crusader, the bits of campaign and voices from Stronghold does stick to me personally. It feels like having characters. i do hope when they do definitive stronghold crusader, they can implement a story approach with the more combat emphasized nature of crusader.

In the end, i enjoy it even if some people may see it as the studio being lazy or ran out of ideas. i had fun and for the price and probably some 20hrs and 30hrs in, you get the bang for your buck.",1699465315,1700736601,True,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Fist off, the reason why I liked this game is that graphic and ""contentwise"" the game is fine, I like the new features, the new and improved HUD and the more accessible menu overall and I became familiarised with the new scribe and I decided to keep him. The game indeed gave me a sense of nostalgia and I enjoyed playing it.
And secondly, the things that I did not like were: 
-The animations. They were unchanged from the base game...I expected for a 2023 remake to have a much smoother animations
-The voice acting. I wished that for women to have an actual woman that speaks rather than a man in his 40s trying to sound childish...but I understand that this might be because you wanted to keep the authenticity of the first game.
-Some bugs.

The main point is, This game is a classic remastered. The game looks a lot better than it firstly did obviously, the campaigns are fun and the game is very easy to learn which really is what got people into the Stronghold series in the first place. The game is a good entry to the many games that Stronghold has. At it's current price point I think it's fair enough for it to stand for itself.

As a Stronghold veteran since day 1 (I started playing Stronghold  way back when it came out in 2001) 
i can only say that this is an amazing remake. The graphics are very clean and were upscaled so you can see much more details as in the original, but the visual style of Stronghold is still preserved. Several quality-of-life updates make the gameplay more comfortable, like seeing a small arrow as an indicator if your popularity changes, or enabling right clicking orders for the troops.

Essentially, this is Stronghold 1 with all its contents and some more, like new campaigns, workshop support, achievements. I can recommend this for veterans and new players. Good Job Firefly.

CONS:
-No skirmish against AI (Which Stronghold 1 also did not have to be fair)
-No local LAN-Mode, which is bad for people like me who like to participate in LAN-Parties (Yeah they still exist)",1700657914,1700657914,True,46,1,0.788550257682800293,0,True,False,False

Stronghold - The Fallen Kingdom 

As soon as the King had marched his army, into the barbarian homeland, rumours began of a plot to seize the throne. When news came of the King's capture, the country was invaded. Several nobles, including your father, sought to end the bloodshed but on the way to meet for negotiations their party was massacred by a band of unknown raiders. Bruised and exhausted, you have been beaten back to a forest on an overlooked peninsula where a group of loyal troops are hiding. Although the country is lost, maybe from this refuge you can at least avenge your father's death.

Yes, my Lord! This game truly unique, has a special place in my heart. Played since my childhood, one of those games always keeps me coming back. Even now, stood test of time for original. 

Stronghold: Definitive Edition honours the original Stronghold game.

Great so far, like original campaign not many changes, nice little upgrades for main campaign.  

Added new side stories. Which is interesting.

Called The Jewel Campaign which has two stories.

Agents of the Crown

Escape from Snake Island

Have story telling chapters, like the main campaign which nice to see.

Under Combat:
Main Campaign 
The Jewel Campaign - truly jewel new story content
Siege
Invasion
Castle Trail - which looks great.

Under Economic:
Economic Campaign
Economic Mission
Free Build

Also has Multiplayer & Map Editor design dream Castle.

Another feature found under options, click the chicken added cheats, fair warning effects achievements unlocking. 

Stronghold: Definitive Edition has Roadmap 

Winter Update 
New Economic Campaign
Swine's Bay (DLC)

Spring Update
Second Castle Trail
Valley of the Wolf (DLC)

Stronghold 2 

Matthew Steele: ''I was young, naive, war fell upon us, so quickly. There was no word from the king! The land, destroyed; people were butchered, like cattle and they burnt their homes. The Barons moved with murderous haste and then they reached us! People prepared, as if they had a chance. My Lord watched, waiting, for the inevitable. In my heart, I knew that for my Lord this battle was lost but for me. The war was just the beginning''

Edwin Blackfly: ''Just so we are clear everybody, kill them, kill them all! I want none left alive, not a peasant, not a lord, not a fly, not one... kill them dead... all of them... dead...''

Truly awesome see new version of Stronghold 2, has similar treatment to Stronghold: Definitive Edition.

It hurts a little that the game does not have AI in multiplayer or single mode like in crusader. Hopefully, with the announced DLCs, this will change.

The game always had great campaign and gameplay.
The new campaign, more missions, steam multiplayer support, 4k support are all great things, and I think they warrant rebuying the game at current pricepoint.

The only reason this review is negative is to the get devs attention - the pathfinding bugs are baffling and really irritate. Also the issue with ambiguity which fields are traversable leads to rage-inducing issues with imprecise walling - especially close to the map edge. The AI is also weirdly exploitable (it seems that once the AI orders units somewhere it will calculate path once, and won't recalculate it regardless of what happens in the meantime)

There wasn't this much pathfinding issues in the original (I don't recall the state of AI, so no argument for comparison here). The readability always was an issue, but I feel it could've been solved (or improved) in the remaster.

In general, it was difficult for me to make a choice between a positive assessment and a negative one for the game.
I will not list the advantages because if you played the original edition, then you already know them.
And now to the advantages of the publication itself. The very beauty of the reissue is the updated graphics, new missions, the addition of online battles. Everything.
Now for the cons. The translation and voice-over jambs have not been fixed (I'm talking about the version with Russian voice-over). The new missions suffer the same problem as other new missions in other re-releases and games of the series.
1. Plot: it happens when the devil understands and only ruins the main plot of the game
2. The missions are not that difficult, but in some moments it causes irritation even at normal difficulty (I played at very high and this is even more noticeable).
Now I'll move on to the online game. In an online game, you won’t find anyone after a couple of days of the re-release being released, and this is a bad signal for the game.
TO SUM UP: Despite the significant disadvantages of the re-release, I still believe that you can turn a blind eye to them due to the fact that the re-release adds features and network play that were not in the original, but all this was in other parts of the series. That is, this re-release makes a demo version of the game and also a series of games (yes, initially stronghold was just a test of the idea itself, which, as we all know, reached the general public), and puts the original game on a par with its successors. So I decided to give the game a positive rating.

RU
Вообще мне было сложно сделать выбор между положительной оценкой и отрицательной к игре. 
Перечислять плюсы я не стану по причине того, что если вы играли в оригинальное издание, то вы и так их знаете. 
А теперь к плюсам самого издания. Сама прелесть переиздания состоит в обновленной графике, новых миссиях, добавлении сетевых сражений. Всё.
Теперь по минусам. Косяки перевода и озвучки так и не исправили (говорю это про версию с русской озвучкой). Новые миссии страдают теме же проблема, что и другие новые миссии в других переизданиях и играх серии.
1. Сюжет: он происходит черт пойми когда и только руинит основной сюжет игры
2. Миссии не то, чтобы сложные, но в некоторых моментах вызывает раздражение даже на нормальной сложности (я  играл на очень высокой и это ещё заметнее).
Теперь перейду к сетевой игре. В сетевой игре вы фиг кого найдёте уже спустя пару дней выхода переиздания, а это плохой сигнал для игры.
ПОДВОДЯ ИТОГ: Не смотря на существенные минусы переиздания, я всё же считаю, что на них можно закрыть глаза по причине того, что переиздание добавляет фишки и сетевую игру, которых не было в оригинале, но всё это было в других частях серии. То есть это переиздание делает демо-версию игры и по совместительству серии игр (да, изначально stronghold был просто тестом самой идеи, который как все мы знаем зашёл широкой публике), и ставит оригинальную игру в один ряд с её приемниками. Так что я принял решение поставить положительную оценку игру.",1700639788,1700639788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But that's just personal opinion.

Now playing this on a 27"" screen, still gives you all those borderes all around and nicely pixelated, could be just remembering wrong but the game feels much slower compared to the original (by that i mean the 2001 released one)

If you slow down (you know the lil trick, when you play SP and just go to 20 and drop down all the buildings) the game expect the grid to become really clunky, not sure how this is connected, but once you go back to 90 speed it's fine

Multiplayer is a joke, not what the community wants, so i would say it's still not an improvement.

Balancing still not a thing, you will end up making bread, ignoring churches and sell iron and stone in huge quantities.

New single player content is great, devs have said more content will be added. And for $19.99NZD? Can't complain at all.

The game does miss some of the QoL we come to expect from playing Stronghold Crusader which is a shame (such as no 'Keep enclosed' flag, or clicking resources directly from the stockpile/marketplace for quick buy/sell), but overall if you loved the original then its worth giving this one a shot for the new content alone.",1700630647,1700630691,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

　Before you think that buying this game will give us the game we've all been waiting for (of course, it's the Crusader game), mind if you check this [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3075689622]image link[/url]. Anyway, I'm a man of my word. I played the game when the first demo came out and provided feedback to the developer. I promised that if they added the option to change our player color in single-player mode, I would buy the game on day one. And here I am. However, if you were hoping for a skirmish mode, I have some bad news.

　The Stronghold game had the best castle simulation gameplay I had ever played. There's no other castle simulation game that keeps me coming back and spending hundreds of hours like Stronghold does. It's an RTS game with main features such as villagers doing their work with amazing animations and progression, unlike many other RTS games that often involve going back and forth without achieving much. Stronghold breathes life into the castle simulation genre.

　Seeing your kingdom progress from nothing into a grand European castle was the best view you had back in the 2000s. If you're familiar with SHC, you know that this game only uses 'Crusader' units, which actually forces you to go through a building process, search for resources, set up military workshops, collect tax money, and then build units. For me, it does feel a bit slower than SHC, not to mention that event missions, economy, and food can pose a pretty decent challenge. But hey, I had the original Stronghold and never finished it due to hardware optimization issues, so gameplay-wise, it's fine!

　Graphically, it looks amazing. The new designs for each unit and building sprite are blowing my mind compared to the original ones. You can now zoom in, a feature that 12-year-old me always wanted, and it's finally here. It looks amazing and great.

　The main problem, though, is that I'm not a fan of the Lord cutscenes. For an easy example, I hate the opening intro this game still uses. It's just an upscaled old file without creating a new one. Some backgrounds are brand new, and I appreciate that, but some cutscenes still look outdated. Seriously, I have a 1990s porn file that looks sharper than the intro video. Come on, Firefly, I know you guys are focusing on 'Stronghold Unreal,' which I have no interest in because I'm a big fan of Stronghold Crusader. Please, move all your resources to make Crusader DE.

　Well, that's the problem with the Stronghold game. You can't play against AI like in SHC. However, the good news is that this game has made multiplayer easy, so you don't need to install GameRanger. While I'm not into PvP in SH because I wasn't in the past, you can now play multiplayer, whether you're a new or old player, without any issues.

　Pig and Wolf, the most annoying lords in SHC. I'm sorry. I'll use SHC as an example because I know that the majority of Stronghold fans come from SHC. So yeah, you've got four lords to fight against: Rat, Snake, Pig, and Wolf (that's a lord's name, I know, probably Firefly Studios were having some fun back in the day). I mean, I don't think they're based on real historical figures, because I know medieval history was too brutal, you know, with things like torture and witch burnings. Yeah, I have no problem with the European British story, but come on, Firefly, give us Crusader. Let us conquer the Holy Land once more!

　•　There are few official maps
　•　There is NO AUTO event setting for free build modes
　•　The old cutscene movies have been upscaled and look terrible.
　•　There is no skirmish mode, which is the reason they should have released SHC.
　•　The Knight sprite looks like a British person knocked out from meth.
　•　Player colors still use Dark Blue even if you change your color through the settings
　•　On the developer's side, they have said that some missions ""may need to be beaten"" by using these glitches. they mentioned that on their YouTube channel

On top of that it has some nice improvements like ultrawide support, very smooth animations and nice textures and some quality of life features like auto buy and sell of goods on the marketplace, more zoom and gather points for newly hired soldiers.
It did what every Definitive Edition should do: It looks and feels like you remember it. 

Sadly the new campaign consists of more of those missions where you have to kill enemy units with a limited given army, which, in my opinion, strips the game of its own strenth - building your own stronghold.

Because I'm certain they'll fix it soon, and this game is still worth picking up for the SP content alone. Additionally, the times when it did work, it was really fun! The addition of the Workshop makes sure there are always new maps to play with friends or randoms, and the process of them joining and receiving the map file is quick and easy so you can start playing custom content right away without any hassle.

For more than 20 years, Stronghold has held steadfast to its RTS niche amongst the Starcrafts, Age of Empires and Command & Conquers of the world. Thus it is only fitting that it, too, now finally enjoys the luxury of a definitive edition.

For many of my generation, this was one of their first real PC games and the franchise is still beloved to this day. Playing it is ageless fun.

I can't really comment on the MP side of things (Coop, Bots, Skirmish) because I was never into that. However, I don't really see how something that was never part of the original game could warrant a negative review.

From what I can tell, Firefly Studios are dedicated to adding more content in the future which is very much welcome. At the time of writing I've already finished the new Rat and Snake campaigns which I thoroughly enjoyed. Looking forward to the Pig and Wolf DLCs!

Its just as bare bones as the first entry of the series which really did not make good use of replayability.

Crusader has give me hundreds of hours of gameplay, where I needed to proove myself against all the different combinations of enemies paired with the challenge of the map. THIS IS WHERE THE GAME SHINES.

Not in random missions where you are bound to some regulations that make no sense. If i have bread why cant I trade it all the time? If I cant make bread okay, but I dont even get a chance this way to clear my stock.

The economic missions arent really fun either because your only enemy is some random fire that just burns your village without having a chance to fight it.

If we dont get any skirmish mode and ai to play against this game will be dead in no time.
Overall its an okay experience but the potential is not even slightly used.

Its just a disgrace to let this great system rot in a couple of missions that just dont have replay value, the replay value only returns after stopping to play for like 2 Years. Its so sad that firefly did not put in the work for skirmish, nobody really wants a campaign just give us skirmish and ai. This way the Game will stay alive for literally forever see stronghold crusader.

As many other reviews point out, this could have had a skirmish mode with AI's, ranked games with players in your area, maybe different game modes in multiplayer.

Oh well, I decided to buy it anyways and try it out. Went into a multiplayer match and it was laggy, just didnt feel good to play at all. Went into another one, same thing, then it crashes, woo! I thought: Okay, multiplayer is not looking too good, lets try singleplayer. So I wanted to play a map that was in the old Stronghold game, and after looking for a while it wasnt even there. So I go into an invasion map and.. it feels so janky and strange compared to the old normal version, it just feels worse.

Thats a refund.

They have had these issues for over 20 years since the games release in early 2000s and at no point was it ever fixed.

I would buy it for £10 from Game 20 years ago and when that CD would get too scratched or I'd lose it, I'd buy it again. And again. And again.

Stronghold: Definitive Edition is the exact same game I re-bought those 20 years ago; warts and all. It runs to a modern standard, it retains it's unbelievable charm, it's challenging and I absolutely love it... but, it's a game from 20 years ago. 

Multiple times I've snatched victory from the jaws of defeat by the foolishness of the attacking AI:
- Spearmen entering my keep to attack my lord only to leave and attack spawning peasants while my archers decimate them.
- In the mission where you try to truce with de Puce (that rhymes), the mangonels were built in the valley and were unable to pathfind to the walls correctly, simply marching right up to them and getting peppered with arrows.
- You can cheese missions by building defences as close as possible to the signpost. When the enemy spawns they will stand and take arrow fire until the scripting kicks in to make them move.
- An attacking army which should just rush the throne, stops to break down palisades - even under enemy fire.

I feel bad giving a game and series I love so much a thumbs down but I just know if I wasn't wracked with nostalgia this would be a regrettable buy from me. I was very on the fence about this rating. The price is very, very fair. I commend FireFly on not ripping the arse out of it.

Graphics: When I first played the new version, I did not see that much difference to the older versions. But then I started the HD-version: Oh my, what a difference! Crystal clear graphics instead of blocky ones. It also workes on Ultra Wide displays without black borders!

The gameplay is good and bad at the same time:  Building a castle is fun and the economy works as intended without much flaws. But the fighting system? If you select archers and an enemy just out of reach: They don't go to him, no, they just say ""I cannot reach him"". This is mediocre, but ok when defending a castle, but attacking one this behavior breacks your balls. As well as the spearmen etc. If set on aggressive, they attack walls first bevor attacking the enemy. So if you breached a castle, they will not go after the attacking foes on the towers, they will attack the next wall. If you manually select them to attack a foe, they might kill him and even then, they start hacking the walls. This is so frustrating!

For over 20 years now we watched Firefly trying to capture even a glimpse of the brilliance they captured with stroghold and stronghold crusader, the latter of which released in 2002. 
Fore two decades we bought title after title hoping they would have returned to that original spark that put their studio on the map, only to be disapointed time and time again. 
We have experienced everything from from buggy titles, ugly graphics, dysfunctional clients, broken AI and unfinished releases and compared to all those set backs stronghold definitive edition is at last a step in the right direction. 
However Firefly chose to call this remaster a definitive edition, yet there is precious little definitive about it. 
They had 20 years, 20 years to get this right and yet we are still confronted with the same frustrating bugs, from units disappearing to broken AI, on top of gaining an entirely new issue on the side of online functunality, which is practically none existent. 
Compared to the features and improvements of other companies definitive editions, which they deliberately invited comparison too when they labeled it as such, this is a sad excuse for another round of cashing in on Stronghold Nostalgia.

This game is perfectly serviceable as a remaster, it is an accurate to the original and makes notable improvements in areas  like aspect ratio. So I am not gonna tell die hard stronghold fans not to enjoy it, after 20 years of worse and worse stronghold titles, this game must appear like drops of a water in the uncaring desert, but for anyone that looks for a deeper  truely defintiive experience they are probably better off just playing a modded version of crusader or just save the money and keep playing stronghold for what little this game offers in extra content: two very short campaigns and a campaign trail, which is again more frustrating than fun due to broken AI. But then again maybe you just appreciate the slightly prettier pictures, although if you want to see how far the love and dedication has fallen just look at what they did to your poor advisor (and yes I know you can turn his appearance back to the old version, its just sad that I felt the need to do that, which again I find runs contradictory to what a definitive edition should stand for).",1700246522,1700246522,False,6,0,0.540997624397277832,0,True,False,False

The economy management is perfectly balanced with the fighting and strategy. The troops are very well balanced too every soldier has its strength and weakness. You can't just make hordes of only one unit. Although I'm new to this original Stronghold game it is the same core game and completely the same units and many of the same enemies so far but in a brand new beautiful setting.

I'm enjoying how thoroughly scripted and well thought out the original campaign was. Playing it on hard on my first run through is a refreshing challenge. (There is also a ""very hard"" game mode, and it stores a point system to challenge you to get higher scores) I'm about halfway through now. Still haven't tried multiplayer or the new campaign or game modes yet but I am confident I'll enjoy those too. 

For newcomers, the game will look dated but trust me its a ton of fun and worth giving it a chance. Most of the negative reviews are from vets wanting the skirmish mode that's missing from the game.

This game is looks a lot better compared to the older crusaders, but it lacks a lot of basic features and is not in a stable state to play. Skirmisch and multiplayer vs AI is not available. You cant even play offline custom games against AI. It does have a campagne that can be finished in about 10-20 hours.

This game can become a great game, but is needs a lot of improvements by expanding the basic features and improving the stability of the multiplayer. Just come back to this game in a few months when it's polished!

Some of you could define ""Stronghold: Definitive Edition"" as a nostalgia operation, trying to resell the same copy of ""Stronghold"" over and over again (Skyrim docet) and probably you are not wrong. So, what this version has to offer? Besides a fresh new graphic, the only thing that really matters is the multiplayer which, in his current state, is a little bit clunky. Of course there are plenty of new quality of life improvements (autoselling/buying, rally points, keybindings, a more dynamic camera, steam workshop), nothing really necessary but still appreciated. What about the new Campaigns? Despite being really challenging (especially on very hard), they are not really adding anything interesting or engaging.

So, why did I buy this game? Because replaying a game which defined my childhood and hearing ""Castlejam"" after 20 years, is priceless.",1700130027,1700130027,True,22,3,0.723202824592590332,0,True,False,False

been a long fan of this game since almost 20 years

there are far too many small issues a a bunch of big issues
yes these will get adressed in probably future patches but I want to play a game at release and not months later after all the patches.

VSync doesnt work (at least for me), textures look horrible when zoomed out, in general almost every video has ugly aliasing artefacts some wrong scaling here as well, multiplayer is unstable which is pretty ridiculous cause thats is one of the big things that is advertised for this game (yes they are currently fixing it but still sad that this happens).
most of the issues in general have been reported since the first demo monts ago and its still no fixed.

they should just have called it ""remastered"", people expect much more from a ""defitivie edition"", just far too many features are missing. skirmish, bigger maps, a free zoom.

I don't recall another that I have installed and re-installed to play the singleplayer campaign (Yes kids, back then we didn't have 2TB SSDs and had to make room for new games XD).
So, if you never experienced this game, you're probably gonna enjoy it if you're in this genre. Despite it's old age, it's still old up today.
Watching all your peasants work and crossbow men shoot down enemies as they approach your walls is very satisfying.

Pros : 
Same old good Stronghold like you remembered.
Updated graphics and resolution
Attention to details
Castles and sieges
Cool story that makes you want to keep playing

Cons :
Same old good stronghold

    [*] I have a keen eye for detail, and one of the most bothersome things are[b] the oversharpened [/b]textures, especially on buildings like the hunting hut. The old game had one thing it nailed perfectly: a harmonious design throughout every visual aspect of the game. I've already noticed a lot of mirrored textures (e.g., the recruitment building HUD) and, as mentioned, oversharpened buildings or units. They don't blend well together, which I hope will be fixed because this is probably the first time I can't stare at my screen for a long time without feeling exhausted, and I'm 26.
    [*] The dialogue volume decreases throughout the game while other sounds remain at the same level.
    [*] I really dislike having to zoom out every time I start a new mission or map. It always starts at the most zoomed-in option.
    [*] The UI elements of the cursor also scale down with the UI scale setting, which shouldn't happen. Please let me change the HUD of the game and the cursor elements separately.

This is not a ""definitive edition"" for Stronghold games as a whole, it's a slightly updated version of the original Stronghold only. If you, like me, preferred Stronghold Crusader, this will be a disappointment. There are elements missing that ought to be there. When I saw ""Stronghold DEFINITIVE Edition"" my initial thought was ""oh good, they made an updated, combined version of the old Stronghold gameS (plural),"" but that is not what this is.

A ""definitive"" edition should have the games defining feature, which was skirmish mode for most people who played it. Being able to play multiplayer with fun AI enemies and allies included was what defined Stronghold games for me, and that being absent from this game really kills it, to be honest. I had very high hopes, and they were not met. The updates that are there are fairly negligible. It's essentially just an improved graphics version of the original Stronghold. I'd rather the original graphics with updated features and AI over this.

Improved graphics, music, animations, mechanics, etc.
New campaigns (with more coming soon), focusing on both economic and military aspects. Split in multiple categories you can play the economic ones or the military ones.
There are also separate missions (both economic and military).
There are sieges and invasions, where you can assault and/or defend historical emplacements (castles from all over Europe).

-- YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER TO ATTACK OR DEFEND IN EACH ONE.
--- MOD SUPPORT. For example, invade Helm's Deep from The Lord of The Rings.
The Sandbox/Freeplay is still here, and made better through additional parameters you can configure before playing AND DURING YOUR PLAY (PRESS F1 FOR THE MENU).

Your name is spoken on launch once set (and can be changed later-on. For example I am welcomed with 'Good Morning, Lord Daniel'. Depending on time of day it changes which is amazing.
-- They also have that for voicelines during missions and actions such as 'Surrender, Lord Daniel?' when I wish to surrender in a match.
DOWNSIDE: There is no skirmish in Multiplayer (yet), so you can only do PVP, not PVE.
UPSIDE: Singleplayer there is Freeplay, siege, siege that, invasion and custom maps.

Multiplayer works flawlessly now, you don't require Hamachi anymore because it is steam steam multiplayer now.
Built-in Map editor, with upgraded functionalities etc.
Built-in Steam Workshop support.
New unit: Monk. Imagine macemen but Religious.

I've tried to play some of the re-releases over the years but could never get them to run properly. So I was excited to try this out.

UI is super important to me in games, especially anything to do with strategy or building. And this is... not good. I have to click on my granary to see how quickly my food will run out. Placing gates within walls is painful - you can't rotate buildings, instead you have to choose one of 4 possible orientations in the building menu. And aligning them to my walls was a process of trial and error. 

There's no way I could find to speed the game up, so the early parts of missions run super slow while you build up your stockpiles. There's no control groups for units. The final straw for me was when my woodcutter walked halfway across the map to chop down trees, instead of walking to the forest right next to his hut, and got ripped apart by wolves.

If you played this back in the day then you'll probably love it. It's a handsome remaster in many ways, and you'll probably feel right at home if you're already used to it's quirks.

My favorite addition is that you can now build troops in batches by holding down shift (5 units), or Ctr (as many as available).

Also holding Ctr while building siege weapons allows you to build multiple tents instead of having to go back into the menu each time.

Also the ability to add troops to pre-existing ""squads"" (the 1-10 groupings). Really awesome for big attacks with multiple unit types.

Also holding Ctr while clicking a building will allow you to immediately start building the same building without having to go into the menu

Also auto-trading with the market is a nice late-game addition when the resources are rolling in and it becomes a hassle to buy/sell things when trying to manage a siege.",1699929228,1699929228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This isn't the game I love, that's for sure. First off, where the hell are the Arabic armies? There units and lords simply just don't exist as far as I've gotten. The campaign missions are god awful. You are either stockpiling resources while they are sending units to kill you, or trying to survive waves of enemy attacks. There are very few missions where it is you versus an actual enemy to kill, and when you do your just commanding a siege, not constructing a base to create an army. Adding to that, you almost never get to construct your own castle. There is always a significant prefab, if not entirely.

Finally, why the hell is there no free versus battle where you can select computers, their difficulties, starting positions, etc? Everything is some shitty mission or you have to design your own.

There are also some other more minor gameplay ""annoyances"", such as when you're moving units up to elevated surfaces, if you're playing in the flattened view the green location markers are always floating above since it can't seem to properly account for the 3D to 2D locations.

I played the original many moons ago in the early noughties on a PC that could barely run it. I got farther than I have on my current run. But it already seems more user friendly with QoL improvements. It also stands the test of time, as one of the better castle building RTS games.
I'm playing on easy to make good progress, but I already got defeated once due to not knowing where I couldn't build based on where I placed my keep at the start of a map, doh!
Still learning how all the buildings are linked, and it's part of the fun. Although most of it is fairly logical. It's all about managing your resources.
The developers seem invested in the game with affordable DLC and FLC on the way.

Been playing Stronghold since I was like 8 years old. I'm 32 now. This was the game that started my love for RTS games. Plus, the original, or rather, Stronghold HD held up really well. And personally, I have never been a big stickler for graphics so I wasn't sure if a ""definitive edition"" of this classic game was necessary. But man this is DEFINITELY worth it!

For starters, the graphics and animations are all updated and they look great. So thats all well and good, but what really got me excited was all the new content and modern quality of life features! 

A whole new campaign (I forgot the name of) A kingmaker trail! Which was a mode that was introduced with Stronghold Crusader. I haven't tried it yet, nor the new campaign but I am very excited for their inclusion. 

Another update for this version is Steam Workshop support! The workshop support has done a lot for Stronghold Warlords and I can't wait to see some of the content that people come up with for it.

On top of what was there before, we get all this new content plus a road map with a lot of exciting stuff planned! And these guys have had a good track record of sticking to their plans (At least they did with Warlords when it comes to the roadmap). 

All in all I would highly recommend! Especially for the price, its a solid RTS and a legendary classic, only made better by new controls (WASD camera control/ Q&E rotating screen) that you can choose between ""Classic"" and ""Modern"" controls, which was very nice to see. 

Only issues I have found so far are audio issues. When you get a ""Message from your scribe"" and the message proceeds to play at the same time. Which is a minor issue that will probably be patched soon.

I would be lying if I said I wasn't sad to not see a skirmish mode V AI. The original didn't have it until Crusader, but there is a lot of new content that wasn't in the original game already so I am very excited about that. Even though they don't mention skirmish v AI in the road map, I am still hopeful, and again, excited for what is coming in the road map.

TL:DR If you are a longtime Stronghold fan and love the original game GET THIS ONE! It has everything you use to love with even more content and planned DLC for the Pig and Wolf with the original Voice Actors! Very exciting stuff. If you are new to Stronghold this is a great place to start with the updated graphics and modern controls and QOL features!

And it does have efforts, and it's interesting. Good Job Firefly studios, a long-awaited improvement for good old Stronghold game. 

Like the new graphics, it really goes smoother than before, also new controls are good, cause the basic strategies uses left click to move. Also power to change color that's the most thing I actually wanted from the first Stronghold, since I was a kid, I've played a lot Stronghold and Crusader, and one thing was always bothering me and that was why I can't change color.

Other things are just great, new possibilities like to play actual MP on Steam platform and not the stupid GameRanger, GameRanger never worked for me, all the lagging, and port-forwarding sh*t that's stupid. Steam workshop great idea, no more to download from Stronghold Heaven other peoples mission they created, this is much faster. 

For those who's first playing now need to understand this was campaign based Stronghold game. In the first one also there weren't AI's and no Skirmish mode.

It seems like Millennials who never really played Stonghold were in charge of this.
The news songs are not as good as the old songs.
The broken missions 15 and 18 have not been fixed.
And worse... The new ""campaigns"" are very poorly done.
They could have easily added the best parts of Crusader. Id est, having new campaigns where you can freely build your castle while the enemy builds his and then you conquer the enemy. But they didn't.
They took the worst part... you besieging the enemies castle with limited troops... and made more of that.
They added several more missions where you never even get to build a castle, you just walk around the map with limited troops. They do not understand what Stonghold is supposed to be... a castle building game.
The ""Castle Trail"" is a joke... you get to have a castle... but you are not allowed to build or raise troops to defend it.
Unbelievable.
And then there is the Wokeness... changing The Rat from an ""Illegitimate child""... to an ""only child"".
Oh yes, and they even forgot to cook the meat. Seriously.
So yeah, I love Stronghold.  I still have the original disks from 22 years ago.
But ""sentiment is warm towards"" this ""definitive"" version.
Time for some actual Stronghold fans who understand what the game is really about to make a ""definitive definitive"" version.

Words can't explain how hyped I was for the release. Two demos and a full version later, I quickly realized and accepted that things are not so colorful with this remaster.

It's not another ""no skirmish"" complaint. It may be an unpopular opinion but skirmish mode was always overrated for me. Original Stronghold is a mix between a Castle Sim and an RTS, not just the latter - it's not built for rapid action, and people that complain about the lack of this mode knew perfectly well what they were buying. The problem lays in a lot of different aspects.

For starters - let me talk about the promised DE's features:

[b]Remastered Visuals using original artwork:[/b] I'm happy with that, somewhat. Firefly delivered a solid visual update, but not without it's flaws. The graphics instantly lose all their charm after zooming out, when they become very grainy, or sometimes even when casually moving around (Anti-aliasing issue?). It's a shame, cause the visuals otherwise are really nice, but as someone who uses the zoom-out feature a lot, it quickly becomes annoying and even nauseating.
[b]Remastered Music:[/b] I have not noticed a single piece of music that was touched in any way. Maybe it's for the better, cause the original soundtrack is pretty iconic and just good, but why advertise that then?
[b]Returning Voice Actors:[/b] Two of them, to be exact, which is alright, but it's worth mentioning that Firefly didn't reach out to fulfill that promise in other countries. Only english dub has that feature, so whoever from a non-english speaking country hoped to hear their version's old VAs will likely be left disappointed.
[b]Upgraded Characters:[/b] Feels like the biggest lie from all the promises, even counting the music one. It feels like the only real character that got an upgraded look was Sir Longarm, and even about that I'm not so sure. It's just plain AI upscaling for all the little videos you see on the radar or story mode, which sometimes does it job in some way, but in majority of cases is just absolutely hideous (For example, the blacksmith looks like he's been working a while in a highly-radioactive environment). Firefly did explain that quite a bit of old resources got lost or are not compatible with modern tools, but why then would you boast about artificially upscaling characters and calling it a day like it's actually any impressive or good? Other seemingly lost assets such as defeat/victory screens were really well remade, why wouldn't that be, especially since the latter was promised not the former?

And here I reach the last but not least of the promises: Bugfixes. Sadly, with some bugs in the game indeed having been fixed, much more new ones arose. 
[spoiler][strike]I've edited out the First bug as it was recently patched as far as I see![/strike][/spoiler]
Second one, equally infuriating - Troops AI and pathfinding is completely messed up. Very often your own troops pick very weird zig-zag-like patterns to reach a place, like a tower or something. It takes time + if youre the one sieging, you can't plan movement too well and risk getting your troops decimated.
On the defending side, large melee attacks aren't a problem to defend anymore, as they focus on your own melee troops instead of actually attacking and getting into your castle in the first place. As such, you can just micro-manage the enemy with your outside melee troops while your range units wipe them out.
The third one, the one that made me literally quit a map made by firefly themselves - units get stuck on enemy's spike traps. A problem that already was in the original (and I doubt it's a feature) that happened sporadically now happens almost every time.

Additional bugs I found throughout more gameplay that I find pretty annoying:
-Sometimes the game selects units you yourself did not. I don't know how that happens, but you can just casually micro-manage with your macemen, and then suddenly the game selects nearby archers for you. 
-Sometimes, the units you haven't selected are taking the same orders you give to the one you actually do have in selection.
-Woodcutters pick the nearest tree to their hut, but ignore whether that tree is quickly accessible or not. That means that if there's two trees, one a bit further from the woodcutter's hut but at his level so it's the quickest to get, but the second is the nearest from the hut despite being on a hill that requires a long walk to get into, the woodcutter picks the latter.
-When you stumble upon ""armory is full"" message when buying weapons, then no matter if you build more armories, you can't buy this specific weapon anymore until armory's capacity will be lower than 50.

Those are probably just the tip of the Iceberg, but they're absolutely sure to mess up old scenarios/campaigns that were working perfectly in the original, and even will be a problem in new maps.

I've mentioned a zoom feature previously - You can now not only zoom out to see more of the map, but also zoom in to see the details of new graphics and focus on some things better - At first I thought ""that is actually neat!"" and then I realized another infuriating problem... Every map starts being fully zoomed in. Every. Single. Time, with no option in the menu to set up the normal view as default. If you're like me, and actually like seeing things in a new map you just started playing, you will be bound to ultimately use the zoom two times, because it almost always zooms out to the maximum while pressing it for the first time. Another nauseating feature.

But... It's not like this remaster is deprived of any good features, there is actually quite a plentiful of them!
Customizable Free Build games are super nice, you can now set up random events and invasions to surprise you without the need of ruining your immersion by having to manually do so with constant F1 clicking, that's pretty neat!
The UI, textures (when they work correctly), redone screens such as the victory/defeat ones are all really well made!
Additionally, there is a ton of new Editor features that can absolutely boost creativity and help with making a lot of new unique maps - something I was hoping for a real lot, and was not disappointed. Additionally you can share the maps into workshop, which is nice. Would love to have a feature one day that would let the player create their own campaign, with story screens, briefings and such, and let that be shared in workshop too.

So, it's not like Firefly didn't put any love into this remaster, because they did, and I feel there's a lot of it. As they themselves said plentiful of times - nowadays, they're a small team, and on top of that, it releases in meantime of making a completely new Stronghold entry. Stronghold DE was their side project, and it shows, it painfully, painfully shows.
Hence why, I feel Firefly had released this game way too quickly. When you're making something as a small team, and break that small team down even further in order to make a side project, you HAVE to give that project some time in the oven. Some more time to listen to fans, listen more carefully, and to most importantly develop a game that will not be a rushed cluster of fixed old bugs vs new bugs.

I really hope for Crusader remaster too, but If it'll happen, I would want Firefly to approach it more seriously and carefully. Perhaps Stronghold DE throughout patches and DLCs will really become ""Definitive"", for now it's not. And while a lot of the added features are nice and fun, I can't recommend it in current state for anyone but diehard fans that can bear through all the current pains of it.",1699555739,1699829081,False,6,0,0.550005733966827393,0,True,False,False

In the game, you can experience combat with iron defense, siege, and typical plain battles.

I personally love to build great empires with massive production and solid defense. (I'm sure super large empire building is beyond the game's original design though.)

In some ways you can play like a combination of Protoss (tech), Terran (human and city defense) and Zerg (large army).",1699799556,1699799556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The old Stronghold was already one of the favourite games of my childhood and this DE version honors it incredibly well. I have yet to find any significant issue or difference from the old version; the only thing right now that feels a bit unfamiliar are the new animations (woodcutter, bakers, etc.), but I must say that they are very well done and look awesome, so this is just me being nostalgic. I appreciate having the option to switch between the old spire and the new one, new controls while keeping the option to go back to the old ones, beautiful graphics, very stable gameplay, original audio... The only thing that I wasn't sure about is the omission of the Wolf and the Pig campaigns, which are coming in January. I am honestly not sure whether those were present in the original game back then or if they were also added later, but I have to say this - I was shocked at how low the price is and I would be more than happy to pay 20 EUR for this game, so getting the two DLCs for 6 EUR with many other planned upgrades on the way... This is a no-brainer for me and so it should be for you if you liked the original Stronghold. Stronghold DE is the highlight of 2023 for me, as far as gaming goes. Now, I really hope they will give the same care and love to Stronghold: Crusader and I also hope that they don't take too long; but thankfully, I know exactly how to make that time go by very fast.

VSync doesn't work (80 FPS with vsync on on 3060 Ti is a joke, without it it's easily 200+ FPS)
There is NOTHING expanded from the base game in terms of units/buildings. 
The campaign was not reworked at all, and after so much time you tend to notice how some aspects of the campaign actually were just BAD. For example, each defence mission is basically the same thing - build a castle, survive ~15 min. Not to mention that the castle you take control of is always shitty and incapable of surviving on it's own. You have just captured a long standing fortress of your enemy, but you find out it has wheat farms but no mills and bakery? Go on figure it out yourself, each mission is basically 10 minutes of fixing economy and 5 minutes of spamming crossbowmen to survive which get's repetitive VERY quickly and will only appeal to die-hard fans of the series. 
Not to mention that the most important part, which is skirmish, was not added.

One major gripe i have with it though (next to the lack of refining the cutscenes that are still butt ugly), is the lack of cooperative possibilities.

I dont mind the lack of Skirmish, but the lack of cooperative playing options is a problem that could be and should be fixed.
Add settings like random Events and random attacks to multiplayer.
Basically what Free Build Mode is in this game, just with other players (at least 2 players would be good).
Same goes for Siege Mode.
Being able to select a map, invite a friend and then set the game to ""Siege Mode"" with a Peace Timer, would allow us to build a castle together, then defend it against Siege Waves.

If fancy, add highscores to that and a setting to select how many waves will attack.

I think this game (version) is a good idea and basically what i hoped they would do.
Stronghold Classic and Stronghold Crusader were their best games and they should focus on modernizing and expanding them far more.

The second problem are the clear expectations that were not met. From the moment that this project was announced people were very vocal about the skirmish/bots in multiplayer feature. The developers were clear about not intending to add that but then what is the point of spending any time on the remaster if the improvements are just going to be cosmetic and clearly ignore the demand. IMO the price point does not justify the feature set and whenever I want to feel the nostalgia I can get it from the original game. As for playing with friends we mainly do it in Crusader and better bots from UCP so this edition does not tick any of those boxes.

I bought this game just because I want to encourage Firefly to properly remaster Stronghold Crusader and I know that it won't happen if this project is not at least moderately well received. However, after seeing how little attention and resources were put into this project (judging by the state of the game at release) I feel like there is no hope. Perhaps the studio is no longer capable of releasing something decent that will also address the key issues and needs of the player base.",1699665099,1699665099,False,2,0,0.541284441947937012,0,True,False,False

As many of the negative reviews point out however their was little modernization done and the game lacks some features one might consider vital for an RTS, such as skirmish mode.
In my book, that makes this a better purchase than the original or SH3 while leaving it solidly behind Crusader 1, Legends, and arguably SH2. If you know what you are getting into, it is what it says on the box. If you don't, but think you would like it, get Stronghold Crusader HD instead for a fuller gameplay experience.

(and no, i am not talking about skirmish being missing.) Where is the camera grip, the replay feature, the multiplayer balance?
Do not get me wrong, i like the core gameplay of Stronghold, even with its lacking RTS features. It's a nice castle sim with some RTS elements, the king of the hill is fun to play (largely thanks to the backstabbing opportunities it creates) and all.

I don't like how the glorifyingly advertised features are broken at launch, (looking at you, multiplayer) even though i expect it to be fixed in coming updates.
[b] I don't like how firefly spends INSANE amount of effort on marketing and creating hype on a series with an ESTABLISHED AND DEDICATED FANBASE, and talk about being low on resources for actual development efforts. [/b]
I don't like how they are about to put a price tag on content that can never hold a candle to the existing, free, and superior content already available online (looking at you, upcoming DLC campaigns). If you are going to put a price tag on anything, do Robert some justice and put the remastered soundtrack as DLC(assuming there is one, maybe my ears are defying me and not allowing me to notice the difference)
I don't like how established QOL gets destroyed in a new version of the game(button Z cannot be used for both zooming in and out anymore!, you cannot click on the message video skip it and restore the minimap anymore!, V button is gone, although thats a rather minor one)
I don't like how some of the newly implemented QOL is lacking in common sense (who the hell would want to point and click on a flag button for unit rally point and not use the inarguably better method of number hotkeys, which was the implementation for the followup title to the original stronghold)
UI being stuck on corner is annoying, it's like windows 11 forcing the centered taskbar items (which they later realised should have the option to put it back to corner again)

The visual upgrade overall nice, but even that has some drawbacks, be it in terms of reduced texture moddability, or reduced discernability of certain elements.
The added hotkey mapping, and ""click to select"" mode on building hotkeys (which became the default behavior on future titles) is good.
But the ACTUAL good thing that came out of the remaster is the newly added map editor features, because that will allow mapmakers to make more interesting maps. Basically more tools to play with = good. Nice job on that one, the sole programmer of SH:DE!

However, the custom map invasion mode is an absolute catastrophe. At least with my own custom map, although I don't know why it would be uniquely special other than maybe the largest map is uniquely problematic or having larger armies, although even if that were the case, why have a large map and why have a unit counter to show you the upper limit of units if it still fails when I'm way below it.

In any case, first of all the enemy army very rarely spawns, so it's literally unplayable 9 out of 10 times if I'm defending. When they do spawn in those rare occasions, the AI has no ability to judge the situation. It immediately sends all of its engineers, by themselves, to the castle walls to die.

Cons:
- Kirche und Kathedrale geben keinen Bonus mehr, warum sollte man diese dann bauen?
- Burggraben entfernen Feature ist ein Point-and-Click. So braucht es ewig Fehler auszubügeln.
- Wo ist die Auswahlmöglichkeit für Waffenproduktionen vor dem Bauen? Muss ich wirklich wieder jedes einzelne Gebäude anklicken?
- Strg-Feature nur teilweise korrekt implementiert. Waffenproduktionen werden auf Standardartikel zurückgesetzt.
- Immer gezoomter Start beim Start einer Karte
- kein geeigneter Multiplayer. Ich würde gerne mit Freunden gegen Bots spielen. Das geht nicht.
- kein Skirmish Mode (War ausdrücklich auch nicht angekündigt, aber hätte hier echt gepasst und jeder wünschte es sich)

Pros:
+ 4K Grafik (hilft halt nur mit 4K Bildschirm, sonst reicht die HD-Version)
+ Auto-Trade 
+ Freies Bauen verbessert mit möglichen Invasionen, frei gestaltbar.

Skirmish, Co-op modes, something of the nature at least. People, myself included love teaming up against bots in RTS games. (Yeah you've seen this a million times and Firefly has explained why it's not here, but it's still a missed opportunity) There is always Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition at least in the future if this is received well enough. It already has AI bots and more in the code unlike the original Stronghold. My hopes are they learn from this one to give us a better SC:DE if/when it comes.

I wish they would expand more on map and scenario creation functionality. Take a look at Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and the absurd amount of custom maps and campaigns made by the community. Their accessible map tool with so many triggers, effects, conditions, etc... has given SO MUCH single player content for anyone to enjoy after they've already finished the base game or wanting something different. Firefly needs to take a page out of their book because more community tools is so good for games like this extending their life. If not this game Firefly, consider this in future games. You guys like money right?

Lastly as of now, there are still bugs and issues. (Especially multiplayer) but they have seemed very prompt to acknowledge and fix things in a timely manner. They have been communicative and upfront about their development, which is more than can be said for many other developers these days.

All in all if you enjoyed the original Stronghold and would like the new graphics, quality of life, new campaigns, future updates along with cheap DLC, and accessible multiplayer without going through gameranger or whatever else.

I understand why it exists (the developer needs money and had to crank out something cheap and relatively low-effort) but at the same time I really don't. There's already an HD re-release of the original Stronghold, and Definitive Edition really doesn't add much that the HD re-release didn't already have. 

The biggest question I have is why the developers didn't improve the camera at all. I understand that they wanted to keep it as close to the original as possible, but.. the HD port already exists. It's not like you need to go through some complicated DOSBOX setup or extensive patching to get it to work. The problem with the camera is that the entire game is isometric, and you can only view the game world from four camera angles. On top of that, the game doesn't allow you to move the camera even partially off the game's map, which means that each camera angle cuts off a corner of the map. Hope nothing important's going on there.

Along with the camera problems comes the fact that the game's main mechanic is kinda broken. Most of the campaign maps rely on the idea that you have a small force against a larger invading force and use walls and fortifications to make up for the difference. The problem is that building walls isn't great - walls can be built in eight directions (including diagonals) but all wall improvements (towers, gates) can only be built in four directions. This wouldn't be a problem if the game had, say, a hotkey that would make it so that walls snap to straight lines - only as far as I can tell, unless it's not listed in the game's key bindings, no such hotkey exists.

The game also makes it hard to tell whether a wall will be effective or not. On one map, I built what I thought was a complete wall only to find out that the wall had a hole in it that the camera would not allow me to see no matter what angle I set it to. It's also hard to tell if an enemy can traverse a given piece of terrain.

All of this pales in comparison to the game's unit AI being a buggy mess. Units in this game will try to hit enemies even if they have no chance at doing so, sometimes to absolutely laughable effect, things like the enemy AI's catapults aiming into cliffs because they can see your walls on the other side. Unfortunately, this is a two-way street in that your units will also try to hit anything they can see, even if they can't actually see or hit it. 

I'd say avoid this until the bugs get patched out. Buy the HD re-release (Stronghold HD) instead at a fraction of the price, or better yet buy Stronghold Crusader HD which people still play online.",1699586557,1699586557,False,4,0,0.502304017543792725,0,True,False,False

Stronghold has since I was a child been one of my favorite games. I've never really been to interested in RTS games but this game has always had a place in my heart. I've been playing this remake now for quite awhile now and I can happily say It's a really good remake! There are some small things here and there that could be improved upon and I hope the devs keep on updating this game as it's a really good game that really deserves their attention. 

Some of the flaws that I've noticed is the following: 
- Zooming is a fixed zoom and not ""free zoom"" if that makes sense. I would love for it to be so that you can zoom as much as you want or as little. The default zoom is either too much or too little, would be great with a middle ground or ""free zoom"". 
- Dialog can at times be hard to hear. I know you can adjust the music / dialog volume but it feels a bit off at times. 
- Enemy troops can enter the castle in walls that doesn't make sense for them to be able to enter. There is a gap that you cannot see and this is usually is around hills and rocks. I've lost a few battles because they've been able to enter when I thought it was closed. 
- When you are fully zoomed out there is very much aliasing, maybe some AA would be beneficial to add? I've noticed that this also applies for stone walls. 

Other than what I've written above I'm really happy with this release. It's not only good but actually really cheap compared to other remasters I've seen. It's basically the same thing you get with the HQ editions but you also get improvement on features and updated graphics plus more campaing and an updated multiplayer!

The biggest thing i dislike is lack of attention to MP, its quality is poor and not all features from later games are added, which is a shame since its still much better than Gameranger. Ashame since MP in this game is probably my favorite.
Thankfully SP is great, visual boost is fantastic [although units still look kinda floaty] and its much better than what we had in the demo. Alongside that, we actually have fixes to some long standing bugs like Doulbe workers, tho some are strangely still here. Despite this the game launched in a mostly good state, however many of us are experiencing issues with Certain visual elements, but i am sure Firefly will fix this as the first patch already adressed some. QOL changes like changing colours, OLD SCRIBE, and auto trade are super nice as well and i do not see myself coming back to the old days.
Campaign was not touched however the new set of missions are nice, they are not as tough as Firefly made them out to be bar a few exceptions, however we are put in many more interesting situations like crossing a canyon while dealing with Wild animals, and even having missions with no market or such, its interesting as at least in Vanilla we did not have these types of missions that much or to this level.
However the ending to this new story ends on a cliffhanger, clearly going to be continued in the DLC and this angers me so much, since Firefly made it seem like we got a complete story, i hope that this is not repeated for the next game on Unreal.
Ignoring that, and poor state MP launched, i think still this is a good REMASTER, in capitals since ultimately this does not do major things like rebalance the game, Religion is still worthless, and there is no Opponent AI for MP, i am fine with this but many people have expected some form of AI. Even so i think Firefly has done well to upgrade the originally visual, stability wise and gameplay wise, for 15 Dollars or Euros its not a bad purchase, but ill hold on until like a week or so till some visual stuff is sorted out.

Game is terrible, it is like a fan edited files of original Stronghold and made this version. There is nothing new, it is sad to see hardcore fans to defend this game even it is totally bad.

I do not even see difference between original and this one. Campaigns can be made by a fan or a kid. Search them up on Google lol.

Good game.

I would like to add. They didn't add a Skirmish mode which is a negative. however they have a ""Freebuild"" mode which the name is deceiving. its not really a creative mode but more a combination of a few modes.

The DE version however still needs work, a lot of basic features don't work anymore. I cannot use laddermen to mount on walls with crenelations.
The ultrawide support is nice, but when you can either fully zoom in or fully zoom out, in both cases it makes it kind of hard to play, there should be a 50% zoom option. The music volume decreases when units talk which is very distracting, it's like i'm in a skype call or something. The double clicking of units with the ""modern rts controls"" also doesn't work properly for me, most of the time it doesn't actually select more units.

Quite frankly I don't understand why they only put one developer on the project. This game is really special and it needs to be given better treatment to be able to speak to a new audience.

These are all complaints of things they actually said they would fix or issues that are new, I would have also loved to see bots in MP, for that I hope they will also make a crusader rerelease. It would also have been nice to get some redone soundtracks like they did with Age of empires DE.

I recently embarked on a medieval journey that left me craving more chivalry, strategy, and just a touch of insanity. Yes, my fellow gamers, I'm talking about the Stronghold Definitive Edition. If you've ever wondered whether a castle siege simulator could be worth its weight in gold, let me tell you, it's time to grab your catapult and aim for the drawbridge! 🏹🏰

From the moment you load up Stronghold Definitive Edition, you're greeted by a jester-like advisor who appears to have had one too many goblets of mead. This character alone is worth the price of admission. His quirky humor and penchant for making questionable strategic decisions will have you giggling through the entire campaign. Who needs a sensible advisor when you can have a manic jester leading the charge? 🤪🃏

The game's graphics might not be cutting-edge, but they carry an undeniable medieval charm. You'll witness armies of tiny, pixelated peasants scurrying about, diligently working to build your dream castle. And by ""dream castle,"" I mean a ramshackle collection of wooden huts, surrounded by a perilous moat filled with more crocodiles than the Florida Everglades. Trust me; it's your very own ""Deathtrap Manor""! 🏡🐊

The soundtrack, if you can call it that, is a collection of merry minstrels playing catchy tunes on their lutes. It might drive you to madness in the best way possible as you try to fend off waves of marauding foes. Battle drums, siege engines, and the screams of your besieged citizens will keep you on your toes, or at least, on the edge of your rickety battlements. 🎶🥁

Speaking of battles, the AI in Stronghold Definitive Edition is something to behold. It's as if the opposing lords have undergone rigorous training at the School of Inexplicable Siege Tactics. They'll attack your heavily fortified walls with a handful of archers, then offer to surrender while your castle is still standing strong. It's an AI rebellion of epic proportions! 🤖🏹

Stronghold Definitive Edition boasts a multiplayer mode that will have you and your friends competing to see who can turn their castle into the most spectacular disaster zone. It's the ultimate test of your strategic prowess and your ability to withstand the relentless banter of your fellow players. 👫🎮

In conclusion, Stronghold Definitive Edition is the ultimate medieval madness package. From the deranged advisor to the perplexing AI, and the musical stylings of our minstrels, it's a game that's worth every gold coin in your digital purse. So, go forth, noble gamer, and conquer this castle simulator. Your jester awaits with open arms and a catapult loaded with laughter! 🃏🏰😂💰",1699461351,1699461351,True,1,0,0.486725658178329468,0,True,False,False

A big big big disappointment is the missing skirmish mode as in SH Crusader. After all these years, is it really that hard to transport this concept to SH: definitive Edition?

As an advice for a future SH Crusader definitive Edition: Add the wooden Defensive structures which were added in the Stronghold Europe community mod.

I was so happy when FireFly studio announced this game on their youtube channel. I bought the game 2 hours ago and played it this whole time. The game is amazing, it made me feel like a little kid again. I played it for the first time when i was 6 years old in 2002. This brought so many happy memories. 
TO ALL THOSE CRYBABIES WHO ARE ANGRY THAT SKIRMISH ISN'T IN THIS GAME I HAVE TO SAY ONE THING! IT NEVER WAS IN THIS GAME!!!!!
Stronghold 1/HD NEVER had a skirmish. And of course they DIDNT add it now, because if it had Skirmish, why remaking Crusader later? Skirmish was introduced with Stronghold Crusader, and i am truly hopping that that game will be remade soon with maybe few more factions, like Byzantine Emperor, Armenian King, King of Jerusalem, Prince of Antioch... Just suggestions.  
The only two things that i ""dislike"" about the game but can be fixed in the future updates are: 
-cut scenes bug, when characters are talking the video freezes after few sentences, but their voices continue to talk. It doesn't make any problems to gameplay, and i am sure that developers will fix them. They should have remade those scenes in the first place and not just upscale them. Maybe upscaling them is what made a problem. But again, it doesnt affect gameplay at all.
-bugs that helped in gameplay are fixed now, which sucks hahahah. It's good for the game overall that this is fixed, but it was fun to do these little ""hacks"". 
But these ""dislikes"" are either easily fixable or just my personal opinion, they don't affect gameplay in any way. Game is still great, 9/10. Crusader if they make him like this will be 10/10. THANK YOU FIREFLY STUDIOS <3",1699450515,1699450515,True,5,0,0.555661141872406006,0,True,False,False

2. Multiplayer doesn't work

3. When I select soldiers and they say something, the background noises get silenced but sometimes there's a bug when the soldier's voice us is also silenced, I think this is unnecessary because it breaks the experience and is not implemented well.

4. The graphics. While they look pretty good there are problems. For example buildings are too contrasting, this breaks the experience because it's too cluttered. When the people and the buildings are at the same level of visibility I have a hard time managing everything. In previous version the buildings were much softer and were blending with the environment very well. Also it feels that the graphics were enhanced by randomly using AI.

5. UI, scrolling, controls just aren't snappy enough.

Those are the main issues that I found within first 2 hours of gameplay. The game isn't that bad but it definitely feels like just another half-assed Firefly project.

If you've followed FireFly up until the release of Stronghold DE, then you'd know that they had delivered on pretty much everything they've promised, and for a very reasonable price too.

I'm pretty sure that everything from the original title is here, with an extra bit of polish. Visually everything looks fantastic, all the UI and control improvements are very welcome and well executed. All the old and iconic soundbites are here, completely re-recorded too if I understood correctly, if so - the delivery of the voice lines is as good as it's ever been.

Some may be disappointed by the lack of a skirmish mode (I know I was when they announced that there wouldn't be one), but the original didn't have it either and apparently it would have required a lot of extra coding time that they'd rather put into the base game and the additional campaign. So not a huge loss.

I've encountered no bugs during my first session of play.

All in all, an actually good ""Definitive Edition"" title, that truly delivers on what it promised to do: polish and visual updates.

The game looks as it does in -my memories- and not the jagged pixillated reality that loading OG Stronghold would do.
The modern control scheme for someone who hasn't played a while is nice as well, and if you've played any sort of sim or rts, you'll probably find it easy to pick up and play with minimal translation error. 

Also, you can play Fullscreen, borderless windowed -and- windowed without hassle. A problem which plagued HD, meaning you can now have a second window open, which in a world where most PCs have a dual screen setup is much appreciated, also the 3k unit limit is awesome.

At this price point with these quality of life changes, I would already consider Stronghold DE well worth the money, but now with proper Workshop support, a functional multiplayer and entirely new campaigns. Not only do you get the joy that is the original Stronghold, you get fresh content to go with it as well.

After playing for 9 hours, I had no major issues, no crashes, not CTDs, it ran smoothly and I was just castle building like I did when I was a wee pup.

Also i found it hard to navigate with the zoom levels being still unintuitive to use: (e.g. i can't put it to a resolution where i can zoom fast and see the map without having the issue of noisy textures and hard to see units).
There are many little bugs, like e.g. the moonwalking troops, that break the immersion.
It is not only visually unpleasant to view, but also the hitboxes of the units and buildings aren't aligning with the visual art.
On that note: Many of those things were already present in the demos, and have been voiced by the community,

I've also taken a look at the campaigns, and from the things that i've seen, i find them lackluster in their storytelling as well as their mission and gameplay design. Especially compared to the community content collected on Heavengames over the years (its not even close,...).

I like the bugfixes as well as the steam MP implementation, but i think they don't justify buying the game for its price (sometimes MP doesn't even work properly).
I would expect some more QoL stuff from a DE like hotkeys from Crusader. Or at least feature parity with the original, like the v mode. I think this is not the standard that was set by the original games back then, with lots more attention to detail.

I am sad to say, that i ll return the game after playing for just 50 minutes :frowning:

I had good hopes.... now i am disappointed.
**I beg you FireFly**, if you ever want to work on the Crusader Definitive Edition you need to change your stance on how you work with the community.

Saying that I CANNOT recommend Stronghold Definitive Edition and that is really upsetting.

From the start the opening movie is now wide screen but stretched. In fact nearly all the movies and character portraits are stretched to the point they are badly disfigured and pixelated.

There is no skirmish/bot mode. The new ""castle trail"" campaign which looks like the campaigns in crusader, is more invasion/siege maps with a map style menu. In my opinion, the new main menu has lost a lot of the charm the original one had.

The newer visuals are nice, though all the effects from the buildings makes the screen too busy when you have a big city. The models of the soldiers look stiff and plastic, especially against solid backdrops like marsh. The zoom and updated controls are great though.

The weakest point of the original Stronghold was the troop tactics. No formation, grouping, bad pathfinding etc. Which was fine in 2001 but nothing has changed in over 20 years and there is a big push for the multiplayer which will make it struggle against other RTSs.

Old maps are still here which is great (though they are dated 2023 for some reason) but this includes the one titled ""user created map"" which looks odd. 

Maybe when the new campaigns come out this be worth the time, but (to me) it feels like Firefly hopped on the remaster bandwagon and tried to stick something together and the title Stronghold: Definitive Edition is just that, a title, and does not represent a defining quality of the game. I think it should be the ""steam addition"" more than anything. 

Stronghold HD is currently £3.49 on steam, unless you want to support Firefly Studios (which is great!) I would recommend starting there and maybe ""upgrading"" for the multiplayer when you have completed the campaign.

So yes, Stronghold has a great campaign worth revisiting. As a game, it's more like a laser guided missile. Build. Demolish. Build in order to demolish. Plop down some farms. Man your walls. Man your siege engines. Go nuts. It is very focused. Its biggest success is that it has incredible depth, while simultaneously being super easy to control. Also, your units actually go where you order them to go, another craft that apparently got lost to time by RTS developers in the last 20 years. The remaster gives it a very welcome facelift, while adding a new campaign that's kicking my ass, so that's great. It doesn't add skirmish and co-op, but personally I don't mind. That's not what Stronghold is. It's you and your walls against carefully scripted and balanced challenges, at least for me. It's being offered at a reasonable price, and most importantly, it has aged well and is still worth playing today.",1699397298,1699397298,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The economy didn't change at all. If you know the OP..... method of selling food than increase food rations so better sell everything... Really nothing the developers have changed.  I take this as more of a money maker for the developers, which is about 20 years old. i would really recommend everyone to play an older episode instead.

These days, there are literal one-man developers whom make incredible games and Firefly Studios seems to be forever behind the times and lazy. Take a look at the comments section on any of their social media - they completely ignore the criticism's and focus entirely on the fans with the lowest IQ. They pump out these horrific games and 'upgrades' but the reality is that this is hardly any different from the original Stronghold. Why not add being able to put your troops into formations? Why not add a couple of extra buildings into the game? Why not think of something new?! Because it costs time and money, that's why. This game has the same aura as COD games - rinse and repeat the same maps, the same engines, the same everything other than a quick polish. Pathetic.

These guys really do need to start again at foundation level and either hire a new and fresh team with talent (instead of the decrepit and ancient team that has clung on for 20 years - see their YT channel) or move on to making appalling Apps because this game does not currently fit in with the 'gaming' market.",1699386140,1699386140,False,7,1,0.501286566257476807,4,True,False,False

3. Survival co-op mode with incoming enemies that get harder and harder with siege tactic flavors
4. Co-op challenges. (Do this and this game can go viral!)
5. Loyalty mode, run out of money? your men betray you and join others!

I'm going to recommend this game because it should not be review bombed while they improve on it. 
Things they better add:
1. Bots in multiplayer (we need co-op or else this will change to negative review)
2. Nerf the mass shield tactic in multiplayer or add setting for no shields (or make it so shields cannot be very close together, slow, and add a setup shield system where shield engineers die near instantly if not setup)",1699381505,1699381505,True,19,0,0.667109906673431396,3,True,False,False

After playing both demos and looking through the missions of the final release, I am not satisfied with SH:DE. The game requires much more polishing regarding mission design, story telling with regard to the new campaign as well as bug fixing. 
To provide some examples: There are UI elements that are disproportionate, some textures lack details compared to the original release (e.g. wooden walls), the scribe seems to be less vivid when it comes to commenting on events throughout the campaign... and crashes are also a thing! Several bugs that existed for 20+ years now have not been fixed yet. 
But most importantly, I am not sure, if the level design is intended the way it is. Mission 1 plays a bit like mission 13 of the original: Move your crossbowmen, so they can shoot the enemy, wait for enemy units to be killed, repeat... I hope that Firefly is going to improve SH:DE with patches to come. I continue to be faithful, since SH1 is a great game in its core, which is why I recommend to wait with the purchase.",1699381412,1699381412,False,10,0,0.534419357776641846,0,True,False,False

This remaster is like stepping into a time machine. The graphics are sharper and the gameplay smoother, but the heart of Stronghold, the thrill of building your castle and fending off enemies hasn't changed a bit. It’s awesome to see how the game that I’ve kept on my shelf for years, still holds up today, just with a fresh coat of paint.

For anyone who loved the original or is just curious about a classic, this game is a must-try. It's simple: if you want to experience a piece of strategy game history with a modern touch, this game is the way to go.
