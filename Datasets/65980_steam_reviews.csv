The background music gets called out as simply exquisite, I loved it!  Playing through felt like a dynamic/adaptive gameplay experience.  Note:  I lost in my first playthrough on Mercury difficulty (next to lowest difficulty) as I didn't focus enough on victory path early enough nor my affinity & just messed around.  It was genuinely a fun experience, though tough to lose after investing so much time, especially on such a low difficulty.  I also have Starships, playing both & getting unlocks is kind of cool (even if they did it just for $ & marketing).

Update:  played BE:RT, above impressions still apply +:  artifacts, hybrid affinities+units, new diplomacy+leader personality traits, black market to covert ops, & the nuanced updates to the tech tree (like Leash Alien) & information systems.  Floating cities are nice, though not essential to enjoying the RT update.  Generally, I found RT easier than vanilla, especially due to Leash Alien which gives you a peaceful means of dealing with too many aliens, rather than just killing them all.

My only issue is that it currently takes 12-ish hours for me to play a full game.  This pretty much holds in my case for all the Civilization games except Civilization Revolution, so it's not specific to BE.  However, BE is the first one that holds my attention enough to keep coming back, due to the dynamic & fresh gameplay, which is really enjoyable.

Anyhow, my guess is those new to Civ franchise may enjoy BE more than longtime Civ players due to less expectation-bias so that's my advice:  keep an open mind & evaluate the game based on it's own merits.  Cheers!",1693860404,1706806881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The mechanics are dated when compared to Civ VI, but I still get hours of enjoyment out of it every few months. Every game plays out differently and both the alien and faction AI are decent for the game's age. The affinity trees and culture milestones are fun systems which help to augment your play style, but they're admittedly confusing at first. I didn't know how affinity worked very well until I was dozens of hours into the game and finally bothered to read about it.

There are many victory conditions and a lot of quests that add a little bit of flavor to the game, but they aren't as meaty as you'd find in a game like Stellaris.

I enjoy all the Civ games (maybe not Civ 4 as much as the others), but I find that Civ Beyond Earth has a level of complexity and replay-ability that out classes other Civ games. 

Civ Beyond Earth has the best early to mid game combat of all Civ games.  It is easy to unlock all the basic units early and the affinity based upgrade system gives a level of military building that other games just don't have. The late game combat can be a little unbalanced, but still offers the player a lot of tools and unconventional units to create complex strategies.

The tech tree is the best feature in the game.  It does takes a while to navigate, but the freedom it offers makes each game different as long as the player is willing to try out new strategies.  

The civilizations (player characters) are fluid and no two games as the same civilization feel the same.  All the civilizations have some customization options that can change how they play. Most the civilizations are not locked into a specific style of play.

My only complaint about the game is it has some issues running and some loading issues.  Most the time this is fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling.  This is a fairly common issue for a Civ games.  Its not a proper Civ title unless it crashes on you at least once.

The opening part of the game does have some great tension with how vulnerable you feel to aliens before getting fences up and running. The biomes and planets look really cool.

The graphics and visuals are decent, but I strongly dislike the presence of ""plague"" on tiles. It's hard to spot and inflicts a -10% HP penalty per turn on your units, and it seems to be nearly everywhere. Engaging enemy units within these plagued tiles is almost impossible and just plain annoying.

Alien nests, reminiscent of barbarian camps, tend to spawn in the same locations. After playing several games and witnessing a nest spawn on the same tile for the third time, I stationed a unit there, which then generated gold for destroying some of the nests that spawned directly on my unit. I'm uncertain if this is a bug or an intentional feature, but I hope the nests would be generated more randomly.

Win conditions are all somewhat alike, they involve performing certain tasks to construct a super building to win or eliminating all other players.

The game introduces some intriguing mechanics, but it feels more like a technical demo. It seems like they were experimenting to gauge player interest without fully implementing them. For instance:
[list]
[*]Satellites are underused. You can send them into orbit, but they essentially act as stationary units that cannot move. They can only be placed within X hexes of your city and have temporary effects.

[*]The tech tree is a great concept. I appreciate that each tech discovery has other relevant techs branching from it, making it non-linear. In Civ 6 terms, if you discover Iron, you can choose to research Swordsmen, which require iron, or skip it if you lack iron. This non-linearity is a plus, but it can be overwhelming, and it's unclear which path to follow, especially since progression isn't marked by eras, making it challenging for newcomers to determine their research priorities.

[*]Unit upgrades are somewhat lackluster. Given the futuristic setting, you can't advance through different eras, leading to unit upgrades that primarily involve better equipment. This approach can be confusing, as it's challenging to discern which units are better and how to upgrade them effectively.
[*] [i]And several other[/i]
[/list]
This game feels less casual-friendly compared to most of the Sid Meier's Civilization games. It's overly complex and challenging to navigate, particularly with the renaming of certain terms, such as ""golds"" for ""energy,"" which can be confusing. I can't recommend the game, given its relatively high cost in comparison to what it offers.",1697789798,1697789798,False,10,0,0.544100522994995117,0,True,False,False

The negative:

* Not optimized and the game was left somewhat unfinished.
* Aliens are troublesome in the beginning, but become mostly target practice later.
* The AI is profoundly stupid. It's a fairly easy game.
* Factions aren't balanced in the least.
* Diplomacy is very limiting, and useless on higher difficulties.
* Strategy is as confined as Civ 5: In Civ 5, you pretty much want to go tall. In this, you pretty much want to go wide.
* Expeditions will spawn behind ice, which you can't get to. Likewise, expeditions that give an alien unit sometimes grant that unit ice or landlocked.

The positive:

* Linux port.
* No crashes or serious bugs that I've seen.
* One of only a few examples of the civ-like 4x in a sci-fi setting. The only other that I can think of is Pandora: First Contact.
* Quest system that lets the player choose a buff or a building.
* The ability to launch satellites, and the addition of a satellite layer.
* More varied unit options with hybrid affinity units, than in previous Civ. titles.
* Beautiful game.
* Excellent music and sounds that set the mood.
* Unique for water-based civ gameplay and naval warfare.
* Ideal for a ""chill"" sci-fi civ ""sim"" experience. Compare to Pandora where you're gonna war early and always.",1694297090,1695512329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It differs from Civilization more than all other series, providing new game interface besides other features. Everyone who like Civilization will like this game as well despite of multiple issues listed as follows.

Issues:
- Beyond Earth (also as Civilization 6) does not support display scale (a feature of GNOME 3 desktop for hig resolution displays). Moreover, it does not allow to adjust font size inside the game options, affecting the visual appearance on screens with 3K+ resolution.
- Annoying UIX issues:
-- City name is not displayed in the city management menu, making it hard to understand what city is controlled among several nearby cities.
-- Add to Production Queue option is not available in the fast city management menu, which is displayed in the end of the turn, requiring multiple clicks (select the target city, initiate production, and only afterward, add to the production queue). That is the most stupid UIX decision I have ever seen, which wastes players time.
-- Side placement of the city management menus and not allowing users to relocate them, makes it hard to read options and select them on large screens.
-- Fortified/slept soldiers in cities are invisible, hard to find and locate, and there is not fast unit search menu available, which makes it annoying to find a unit or even to check whether any units are fortified in a city. That is another huge and extremely annoying and stupid UIX flaw in this fame.
-- It would be convenient to see brief information about the target cities and sort them by the selected criteria (e.g., production capacity) in the Trade Route selection menu.
-- There are many more less severe UIX flaws in the game. The idea and scenario, and the visual appearance are awesome, but the UIX is awful.",1695391348,1695391348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
65980,18867807,76561198038664185,0,2,9613,0,9032,1496202930,"This game desperately needs some Mobile SAM equivalents. Your units are sitting ducks and there's nothing to counter flying units.
The submarines are also a bit OP as they can attack cities, land units and other ships when they could only even attack other sea based units in the previous Civ game. A good balance would be for them to attack only cities and other ships, not land units.

Beyond Earth is overall a fair follow-up to Civilization's V success. The base game was nothing spectacular and incredibly vanilla. But after Rising Tide and subsequent patches, it's overhalled Diplomacy and added more depth and identity to the game. Communiques show more dialogue and adds more identity to the Civs, movable ocean cities add a new dynamic, artifacts are fun to look for and combine, more art and aesthetic has added identity and lore to the game,and the Spoils of War feature allows for more control over ending wars and negotiation.

With Rising Tide, i rate this game 7/10. The base game I rate 6/10. It's a good game if you basically just want ""Civ 5 in space"" that's not a mod. By the next DLC, if it's done right, this game should have a true mythos, lore and identity of it's own with adequate replay value.

Each affinity is well differentiated aesthetically and in resource focus, beyond the basic strategic resource types. The focus on different yields means they interact with the terrain differently in the late game. The affinity units are also fairly well designed, though I don't use them as often as I should, beside the Harmony ones (the best affinity).

I prefer the aliens to barbarians because of their clear distinction of unit types from (non-Harmony) factions, and the sheer power of some of them, especially at sea. It makes early game exploration more dangerous, and therefore slower and more deliberate, but can be dealt with. Their interaction with miasma and their anger system is an interesting challenge, and adds to the differentiation between affinities in their bonuses and roleplay. Become one with the new world and coat it in miasma, or exterminate the bugs to make way for your human or machine paradise. Aliens are basically improved versions of barbs, except maybe they should also improve in capability over time to deal with the invaders (i.e. flat damage and defense boost, increased manticore range, and more proactive response to repeat aggressors). 

The diplomacy system is the weakest part of this game by far, though that's often true for Civilization. There's no asking to not settle nearby, trading artifacts, joint war without an alliance, nor directly trade resources or yields to gain a quick sum of energy or firaxite, or help fund a cooperating faction's war. On the note of war, it happens way too often. Because of the lack of nuance in how you interact w factions, if they hate you and don't fear you, they'll declare war despite being on the other side of the map. And this is not limited to the player; the AI is almost constantly at war with at least one other, making alliances risky to have unless you're highly militarized or at war yourself anyway.",1692121017,1692121017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Builds don't have charges so you don't need to constantly pump out builders to build stuff.
cool maps.
sweet looking troop upgrades depending on what affinity you go for(I normally go for the hybrid supremacy/harmony troops because I like the purple :P)
unique troops depending on what your research on the tech tree and with the right afinity.
the alien's are cool looking.

Builds take a few turns to build stuff[but again look the the pro to them]
there are only three huge resources in the game.

This is by far my favourite civilisation game.

I see some complaints about the technology web design, describing it as confusing, but I find the progression logical.

Other complaints I read about the game is that the combat is simplified. I can't argue with that, there is precious little variety in attacks, and basically it's whoever has more units.

Wait for it to be on sale, and do NOT purchase the expansion. I tried for a while to like it, but have since deactivated it.

Now, I've led my fair share of missions in hostile territory, but this game takes the concept of exploration and colonization to a whole new level. So strap in, 'cause we're embarking on a journey to the unknown.

In Civilization Beyond Earth, you find yourself in a future where humanity has left Earth behind and set out to colonize new planets. Just like my own encounters with the Predator, you'll be facing the challenges of an alien environment and the constant pursuit of progress. It's a game of strategy, diplomacy, and the quest for dominance in a new world.

Now, let's talk about the gameplay in Civilization Beyond Earth. It's what you'd call a turn-based strategy game with a focus on civilization building and exploration. You'll be leading your own faction, making decisions that shape the future of your people, and expanding your territory through diplomacy, technological advancement, or even warfare. It's a complex web of choices and consequences that will test your leadership skills to the limit.

The visuals in Civilization Beyond Earth are impressive, team. The game presents a futuristic and alien world filled with stunning landscapes and diverse civilizations. You'll witness the growth of your own colonies, the construction of advanced technologies, and the interactions with other factions. It's like watching a new world come to life before your very eyes.

Now, the story in Civilization Beyond Earth is a grand one. As you explore the new planet, you'll encounter various factions with their own unique ideologies and ambitions. You'll face moral dilemmas, engage in diplomatic negotiations, and witness the consequences of your choices. It's a tale of humanity's struggle to adapt and thrive in an alien environment, all while navigating the complex web of politics and survival.

But let me tell ya, team, Civilization Beyond Earth ain't a walk in the park. It's a game that requires careful planning, foresight, and adaptability. You'll face challenges from rival factions, manage resources, and make tough decisions that can have lasting impacts on your civilization. But remember, we're the ones who thrive in adversity. We adapt, we overcome, and we lead our people to victory.

One thing I appreciate about Civilization Beyond Earth is the depth of options and customization. You can choose different affinities for your civilization, each representing a unique approach to the new world. Whether you lean towards harmony with the planet, embrace technological superiority, or seek to dominate through military might, the choice is yours. It's all about forging your own path and shaping the destiny of your people.

Now, just like any challenging mission, Civilization Beyond Earth has its flaws. Some folks have mentioned occasional AI quirks or balancing issues. But the developers have been listenin' to feedback and workin' hard to refine the game, delivering updates and expansions to enhance the overall experience.

So, if you're lookin' for a strategic and immersive journey into the unknown, Civilization Beyond Earth might just be the game for you. It's got depth, complexity, and a captivating story that'll keep you engaged for hours on end. Get ready to explore new frontiers, lead your people to prosperity, and show the galaxy what we're made of. Remember, we're the pioneers, the ones who push the boundaries of what's possible.

7.5/10
 
This NOT game of instellar combat and empire building.  This is a 4x futuristic world-builder, like its immediate predecessor, the history-oriented Civilization V: Gods & Kings.  Are there better Sci-Fi games out there?  Undoubtedly.  But this game is a fine addition to the Civ franchise.  Beyond Earth introduces new mechanics that, sadly, were either not implemented or quite butchered in the next game in the series, Civilization V: Brave New Worlds.

As with any game of the Civ franchise, the heart of the game is its Tech Tree.  And Beyond Earth's tech tree can be a challenge to master, as it branches out in a circular array rather than in linear fashion; and each main tech (Engineering, Computing, etc.) has one or two ""stem"" technologies (Autonomous Systems, Defense Grid, etc.).  Finally, certain techs boost Affities (this game's equivalent of ideologies).  This leads to far more involved research strategies than previous versions of Civilzation.  All this can be very intimidating to the starting player, but thankfully there is both a filter and search function directly accessible from the research screen.

There are three Affities in the game that determine special units, unit upgrades, and victory conditions: Purity (human-oriented), Supremacy (tech-oriented), and Harmony (alien-coexistence).  Each have their strengths, and each have their cool (and not-so-cool) units.  

Instead of Civ 5's social policies, there are four Virtue Trees: Might (Military), Prosperity (Health & Happiness), Knowledge (Science & Culture), and Industry (Productivity & Energy).  Each tree has three tiers of five selections, for a total of 60 policy bonuses. The strategic implications of your choices are enhanced with ""synergy bonuses"" for completing specific combinations of policy choices.

Perhaps the biggest improvement in this game is Espionage. I have never been a fan of spying in the Civ franchise, but the espionage options in this game are step beyond those featured in the main line games.  In addition to providing all important intel on opposition research and wonder building, one can siphon energy (this game's substitute for gold), steal research, steal techs, recruit defectors (a cheap way to get more units), and -- of course! -- call in a worm strike.

Satellites are another dimension to the game, allowing players to improve whatever output the player wants to focus on: food, productivity, energy, and even science and culture.  Other goodies include building customization, unit upgrades, the re-introduction of trade units, and the taming the native wildlife. 

On the downside, the game is a little slow at the start.  Initial tech research costs are scaled a little high, but research-boosting science buildings come early and often.  Likewise, the numerous aliens spawning at the start warrent considerable prudence (""This is an ugly planet, a bug planet!"").  

There may also be too much of good thing, as specialty buildings for a modest increase in basic resources helps contribute to an increase in the number of buildings available.  And since all buildings are available once techs are acquired (i.e., no ""prior"" building prereqs), towards the end of the game the list of building options can be somewhat long.

And, unfortunately, Beyond Earth makes no improvement on the rather lame diplomacy system of Civ V.

As a fan of world building and geoscaping, I find this game is quite enjoyable and would recommend fans of Civilization V looking for new challenges. [Note: While I haven't experienced any significant problems, others have reported the game being somewhat buggy.  Examine the discussion boards for possible solutions early on.]

Although fans didn't take to it when it came out, the core gameplay is solid and it has a lot of unique and interesting features that set it apart from other 4X games. It has some of the best eXplore mechanics of any game I can think of. The alien worlds look great, especially the primordial biome. The resources and the terrain types add a lot to the flavour of what is, essentially, a reskinned version of Civ. With the Rising Tide expansion, the coastal shelves are especially lush. Expeditions are a great mechanic, archaeological digs that can yield artefacts, which can be combined to yield bonuses and even unique buildings - sort of like a hidden bonus tech tree. The mechanics for satellites are interesting and add a layer of strategy, although it seems to take a long time to unlock many options for orbital units. Another strength is the Affinity system, where players choose an overall approach to colonising the planet: terraforming in the image of Earth; dominating through advanced technology; or merging with the alien ecosystem. Diplomacy is quite unique, not necessarily better or worse than other Civ games, but an interesting experiment.
There are a couple of weaknesses of the game. Like Civ 5, the game likes to sprinkle lots of small irrelevant choices in the player's way. Again like Civ 5, the combat system seems rich on paper, but the AI can't deal with the one-unit-per-tile system. So despite the complex bonuses that late-game units receive, war is not especially deep. The Affinity system had potential to be the core of the game's lore and flavour, but this isn't quite realised. The writing, especially for the choices conferring micro-bonuses, is sometimes waffly and trite. It doesn't convey what life is like on the new planet often enough, or give a sense of a rising ideological conflict between the Affinities. Diplomacy should really have been informed by the choice of Affinity of different factions, making the late game a three-way ideological struggle for the future of the planet and humanity.
Overall, better than Civ 5, with a lot of unique, interesting contributions to the genre. A rich exploration and expansion phase gives way to an interesting midgame developing your territories and pursuing affinities, giving way to a slightly flat endgame.",1686428247,1686428247,True,5,0,0.541416823863983154,0,True,False,False

[b]The good: [/b]
·Rich alien environment that will put pressure in you from the start.

·Choosing certain affinity perks can lead you to master the afore mentioned alien environment.

·The new satellite mechanics is cool and something that deserves to be taken into account.

·Diversity of units (especially with the DLC): organic flyingaircraft carrier? check, space marines? check, Titans the size of a small city? Check, Organic titans the size of a small city? check, mobile antigrav fortresses? Check...

·""Serious"" graphics: no more deformed Julius Caesar or cleopatra à la CIV6.

·The graphics weren't meant to be played in a mobile device (android/ipad) Thanks GOD for that.

·Possibly the best DLC that I've seen in a while: new maritime options, new hybrid affinities...100% recommended.

·The DLC integrates a new ""artifact"" combining system that is really something worth mentioning, conceded that maybe you'll be able to assemble 1/2 artifact, but the bonus are so strong and differentiates you from the other civs that will give that playthrough another flavour.

·A sense of accomplishment when you see that alien planet full of your bases with your titans roaming and destroying/colonizing/assimilating every pandoran antihuman race.

[b]The bad:[/b]
·Zero replayability, every civilization is the same... with 1/2 different perks.(There are mods for that, though).

·The replayability comes from where you land: and believe me that sometimes you land in a place in where your boys are doomed from the start.

·Since there is only one planet, all your gameplays will have the same terrain details and will  have that Deja-vu effect, it's incredible because even transport tycoon (back in '96) allowed you to start in different environments (snowy, mountains, etc...), there is a ""exoplanet map pack"" that is the biggest cashgrab that I've seen in a REALLY long time.

·Do not expect the replayability of a civlization game.

·The little effort invested in make civilizations interesting. Don't expect the alpha centauri's plot twists to ever happen. In fact you feel attached to any civilization at all.",1680412800,1680412800,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I beat it in a few days. And then saw that I had left a review from the first time I played (which I forgot about), and found myself agreeing with everything I wrote 5 years earlier. It is beyond disappointing.
------------------------

1. TL;DR the only challenge to this game was understanding the overly complex and convoluted tech and politics

2. the units are arbitary and disconnected from the 'story' - in CIV5, your units are tied to the development of your culture through history

3. the political system is pure junk; it was completely unnecessary to interact with other cultures; I ignored other cultures for 99% of the game; out of boredom, I engaged in trading political capital, but it didn't seem necessary to the overall game

4. other cultures will be behind your military advances by huge leaps; I dominated the map by only creating autosleds with movement upgrades; building evolved angels and so on were pointless as they couldn't take cities and moved slowly; there was also no incentive to limit the size of your army; I simply purchased massive amount of units every turn and zerged the whole map

5. I was bored of the game by turn 100, and only continued playing to beat the game to see the end-game cinematic - which (SPOILER ALERT) there is none; not really; not on par with the opening cinematics. 

6. building 'wonders' didn't seem like achievements at all; when you would make one, other cultures would say, ""Wow, you're so amazing,"" but it didn't feel amazing at all

7. aside from building specialized mines to harvest rare resources, there was no reason to build anything other than terascapes or biowells, since both can provide +production, +culture, +science, +food, +health. 

8. I spent more time reading and trying to understand the overly complicated tech tree than playing the game

The game play of Civilization: Beyond Earth is similar to other games in the Civilization series, with players building and managing their own civilization. However, the game introduces new mechanics and features, such as a technology web instead of a linear tech tree, and new units and buildings that are specific to the sci-fi setting. One of the standout features of Civilization: Beyond Earth is its narrative-driven approach to game play. Players must make choices throughout the game that impact their relationship with other factions on the planet, as well as the ultimate outcome of the game's story. Additionally, the game features a variety of victory conditions, including economic, cultural, scientific, and military victories, allowing players to pursue different strategies and play styles. However, Civilization: Beyond Earth received some criticism upon its release for being too similar to its predecessor, Civilization V, and lacking some of the depth and complexity of previous games in the series. Additionally, some players found the sci-fi setting to be less immersive than the historical settings of previous games.

If you like the exploration and combat of other Civ games, but not the city building and depth of strategy that usually comes with it, you may like this game (but only on sale, it's definitely not worth full price). If you prefer that city-building and strategy, you'll be disappointed. The honeymoon period of the novel experience with BE wears off quickly, after which the game's flaws/pain points will get frustrating.

For me, personally, the gameplay loop was simply not fun. I feel many elements are simply poor game design. Too many to count, but for the sake of the strongest example: Miasma. At the start of the game Miasma litters the entire map. It restricts your movement and capabilities to the point where it essentially decides-in-advance for you, all of your tactical movement. You can't do anything about it for several, if not dozens of turns. You have to clean it up, which feels like work, not fun.

And we haven't even gotten into the playability of the game. The UI is absolutely horrendous. On 4k, the text is abysmally tiny and shoved into the corners of the screen. You'd think a major game developer at this game's release time could provide 4k support, or at least some kind of dynamic text or UI element scaling option in the settings. Nope, nothing. There a lot of hacky solutions online people have come up with, which is just pitiful. I had to whip out and play the game on my old 1920x1080 monitor.

Even on such an intended/supported resolution, the UI/UX is still lackluster. The strongest example from my experience is with the tech tree. It's no longer a tree, but now more of a tech web, very shallow and very wide branching in many directions. It's not user-friendly to navigate or understand. When you can't harvest a tile because it says you need tech X, but you have no idea where that tech is on the tech web, it gets annoying to hover over every icon in the moshpit web to find it, sometimes the same one since you weren't sure if you looked at it already.

Still, if you can get past the terrible UI, the flaws in core game design, and the shift from strategy/city-building towards exploration/survival/adventure, then you might want to buy this game.

The AI, while arguably better than Civ 5's is still kind of dopey at times, and neither it nor the aliens are aggressive enough.  Even still, I anticipate Firaxis will patch a good deal of these complaints in time.

Because it's the closest you'll ever get to colonizing a new planet without actually leaving your couch!

You can finally fulfill your lifelong dream of becoming a space dictator.

You'll learn valuable lessons, like how to build a civilization from scratch, how to handle diplomatic relations with aliens, and how to deal with disgruntled citizens who demand better pizza.

You can finally answer the age-old question: What would happen if Gandhi went to space?

It's a great way to take a break from the real world and immerse yourself in a new, fantastic universe full of possibilities... and killer robots.

It's a great way to bond with friends and family over a shared love of strategy games and dad jokes.

You'll finally have a valid excuse for staying up all night playing video games... you're saving humanity, after all!

You'll learn all sorts of important things about science, technology, and engineering... like how to build a giant space cannon, for example.

If you're a fan of Civ V and aliens/sci-fi, then you'll probably dig this game. It's on a hex grid, like Civ V. The game starts you out with a pretty good bit of Tech. The tech tree is a bit hard to understand at first, but you become familiar with it. The barbarians are replaced by various aliens, some docile, and some more hostile. Aliens will become more hostile the more you attack them, but will calm back down after backing off. The addition of controlling a satellite system takes the game to another level. Victories are a bit different, but still satisfying and achievable. The DLC adds mobile cities that can move (after x amount of turns). These cities will not expand territory while stationary. Instead territory is gained by purchasing territory or moving the city. Workers can build a lot of different improvements immediately (Including farms on water and some other unique improvements) and can clear miasma, which is a damaging fog that is present.
Still a huge fan of Civ V, but this is a nice take on a futuristic Civ game. I enjoyed it along with the DLC.

It is developed by Firaxis and builds on the previous Civilization game series. Civilization:BE also has a “spiritual predecessor” in Alpha Centauri. I haven’t played that game, but I have spend uncountable hours playing the previous versions of Civilization and Colonization. Now, one month and a lot of turns later, I will summarize my experience and thoughts.

You lead colonists that have been sent from Earth to establish a new home for mankind. Your task is to build a civilization on a newfound planet filled with strange aliens and rich in natural resources.

If you have played Civilization you will recognise a lot. You found cities, construct buildings, and explore. Other civilizations will also settle on the planet and you can either work with them or try to conquer them using warfare. I don’t find the civilizations in BE as prone to warfare as they are in for example Civilization V, which makes the game a bit less intense and you can focus more on your plan instead of worrying about what the others do.

The first thing you will notice is that BE is very different from Civilization when it comes to victories. The game is much more story driven and you win by reaching certain conditions (research these technologies, then build this wonder, then do these special actions etc). You have a quest log with missions that you can complete for rewards that is meant to help you get closer to victory. It is a fun change, but after playing through numerous games it tends to be a bit repetitive.

Finishing quests or researching certain technologies allows you to control what type of civilization you should build. This is called affinities and you have three to chose from. They basically can be summed up with: Become more alien, become more technical, or stay true to humanity.

Leveling up your affinity also levels up your units, which is useful. I have always found that managing and upgrading units in Civilization has been tedious, and having them upgraded automatically is a nice change. However, if you don’t focus strongly on one affinity you will find yourself surrounded with much stronger opponent civilizations and become vulnerable to attacks.

Researching technologies in Beyond Earth works slightly different from previous versions of Civilization. Instead of a research tree you have a tech web. This, combined with the new victory conditions, means that in higher difficulties you really have to be certain of what victory you are going for and what you are researching. It is a cause for more difficult decisions and it is sometimes painful choosing what research you have to focus on.

The spy system we are used to in Civilization V has gotten a big upgrade and is much more fun now. Just as before you can place covert ops agents in other cities. The more covert ops activity there is in a city (called intrigue), the more tasks your agents will be able to chose from. When there is low activity you can for example steal gold or science but at higher levels of activity you can start stealing technologies or order alien attacks.

The aliens are also worth mentioning. In Civilization, we are used to barbarians that attack units or pillage lands. On this new world there are roaming aliens. They are not at all as aggressive and a lot dumber. If you start attacking them however, they will understand that you are a threat and become more aggressive towards you. This is a change I really like, as the barbarians had an annoying way of always messing up my plans… :)

As I am a complete sucker for Civilization, Beyond Earth could have been either a complete miss or a complete hit for me. It is definitely different from Civilization in many ways and it is not a replacement or the next version of Civilization but rather another type of game in the same series that has its own tactics and charms. I’m glad to say that Beyond Earth, for me, is a hit.

My favorite way of playing this is with the mod that makes the Alien Life super strong and aggressive and then go pure Nature Gaia.  The AI will then have a constant war going on between you and the alien life unless they too have gone Gaia.

On many of the maps, the only remaining players are typically Gaia, and then you'll have to engage them directly.

I also really appreciate that there are powerful enough units that you can dominate any level of alien life if you go far enough down the tech tree.

The one complaint I have is that Beyond Earth's system is not particularly stable when it comes to mods for some reason.

If you're playing a modded game, most likely you'll need to simply leave that game on until you win, bc the save files are unstable when modding for some reason, idky.

You'll also have to play test the game until turn 20-40 to make sure the mods you installed are working because of instability, it's very likely that you'll have to remove mods one by one numerous times until you get a stable game, and that REALLY reduces the replay-ability of the game.

This is the era of Modding and Firaxis needs to take note.

Age of Wonders Planetfall and Humankind, Firaxis direct competitors in this space both seem to run mods fine, not sure why Beyond Earth mod system creates instability.",1676775550,1676775550,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat ITSELF feels overly useless.

My main gripe with the game -- and it's sort of essential in one like this -- is that there isn't any real diplomacy. The diplomatic system is based on acquiring ""diplomatic capital"" as a resource (like money or science, you can even buy units with it for some reason) and exchanging it for upgrading a relationship level or making an agreement which give some kind of bonus. That's it. There's little room for strategic consideration on the AI's part.

Relationship levels also require a level of fear or respect, but this doesn't help much. Fear seems to be based on military size, and of course it's always lower than it should be against a human player. Respect is mostly an arbitrary roleplay kind of thing that has nothing to do with the strategic situation. This game is supposed to be some kind of successor to Alpha Centauri but learned nothing from the worst part. Remember how AI factions would usually get locked into a vendetta against or be in love with you because you chose ""planned economy"" or whatever? Well, it's back under the name ""respect"" now and that's why you'll see things like an opponent nonsensically declaring war from the antipode with nothing to gain followed by fifty turns of no fighting. It's why if you outperform the AI they'll say things like ""wow nice culture rate!"" and want to be your friend when they should be envious that you're on the way to winning. I haven't seen any coalitions against the strongest player or any sort of smart play. Supposedly the AI will turn hostile once the player starts making a victory wonder, but I never saw this because I crushed them all long before then.

The alliances are a mess. Say you've developed friendly relations and have an alliance with everyone, and then they start declaring war on each other. You'd think this would result in joining with the defending side, or maybe neutrality, or even keeping at least one of the allies...but no. Somehow this puts you in a war against LITERALLY EVERYONE at once. Because that's what alliances do. C:BE flouts the usual rule in strategy games* that a relationship can't just flip on a whim. Even cease fires apparently don't exist (for the AI). A couple turns after crushing an opponent, despite having made him an ally again, despite having his ""fear"" level maxed out, and despite having no chance against me, he switched right back to war again. Not that it mattered. The AI is so bad that I never declared war on anyone for the whole game and somehow ended up with a dominance victory. Tip for any experienced 4x player: Don't use the default ""start game"" button, instead take an extra two difficulty levels. The AI needs its bonuses.

(*The big exception being something like Diplomacy, but that requires human players.)

The interface is a downgrade as well. Oh, that button that appears only when a certain unit is on a certain dozen tiles of the entire map is what I was supposed to press to finish this quest? Where are all my tables and graphs? What characteristics does this enemy unit design have? How many known foreign units are there? Which cities have which wonders? Civ II could tell me that in 1996!

The orbital layer is nothing interesting. It's just there to deploy stationary area effects. It'd be interesting if they actually orbited or something. I guess humanity in the distant future decided all satellites should be geosynchronous.

The quest system feels like a superfluous tutorial. Build an ultrasonic fence in this city? Well I never needed those since I don't anger the aliens but ok guess I'll build it and promptly sell it after taking the reward.

The upgrade system works decently and is a welcome change from the mess of Alpha Centauri's designs. Unfortunately, unit names change with each upgrade, which are in turn unique to whatever affinity your civ chooses. This results in every type of military unit having up to a dozen different names. By late game, most time deciding what army to build is spent looking at a long list and thinking ""What's the ranged land unit again? The guardian? No wait, that's called the shredder now. No wait, that's the harmony version. Or was it..."" It'd take me several playthroughs to start recognizing them all, but it's pointless because late game was just steamrolling the AI with whatever I happened to have anyway.

The aesthetic is pretty and polished but nothing stands out in retrospect. Besides the opening cinematic, there's little plot or personality to speak of. Alpha Centauri, for its gameplay faults, was immersive and memorable. Maybe they need a philosophy grad student on the team again.

The only thing really setting C:BE apart is the technology web. It makes for more interesting choices than the usual linear tree...well, it would in a game that demanded a challenge and I couldn't just go ""that one looks cool."" But it is probably more historically accurate...well, would be in a historical game.

Recommended only if you really like the civ series. Lacking in competent AI and diplomacy. Haven't played III, V, or VI but I liked II, IV, and AC better.

This is my first review so please bear with me.  I am really angry with 2K, I will try to be civil.

Sid Meier's  Civilization has a setting that enlarges fonts, to make them more readable, I have a 4k monitor and this is really necessary to play the game.

They forgot this setting in the Beyond Earth game.  On my monitor I cannot read any of the text in their game.

When I contacted 2K, a tech responded saying that they would assist me.  At the time I did not realize that assistance meant that I needed to go to a forum and HOPE for a solution.  I have not heard from the company other that to tell me to go the the Forum for answers.

When Beyond Earth was released, people were expecting the spiritual successor to that game. And we didn't get that. 

Beyond Earth is a bit rough around the edges, Its UI can be wonky at times and the base game is pretty simple. And maybe that was the idea behind this game (Not the UI that's unforgivable). It wasn't meant to be at meaty as the main line series. An easier CIV for people new to the genre.

Well I'm not new to the genre and I love this game. Why? Because once in awhile I want a simpler 4X game. And on top of that, the alien world is way more interesting that people give it credit. More importantly, the DLC Rising Tide, gives this game more meat. Its similar to what happened with CIV V. DLC was the finished product which still isn't the right way to do this. 

Either way, I still give this game a thumbs up. Its fun, its different from the other CIV games and that's all I wanted. Pick this up and the DLC, if you want a CIV game with a new coat of paint and a bit less complex. For days where you don't want to work after getting home from work.

I know this game kind of gets railed in the user reviews, but I'll just talk about my experience and thoughts. First off, this was my first Civ game in a while. The last I played was Civ 4 on my dad's house over a decade ago or whatever. So I'm a n00b. I'm a scrub. Yes, this review is based on the one campaign I played...which I just lost today against Normal AI because I'm obviously trash. On the plus side, like all my other reviews, I go into detail about what I like about the game instead of just saying it's amazing or trash and giving a thumbs. 

Good: I really love the main concept of BE, which is why I wanted to play it so much rather than other Civ games that might technically be better. The Affinity System. How do you deal with living on this strange alien planet? My choice for that question was Harmony, adapting to suit the alien planet. 

I went from wanting to clear miasma out to parking my units in it during fights because now it healed them. From hating seeing Raptor Bugs to loving them carry my Xeno Cavalry to battle. I especially love the unique units and the capabilities they bring to a fight. I love how even the shared units, like rovers and soldiers, still change to match the affinity, with different combat and physical traits. I appreciate that each affinity has a different special resource they depend on.

Being a Civilization game, Beyond Earth is, of course, addictive. That Wonder, unit, research, Victory will be done in a few more turns! Keep going! Just like my experience with Civ4, I really like the accompanying quotes to the research and Wonders, and Affinity levels, especially when they come from Sponsors.

Bad: Sponsors are kind of boring in the game proper. Their quotes on the loading screen, when you unlock research, or build wonders is unique enough. Fielding wannabe talks about how the only love of her life is money. Rejinald talks about war. Kavitha is poetic and talks in metaphors. Barre talks about nature. But in game, their lines are exactly the same and completely interchangeable with one another. And I have to bring this up because the OTHER space-themed 4X strategy game that Sid Meier made clearly had the sponsors talking about what they believed, 

I think the Affinity system I love so much might actually be to blame for this, because you can't have Barre in game talking about how much he loves nature while looking like a cyborg. But he WON'T look like a cyborg. Which brings me to my next point...

When a sponsor eventually does pick an affinity, their appearance barely changes at all, and they just wear differently colored clothes. While that's fine for Purity, since they stay...wait for it...pure human, it's not for Harmony or Supremacy. I understand Starships alleviates this issue, just as I understand this game isn't Starships.

Continuing this point further...

Reader: Please stop.

Quiet in the front row. Continuing this point further with the research tree and affinity system, how about some more cutscenes? Purity factions are putting on Warhammer armor and levitating things with floatstone. Harmony is splicing their DNA with aliens making actual kaiju. Supremacy is speaking to the machines in their own language and whatever. It would be cool to actually see them doing this stuff.

Now, here comes the real ranting...

Ugly: The AI of the sponsors is extremely irritating for a number of reasons. One: they constantly complain about everything. Stop killing the aliens that are attacking you. Don't settle on land next to me while I settle on land next to you. And we can't forget the ""Condemning."" 

I've been condemned more in this game than in friggin high school. And half the time it's for crap I haven't done in 50 turns, sometimes more. ""It's time I told the world of your sins!"" Bruh, what expeditions? I don't have any explorers now. The last time I did an expedition, the actual Soviet Union was still around. Get off my back! Why don't YOU do an expedition?! Huh?! There are alien bones literally staring your capital in the face for the whole game! They're practically making out! Jesus!

You know what else they bring up constantly for no reason? When you're different affinities. ""You and your people reject your humanity"" or ""It sucks that you're not cyborgs."" I know. You told me this already! TEN TIMES!! ALREADY!!

How do you even KNOW I'm a hybrid? Going by the sponsor character art, the only thing that changed about my people is that we start wearing green all the time! Green! And yet Elodie goes from being ""Friendly"" for half the game to being a complete asshole who sends her cyborgs to invade me twice! When she's ""Neutral""! Both times! And then she wins based on a time victory because she had the most points!

In conclusion: You SUCK, Elodie! You run on Windows Vista!

The first would be the sense of atmosphere, setting, and characters. AC had a fantastic atmosphere of a place that was truly unknown, hostile and dangerous, a a land where you could truly conquer it and bend it to your will, or work alongside it. Planet, was a character all on its own. But then you also had unforgettable characters like Morgan, Godwinson, Yang, and so many more.

Beyond Earth is trying its own thing, I get that, trying to compare it to SMAC is a bit unfair as I do not recall the company themselves doing so. If this was an intent to remake it, then I'd be way more upset. 

In all honesty, I'm not sure if disapointed is the right word because I had hopes, but the game did not dash them or meet them, it just kinda exists. The leaders and factions lack on screen personality, you might find some in the beyondopedia or whatever but when you actually interact it's like everyone went Synthetic because everybody feels like an AI wearing human skin. 

It has all the pretty lights and polish of a game from 2014, it plays well and runs well(on my machinetm), but it lacks life.

I can recommend this game if you are looking for another game to try to scratch that Civ experience itch, but I [b]DO NOT[/b] recommend buying it at full price, or not the complete set.

If you are familiar with Civ V, it should not take you too long to get a hand of Beyond Earth. I enjoy the overal setting of the game and can work with most of the new mechanics. Aliens instead of Barbarians are more interesting and a bit less annoying to deal with, Aquatic cities is a cool feature, you can start city development pretty much from the start, Diplomatic Agreements depending on the policies of you and other players for different buffs,...

[b]HOWEVER[/b]
This game has [i]a lot[/i] of missing features, or at least it feels like that, compared to other. To name a few:
[list]
[*]You cannot trade Strategic recources or Energy (this game's equivalent of Gold) directly through deals; the [i]only way[/i] to share your pools of recources is by forming trade routes
[*]The military unit variation honestly feels like a big mess. Besides the classic siege, ranged, melee, naval melee, naval ranged, there are other more specialized units, but I rarely feel compelled to even try them out, especially because the first don't require special recources and can frankly get the job done.  Speaking of that
[*]Only [b]ONE AIRCRAFT UNIT[/b] in the entire game (disregarding Orbital units), who cost no Strategics, are available pretty early in the game and you can mass up to three in a City. The best part? In my 30 hours so far, [i]I have yet to see the AI use them[/i]. I think you can guess how broken these can be, especially because I didn't find [i]a dedicated anti-air unit besides aircrafts of your own[/i]. Great for turtling, but it feels unfair.
[*]The Victory Conditions are, in my eyes, not balanced at all. The Emancipation route for example has a straightforward plan in the tech tree and its final phase  can be done in 15 turns, if you plan it right, while the Contact route is not only RNG-dependent to trigger, but the final phase [i]has a 45-turn timer that can [b]NOT[/b] be sped up by any actions whatsoever![/i] Why would you even consider such an option if the other is much more reliable to pull off? This leads to you leaning more towards certain paths because 'I ain't got time for this bulls###'
[*]Relatively small Leaderpool, and Leaders provide one unique ability, all the other you can handpick yourself. from a small selection that is the same for every game. It thus barely matters who you pick, their ability affects your gameplan minimally, which is a shame for replayability. No unique infrastructure, no unique units, no unique improvements,...nothing

I'm more of a sci-fi guy, so I prefer this, to Civ5 or 6. Future stuff on another planet is way more exciting than human history. 

Civ:BE has its issues, but it's overall a very fun game that feels good to play. Good empire building experience. The planet feels alien enough when exploring and the AI can be nasty at times, even though diplomacy is weird and convoluted. 

The good: 
Graphics and music are solid, so is the atmosphere. 
Building your cities and empire, advancing in your affinities. 
War and unit upgrades. 
Exploration and aliens. 
The game in general is good. 

The bad: 
Should have had a second expansion after Rising Tide. It's a shame they abandoned the game after the 1st one. 

The ugly: 
Diplomacy. They made it pretty unique, but... it's not good. They should have kept the classic Civ5 diplomacy negotiations instead. Diplomatic Capital is kind of okay... But only interacting with other factions via Agreements is boring and not engaging at all. Overall, diplomacy isn't not absolute sh!t. But it's weird and sad.

I can't recommend this for it's current price because the only real difference... actually I don't think there is a real big difference, actually yeah the tech web is a substantial change to the game just not big enough. 
Culture isn't nearly as useful as it used to be because, the lack of a culture victory, and the benefits from the trees you go down in the culture menu don't cause much change in tactics unless you go down basically the growth tree which will keep you afloat on your health. Also something to point out is why allow yourself to become friends with aliens when you ARE going to wipe them out, even when you pick the Harmony tree you will find yourself killing off nests and the AI demonstrates that. The aliens have no real use to them as allies it basically just means they won't attack you but that isn't much of a problem when they are laughably weak. 
The outposts you trade with in my opinion are just wasted space, the AI is horrid, it's very buggy, and the only thing that I found enjoyable is that I found it fun to play wide instead of tall when I am the kind of player who always plays tall.

The setting and theme behind this game had so much potential, but what is left is an unpolished and frankly boring experience sewn together with characters and factions that lack the charm you'd expect from a Civ game. 

The tech web is a poor experiment, it takes too long to figure out which direction you need to go in and the culture tree equivalent in this game is much reduced compared to the larger titles of this franchise. The affinity system is an interesting concept, however this again adds to the complexity of the tech web, making you have to choose specific techs just to get XP in the right colour! 

There are plenty of interesting ideas between station quests, spawned quests and objectives but these tend to dry up by the mid game where this title, above the others, becomes its most bland. Onto victories, the signal victory was an incredibly disappointing addition here, reminding me of transcendence it requires a flat sum of resources spent followed by waiting until you win. Purity and Supremacy get their Earth-linked victories which require a little more thought at least.

Combat is an incredibly easy feat in this game, if someone has less orbital coverage than you that is, between phasal teleporters and combat satellites you can easily wipe out key units or teleport halfway across the map (*cough cough Firaxite global coverage*). Besides this, the ARC and other players who want to use covert ops had better hope for success very early on. Spies are easily counterable by a low-cost building from mid game onwards and don't tend to have much impact overall, quite boring for the promise of those L4 ops.

Overall, I have tried to love this game for years but I must describe this as a half-finished project. I have not played the only DLC nor will I ever buy it, staring at the bland, indistinct terrain and dozens of dead stations for hours doesn't pique my interest in this title. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you enjoy the story and ideas behind the tech and building lore in this game, it had so much potential but clearly not enough to create a proper game for.

Pros:
+ tundra and primordial maps look dope
+ aliens are cool (but become easy to ignore late game)
+ futuristic hybrid units are kinda pog
+ unit upgrade system is amazing...

Cons:
- but the better half of the unit upgrade system is in the DLC
- only 12 Civs, 4 of which are in the DLC

So... long story short? It isn't.

Short story long? 

Personality: In SMAC, each leader has personality. The personality aspect lets you remember who each person is and the ingame story gives each of the leaders growth and further backstory. You get to feel and understand how each leader is. In this game? Random conglomerate guy on random planet get money. Why? idunno. 

Technology: The tech tree in SMAC makes sense. You start with old 1980s computers. You build up slowly. You have the knowledge, but not the tools. Eventually, after maybe a few centuries, your small advances make sense and they even bring it back up. There is a quote by Morgan in SMAC where he mentions that computers, genetic engineering, self repairing machines are all great, but real technology are the simple things we don't notice like having megatons of weight being held up by a single hair. In Beyond Earth, you can pick between 3 tech trees or a mix of them, but generally, they feel mostly the same. 

Units: SMAC has customizable units. Teleporting Death Spheres, Invisible soldiers. Psychic planes. Beyond Earth sort of has this, but not as much. 

Maps: This is where Beyond Earth wins. It has more than 1 map or at least more than 1 planet.

Graphics: Well... SMAC is 20+ years old at this point. So... ya.

Main Story: Well, SMAC wins. I don't even remember what the Beyond Earth Story is aside from go to other planets.

Get it? Sure, but it needs massive overhauls to be remotely close to SMAC.",1662177927,1662177927,True,1,0,0.49253728985786438,0,True,False,False

I like the intro video a lot since it tells the story in just that short video. You know immediately what the moral is and what to expect. (Obviously not everything but it will give a clear picture of what to expect.)

What I like about the game:
- A turn based strategy game which can cause hours and hours of playtime to complete your singleplayer game.
- Great graphics
- A insanely huge tech tree
- The way of obtaining and upgrading units
- At the start the settings of a game you're about to start are abundant
- Steam Workshop mods can be used

What I don't like about the game:
- The Steam Workshop mods mostly don't work properly which sometimes forces a complete crash or a save you can't load again
- There is not much choice of commanders in the basegame (Steam Workshop also contains more commanders)
- It can be difficult to maintain the fun and satisfaction you can get from playing the game due to long hours to complete a game.

People who tell you this is a reskin of Civ 5 probably also think that Sonic the Hedgehog is a reskin of Super Mario Bros. Of course theyre similar, but nowhere near the same game, and to just call it a reskin would uninformative and simply just wrong. Many principles of previous Civs carry over to this game as all Civ games do, but this one takes some twists on how they go about it. The Tech Web can be a little more confusing at first compared to the Tech Tree in Civ 5 but is a different take on it that forces you to go in different directions with techs along with the Affinities you choose. Picking the different bonuses that each civ gets before starting is a different way to about picking your civ and starting the game and then choosing what Affinity you want to pursue takes you down different paths. Will you conform with the aliens and use miasma to your advantage? Will you wipe out every alien you come across and just dominate the planet? Resources play out in a similar fashion to other Civ games but are different in this one just that they are some of the same and a lot of new ones, but a major difference is that there is no happiness so there are no luxury resources. Instead of happiness you have health, which works the same as happiness in that the healthier your civ the better it grows and prospers. However without any resources that just give you health you rely more on buildings and technologies and cultural policies that provide you with more health. Some tile improvements do improve health as well but take quite a bit longer than anything in Civ 5. Many other little differences, like quests throughout the game that provide you with a plethora of things to help your civ, are scattered throughout enough to make this a game that is of course built on the Civ Franchises fundamentals, and of course builds off of(what was at the time the newest and probably most successful Civ game in Civ 5) the previous games success. But is definitely not a reskin.

I recommend it if you like the Civilization series and think you would like to try a change.

It's not the best game out there, but it's better than a lot of people would lead you to believe. It has most of the high points of other Civ games: grand strategy, unique civilizations, settlement, development, and expansion. The system of Affinities gives it a truly sci-fi feel (frankly, I think Affinities are one of the best design choices they made). Finally, Rising Tide lets you build FLOATING CITIES!!!! I mean, what other Civ game lets you do that???

Probably best of all is the worldbuilding, art, music, and general aura of sci-fi colonization. All of this is simply fantastic.

It has its downsides, of course. It's not very well balanced, and Rising Tide (RT) makes the balance even worse. I find that just getting all the Affinities in RT is one of the best strategies, which clashes with the theme of conflicting ideologies. (Rising Tide makes it much more interesting overall though)
As with a lot of Civ games, the AI is dumb. Not much else to be said here. Try playing with humans.

tldr summary:

Overall, I found it an enjoyable play for a while, but it didn't hold my interest the way Civ V has. It's very atmospheric and customizable, but there's an exploit for dealing with alien life that drains the challenge from the early game and the Civ V shift to city spam occurs much earlier than in Civ V, which makes the game get tedious. Also, much of the customization has little effect on game play. I got decent value from the purchase, but I regret that Beyond Earth wasn't the memorable masterpiece I think it would have been with those problems and a few balance issues fixed. 

Beyond Earth is an expansion of Civ V released in 2014, later updated with the Rising Tide expansion. Although it's not just a revision of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, the famed Civ II spinoff from 1999, it still captures much of the feel of Alpha Centauri, with flavor texts drawn from fictional texts by the various faction leaders and a shift to transhumanity in techs, units, and story quests as the game progresses. Effectively, it tried to be the Civ V version of Alpha Centauri, with mixed success.

The game is more varied and customizable than SMAC was. Rather than monolithic factions with set powers, you choose a faction, a colony type, starting bonuses, further add three more traits chosen during the game, *and* you get to customize almost every building into one of two types. In addition, instead of just the vaguely Mars-ish-with-oceans Planet, there are six different ""biomes"" - frozen, arid, fungal, etc - and a wide variety of map types. There are now three more ""story"" endings to strive for in addition to merging with the planetary organism - saving the inhabitants of earth; becoming superhuman and conquering earth; and contacting aliens. 

All this variety should have created tremendous replayability, with literally thousands of different possible games. The problem is that much of the variety is faux. Unlike SMAC, where Planet is much harsher than Earth, all of the different ""biomes"" play similarly to each other and to vanilla Civ V, with abundant farmland available even on ""arid"" or ""frozen"" worlds. Likewise, all of the different story endings end up as ""build a wonder, set off a timer, and get attacked by the entire world"". And finally, with most of the building choices one of the choices is distinctly superior, so there's not really a ""choice"". So while all these different settings *look* different, they don't *play* very differently and it feels rather samey after a while.

There's a severe exploit with alien life, the analogue to Barbarians. If you don't attack them, they won't attack you. Ever. Even on ""Raging Aliens"". Worse, the AI players don't know this, and so you can get extensive access to valuable exploration sites until rather late in the game, because the AI's fragile Explorer units keep getting eaten. In combination with the welcoming terrain - 2 food farmable to 3 is widespread even in the supposedly harshest biomes - the Beyond Earth planet is actually easier to start on than even vanilla Civ V. Yes, I know I can counteract the gentle aliens by attacking them, but having to deliberately handicap myself just drains the joy out of it for me.

Also, empire growth is held back by a ""health"" mechanic, basically a rename of Civ V's ""happiness"". Like Civ V, once you can make enough bonuses per city, you can go viral and cover the planet with your cities. But in Civ V, that happens with the advent of Ideologies fairly far into the game; but with Beyond Earth, you can get there after about a dozen or so techs. So after the third city or so you're off to the races, and I find it really tedious setting up the 20th production queue. SMAC had the same kind of problem, but softened somewhat by the harsh terrain, and also it was 20 years ago before we had not developed better approaches.

So the first few plays I had fun exploring the tech tree and some of the funky units and upgrades. But after couple playthroughs I faced my first tough later game challenge, and looking at having to spam out cities across the world and then fight yet another world war it just doesn't feel worth continuing. 

What's annoying is that I think the limitations that frustrate me could have been fixed with a little tweaking. It seems really obvious to make the biomes really different - Frozen should be overwhelmingly tundra terrain; arid overwhelmingly desert; lush earthlike; fungal almost completely covered in miasma, etc. Then the different biomes would be really different to play in, and there'd be several more games.

Making the aliens spontaneously aggressive like barbarians are is a REALLY obvious choice. 

Building choices would be a lot more interesting if the energy bonuses were doubled. There's a lot of ""one energy or one culture/science/production"" and that is an EASY choice. Should be 2:1 early and 3:1 late.

Finally city spam is easily fixed by making the per city penalty increase with the number of cities.

The win conditions could have been made somewhat more interesting. The Exodus win, for example, could have had all the players competing to rescue and acculturate Earth Settlers rather than the Settlers functioning as a slightly gussied up timer while the world attacks you.

So Beyond Earth was a lot of fun for a while exploring the techs, units, and chrome, but after a few games I was ready to move on. I suppose it's way too late for this to get fixed, since even Civ 6 seems to be wrapping up (I've stuck with V because of better AI and because Civ 6 is not stable on my Mac). I do hope the relative failure of Beyond Earth doesn't end the development of spiritual descendants of SMAC, because I see a great game combining the improved mechanics of modern Civ with the PvE style of SMAC. Beyond Earth almost made it, but not quite.",1652730824,1652730824,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My recommendation is to reduce to price to $5 for Beyond Earth and maybe another $5 for Starships but at $40 and $50 it is a charitable donation to the intellectually disabled programmers at Firaxis, because it is a good franchise and usually civilization games are not bug infested.

I have to say, Beyond Earth has the worst writing by far in this game lineage. Whereas SMAC is about future possibilities, BE is about global warming--how we didn't show enough respect to Earth, how we made a huge mistake, how we didn't regulate enough, how much grief, shame, or guilt we all feel for what we did to Earth, etc, ad nauseum. Everything that isn't about global warming is vacuous ""flavor"" written not because it's worth reading, but because the formula demands that something be written. The game mechanics in BE are on par with the previous seven games (most similar to Civ 5), but there's a conspicuous absence of a competent mind narrating this game. The writing in SMAC is in a different league--as is the voice acting.

Also, the alien planet is gloomy and cheerless; Civilization 4 looks better than Beyond Earth.

This is also the buggiest game in this lineage. For example, when you scroll around the main map, sometimes tiles aren't loaded as soon as they appear, instead they appear as a black void until you stop scrolling the map and give the game a few seconds to load all the tiles (this happens repeatedly, not just once when tile is first loaded, and it happens on small maps on a high-end PC).

I recommend playing Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri or Civilization 4: Warlords. SMAC has the best writing but is not beautiful; Civ 4 is the best of the beautiful ones.",1442465848,1649440981,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This should've been Expansion 3 for Civ 5. Would've kept the much better diplomacy system too. Game starts off fun and engaging but quickly devolves into unit spam due to lack of resource diversity and the confusing tech web, making anything but military boring as hell. Affinity system is also a cool idea but needed more fleshing out. All the unique paths is why I picked this game up again. AI is especially stupid in this one, which really drags the late game more than it already does.

Too much of it and it gets stale, but sometimes I just want to play (modern) Civ in space, and this scratches the itch. (But, really, if you haven't played Alpha Centauri, it's worth it at least once despite its age, but this isn't a review for that game).

As a spiritual successor, I'd say Beyond Earth has less soul. There are a variety of planets that can be generated (cold, primal, fungal, etc), but each individual planet has less character (and really, is just a recolour). The factions are less memorable, and in my mind I simply refer to them by their real-world counterparts rather than their ideological representations. Diplomacy is sorely lacking, limited to a friendship meter and boons-for-currency trade deals.

It's not all doom and gloom, though. The game does a good job of telling a story though events and quests which lead to the victories, and every building is accompanied with a choice that lets you define your culture. The affinity system is neat: you get to choose between evolving your society through embracing cybernetics, alien biology, or sticking to your human roots. Do you change yourself to adapt to this new world, or change the world to adapt to you?

But, without Rising Tide, this game ends up playing like an extremely bare-bones version of Civ 5. With the DLC, you can mix up your affinities, so instead of picking one and sticking to it, you can embrace two of them, or all three. As well, the moveable ocean cities help give this game some uniqueness within the series.

So... Is it the best Civ game? No, not by a long shot. But it's not bad, either, and worth playing through a couple times, and the modding scene breathes life into it if you want something more.

I'd recommend this game to anyone who prefers a science fiction basis of strategy and visual environments.

For this reason it feels more of an RPG strategy, I much prefer this game for that reason alone. Instead of the Archaic denunciations in the previous CIV games, this feels a lot better imo. 

PROS - Sci-Fi awesome, cool future tech research / units / buildings & Aliens! Same CIV feel but with shiny new things.

CONS - early game is quite boring but essential for victory in the long run, similar to other games. All Leaders will react the same way which could be improved.

The lack of familiar terminology makes the tech tree pretty confusing to start. After playing a few matches I still don't really have a mental map of where to find the units/improvements/etc I want to unlock.
The building names are all weird but since they are accompanied by a resource icon its fairly easy to pick what you want.
Like tech, unit names are also unfamiliar and disconnected. You can't read the name and know the unit is. Upgraded unit names often have nothing to do with previous name.
It plays very similar to civ5 so the city building and combat elements are more or less as enjoyable as civ5.
I dislike how unit strength is gated by affinity. It can lead to unbalanced matches. However, I did like the opportunity to mix and match bonuses.
I dislike worms that camp resources, move to the plains already so I can make you into a skeleton.
I dislike the gloomy alien color palette of the maps. 
I liked the orbital stuff, its an interesting piece of the game. The terraforming is a neat addition.

2014: Hey, this looks promising, some things to iron out, but is fun.. AI could use some improvement
2015: DLC made diplomacy unexistent... can make some resources go +9999999/turn with some mechanics...
2018: Still a mess... +9999999/turn bug fixed at least. Experiencing some issues with specific GPUs...
2021: Game does not even start anymore, crashes PC into a deformed black screen as it tries to launch at resolutions higher than my monitor can handle.

(Note: I am still using the same monitor as 2014, meaning game could handle it just fine back then, what I changed is the PC and O/S, Using W10 instead of W7)

Back to playing Alpha Centauri, I guess. It still works.

Строго говоря, для гения это не обязательно. Сид неоднократно был замечен в рубке баблоса на фанатах. Эта игра - один из таких печальных фактов.
Перед нами перерисовка пятой цивы в космических цветах. Но не будем слишком строги: атмосфера, технологическое дерево и инопланетные фишки сделаны на высоте и отлично играют на настроение.
Ощущение чужого и неизведанного мира сразу наполняет тебя и жизнь останавливается в точке ""еще один ход и всё"". Как можно оторваться, если непонятно чем кончится распаковка модуля, а вокруг городов бродят жуки и ползает червяк!? И китайцы.
Из недостатков я бы отметил общую для этой серии нудноватую механику боёвки и развития территорий. Этот недостаток присущ и циве тоже: когда у тебя много войск, то прокликивать их каждый ход долго и нудно и надоедает. То же относится и к рабочим: автоматически они делают всё не так, а руками облагородить планету даже среднего размера - это то еще удовольствие. Крутить гайку на заводе и то интереснее (наверное).
Несмотря на то, что игру тут немного и поругали, она всё равно стоит внимания брата-стратега. Поэтому палец вверх.

You will find yourself loading up a new map 10-20 times to avoid getting cursed geography for your starting position.  Assuming you can bypass cursed geography and begin getting ahead of the other AI players, the game will then begin throwing disasters your way, such as spawning gigantic alien worms to pillage your roadways, killing your trade convoys, or attacking your outposts, just to nudge you into using their terrible relations and covert operations system.  In theory, covert operations can be used to destroy enemy cities or even steal their capital, in practice, this requires investing 200+ moves in game, which is about 1-2 hours of time, to maybe do something mean.  Relations means dealing with AI that will land their starting base right next to yours, pester you for free resources every other turn, then condemn you for taking almost any action including claiming resource pods, land, founding another colony, or doing an excavation of a ruin next to ""their"" land.  Worse, they will ally themselves with other players and draw you into a war.  Great, it's 50 moves in and 3 AI's are now sending units to kill me, this happened every other game I played.  On the easy setting.  Combat literally boils down to spamming affinity upgrades and units as fast as possible, position and using choke-points counts for almost nothing.

If I had to describe this game with one word, it'd be ""Miasma"".  The AI Characters are uninspiring, steriotypical, and their actions and mannerisms, and diary entries, make them come across as the most narcissistic, racist, sexist, bigoted a-holes imaginable with zero depth.  It's like someone was tasked with filling out their DnD Character sheets and decided to write in slurs for every other entry.  Who thought it'd be a good idea to name the 2nd city the African Union founds ""JimBobia?""  Seriously.  Africans and Brazilians get population growth bonuses and Asians get Production bonuses for starting, talk about lackluster races.  There was no effort put into making the AI players unique, interesting, or have their own behaviour.  Like 8 nations land on this planet and they all have the same equipment, same tech, same buildings, same tech tree, same approach to building stuff, same military units?  This is the future people, I should be able to build a greenhouse igloo in the middle of the arctic if I want to.  Terrible.  The only redeeming factor is there's a decent modding community for this game that tries to rectify the above.  

The correct way to look at this game is you'll get about 40hrs of playtime out of it before the novelty wears off and you are just reloading maps to get interesting geography to play.  Which is about how all Civilization games play.",1639497484,1639497484,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

We have a new quest system, bugged, for every planet explorer quest you have to one up by one every objective for it to count, exploration quests that are triggered but the game mechanics hinder the player to ever achieve its goals.

Even the flavor text for a lot of the missions has grammatical errors. I found more errors than I would find in a lazy student's essay written in like 3-4 hours.

Game crashes sometimes, like it did in Civ V, but we can enjoy the same panacea of reinstalling everything from your drivers to you gran-gran's air conditioner to maybe not happen oh, so often.

Workers cannot heal within cities, aliens don't always stick to their ""scripted behavior"", AI that's borderline stupid, but worry not, as with increasing the difficulty setting you may face a more muscly common sense challenged entity, some props, especially personality traits are not accurately explained, leaving you to wonder and to play 2-3 games with a nation to figure out what exactly did you do that was so you and unlike any others.

Customer service that engages you, asks for data and upon submitting almost the entire game-worth of info they politely excuse themselves as the game will no longer be patched. They could say this on the support page before acting like Dora the effin explorer trying to bust your rear to figure out whatever the hell is wrong with the game.

I love Civ as a franchise, heck, I even played the board games, but this game is awful.

The game has it's merits, however not for the 40$ pricetag or whatever it is now, Try getting it with the biggest discount possible to enjoy the above mentioned features. Merits include a sci-fi feel in Civ with OK graphics. Also make sure you buy the DLC for it too, otherwise it's not worth Jack Schidt.

Oh, but I have more blows to throw! Planet variety? More like planet shmariety, amirite? Even Civ 5 managed to create more variety in maps, here, we were supposed to have alien planets and they are all green with miasma, the oceans are the same, you can hardly describe it as something if you haven't already got familiar with the standard seeds.

Never in my life have I had to actually change the game speed for variety in a game that is so broken policy/virtue-wise as while playing on the same speed there is always the same path to follow for the best gain. Almost 0 synergy in between some trees and factions. Thank the heavens the affinity systems have been tweaked to offer some variety and reduce the diminishing returns of having reached levels in other pursuits, but wait! The game has a specific set number of turns before it ends as a time victory (a setting you may not alter), afterwards, the player is forced to play as ""just one more turn"".

Likes:
Plays like every other Civ game, But is still vastly different.
Barbarians from the other games are now wildlife of the planet and they can be set to act differently.
Ruins from other games are now things like wrecked spacecraft, ships, old alien areas, or wildlife zones. Plus added bonuses can be found inside.

Dislikes:
Every game seems to play the same, still a great game but can get old fairly fast.

The game is beautiful, especially with the Rising Tide enhancements to the oceans. The soundtrack is really one of the best, running through my mind even when I'm not playing. 

The concept of having to consider ideological affinity when making tech choices brings an interesting dimension to the standard Civ 5 gameplay model. The different victory types are refreshing - the Promised Land victory is particularly rewarding. 

The new diplomacy model that comes with Rising Tide is - interesting. Having other civs texting you constantly about what they think of your progress and various decisions was annoying at first. However, I tried playing without Rising Tide, reverting back to the standard Civ 5 diplomacy model, and I found I actually missed the feedback. Even if having the Slavs text me ""You are weak"" every four turns does get under one's skin.  My biggest complaint - I'm finding the game is too easy to beat. The AI just isn't that smart and this seems to be a trend with many games as multi-player has become more popular.

For one, it's effectivly just a big Civ5 mod, or expansion that adds a variant of the game. 
So it should be priced and handled as such. Which it is not.

On the other hand this is possably the civ game with the most unique and pronounced character.
It also contains a lot of unique mechanics I wished they would have kept and built up on in civ6, but didnt.

PROS:
My favourite system in this game, and what brings me back, is the Affinity system.
In no other Civ game does it feel like you're shaping your civilization. It just feels like you're trying to survive with what you have.
In Beyond earth though, the Affinity system adds onto that and actually lets you have your civilization grow in more then just land and pop.
Adding to this how modular your units are because of the Affinity system, and how they upgrade with your civilization's advance, not your gold account, makes them feel just so much more realistic and natural. 
Even though there's effectivly only the 6 base unit classes (heavy and light infantery, ranged, cavalery, maybe a boss unit) the variety that you can get and the feeling that brings is better then any other unit system I've seen in civ since the Fall From Heaven Mod in civ4.

The other thing I realy enjoy in this game is the exploration and expansion.
The mix of alien world and sci-fi extraction capabilities, makes land not make intuitive sense, and unique resources and landscapes come up.
The miasma is especially interesting, as well as the fact you can have canyons, that work like mountains, together with mountains, sometimes giving a very clustrophobic feeling.

The Satelite system is interesting, and something I feel that inspired the district and wonder ranges of civ6.
Being able to temporarely or semi-permanently buff a specific area of land is very unique, and I wished things like it were used more.

The ""barbarians"" of this game, the aliens, are much more interesting then the traditional barbarians.
While they work the same ultimativly, they are given much larger numbers, and the player is given much more ways to interact with them.
From installing sonic fences, to luring giant worms with probes, to outright allying them with the Harmony affinity. 
While it is just one more AI to deal with, I often find interacting with the aliens more interesting them interacting with my fellow human AIs.

This is more a dlc thing, but I LOVE the water cities, and the amount of water improvements one can build!
Oceans always were a bit of a dead zone land in civ games. 
But with the right dlc, you can even inhabit the oceans!

Finally, the Affinity victory conditions are very unique and interesting.
Much more then in most other civ games. They each have their own mechanic and requirement. 
The purity victory is the most interesting to me. To have to expand, or leave space for earth's settlers, to come through the gate, and protect them in the meantime, is so unique!
The science one is also very interesting, though more by character then mechanic.


CON:
My biggest gripe is the fact that there is effectivly no relation to cultural things in this game.
Wonders have texts, oftetimes more story logs of in universe writers, rather then a 1 or 2 liner.
Not to mention, we have no relation what so ever to those wonders. Obviously not. But it makes them feel so much less impactfull or ...well, wonderfull.
They just feel like stat structures that are unique, then a world wonder.
Adding to that, the fact that most wonders arent that impactfull with their effects, and there's 2-4 ones that are nearly overpowered, realy takes away from the awe of building these huge structures.

The modular civs are a great idea.
But they likely wount work in another more traditional civ setting.
Not to mention, without very carefull balancing, it is extreemly prone to be unbalanced and produce 1 or 3 ""most powerfull"" builds, leaving all those options for nothing.

While I praised the exploration, the look of the alien world is....rather bland.
It's all that light blue light green hue. Not just in certain bioms. EVERYWHERE!
There's no orange desert, green farmland, white snow  and grey mountains.
Everything is the same kind of blueish, grey green disgusting looking hue.
This doesnt only make it more likely for you to just play with yield icons on 100% of the time, it also clashes with the improvements you build on, which are cool scifi looking, but not fitting to the planet enviroment.
Oh, yeah.
There's also only ONE planet enviroment/type.
Which is disapointing.

The espionage system is techncially great.
It's more interactive then previous espionage systems, and gives more options.
However, it is compleatly overpowered, unbalanced and a horrible mess in the sense of applying it to the game.
Civ6 luckily learned from it and did it way better.

The tech tree is an even bigger mess.
It looks futuristic. But the icons are so .... symbol placeholder like that is hard to udnerstand what they mean. Especially because they are made to make sense to people in the future's time.
The effects of things are also often... weird. You have things that are name ""something power"" produce food. Or you have truck symbols for settlers.
There's also weird connections that exist just for the sake of making it that grand spiderweb.
The flexability of the tech web is great. But just like the wonders, it is horrably difficult to understand and get a feel for.
For one cause of it's complexity, but mainly because we have simply NOTHING to relate to when working with it.
In the traditional tech trees we can read the tech's name and somewhat understand what it means. Same with wonders, units and buildings.
But here, in this game, you have to go in and read the effects and memorize them!
I know, that's part of it being sci-fi. You can't rely on common historical knowledge.
But I feel it could have still been designed way better and way way more intuitive.

The victory types, while realy interesting and characteristic, are often times a chore to do, due to how long they take.
You're nearly always better off just conquering everyone.
And with how fun the units are, that's what you'll often end up doing.

Besides that, the affinity system, as cool as it is, does very little to encourage a proper conflict of idiologies.
Aside of a ""you're not my affinity"" debuff to relations, it does very little to nothing.
There's the hint of a quest system in the game with how you get affinity points.
I wished they put more on that and rewarded players to fight other idiologies, or even encourage different idiologies to temporary band together to beat another third idiologie.
The espionage system even hints at that idea.
But there's just no point to it.
You might just as well ignore everyone and build your gate to earth, or kill everyone in your grand global conquest, diminishing the best part about the game, the affinity system, to little more then your colour flavour.

Finally. The balance in this game and the AI are abismal.
The AI is passable for a civ AI, but it's horribly bad in using the new systems introduced.
It often feels like you're the only one actually playing beyond earth and the AI just builds civ5 with a different skin.
The balance, especially when it comes to civs and their bonuses, is realy bad. And while in the past the balance of wonders, buildings and units were adapted, this is no longer done. So compeditive play is basically out of the window.

Finally Finally.
This game should have come out as an expansion to civ5.
Not as it's own game.
Even in it's current state, it feels more like a mod then a game.
A very competant mod, dont get me wrong.
But it does feel more like an experiment then a fully designed and worked out the kinks product.


Would I recommend it?
On a sale, absolutely! 
It's a very fun and unique civ experience.

At Full price though? .... I dont think so.
It just feels to much like an unpolished experiment/prototype game for me...",1634311101,1634311101,True,43,2,0.801567971706390381,0,True,False,False

For the features that remain they are either unimproved or downgraded (pretty much everything: trade, combat, construction, communication, enjoyablity) . The only improved aspect to this game was the spy network, which added some cool features, though this slight boost is not much. Many features can be made to feel tidious. I often found myself just pressing random commandes to hurry the game along. There are prompts that occur almost every turn, such as telling caravans to trade. This message pops up every 10 turns, so having an empire with 15 cities and 30 caravans, it gets annoying fast). The new skin also takes a LONG time to get used to as the symbols and such all look the same, so it's a lot of reading on small little facts and tibits to know what's going on (it’s not like previous civilization games where icons are intuitive). The skin and astestic of the game while trying to go for a futuristic and impressive feel, falls flat. The game is most likely to be improved over time with over-priced DLCs, but in its current state it simply doesn't live up to exspectations, exspcially since it had such an enjoyable predecessor (like the sims 4, they removed basic features to sell later). If you're into spending countless hours in order to understand the incomplete game, it MAY be enjoyable, but for the casuel gamer it would be best to stick with Civ 5 (one of the best turn base games there is).

     On a side note, the game doesn't meet expectations as it never changes, its the same concept from the beginnning to the end. In Civ 5 eras changed, units evolved, and new concepts formed (also new elements to the game formed from the world congress to archieology). Beyond Earth is very linear (which is pretty funny since that was what they were trying to avoid with the tec web and such). Beyond Earth has few changes throughout the game and its feels like the same thing with only new buildings that hardly make sense and few units that change occasionaly. The game is never going to capture that essence of Civ 5 with wonders we understand and nations we learned about in the world like our own, so the game is never going to truly feel like a Civ game. 

If you're a casual gamer I suggest you wait a couple of months until the game is improved (but maybe even then the game will still be terrible)",1414279907,1633814982,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Call this a fair sequel to the space victory of Civ 5. A lot of people have given this a negative review and they are all correct. A lot of people gave this a positive review and they are all correct as well. The very split reviews both have merit and I'll address the pros and cons below:

Pros: 
Go any direction you want with the tech tree. 
Upgrade your troops one of six different ways of your choice.
It can be very relaxing, once you get a good grasp of the game mechanics.
You can become friends or enemies with all of the alien bugs. They have a hive mind and are all linked together.
You can send an orbital unit up to get the aliens to attack other players.
Despite the cons listed below, the game is actually pretty good and one of the better space colony sims.
A few turns after you complete a building for the first time, you get a choice on a permanent bonus all of those types get.
There are chain quests that aren't all the same every play through. Many have to be discovered by explorer units.

Cons:
The non linear tech tree is very discouraging till you get the hang of it.
The tech tree adds to the steep learning curve. Even for those highly experienced in the Civ franchise.
There are bugs and the developers long since quit trying to fix them. I haven't had game crashing ones though.
The AIs are about as good as Civ 5, which is okay at best. Diplomacy is very challenging.
The win conditions, other than total war victory, will take you many many turns to achieve. Like hundreds of turns.
Two civilizations have overwhelming advantages. If you play against one and aren't one yourself, good luck on winning.
The game is too expensive at full price for how old it is. Plus how the devs won't fix the bugs, do any updates, or patches.",1632878258,1632878258,True,89,1,0.891597867012023926,0,True,False,False

The game assumes a lot, it seems to be, as to what the player is supposed to understand from the get go. One of the things that drew me in tot he early Sid Meir's games was the gradual way in which new things were introduced, and the learning curve was certain long, but never steep. 
I think one of the things game designers seem to do is assume that no one would but a later game without fully playing and understanding all of the earlier iterations. A real mistake, in my mind.

Now, dont get me wrong, i havent played over 800 hours of this game and hate it, but there are some things that certainly make me punch the wall in rage, and thats certainly not a good thing in a game ive played almost entirely solo and on lower difficulties.

This is basically civ5 ""in space"". Unfortunately, its more like a mod that people stopped working on. There is a ton of bugs that still exists and yet we've seen no updates for years now. The ""upgraded"" diplomacy system that came with the expansion almost inevitably leads to war unless you go grade-school behaviour and adjust everything about yourself so that people like you. Oh and theres a ton of things they can do without going into war, like using satellites to lure aliens towards your cities and attack your trade stations (think city-states of civ5). These actions carry ZERO diplomatic repercussion, and only way to stop is to go war... which they will hate you for. Oh and theres no peacefull win. You have good ole kill-em-all win, and all other victories mean long term wonder plays which when they're closing on completion will cause everyone to hate you... even more.

You get Aliens roaming about instead of barbarians.. some of these are big enough to solo-kill cities until midgame and auto-raze any improvement they walk over ... The aliens are also a team without a voice, so any aggresion to any alien (or especially their Nests) will affect the mood with all other aliens on the planet.

Now, there are some good things though. The take on quite near future space-tech is intriguing and the three Affinities you can direct your society towards give a nice variety to the culture-tree-structure they adopted from civ5. The game also (mostly) looks quite nice. All in all, for atmosphere, yes, that i DO like.

So Semi TL;DR ; 
Infuriating AI, just play with friends (or sworn enemies).
Tons of no sense gameplay choices by the creators, flavored with bugs.
Nice ½Sci-fi atmosphere.

BE definitely recaptures the spirit of that game. I always loved that the specialization and subsequent emphasis of any sect was upon a particular philosophy or facet rather than a national identity. Being able to dive hard into production, trade, scientific progress, or even military training brings a unique experience to the Civ mechanic.  Certainly, you can favor these routes in any of the Civ titles, but to a much lesser degree than you can in BE or in AC. The AI diplomacy while painfully linear is at least not as absurd  in it's execution as it is in Civ 5, this game's nearest approximation. You can form long-lasting friendships that are less limiting to yourself in terms of your progress, and that do not seem to deteriorate sporadically. Speaking of, Civ 5's diplomacy is the worst example of a diplomacy system that I have ever seen. I do miss the ""world"" council, however. That might have made for a fascinating inclusion here. The aliens as barbarians mechanic makes barbarians worth while and not so one dimensional. At the end of the day, its not AC but its pretty damn close. Considering how flawed Civ 5 is, and don't get me wrong I still enjoy it, its a wonder that BE is not as equally damaged. I would definitely recommend this title to any Civ fan or fan of AC.

From setting up the game to making planet fall, every map I start feels exciting and full of potential. I love the science fiction theme. It's brought to life with a slick presentation and art direction that radiates gravitas. Sweeping orchestral movements accompany you through gorgeous alien landscapes, lush forests, giant fungi, blistering deserts, and frozen tundras. Strange flora and fauna await as your explorer ventures beyond your outpost. Will you learn to live in harmony with the local denizens? Or stamp them out in the name of humanity?

As you progress along the Technology Web, you will unlock more than tech. You'll also gain Affinity Points, granting your units unique appearances and bonuses. Your entire civilization will start to change, moving in one of three distinct directions, or becoming a hybrid of two or more.

I find this game to be so much more interesting and fun than Civilization V, and that's saying something because I love the entire series. The diplomacy is more interesting, the combat is more robust and frequent, and the aliens are way cooler and deadlier than barbarians. Whats that? You say you don't want to constantly fight aliens? Why not align yourself with the Harmony Affinity and develop a symbiotic with them, steamrolling your opponent with Xeno Swarms and Xeno Titans then!?

I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves 4x games and Sci-fi. It deserves way more love than it gets.

But if you're a fan of Civ V like I am, and are looking for something new to occupy your attention, then this game is fine. I know, not exactly a rave review, but this game is definitely enjoyable.

I do enjoy the sci-fi/alien world setting of the game, and although it is a little bland at times, it is somewhat fun to explore these strange alien landscapes. As you explore you discover strange alien artefacts and old relics from earth, using these items to give yourself technological boosts. There's a diverse range or new resources to collects, some might be familiar such as gold and the much coveted petroleum, and some strange and exotic like, well actually I'm not sure now that I think of it. Maybe none of the resources are all that strange. Still, I like them!

I also like the tech web, which replaces the tech tree. It's a interesting concept being able to discover techs in any direction you would like, although it will more than likely take you a at least a couple games to wrap your head around as it can be a little cluttered and hard to read. Still, neat concept at least!

For the most part this game is fun to play, although the victory conditions are a little annoying and drawn out. And the AI is damn cakewalk. And the aliens pose almost no threat after about turn 50. I still like the game. There's a neat quest system that lets you pick different bonuses for your newly built buildings that allows you to optimise your colony however you would like, and that's got to count for something right? 

I could sit here and write out all the pros and cons in dot point form, trying to convince why the game really isn't all that bad, but I simply don't want to. If you like Civ V and want to play it on an alien world then pick this up on sale.

The factions are my favorite part; they add a interesting variance both cosmetic and functionally. The alien aspect of the game is a nice re-imagining of barbarians. The aliens, typically, respond to you depending on how you treat them. Adds to the symbiotic theme (if you are going that route). The tech tree is awesome. Don't get frustrated... it does take a few games to know what to focus on. It's a web systems not a linear path. The map types and sprinkle of alien ruins make this game super pretty to play. Honestly that's one of the reasons I keep coming back to it. Against the grain of other mindsets, I think this game had aged well.

First and foremost it is a lot of fun with a ton of options and strategic choices. It draws heavily from Alpha Centauri and manages to capture some its charisma. This plays a bit more Civ4 than the controversial Civ5 (apart from stacks). You need the expansions however as without the game is a mess (In true Civ Style).
  
Its main flaw is the games pacing. Most games end way before you reach the end techs and some of the best parts of the game. For a great war game though play conquest only and that prolongs the end game unless of course you have killed everyone.

Overall a great 4x for all you strategy lovers. Well worth it if you pick it up with all the expansions in a sale.",1622129130,1622129130,True,3,0,0.502994000911712646,0,True,False,False

The mission objectives can sometimes be quite uninteresting, which could be made more interesting had the game include more RPG social elements, as its a very linear game, but with the structure of the gameplay being quite fluid and open, allows you to approach linear objectives in an array of different ways. While you play as Talion, the main character is the spectre with you, Celebrimbor- he's really the main plot point, and half your in-game abilities come from him anyway: luckily, his story is really interesting, and a little morally-gray which is always fun.

The feature of Sauron's Army with promotions, fueds, duels, riots, betrayals is very fun, getting to make rivals and a Nemesis that just will not stay dead is a really cool way to allow the player to make their own story and get them riled up a little, but the pacing on unlocking those features feels very strange: I'd unlocked the feature for finally mind-controlling warchiefs and planning betrayals in their ranks, but after around 4 more story missions, the game was over.

The map itself is quite well themed- very dark, stormy in areas, with brief retrieves of quite nice looking scenery. The game was produced in 2014 but the graphics still hold up decently, with some cutscenes looking very well done.

The soundtrack was quite good- not quite as themed around the LOTR score as I'd hoped, but good. When you enter combat with a warchief, a choir starts chanting the name of that warchief during the fights, and whenever they're about to beat you- I thought that's a really cool feature and can make fights feel more personal.

The combat is very fast paced and surprisingly fluid for the amount of enemies you're fighting at one time- the scenes where you're surrounded by enemies and have to think of cool ways to turn them on eachother, terrify them, or explode them all are very fun to play with too. The executions in this game are my favourite part- building up hit combos on enemies then doing one of a surprisingly large array of different executions, some in slow-mo can make fights look and feel really cool.

If it was just one time or an occasional occurrence, then I would just suck it up and deal with it.  But I am stuck waiting up to a whole stinking hour for the game to finally download the right combination of files and apply them.  I have never had this kind of idiotic problem with any other game in my life and it is more than a little exasperating.  2.  If you have a mod for any other civilization that did not come with the game, then the map immediately goes flat.  You cannot tell what is mountain, forest, or plain.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

It reminded me of Alpha Centauri, which is an incredible game.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

I just couldn't get into it.  A lot of videos I saw covered the first couple hundred turns, but once that's over, it just goes down to taking over other cities.  I know that's what the game is about, but there is no life in the game.  All the civilizations feel sorta unique to one another.  But their abilities feel the same.

The game gives little to no choices how you proceed.  Your civilization is the same as the other civilizations.  There are minor differences, but not enough to feel unique.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

Grew bored and moved on.  Huge waste of money.

No new developments have happened since my last review to dictate the game would be new, however my game has encountered an Unhandled Access Violation error and I can't start a game.

TL;DR - This game is a bland, generic mess of uninspired game design with only two cool parts here and there. Give me a team and 10 years and I can make this look like the scribbled drawings of a toddler.

This game may be a departure from the restrictive tech tree of Civ 5, but it's otherwise endemic of the same basic nonsense that permeates any game Firaxis makes.

The design of the game is basic, it's about as complex as a babby's first 4X game.

1. Combat is basic as hell. The only thing that ultimately matters is the strength stat, if your unit has more, it's almost guaranteed that you'll win the fight as all units have 100 HP and really no other stats. There may be Range stats, and bonuses obtained through levelups, but tile bonuses are the main dominating bonus differences, levelup bonues are incremental and barely matter.
Due to the Hex-tile nature of the game, tactics also matter a whole lot less as you can't fit as many units onto a battlefield as you used to in Civ 3/4, and because there is still no unit stacking, it's literally just ""bash army against army and win or lose"" 

2. Firaxis is afraid of players gaining more power than others due to more aggressive strategies that were mostly all but essential in past games due to their power, this is evident in the lack of power that levelups really give, but it's barely anything compared to the Happiness system that's simply renamed to Health and is literally no different.
Cities and Pops remove Health, buildings give it. Simply put this means that having numerous cities is a later-game priviledge and not due to budgetary problems either.

Simply put, if I made a better game, it wouldn't have this mechanic and the role of penalizing overly greedy expansion can be done easily via money upkeep.

That fear that many devs of 4X games have can also be mitigated by providing greater opportunity for differing strategies to give players their own power, and I'm not talking about the still-evident blight of the genre, Culture.

3. Culture is essentially a useless resource, it's only purpose is to give players bonuses but it can be broken if one rushes wonders as most of your culture income can come from them. All Culture bonuses can simply be transformed into technologies from a design-perspective and it would make them not only more accessible, but you would also have to choose between a bonus or unlocking a new building or unit, therefore making your choices in technology matter a whole lot more.

4. All the tiles look visually identical in many cases, more than Civ 5, the idea of Tiles having special resources is just almost completely gone now, let alone tiles having their own visual identity. Another point that Civ's turn from 2D was a mistake that is only manifesting now.

5. This game would've been better as a DLC for Civ 5 in which it adds all the content as a sort of multi-map feature in which a colony on Alpha Centauri (Of which this game shows a much less interesting version) is being played at the same time as your civilization on earth, which also could have it's own ecological distater ""crisis"" of sorts that Earth's civilizations could be faced with rectifying, or else the planet will be rendered uninhabitable, where the Colonies could then become so powerful that they could go back to Earth and reclaim it and reshape it into the Utopia each ideology dictates for itself and the world.

But this is Firaxis, a company that's been forgetting how to make a good 4X more and more, nowadays all they're content to do is copy off of other ideas and do nothing to innovate.

6. This game runs poorly, loads badly and needs optimization everywhere.",1414730976,1618434259,False,1,1,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

The Harmony/Purity/Supremacy angle makes for an interesting addition to gameplay, in that as you progress through the game with one or more of those, the resulting benefits of it can greatly impact your playstyle. For example, speccing into Harmony can greatly reward a more defensive or passive playstyle, such as avoiding conflict in favor of building up your faction. The visual transforrmations your units undergo is also very distinctive and invites speculation; what DO your Harmony units look like beneath their armor? Assuming that IS armor, which is a fun thought.

That said, compared to this game's immediate predecessor, it can be a bit iffy in terms of performance, and the factions themselves are cool but aren't quite as interesting as Alpha Centauri's tended to be. The alien fauna that serve as this game's equivalent to AC's mind worms or the barbarians of Civ can be a nuisance and more annoying than a real impediment, and the few genuinely threatening aliens can effectively stall your entire game for some time, as you will be unable to move into certain areas without any real hope of defeating them. (This may actually be a benefit to some, in terms of challenge.)

The modding scene is very interesting, though I have yet to see anything as game-changing as some Civ mods could be. I highly recommend the Codex mod, which improves many functions of the game and makes it work a bit closer to Civ 6, if that's your preference.",1614030347,1614030347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Improvments are better, you can build a farm over a strategic resource, are not as limited in capability. You can mod the configs so can get even more freedom

The leader traits and start bonuses lets you compliment or boost your empires strategy for steamrolling capability. For of course when you want to play easy mode on ai, or competitively.

Lots of fictional technology make the playthrough have that mystical aspect to it, this could be a downside, or a fresh change from the unchanging civ 5 technologies.

The health system allows you to build taller than the limiting happiness system in civilization 5, or even the amenity based system in civilization 6. Partly due to the increased amount of methods of getting it.

Now of course the downsides,
Its a more fictional game so your not playing for realism

Aspects of the game can be buggy, some bugs in civilization 5 were fixed as this game is newer, some bugs that were fixed in civ 5, re-expressed themselves in beyond earth

Let's get something straight right away. When I first heard about this game years ago, I was sincerely hoping for a proper continuation of the Alpha Centauri series just like so many others. 

Now, to be perfectly fair here, I think Beyond Earth is a good attempt to try to recreate that game to some extent without falling victim to lawsuits due to copyrights. (For those reading this unaware still, Sid doesn't own A.C fully or something of that jazz.)

So, what is this review about then? It's about how this game could have been the proper continuation, and should be the stepping stone for you to do so. It's almost 7 years since release of this game now. Getting nigh close to it for sure. I think there is room for a new release under Beyond Earth that fixes a lot of the problems of the game (Crashing, bugs, etc) that also helps bring it more in line with what A.C was. For instance, Terra forming in A.C was part of the staple of why the game was so damn great. You could terraform yourself a veritable paradise while drowning your enemy at the same time. Glorious. 

So, anyone looking to play this game for the first time; I would recommend treating it as what it is. A good game with issues. Like so many others. 

Hopefully they pay attention and decide to take this one step further. The rising tide DLC was a perfect example of how they would best continue to flesh this game out, but it's been 6+ years now. So better to start a new game. 

And yes Sid, I will pay your damn Sid Meier's Tax every time. Why? I don't know anymore. 

Just make Civ 7 a masterpiece beyond all else, and make it's map pack version of Beyond Earth more like Alpha Centauri please. Thanks.

And yes, I will continue to modify your broken ass games anyways.

Didn't have to fiddle with anything, change any setttings/drivers/etc.

My play time is far higher than recorded - I played the game offline quite a bit over the past several years, so I expect that I am well over the 100 hour mark.

This game is basically Civ 5.5, but in space with a few interesting mechanics thrown in.  All the mechanics don't quite work perfectly, particularly late game when you have multiple affinities at once, but I find it a compelling game overall.  I prefer it to Civ 6 vanilla, and it's a nice change of pace to Civ 5.  By far, my biggest complaint, is the narrated tech flavor descriptions.  Many of them are just plain silly, but that's a minor complaint.

-""Customizable"" Civs: This is a great feature because it really lets you fine-tune how you want to play in order to win. This customization also leads to unpredictability, allowing more replay value.
-Tech Web: The tech web also allows you to customize what you're doing and how you're doing it with it's branching paths and tech ""leaves"" to research. Because it's so non-linear, it's harder to tell what other Civs are researching, and that leads to more interesting, varied gameplay.
-Aliens: If Barbarians were cannon-fodder, then these are the guys shooting the cannons. Never have you felt so threatened by ""barbarian"" units as you have these guys. Naturally they eventually become less and less threatening with advanced combat technologies, although some of the aliens keep their threat kevel high even in the late-game.
-Affinity-Specific Units: These are units that can only be unlocked through a combination of the tech web and having enough points in a certain Affinity. These units look cool and are fairly powerful, and create a bit of unit diversity.

Now for the bad. With 200+ hours in Civ 5, starting off post-Gods-and-Kings expansion, I'm no newcomer here, although I've still never been very good at playing but always enjoyed the game nonetheless. Even still, I was able to win on turn 317 on the normal difficulty when I had trouble doing something like that in Civ 5. In fact, it was so easy, I barely even played. I more of just micromanaged my four cities after putting up my anti-alien fence building. Near the end I even just went ahead and started razing my neighbors cities with my ultimate Harmony unit JUST TO BURN TIME UNTIL I WON. No one put up a fight against me, even my neighbor-now-enemy had just a few ranged units, one planted in each of his cities! I also found some of the gameplay changes, like Happiness to Healthiness and the lack of some kind of Beyond Earth-equivalent of tourism/religion, made the gameplay feel very dumbed down. The game also felt very bland, as I never really saw any other units besides a standard Marine, Explorer, and Worker robot until I got my special units, and even then only saw them (this is more relating back to the AI seemingly being incredibly incompetent, but still a con nontheless). As well, the color pallette seems to have noticeably darkened, and personally becomes much more boring to look at as a result. All in all, I think Civ: Beyond Earth needs what Civ 5 got; A GnK/BNW expansion that adds more to and fixes the base game. In it's current state, I regret spending $50 for what feels like a polished beta of a game.",1414298990,1605591661,False,12,0,0.508146166801452637,0,True,False,False

I am constantly harassed with trade offers. Constantly getting notifications of how good or poorly I am doing based on other leaders preferences.

All of the bonus, primarily through diplomacy, feel just random and often times giving little to real effect.

There are some things I enjoy. I like the native life on the plant, how you can choose to attack or remain friendly with them. The varied terrain and resources are nice, but this is mostly just looks. I like the units and upgrading them rather than simply replacing with newer units. I do like the culture tree, though this is similar to civ 5.

The civilizations refer to each other by the leaders name rather than the country. This is confusing and makes me have to check and recheck who the **** they are taking about. I honestly dont care about the leader and their name. I see the image of the nation, the colors of the nation and the name of the nation. This is also a problem in civ 5 and 6.

This game has good graphics and good mechanics. Music is nice but a little uninspiring. Gameplay is OK and balanced, almost to the point of being too smooth. If you're in it for just the gameplay and don't care about story you might rate it higher than I do. However all in all I would give the game a 5 out of 10 for the reasons below.

The game is about the future of humanity but suffers from poor narrative. I just did not care about this kind of future. There is lore, but its not worth reading because it doesn't integrate in the game. There is just no point to the lore. None of the victory conditions is convincing. A Giant brain on a pedestal as the ascend to transendence? Or building a giant beaming tower to contact the progenitors only to discover that nothing is revealed?

There is no real canvas for morality and therefore no story and no mystery. The game tries to be serious but the faction leaders interactions and the philosophical quotes are just pathetic. The game throws a ton of polished nice looking aliens, affinities, victory conditions, and game options at you. But all this cannot make up for these shortcomings. In short the game and the faction leaders have no soul. 

I played 53 hours, because well... if you want to play a few rounds that's were you end up. There was some fun in trying all things out. But after you have done that, you just don't want to come back.

Very much unlike CiV 4 with its beautiful integration of music, history and philosophy. Or  alpha centauri (AC)... which is even on a higher level perhaps.

[b]Beyond Earth (BE)[/b] doesn't feel like a Civ game. Sure it has many similar features & mechanics, and you'll know most of the basics from the first turn, but numerous other changes just don't sit well with me, feeling unbalanced & unintuitive. 

For many Civ fans, winning their space victory and seeing their rocket set off for the stars always left you wanting to continue the journey, one day. There was Alpha Centuri off course, but [b]BE[/b] is not AC. [b]BE[/b] is set about 500 years into the future, a dying Earth, the remaining civilizations [i](conglomerates of existing nations)[/i] reach out to the stars in hope of survival.   

One of the first issues you will encounter is the new tech-web. Not necessarily a bad concept, when there is some logic behind the progression. In Civ, this is natural, as a player you understand the significance of your technological advances [i](its intuitive, part of our collective human history)[/i]. In [b]BE[/b] where there is no basis, no lore, no previous history created to help the player understand where you are starting from at turn one. Most of the sayings, names, wonders or civilizations for that matter hold little meaning or interest.

Technologies for the most do not seem to have any logical steps once you step out the inner circle [i](few that are familiar like Computing, Chemistry etc.)[/i] of the tech-web. It's symmetrical, not organic and although you appear to have so many more paths to potentially explore, in practice I found I just wanted to get the affinity ones primarily as fast as possible to get various bonuses/buildings but most importantly military upgrades. Tech-web is bland & overall is very hard to follow. You will revert to always using filters to make any sense of it all.

Military Units now upgrade rather than becoming superseded. I really like this idea, although I don't like the implementation. Your upgrades are seemingly tied to your affinities, along with requiring certain techs to build some units. These steps up in strength can make a huge difference and when all your units instantly upgrade. You can have a war turn instantly on you! It’s a flaw [i](or perhaps a limitation)[/i]; these steps should be more gradual. In Civ, this happens as you cycle through and upgrade new units into your military over many various iterations. In [b]BE[/b], there might be 4-5 main iterations over a game per unit type. This can represent significant stats improvement to receive automatically which seems to widen later in the game. Unit upgrades should be far greater in frequency considering the limited number of unit types and should involve other techs, not affinity related too [i](maybe more minor improvements but still help players keep pace if exploring other parts of the tech-web)[/i]. Going a smaller arsenal also should have a high level of customisation than simply choosing the affinity. Affinity is also tied to your victory conditions adding further to its importance.

I did like the aesthetics & more intense colours used in the alien landscapes and thought the musical score was excellent [i](so was the intro video!)[/i]. UI was good in places [i](liked the colours again)[/i], but confusing in others. It seems [b]BE[/b] is almost a stats free Civ & other management features seems very cut back to almost non-existent. This simply adds to the confusion when you cannot assess how you are tracking. All feels a bit dumbed down really, even further than Civ V. Feeling less strategy, more plain luck at times. Please bring back the stats!

[b]BE[/b] is also cut back in other respects, such as no more intros for leaders, no more wonder videos or cool narrators. Diplomacy, is none improved from Civ V and the generic leaders have no personality. Doesn’t really matter much of the time anyways as games mainly turn to war [i](seems after 500 years nothing’s changed :lol:)[/i]. One little hex of Miasma clearing can turn your friendly neighbour to the brink of war. AI flip-flop consistently and there is little you can do to avoid it, making it a better approach just to avoid them all together where you can or go strong and wipe them out.

Aliens on the planet are an improvement over barbarians, but still not terribly intelligent [i](or aggressive)[/i]. Worms are cool!

Although the health [i](happiness from Civ)[/i] is less penalising if you go in the negative, I have found it harder to keep in the green. Depending on your tech choices you can find yourself very limited in improvements to counter expansion. I would have liked to see both health and happiness included as different measures, and more flexibility to manage your cities. There are more improvement options for your workers which is nice, but being the future, I would have liked to see options to better evolve your landscape.

Satellites [i](Orbital Layer)[/i] are another addition to [b]BE[/b]. This could have been a really awesome feature improvement. In practice, I found myself using it very little, as often you had limited choices in launches, and they don't seem to stay in orbit very long for the turns used to build. I would have loved to seen this fleshed out further, options for upgrading satellites to make permanent or increase coverage. Using Miasma killing satellite can send you to insta-war too, so I found myself avoiding using it. 

Another annoying feature in the late game is having to keep setting your trade routes every few turns. You have so many to manage too it becomes incredibly frustrating!

[b]BE[/b] has bravely tried to be something unique, introducing some new mechanics to the well-established Civ world. Some of it is interesting enough to experience a few times, but overall this world feels generic, unbalanced & frankly uninteresting. Too much of what makes Civ addictive is lost in [b]BE[/b] and I come away feeling a bit dirty about it all, especially knowing the premium price charged [i](should add overcharged for us Australians at approx. ~$80USD)[/i] for what is at most an expansion in terms of real content. 

For me, this is the biggest disappointment of the year, but Firaxis are known for good after release support, so I am desperately hoping some balance patches and more content might make this more enjoyable. As a big Civ fan I will keep my eye on future progress, but at this stage, in its current state, I don't see it holding my interest for many more turns.

The game is unbalanced; There are 3-4 starting options that simply better than all the rest. You will for example always pick +culture a turn, because it provides the fastest unlock of the upgrade tree and visibility of titanium because it provides +5 production right off the bat. A person who knows the meta will easily outclass the AI.

It totes it's 'affinity' system: More or less the player can pick one of three (one of six with Rising Tide DLC) talent trees to go down that provide specific upgrades to their units. You can be robots with good tech, breed with the aliens and turn yourself into an every growing horde of hippies, or decide that you hate the planet and want to purge all alien life- which will quickly make you fall behind because military focus is not the meta.

However, the player is restricted from affinities with resources found across the map- It could be that you want to play as robots this game but all the Firaxite needed to do that is on the other side of the world and now you're stuck as space hippies. Now, each affinity is supposed to have its strengths and weaknesses, but a half competent player will end most games with some odd mixed affinity, having maxed one out and gone down another tree after- This inspired the DLC which added content for these mixed paths.

The tech tree is non-linear and has multiple branching paths to go down, but you'll still end up going down most of them. The AI does not seem to deal with end game tech well- particularly teleporters seem to be a sore point for them. You can watch as the enemy army leaves their homeland undefended and then just teleport onto their capital. I've done that, multiple times.

The mods are buggy and need to be loaded twice to actually turn on.

I don't know how to write reviews, but I do know I like this game. I recommend this game, if you want more Civ 5, in all its unbalanced glory, with aliens, and robotic hiveminds, I strongly recommend this game- On sale.",1598762191,1598762191,True,16,0,0.67277061939239502,0,True,False,False

I absolutely adore this game.

The main thing which I love and which (in my opinion) gives the game its replayability is the affinity system. This system is based partly on the resources you find and partly on your style of play.

If you enjoy the Civ series and like a more SciFi like setting, Beyond Earth may very well be the Civilization game for you. If you can pick it up while its on sale, it'll certainly be worth a good bit of playtime. For myself, I've still sunk over 150 hours into the game, just by occasionally playing it for a bit of variety.

That being said, in my opinion, this is far from the best Civ game in the series. If you're looking for a great Civ title to play with your friends, I would look to Civ5 or Civ6. Both are better developed, more fleshed out games. They also feel better programmed and supported. Even on my current PC (9th gen i7, 2080S), I had issues with BE on low settings. The game does not feel well optimized and does not always run smoothly.

Gameplay wise, the game lacks distinct visual cue's for terrain types. But perhaps it matters little, as terrain also has little impact on your cities. Outside of strategic resources, you can basically dump a city where ever you want, it'll be fine. This makes it lack some strategic depth for me, compared to Civ5 and 6 for example.

The Tech Web, while making sense with practice, is counter intuitive when you just start playing and the victory conditions are not quite as well balanced as they could be. Most of my games simply ended with large Hovercar battles, trying to get a domination victory. 

There are more issues I could list, but I think the idea is clear.

Beyond  Earth very much feels like an ""in between"" product. Civ5 was getting older, Civ6 wasnt out yet. Beyond Earth was launched to fill the gap, but it did not receive the support needed to turn it into the same sort of great game as the other games in the series.

If you can live with that and want some fun exploring Civ in a SciFi setting, see if you can get it on a discount. But if you're looking for the top-notch Civ experience, I would look to Civ5 or Civ6",1597599383,1597599383,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The aliens are incredibly invasive and cannot be turned if. If you so much as attack ONE alien by mistake (which is very easy to do since the unit's icon is shown on the tile ABOVE the tile they are actually on), ALL of the aliens flip out and attack you simultaneously, world wide (despite being maxed out in the Harmony aspect).

There is no way to disable the pervasive ""help"" system that won't shut up and keeps telling you the same things over and over and over.  The other civilizations just spew endless nonsense at you. The AI is somehow even worse than Civ 5, there is no pattern to their requests and clearly no ""logic"" to their interactions with the player, the things they say don't even match the respect shifts. They will insult you, yet you GAIN their respect?!

Also, the minimap. I get that we all like dark mode, but good grief, it's impossible to distinguish between land and water. You certainly can't glance at the minimap and get anything useful out of it.

It's very clear that this game's designers abandoned all effort once the graphics had been sorted out. I purchased this game out of good faith in Fireaxis, hoping that maybe my friends were mistaken and the game couldn't possibly be this bad. No wonder you can't find any discussions around this game, nobody wants to acknowledge that this travesty exists. I'd ask for a refund, but no Civ game can be adequately tested in two hours.

I'm only 4 hours into the game now so I'm still getting used to things like diplomacy, but so far I really like what I'm experiencing. I still wouldn't rate it as high as Civ 4 or 5, but it is very nearly there.

Civilization: Beyond Earth is a very fun game, and in terms of a Civ game - it's pretty fast paced. The only problem with it is that it's not really a civ game. The game lacks the depth and complexity that made Civ V, and arguably Civ VI, so much fun and so addictive.

I do reccommend this game, however, but not to someone chasing a true Civilization experience, but to someone who wants a strategy game without the learning curve of a normal Civilization game, but still more complex than a Command & Conquer RTS game.

Some said it was too similar to Civilisation 5 and therefore not innovative. Whereas others praised it for being an expansion on one of their favourite games, with some interesting changes. 
I have been a fan of Sid Meier's games ever since I first played Civ Revolution on the Nintendo DS. So when I discovered this, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt, and give this game a shot.

First and foremost the intro video immediately grabbed my attention as soon as I loaded the game, visually stunning and the orchestral music accompanying it was incredible and thematic in my opinion. So, it's off to a good start. Like with any other civ games I play for the very first time, I decided to create a quick match with about 3 other AI on Normal to get a feel for it. 
Second thing I noticed when it started up, was how hexagon tiles from 5 were carried over, aswell as a lot of the UI. Not really a problem for me but I could definitely see what other people were talking about in similarities. I decided to allow the guide ""ADVISR"" show me what new features and victory types there were. Fairly helpful information, but most of it I picked up through trial and error or reading the civpedia. The game plays exactly how you would expect it to play. With production and growth management, ""Health"" replacing happiness, and a new and ""improved"" (depends on the person but i personally liked the freedom of direction with it) research tree.

+ The new features that grabbed my interest the most were:

The AFFINITY system. It is essentially how your army and civilisation evolves. Depending on the choices you make at what you research (look at the colours), it will actively change how your army and cities look and function. Took me a little while to get the hang of it as I kinda ended up lost in choice, not focusing on any particular thing, just because I was curious to see what cool weapons I could make to reek havoc and destruction with. I was not disappointed. This is probably one of the more fun aspects of the game. As warfare was always something I liked about this series. 

Barbarians have been replaced with alien creatures. Which you can either kill or domesticate to use against your enemies.

""Orbital"" movement, being able to construct and launch satellites/spacecraft gives a whole new strategy element to it with some unique units. 

Quests (improved further in DLC), these are carried over from some of Sid's other titles. Throughout the session you will be given mission to complete for you civilisation which offer short little stories and exposition related to your people's struggles and adventures, nice little touch.

The new victory types, I was going for Emancipation, which is basically building up a large force and sending them through a warp gate back to earth to...liberate...it? But ran out of time on the last couple of turns, going to have another stab at it soon. Like, a lot of people have complained about the game's new victory types being confusing recently, but all you really have to do is go into the ""victory"" menu, click on which one interests you, read what is required, and then glance through your research tab to see what you need to build the thing, a little tedious at the start but you'll eventually get the hang of it.

- Some negatives would have to be:

The base game factions have stale personalities, quite generic, which is a big contrast from other Civ games. Though the DLC GREATLY improves on it allowing you to also alter it with different traits. Just shouldn't have had to be DLC, could've been implemented from the start.

They could've done a little more to make maps look more unique, apart from a few planets I played on that had amazing otherworldly biomes, most felt the same.

* Final verdict: 7/10

I don't know why there is so much hate for this game. At full price near launch I can definitely understand why people disliked it, because it didn't change a lot from its predecessor, but I guess they went with the ""if it ain't broke why fix it"" approach. But it is now years later since it came out and honestly at it's current price tag of £30, I think the game is still pretty entertaining enough to buy. I'm still enjoying playing it because I just treat it as an expansion rather than a full title, I kinda switch between this and Civ 5 depending on what time period I want to play in. All I'm saying is, whether your a die hard fan, someone who is just getting into the series, or someone who enjoy's board game style strategy. You should definitely check this game out if you haven't already. Also I could understand if you think it's still pricey for an old game, I'm sure there will be another sale at some stage, so you can probably pick it up for even cheaper. If you can't wait that long though, I still think it's a safe purchase.

P.S. The DLC ""Rising Tide"" adds even more units, factions, quests and diplomacy options to the base game, highly recommend it if you want the full experience, makes it an 8/10 in my opinion.",1560644238,1595270844,True,34,0,0.746865332126617432,0,True,False,False

I was playing on marathon with the most weak AI to learn the mechanics (and it still took 300 turn).
I didn't play a long time so i may not have the full experience of this game.
I got this game for around 3$ (i think) and for the price it's fine.
If you are not sure if you want to buy this try the demo or keep your money for something else.
If you like that game then good for you!
It is not my first Civ so i'm not just crying over the game cause i can't beat it (it's playable but it's not worth my effort).
If it's your first Sid Meier's, buy Civ 5 or 6 instead.

One might be military-focused, one might be science-focused, but they all pretty much look the same and behave very similarly to one another.

Alpha Centauri also didn't have historical figures to draw on, but the faction leaders had real personalities and played significantly differently from one another. And as pretty as the modern graphics are in Beyond Earth, the art style of Alpha Centauri also had more personality.

Except I kept getting extremely stressed out and angry while playing it.

It took me a while to figure out why, but once I realized that how upset I was getting was tied to how much AI Civ interaction I was having to do I took a closer look at it.
I realized that the wording of almost all the AI chatter from other factions is worded specifically to make the player angry. Now... for a more aggressive person that might well be fine. For a competitive person that might be fine. ...but for anyone with major emotional abuse in their past, particularly if they've had to deal with severe passive aggressive manipulation or outright emotional bullying the AI Civs are Hell.

I won't be playing this game again, and since the wording was so very, very carefully structured as to make it obvious that it was done intentionally, I will never be purchasing, supporting, or endorsing any Firaxis product again.

Its probably more worth it to play with friends but the game boils down to this: You either murder all the aliens of leave them be. Make robots or monsters. Also the fact that you have to get a 20 buck dlc to unlock basically 50% more the game is just blasphamous.

2020 Review: This is my updated 2020 review, still not worth it AT ALL. While the game certainly does bring some really interesting things to the table, it lacks the charms that Civ V has, Wonders in the game you cant tell apart from basic buildings because the UI sucks, the Civs are cool, but super generic, and the only good system is the Affinities. The DLC is far too expensive even now, AND to boot, the game doesnt start anymore. Idk if this is a new problem or a problem with me, but there seems to be a problem with Windows 10 and the game, but I cant be for certain. All the matters is it wont start up and I tried hours trying to fix it to no avail. If you really, REALLY want to spend money on a Strategy game, get Civ V or maybe Stellaris, which are my personal favorites, but absolutely dont spend money on this unless you really want to dealt with refunding it like I am currently while writing this review.",1508889724,1591075868,False,6,1,0.573445022106170654,1,True,False,False

Because it does not mimic human history like the other Civ games it is hard to understand things like the technologies, the strategic resources and alien behavior. I like Civ Beyond Earth because:
- tech web makes you choose in which direction you let your civilization evolve (if you had a timeline then you would only be able to evolve in one direction)
- you can decide how to handle living on the new planet (change humanity to look a bit like aliens and live in harmony with them, destroy the aliens and their habitat and change the planet into a second earth, or a solution in between)

1. Is this better than Civ V?
A. No, but it plays in a familiar fashion to V
2. Is this better than Civ VI
A. It is not as buggy or exploitable in all the time I have played it.
3. Is this game worth my money?
A. I would argue yes, but get all the DLC and get it on sale.
I have really enjoyed this game a lot. It is overall an easier game to play than Civ V. Aliens are fairly friendly as long as you don't encroach on them and the flavor text around each building and technology is a lot of fun to read. It is not Civ V though, not even close. Trade routes between nations allow for strategic resources to be traded, and diplomacy is not as advanced in this, rather you get a whole slew of benefits from raising relationship with nations. The affinity system allows for more advanced troops and overall is a little strange as a mechanic, but it works out in the end. Wonders are actually well placed throughout the tech tree and are just as powerful as V's but will not mean the end of the game if you don't get them. I have won several games without having to build wonders. There are lots of quests throughout the game which have very nice stories that draw you into the environment. You also basically get to design your own religion in game with the diplomatic policy options which is a nice feature allowing you to play in varying ways. Culture is still very useful and the policies are a bit easier to obtain allowing for a more uniquely built Civ. The victories for each affinity are somewhat similar, though each takes a slightly different focus. One being more production, another economic, an additional science based, another land based, and of course domination. There is also a very wide array of units, though it is mainly a focus on land units, the navy kinda gets shafted. The satellites makes up for aircraft, and are very useful. I love this game, but not so much for how well balanced or perfect it is, but for the shear amount of customization and unique ways to play that are all fairly viable. 

To summarize Beyond Earth allows for very heavy customization of all units and buildings and the Civ itself without as much focus on Civ to Civ interaction. The environment and where the game takes place are the main focus and how your colony develops.",1589390456,1589390456,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is fairly exciting due to being a ""new"" Civilization in most aspects, with different approach to trade and tech, as well as the affinities, which is interesting for, maybe 2 or 3 times maxing it out.
Unfortunately, there's more negative than positive.
The game lacks dynamics. I am not even sure what is the reason: there are hostile mobs, random stations, various biomes, but it is all so linear and predictable, hardly exciting.
The diplomacy and the affinities are somewhat different, but, again, way too predictable.
In the advanced age hardly anyone goes to war, because all wars are short-lived and brutal due to a huge disbalances in power, not much fun, really.

Got 85 hours of it before playing my other civs (bought 4-6 and this).. was hella addicted when playing. First play through - really hard. You dont know whats what, or what does what. So id say the learning curve is about 15 hours. Then you get into the 2nd game and you have a MUCH better idea of whats going on and what way to build and all that... 

Third game youre basically pro and you can up the speed so its not so tedious. At one point i was taking on 2 major powers that declared war on me and damn it was fun!

If you like any civ games, ignore pretty much all negative reviews and buy this (on sale of course) with xpac.

I heard its to do with excessive satellites. Theyre not really necessary in LARGE QUANTITIES (theyre basically win more by the time you are already investing in them) so just stick to maybe 5 solar, a few science / culture.. and if you want a couple laser ones. (the laser ones are literally just fun to use but basically garbage)

After I deleted some satellites and reinstalled... I had no issues.

Still, it does have a *few* of the features going for it, and it could be a passable 4x in its own right, if not for one major issue: diplomacy. Diplo is always tricky in 4x games, but there are a few glaring oversights that honestly make me wonder how they possibly could have been sent to live at any stage, much less still be in the game years later.

First, let's talk briefly about diplo in the base game:
Diplomacy is limited. Very limited. You can trade money (energy), money/turn, science/turn, and resources. You cannot trade technologies, cities, units. You cannot ban trade routes from being formed with you. All you can really control is whether you want to be friendly or not, and the AI will constantly ask you for freebies in exchange for Favors, which they are reluctant to cash out on. Overall, there are no major issues with this system, but it offers incredibly little in the first place, so it's hard to find ways it manages to fail at the very few things it does offer. It mostly feels tedious rather than useful.

Now on to Rising Tide:
The expansion comes with a complete diplomacy overhaul, and it's largely for the better. It's still relatively limited compared to other 4x games, but there are at least *some* significant interactions. There are now 5 statuses you can have (from Alliance to War), including the ability to have consistently open borders or to ban trade from the faction. You can increase relations if you are friendly enough with a rival faction, or if they are afraid of you - with simple indicators as to how they feel and how much more you require. It is a generally decent system, which is marred by a few massive game-breaking flaws. 

The first issue I personally ran into was the pseudo-""truce"" functionality. After a peace deal, you cannot declare war for the next (9) turns. Once a war is declared, the AI will refuse to negotiate until a certain length of turns passes, or a clear victor emerges. However, there is absolutely no truce time whatsoever for Alliances. This means, for example, that an ally could declare war on a powerful enemy which you *automatically* join because they are allied to you, and then immediately declare war on you. Why you don't even have the option to ditch the alliance to avoid war, I'm not sure, but there is absolutely no *universe* in which an alliance where you auto-join wars should *EVER* be able to be back-stabbed with a 0-turn delay. 

This is sadly not even the biggest flaw, which is the one that got me to write this review. That honor goes to the answer of the fairly obvious question of ""what would happen if my ALLY declared war on another one of my ALLIES?"" Do I get to pick which side to join? No. Then, perhaps I auto-join on the defending side? No. The attacking side?? No. Give up?
In fact, what happens is that you will automatically join a war... against everyone you are allied with. Even if that faction is not allied with EITHER the attacker or defender, you still are now at war with them, for because. What a fucking shit-show.

The mechanics are largely the same as Civ V or what have you, but obviously there are new variables and other fun stuff brought in to the mix.

What the game is lacking... are more civilizations (maybe some colonizing aliens would be cool), and/or more variables than the three paths you have to choose. I guess for that, you'd have to jump over to play Stellaris (which is a whole 'nother thing).

I have a feeling that what's currently available for BE is all we're going to get, until a newer take on this for Civilization is developed by Firaxis and 2K.

If none of this works, be ready to return the game (if you didn't spend too long trying to fix the issue with the game running).

After I got the game running:

It's fine, but not as refined as the full Civ 5 experience.

-Base gameplay is Civ 5 still, but Explorers (replacing Scouts) can now excavate sites like Archaeologists could in Civ 5 (but an unlimited number of times per unit after replenishing their modules at a city)
-Diplomacy is different and not very good in my opinion with other Civ's declaring war on you because you were mildly friendly toward another Civ and maybe lost some respect with them because they randomly weren't impressed with your new world wonder.
-Tech Web is a bit overcomplicated, but it's integrated pretty well with the new affinity system which basically replaces the ideologies from Civ 5 with a new system that allows you to get bonuses or to upgrade whole unit types upon leveling up any of the 3 affinities.
-Leaders are generic and completely unmemorable because it's no longer drawing from iconic historic figures which makes it much less interesting in my eyes (as a history buff). Others may not mind this though.
-Graphically, I prefer the atmosphere given off by Civ 5. This game always feels like it's taking place at night and is a bit dreary because of it. Civ 5 feels a lot more welcoming. Not to say it doesn't fit with the theme of the game, but it's a small nitpick I have anyway.
-Sounds are sometimes a bit unclear as to whether they denote a positive or negative thing. Music is nice though, as always.

If you're just getting into Civilization, buy Civ 5 Complete for the best way to get into the series.
If you're already a fan, this is a fine change of pace from Civ 5 but nothing sticks quite as well as it did in that game. 

I recommend it for people who have already played Civ 5 for a very long time and want something somewhat similar to that game but just a bit different. Otherwise, Civ 6 might be the better option.

With that out of the way, let's get to the meat of the review.

First off, Beyond Earth is based on Civ 5, the last of the 'old school' style Civ games. What I mean by that is before the District System that has been introduced in Civ 6, Civ games were less interesting overall visually. You've got your city, you've got your improvements, you've got the units going about, and that is about it in terms of map visuals. Everything is built in the city and outside the wonders, you don't see much of what you have built within the cities.

In addition, the engine has similar issues to Unreal in that it takes a while for the graphics to 'get to spec' and lags in terms of rendering landscapes (especially when a lot is going on in the 'background').

With that out of the way, the game plays like Civ 5, but in space. This is similar to how Alpha Centauri played, where it was Civ 2/Call to Power but in space. Both games also utilized unit customization but in different ways. In Alpha Centauri's case, it is an optimization process of armor, cost, abilities, and armament. In Beyond Earth's case, it is visual and combat style. You see, every time you improve your units, you have to choose from two combat perks and these perks tend to either shore up weaknesses, improve strengths, or add interesting advantages like improving strength with each adjacent unit.

Progression in Beyond Earth is what makes it stand out. Instead of simply tech progression, the game utilizes 'affinity' progression. There are three affinities: Purity (Humanity First), Harmony (fusing alien and human), and Supremacy (Uplifts). With Rising Tide you can hybridize two affinities near the end of the game. Each 'pure' affinity has a specific combat style. For example, Purity is all about firepower and durability while Supremacy is all about speed and flanking. 'Hybrid' affinities mix the two affinities while making their own spin on them, like purity-supremacy units tend to be something of both but with a focus on abilities (at least, that is how I got the most out of them). Each affinity has a resource specific (purity=Floatstone, harmony=Xenomass, supremacy=Firaxite) to it and their availability heavily determines on your affinity path.

This goes into the first complaint that people have when comparing it to Alpha Centauri: the factions feel all the same. The reason for this is due to each affinity requiring a specific resource, making factions set in stone in terms of affinity useless when there isn't enough of that resource to go around. Alpha Centauri never had this problem... although had others instead (broken Psi).

The complaints... don't have that much water when you actually look at the bigger picture mechanically... but people like to complain and rant and rave whenever things aren't to their spec or aren't 'pure' enough.

The game itself plays like Civ 5... and Civ 5 was back when 2 units per tile was a thing and before the vastly improved District System of Civ 6... and the 'old school' system of Civ has aged rather poorly. Then again, that system has been around for a better part of two decades by the time this game was released, with only a handful of upgrades to its credit. It is simple, but doesn't allow for striking visuals like the District System does.

The combat hasn't changed a bit since Civ 5 and, really, combat isn't the focus of a Civ game even though it is a major part of it. You've got your ranged units, you're melee units, your aircraft, and your naval units. Nothing much changed with those and plays a lot like Civ 5 in that manor...

Really, this is a good game for all its faults...",1584031121,1584031121,True,70,1,0.817301690578460693,5,True,False,False

The game isn't too close to Civ games, and so I find it unfair comparing it to the great Civ classics.

In the long run, the only thing Beyond Earth fell flat on, was replayability.  Once you're done, you're done.  No more new Civs with vastly different ways to play.  Once the game is over you're just kinda over it.

It's virtue system has 4 paths across Industry, Might, Prosperity, and Knowledge, and the the three affinities, Harmony, Supremacy, and Purity can be adapted to your own personal styles. As you increase your Affitinity you unlock upgrades to your units. With Rising Tide, cities can be built at sea and you can get hybrid affinities for each of your units. 

The technological researches are in a web starting from center out, and leaf technolgies under each of those branches. Game pace and setting can be changed from the advanced setup menu to allow for easier or tougher and shorter or longer gameplay. The advanced setup menu allows for some customazation of the map, allowing you to chose planetary age, biome, sea levels and more. 

As you play, you receive a variety of differing quests which impact the game in small ways, upon completion of them you can gain affinity, small bonuses to structures and sometimes resources. 

No one playthrough is ever the same as each map is randomly generated, and AI's respond according to the map and your actions throughout the game. The unique and stunning graphics, and amazing soundtrack make it that much more immersive and enjoyable.

The Diplomacy system is lacking and the AI is tough to negotiate with. With rising tide it the diplomacy system is slightly worsened. Quests, while they do provide bonuses, are virtually the same in every game just coming in a different order.

Upon original release this game received a great deal of flack for not being a remake of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and while it may share some ideas and concepts, it is not Alpha Centauri and is a very fine and enjoyable game on it's own with stunning graphics, good music, and fair amount of choice, and great deal of tactics and strategy.",1581619352,1581619352,True,4,0,0.556700229644775391,0,True,False,False

If you like Civ 5, this is a great sequel. In fact, I would go as far as to day that this game actually built on Civ 5 and without the encumbrance of having to stick to a linear chronistic tech ""tree"", has made significant improvements to the gameplay. For example, it's not the same old race for the same old wonders that Civ 5 generally revolves around, wonders have far less impact and specific wonders are not necessary for a specific victory type (except the handful of planetary wonders).  I also like being able to build wide without having to hamstring myself in terms of going for strong wonders or high tier buildings, which in Civ 5 would basically limit you to very few settlements as lower level buildings would have to be built in every settlement before you could begin construction (e.g. Oxford University). 

The affinity system is excellent and means the A.I. never lags too far behind militarily, rather they simply have a different ""flavour"" of troop types. The aliens (and miasma) are far superior to the Civ 5 barbarians and attacking them can have real gameplay consequences, especially in the early game. Tile improvements and population management in cities are much better in this game ... i have found myself keeping multiple workers constantly building until the very end of the game, unlike civ 5. The artefact system (and combination for unique rewards) and explorer units are a great addition too. Better than the rewards for scouting in Civ 5.

There are lots of other little touches (like starting perks & the diplomatic currency system) as well that I'm not going to list out, but taken together, really make for a refreshing and original take on Civ, and of course as it is based on Civ 5, it still looks beautiful too, and not like a crappy mobile game .....

It's well worth picking up in a sale (a bit pricey otherwise given it's age I think), and very enjoyable. I only wish it had been given a fairer innings when it first came out, and then maybe it would have had more DLC added over time, just like Civ 5 did.",1580248001,1580248001,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The tech tree is a circular web that extends out from the center. This gives you access to a lot of options early on, and it doesn't take long to get to some of the most fun mechanics of the civ games, like aircraft, carriers, tanks, etc, as well as some new things like various types of satellites.  It's also designed in a way that there's no way you'll finish researching all of the most expensive techs before the game is over, so it feels more realistic, with all civs having the same basic techs but each civ having unique specializations.

The game suffers from a few bad design choices, like your progress towards your victory condition is almost entirely reliant on your access to a particular resource.  You're going to pick which victory you're going after based on what resources are near you, and if you got lucky and there's a lot of one of them nearby, that makes a huge difference.  There's a few things like this that, over the long run, makes it an untenable game. It's reasonably good for about 40 hours, but after that these little design mistakes become deal breakers. I don't regret my purchase, but I love exploring unique mechanics in games, even if overall the game is not great.  Your millage may vary.

It's all a giant scam, 2k and the pic debacle should have been enough to turn you off 2k, but this will seal the deal buy it, spend 6 hours trying to find a fiz only to realise it's the same unfixed problem since 2014 and the game actually out right, simply won't run on a windows 10 pc even with compatibility.

On one hand it is an interesting take on Sid Meier's Civilization with ideas ranging from Contacting Alien life to become a hive mind. But then there is the actual gameplay.
It is a normal Sid Civilization affair where you, a leader of a people, will help them expand and grow from a fledging camp of lonely survivors to a grandios Colonial Empire. However, the elements that make the expansion of your empire interesting, is very flawed to say it politely. DO NOT HAVE ALLIES! They're a waste of time, or at least, only have one Ally (Prefferably the only person who is not at war with you). Two allies will cause the most retarded thing I have ever experienced in a game.
If for some reason, one of your Allies declares war on another Ally with yours, You go to war with both of them. Why? Because you're ally declared war on another player, so that means you are at war with that Player. However, because that player is also your ally, you also declare war on the player that had just declared war. So meaning, you are in a three way war, because for some reason, their is no way to decline the request of going to war (or at least joining one of your allies in the war), and the AI doesn't have any sense of the negatives and postives of going to war. Like why isn't there a system, that tells the AI, ""If you declare war on Player A, Player B (your Ally) could declare war on you."" and some calculation of economic, Technological, and Military Power comparison (Where the AI is given information about whether the player they are going to declare war on is Superior or inferior to them (Detering them or making them more likely to attack).
Making Peace is an AI only thing, with a warscore board. I like the idea of the war score board, as it has potential of making going to war more interesting, but there isn't trade or anything. If an AI is bargaining peace, you cannot give a counter offer, like they offer me cities all the bloody time, and by the point I am at war, I have about 12 Cities in my Nation, So I don't want anymore cities. I mean trade was a cool way of diplomacy. You have a captured an enemy city but you just captured it to end the war. Well you can't trade it back or anything. It's just so stupid with this lack of trade and diplomacy. It's really dreadful design.
Also fuck the Aliens in this game. They aren't quirky, they're just fucking annoying. At the start of the game that can fuck you hard, and hampering your progress. Or they'll destroy shit and just overall being a complete nuisance. And its not like they evolve with you like the Barbarians. I mean endgame level Aliens appear at anytime so, you could be trapped by an Alien worm or a Leviathan that is just killing all your explorers and troops. But you do eventually become god-tier creatures and just Nanking them out of existence.
But hey what about the positives.
Well, I find the Affiliation element, really cool, as well as the Unit Upgrades. They really do add a cool dimension to the game. Tech has a fantastic variety, where you can go in different ways to other players and have access to Tech that other players haven't got. Unlike normal Civ, Tech is not linear.
There are a lot of Wonders, Buildings and improvements that are pretty cool.
I didn't mind the personalty element of the game, but there are metas that just make the entire thing pointless.
But my favourite thing about the game was exploring. Where you can excavate Crashed Sattlites, bones of Creatures, Progenitor ruins and even crashed colony ships. It could have been done better, but i liked it nonetheless.
So do I like the game...Well strangely enough, yes. I still have fun with the game, and I do like the ideas that it has, even if they aren't done perfectly.
Would I recommend it...Well I would say no. Though I may like it. It has a lot of flaws, that are just too agregious to ignore. And it's current price of £29.99. FUCK NO! But if you aren't to fussy about the lack of diplomacy, and just want war to hearts content, or just because you think it might be interesting to play, then sure. But do wait till their is a discount like I did. Because £29.99 is just way too much for this game. I mean at least £15 or less.",1578677881,1578677881,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I thought after 3 years of launch and after several updates and expansion this game is worth buying with 75% discount. It wasn't expensive, but I did hope more, than getting bored after 40 hours of gameplay.
Started on Gemini difficulty (4/6) and jeez it was so easy. After a fast win I gave a try to Soyuz (5/6) but it was still too easy, only a few loaded game so continued with the hardest difficulty, Appolo. Well if anyone who is familiar to civ games it should NOT be an easy win, however unfortunately it wasn't even challenging. I just followed the enemy's affinity not to attack me and won the game without any fight.
Well this could have been a really good game, but still need some polishing (which won't happen I assume sadly)
pros:
- cool design and concept
- good new ideas (techweb, affinity, upgrades..)
- interesting storyline
- anyone who loves civ games should like this one too, but doesn’t feels like you get a whole new game after civ5


cons:
- not balanced stuffs

The Good:
I waited a long time for the game and had issues playing it initially. I have a new computer that is tailored more for gaming and it still can be frustrating waiting for it to load. That said, I feel like there was an attempt to make the nations customize able, but they really aren't as many options as I have come to enjoy from Civ games, but the additional aspects such as starting with pioneering does give you the ability to tweak things. The landscapes of the planet are beautiful and the different types of resources make for a nice effect. I like the explorers and what they add to the game. I also like the different ways the affinities affect unit progressions.

The Bad:
The aliens are tough for me to avoid. I get impatient and have to murder them, try as I might to be more of a Harmony affinity, ain't nobody got time for that. It can get a little bogged down mid to end game, but I just recently got back into the game so maybe I'll edit this again after a few more tries.

Conclusion:
It was an okay game in between Civ 5 and Civ 6, but if you missed it, don't feel like you missed a ton. It does really feel like a re-skinned Civ 5 that runs slower. The modding community really seems to make the game more enjoyable, so I recommend heading over there as well!",1417192492,1577839390,True,2,0,0.543859660625457764,0,True,False,False

The systems are somewhat close to civ 5-6, and there aint all that much difference between regular civ 5-6 and BE, but its enough for a few casual map rounds in a fresh and different enviorment.

All that said, dont expect a new game or fancy new mechanics, most of the time you will be hunting for specific tech or affinity points that unlock that magic +1 range to units, unless playing on a low difficulty level where its hardly needed.

Seeing as the difficulty level in BE is different from Civ 5-6 where even on the lower levels the AI actually put up some resistance, in BE it will hardly have 3+ cities after 100-200 turns on the first few levels of difficulty.

The creators went all out making a cool, immersive (if at times ridiculous) setting for the game, and since I’m a sucker for sci-fi it’s definitely my favorite of Civ installments. The Rising Tide DLC is a must. It adds and improves too much to be left out. Unfortunately, there are a few bugs here and there even after they released the DLC, and it’s clear the developers won’t be back to fix them. We do, however, have a fantastic community of modders that have released content on the workshop to fix bugs and improve balance and gameplay. Of course, mods preclude you from playing multiplayer, and even though the AI aren’t bad at higher difficulties they lack a certain style that only human players can boast. I should mention that the game is very combat-centric, as even the non-combat victories often incite other leaders to attack you to prevent the creation/activation of your game-winning wonders. But, with giant robots, hover tanks, and genetically engineered Godzilla-sized monstrosities to bring to bear on your foes, this is, in my opinion, not necessarily a bad thing.
     There are several features in the game that are very unpolished that I can easily gripe about. For instance, the diplomacy and trade systems are egregious, and the espionage system feels so separate from the rest of the game that rarely enjoy using it. That being said, there are features that really make this game shine. Unit upgrade choices, which allow customization of their capabilities as you progress, allow you to turn the basic classifications of units into specialized or versatile pieces of your army. The tech web system, a unique feature for a Civ game, is a fun addition to the game. While it lacks balance in some respects, with certain techs being clear choices while others are ignored entirely, there are a handful of mods that rebalance the tech web and tie in some of the more neglected branches and leaves. Finally, the affinity system was very well done, and remains my favorite part of the game. With the Rising Tide DLC, the affinity system lends itself to multiple playthroughs as you explore the bonuses, upgrades, and unit and structure unlocks littered throughout the game for the 3 main and 3 hybrid affinities.
     All in all, a shaky but certainly entertaining addition to the Civilization franchise that I still continue to enjoy from time to time. Rising Tide DLC is a must, and a visit to the Steam workshop is encouraged.",1576605097,1576605097,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Civilization in space? Amazing. I went ahead and came here, looked at the Steam page and it was full of negative reviews. Ended up pirating the game, because as far as I remember, the Steam refunds' system wouldn't give me back my money if I didn't enjoyed the game (any Civilization match last for more than 2 hours, the refund limit). So, I went from here to my favorite Torrent site and ended up downloading this game, had some fun, but it didn't struck me as really amazing.

A few months ago, in a sale, I saw this game again, with his DLC, for a few bucks, and ended up buying. Booted it up again, this time with the DLC/Expansion Pack on and ended up playing like 6 hours straight. Goddamn, what an amazing game. By this time, though, I knew what was missing back then on my pirated copy: the DLC. 

You see, with each and every Civilization game after III you must have the DLC/Expansion pack in order to have a complete game. So, for instance, you need Brave New World for Civilization V or otherwise it just feels incomplete. With the overhaul to the diplomacy system and the really good Naval cities (and the new sponsors) the game feels complete and a lot more fun than without it, feeling a lot more like a proper stand-alone game and not like a Civ V re-skin. This game is an absolute timesink, and it's great to have for those days the internet is down or you don't actually feel like dealing with other players in online games, since you wouldn't be able to play with anyone here, because no one plays on the multiplayer mode; which is really sad, because the game is just so good.

How come no one plays, you might ask? Well, people somehow believed this game was Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri 2, and this game is not that. Or actually, if it were Alpha Centauri 2, this is what it would be on this age. I've never played Alpha Centauri, but I do have plans to play it soon. I've heard many good things about it, and it does seem like it was an amazing game. But then again, this is a Civilization game, not an Alpha Centauri sequel.

What shines the most here is the OST, however. The game is really good, really fun, and you can easily play this through a whole night until the sun comes out again, some improper words leaving your mouth as you become conscious of the fact that you have to go to work/school/something and you didn't sleep. Going back to the OST, just listen to this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXgyqtED_50

Even if you didn't like the game, the OST is just marvelous. I've encountered many people who listen to the OST on a daily basis, yet haven't played the game a lot.

SMAC/AX is widely regarded as one of the best 4X games there is. It released in 1997, with it's expansion a year later in 1998. By modern standards it's very dated, so a sequel or spiritual successor is a wonderful idea. SMAC did a lot of things well, the civilizations were caricatures of elements of human society. The Spartan Federation are warlike, while the UN Peacekeepers are diplomats. The University of Planet were research heavy, while the Lord Believer's are hyper-religious. Every faction had a (rough) opposite faction, as well as factions that were similar. Beyond Earth doesn't go with caricatures, but rather nation-states like the other Civ games. I believe this is a misstep, as the factions of SMAC had a degree of character to them that the BE ""Sponsors"" lack. Polystralia and the North Sea Alliace are, despite mechanical difference, essentially the same. There are no real pre-existing rivalries and alliances. You have no reason to go ""oh those are the Morganites, fuck those guys."" You might think this adds variety, seeing as how your enemies will be different every game, but that isn't the case. In SMAC you'll be put in situation that might make you turn on an otherwise ideologically related country for resources, This forces you to weigh them as a potential long term ally, weigh their resources, and weigh them as an enemy. In BE your decided factor of whether they are an ally in the early game is strictly their resources. 

In both BE and SMAC you have an ideology that governs your faction. In SMAC you have the base ideology of your faction (religious, technocratic, pro-planet, profit driven, etc), and social engineering policies. You have 4 such policies: political, economic, social and future society. The base ideology dictates what you can and cannot choose. For example, the UN peacekeepers cannot become totalitarian, and the Human Hive cannot become democratic. This gives you some degree of customization of your faction within reasonable limits. In beyond earth you get affinity points as you research, with the affinities being Purity, Supremacy, and Harmony. Purity is human domination over the planet, while Supremacy is post-humanism, and Harmony being a meld of human and native life. Overall the BE system is pretty weak compared to the SMAC system, but personally I'd love to see a hybrid system where depending on your policies, buildings, and research you drift towards certain affinities, sort of like Hearts of Iron 3's alignment chart.

Speaking of research, each game does research differently. Both games have a techweb with branching, non-linear technology. BE is a bit more standard civ, where you choose what tech you want directly. The only real difference between BE and civ V is BE has ""branch"" and ""leaf"" technology. Branches progress you along the tech web, while leafs are sub techs that don't lead anywhere. In SMAC you don't have leaf techs, and cannot directly choose what to research. You can research in multiple ""fields"" or narrow it down, a narrow approach is better for finding a specific tech, while casting a wide net lets you get a good variety. Personally, I feel this is one of the things BE does better.

In both games you can customize your units to some degree. In Beyond earth you get semi-linear upgrades based on your affinity, as well as affinity specific units. In SMAC you unlock different parts, chassis (helicopter, rover, tank, person, etc), weapon, armor, reactor, and special ability. As you tech up you unlock different upgrades in both systems. As you rank up in affinity you can upgrade your units, at first they're affinity-neutral, but over time they become affinity specific, with the tank becoming a Lev tank with the Purity affinity, which makes it ignore terrain. In SMAC the upgrades are a bit less linear, with certain equipment being side-grades at higher techs. Like i said in paragraph 2, I would love a hybrid system where you have a unit designer, with affinity-specific parts.

A common theme with both games is the Native life of the planet. BE has miasma, and SMAC has xenofungus. Both can spread of not properly managed. In SMAC mind worms and other native fauna can appear in xenofungus and attack your unit psionically. Personally, I love the psionic element to SMAC, where it's not your units strength that matters, but their morale. This means that you'll want veteran units dealing with the natives, while greener ones fight humans. In BE they developed this aliens vs humans element a bit more and merged it with barbarians, with the aliens having a relationship with you. If you leave them alone they'll be friendly, but with repeated attacks they'll become more hostile. Aliens spawn from nests, which you can destroy, similar to how barbarian encampments worked in V. I really love the choice both games give you with regards to how to deal with the natives: you can adapt and live in harmony or you can destroy them and terraform the planet for humanity's sake. I wish the Psionic factor was brought into BE's aliens, giving us physically week enemies we have to deal with psionically, or physically strong enemies that are resistant to psionics. Overall either system is a welcome addition, even though I wish the ""humans and aliens""dynamic was expanded on.

BE and SMAC both have ""little things"" about them that I like, for example you can construct a mine or solar farm on top of a normal farm, with a road running through it in SMAC. In BE you have the more modern trade mechanic between cities, as well as territorial growth. In SMAC cities don't grow their influence, but they do have a mechanic BE is lacking: drones. Drones are unhappy pops that don't produce resources but still take food. You can nerve staple them (an atrocity), or increase police presence. 

Overall SMAC is clearly the better game, but BE does some stuff better. As it stands, Beyond earth feels like an imitation of SMAC/AX that didn't quite understand what made it good. (The writing, mostly). If Firaxis release a Beyond Earth 2 or Alpha Centauri 2 that brings the games together, while also introducing newer mechanics like districts I'll be very happy. As it stands, Beyond Earth feels like an alpha version of a SMAC sequel. Lacking many mechanics that the original had, while improving somewhat on other things. I wish Firaxis didn't abandon this game after it's first major expansion as it had some serious potential, but alas we'll have to wait for another attempt. I just hope SMAC's social engineering and unit designer mechanics are mixed with BE's affinity mechanic, and the alien life gets more developed. Personally, if BE is on sale I'd say pick it up, as well as SMAC on GoG. BE isn't a great game, but it's still worth playing; even if to see the wasted potential it had.",1550469996,1575882389,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Totally unbalanced: do you think the AI cheated too much on emperor, immortal to deity in Civ5? think again!

in short:
- lazy
- AI is further OP than civ5 to compensate the half baked product
- resource system shallow
- growth system shallow and limited
- terrible UI
- nice diversification, badly implemented, you don't feel it until late.
- ok aliens i guess.

not recommended




in detail:

COMBAT:

On a simple vostok difficulty the unbalance between your unit maintenance and the AI's is seriously stupid. (i couldn't play deity on civ 5, maybe i won once, immortal was my challenge and emperor my standard).

i.e.: early war, 3 cities each faction, i can only support 3 gunners, couple of marines and 2 jets otherwise i'll go on serious negative gold and be forced to dismiss. here comes the AI with an endless supply of troops, no gold required MUCH more than civ5. and because cities are made up of paper you will be wiped out in like 5 turns.

their personality is straight stupid. some folks like the ""sci fi british"", indians and ARC are ALWAYS crappy.
you will basically face a traitor PAC, an aggressive slav and brazil and an indecise african guy. THAT'S IT.

diplomacy is more useless in BE because of the mandatory unbalance of the factions you can't actually ""play the game of thrones"" because the crappy ones will chicken out/be ineffective and the asians + slavs will just invade you with cheats. so basically you can determine a game by how you land on the planet. near polystralia or the indian lady? nice landing! PAC next to you? restart the game.

the promotion system is just lazy. only heal and +strenght. no diversification, no tactic depending on the situation.
troops are more or less the same, there is no real diversification until very late.
this result also turns out comic like the supremacy artillery which is the only mid-term ranged with 3 hex range. soooo a supremacy player has artillery and the others... no. lol. it also has high ranged strenght, so your NOT UPGRADABLE basic troops will die instantly in an attack.
(air combat is seriously nerfed. you only have jets to start with that are ok strong but have a stupid range, so you basically end up using them defensivly.)

aliens:
because the AI is OP, and can have as many troops as it wants, aliens are not really a treat to the AI. i.e. you can stumble upon a kraken and bye bye your 10 turns boat, while the AI will spam another 5 in no time.



GROWTH AND RESOURCES:

the health system is meh, really MHE and the resources seems all the same. production, food, bit of science, even tho there is ""fungus"", ""fruit"", ""fiber"", ""this and that"". it's just scenery, no real tactic involved. there is no lux, ok, but then they still added things like copper, gold,... and paired them with some MHE build perk or tech perk. no great person makes specialists a second-hand resource.



APPEARANCE: 

the overall skin of the game makes you feel unaware of what you are doing. everything is blu-ish, no real wonder artwork, no real icons, everything is like a blueprint. you can't really tell what is what unless you pay that extra 1/2 sec to double check, on an already long game to play.



the only PRO i found is the tech web, which COULD result in a non linear advancement: so let's say you want to be militaristic and have an early big troop, which are all KINDA different. problem is you need affinity. so you kind of try to get ahead, but no really. you'll never have a massive tech-advantage resulting in very good troops.
it's also confusing, because (SURPRISE) of the color scheme.

just to clarify: my last match was kinda perfect. i had a portion of land up north, a long orizontal mountain range divided me with PAC and slav guy, aliens and miasma in the middle. i was top score, not too bad army. if you have played civ you know that with chockes and mountain you can hold up with 1 archer and a shit thrower.
*bum* double war declared and the sheer amount of invading troop just kamikazed throu the miasma, the alines, the 2 choke points like a trench assault and arrived in my cap in 10 turns SURROUNDING the city.

no, just no.

If you're familiar with Civ 5, It's like playing a huge mod for Civ 5.
About as much as playing Fall From Heaven from Civ 4.
Okay, appanrently you can't talk about this game without mentioning even more Civ games.
Let's try, though.

Okay. Civilization: Beyond Earth is a turn-based 4X (Explore, Exploit, Expand, Exterminate) set on an alien planet.
All the players are the leaders of a number of colony ships that were sent to the planet (which is covered in indigenous alien wildlife) in a bid to escape an overpopulated dying earth. The backstory for how the game's setting comes up is important.
Because as you play the game, you get to adopt a number of Affinities that each represent a different attitude to this alien world. Which will be reflected in changing your gamestyle to some degree, giving you visually distinct units and cities and giving you a unique victory condition.
There are four different victories that, I'll admit, come down to building a high-tech building and protecting it while you fulfill a secondary condition. (There's also still the Kill Everyone Else Victory)

The thing there is that each of those victories has a much greater narrative flavour.
And narrative is a big thing in Beyond Earth, because the game is filled with Quests.
Most of the quests are as simple as ""what extra thing does this building do?"" or ""Build 3 Orbital Units"".
BUt each one has some great writing for the question, and more for whatever decision you make.
Each World Wonder and Tech come up with a little sci-fi quote written for the setting, and the in-game ""civilopedia"" has some great and not-insignificant writing for each unit and building and ... anything else, really.

It's a 4X strategy game on a dangerous planet, much like other Civilization games.
But it also an awful lot of story and choices (for a non-campaign 4X), unlike other Civilization games.
The DLC is also, like a lot of other Civ games, a very solid upgrade that brings a whole lot to the game that would not have been amiss in the actual game in the first place.
it adds moving sea-based cities for one.
It's a good game. It adds a lot to the Civ series by taking a somewhat more narrative path, but is also a good solid turn-based 4X with good systems and pretty maps.",1573557016,1573557016,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly the poor reception it received means we'll probably never see another like it, though this is admittedly their fault.  The original release was full of good ideas that were implemented poorly.  The Rising Tide expansion, while very good, should NOT have been an expansion.  It should have been a patch.  Rising Tide mostly just took the half-thought concepts and half-finished mechanics of the base game and turned them into properly fleshed-out ones.  

The game also suffers from lackluster under-the-hood polish due to how quickly the company gave up on it.  This takes two forms.  The first is a minor annoyance related to the mods.  Mods which affect unit actions in any way require that you load your chosen mods, then back out to the mod selection screen and load them a second time.  The second is a graphical issue.  A particularly ""busy"" map (lots of tile improvements, miasma, units and algae on-screen) will suffer from flickering.  It's nothing game-breaking since it's limited to the map, itself, and ""fixed"" by zooming in a bit but it can still be annoying (particularly if you focus on Harmony, which makes use of the miasma and thus benefits from spreading it).

In short, I recommend this game but *only* if you buy Rising Tide with it.  A review of game features follows.

-----

Above issues aside, I can name a few positive features this game has that other Civ titles could stand to adopt.  Chief among these is the affinity system.  In short, affinities describe your approach to developing your society on the new world.  These are Supremacy, Harmony and Purity.  

--Supremacist societies slowly forsake the flesh in favor of cybernetics and artificial intelligence.  They have far and away the best energy (money) income and most of their units benefit from networking in the form of adjacency bonuses in combat.  Supremacist tech eventually leads to the creation of powerful AI units geared towards holding or breaking defensive positions.  Supremacy typically favors conquest-based strategies.

--Harmonious societies choose to adapt themselves to their new world, gradually altering their own genetics to better fit in with and eventually take advantage of their new environment and the native lifeforms of the planet.  Harmony typically has the easiest time maintaining a healthy society and consequently tends to expand faster than the others.  Most Harmony units gain significantly increased combat abilities when fighting in the native miasma.  Later Harmony tech grants the ability to train local lifeforms for military use.  These are quite fast and mostly geared towards rapid kamikaze attacks to do area-of-effect damage to the enemy upon death.  Harmony typically favors expansionist strategies.

--Puritanical societies revere Earthly humanity and shun any kind of contamination of that ideal, be it biological or cultural.  Where Harmony seeks to become one with the new environment and Supremacy seeks to simply transcend such concerns outright, Purity seeks to conform the new world to itself.  To this end, Purity units tend to be bulky and durable and benefit from more defensive buffs and special abilities.  Later Purity tech often focuses on large, powerful units capable of holding their own when defending against multiple opponents and sports the most ranged units.  Purity typically favors ""turtling"" strategies for outlasting your opponents in the long game.

Rising Tide introduces numerous ""hybrid"" units that ostensibly take advantage of the strengths of two affinities at once.  Unfortunately these hybrid units tend to be somewhat niche in their uses and, while sometimes useful, don't typically represent any recognizable traits of their two affinities.  They have their applications and they look pretty nice but they don't really serve as the bridges that they're supposed to be.

Something that was actually present in the base game but cut out by Rising Tide was a sort of diplomatic credit system.  The original release of the game feature a diplomacy system much like Civ 5 (small wonder since the game is basically just an official total conversion mod for Civ 5).  A new addition to this, however, was the favor system.  This system addressed the eternal issue of Civ AIs being utterly unreasonable diplomats and traders by allowed you to gather enough ""favors"" to essentially force the AI to do its part.  Perhaps you routinely supplied them with needed resources and defended them from a more powerful foe when they were weak and now [i]you're[/i] the one being assaulted.  In any other Civ title, the AI would laugh and tell you to get fucked if you asked for help.  In pre-RT Beyond Earth, if you had enough favors you could cash them in and [B]make[/b] the AI live up to its end of the bargain.

While it's a shame that this favor system was so short lived, the new diplomatic exchange & trade systems are quite interesting, themselves.  For starters, you no longer directly trade resources via diplomacy.  Instead you establish trade routes between your cities and theirs and any resources present naturally flow between the two.  It makes the establishing and defense of trade routes much more important.  Diplomacy, itself, is also a very different beast from past games.  Some of this is due to simplification, such as things like border issues being rolled into your general diplomatic status with another player, while the rest is due to new systems entirely.  By and large, you now have three primary concerns: traits, diplomatic capital and respect & fear.

--Traits apply broad bonuses to your society or actions.  Each sponsor (civilization) has one inherent trait which is unique to it and which it starts the game with.  Beyond this there are three categories of optional traits and you may choose one trait from each, purchasing them with diplomatic capital.  Traits may also be improved twice by spending increasing amounts of DC on them, and if a trait is no longer useful then DC may be spent to replace it with a new one.  Furthermore, traits grant you access to various treaties you may sign with other leaders, granting them bonuses in exchange for per-turn payments of diplomatic capital.  The bonuses these treaties grant become more powerful if you're openly cooperating with the recipient and even more powerful, still, if you're officially allied.  And finally, the AI's traits partially determine their values.  An AI player with a lot of espionage-related traits, for instance, will think more highly of a player who possess a lot of spies and uses them regularly, or an AI with a lot of scientific traits will respect a player with high science income.

--Diplomatic capital, in addition to its aforementioned use in the purchase of traits and securing of treaties, can also be used to purchase units & buildings.  The cost to do so is considerably higher than the cost to purchase them via energy but at the very least this ensures that DC doesn't become useless in the late game.

--Respect and fear are the new opinion modifiers.  Basically the more you have in common with a society, the higher its respect will be while the more your military surpasses theirs, the higher their fear will be.  Respect can be harder to build depending on the AI's traits and dominant affinity but is typically stable.  Fear is easy to build via a rapid, large military buildup but will fall just as quickly as the AI moves to mach you.  Either score can be used to secure diplomatic deals, however, so for short term goals fear can be sufficient.

Finally, there's the aliens.  In Beyond Earth, Aliens fill the role of barbarians from previous games but with a twist: they're not unthinkingly hostile.  If you keep your distance from their nests and don't attack them, they'll usually leave you alone.  They can even become friendly over time.  Provoke them enough, though, and they'll not only go on the offensive but also bring some very large friends along, too.",1572728151,1572734879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is greatly improved with rising tides which is the DLC. The DLC fixes the diplomancy which is awful in the base game, and trade convoys are much more important. Also the DLC balances out the branch in the tech tree, and allows for pretty powerful hybrid units, which are a blast to have. The game is still flawed.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ It's Civ. It plays like Civ. This shouldn't even be up for question, but I spent so long talking about the unique points that I forgot to mention that it's still Civ at heart.
+ Makes the affinities feel different. You know how in Stellaris almost every single civilization feels the same because the make the same power plants, mining installations, ships, etc? In CivBE, your units (and even improvements around your cities!) are going to be different based off what affinity you research. Do you build satellites that add miasma (because you get a bonus for being in it) or do you build satellites that remove miasma (because being in it hurts your units)?
+ Units can embark at start. You're in space, so you don't need to research boats to swim in. This opens up the map in a huge way from the very beginning.
+ Don't worry about feeling like you're not exploring, though, there's quests that encourage you to seek out special tiles across the entire world, and the world will not feel boring because instead of finding new ways to explore an old world, you're using old ways to explore a new world.
+ Artifacts and Quests. Another great way to encourage exploration. It's not as detailed as the quests and artifacts from the Endless games, but this was a very welcome inclusion in the Civ franchise. Quests can be random based on technology, buildings, exploration, and biome.
+ The map opens up later on with floating units that can go over all terrain (water and canyons included) and the satellite layer that can do all kinds of stuff.
+ The satellite layer is cool. Anything from resource bonuses to teleportation (formerly airdrops) to giant space lasers is available.
+ Units upgrade automatically based off affinity level. This lets you specialize your units since you pick one of two bonuses each upgrade, gives your play-through a distinctive flavor, and does away with the annoying need to bring units back home and pay to make them usable. While each of the base units are the same, a Harmony cruiser plays differently from a Purity cruiser, and all of the affinities encourage different types of military tactics.
+ Technology research is a web with stems-and-leaves rather than a linear path. This is probably the biggest mechanical difference from any other Civ game, and one that I've come to appreciate very much. In normal Civ, you understand that researching ""writing"" lets you build Libraries, but in CivBE, you research Genetics, which unlocks the Cytonursery and Pharmalab and unlocks the Cognition and Genetic Design Branch technologies, as well as the Alien Lifeforms and Genetic mapping Leaf technologies. And it also grants you Harmony affiliation points. That makes no sense because you don't know what any of those mean, which is where the game primarily stumbles, but it makes technology research feel like much more of a meaningful choice.
+ Flavor is very cool. There's a library of sci-fi history to read through if you care. Most notable in the wonders, which may at first make no sense as to why they are wonders, but they turn out to be things like ""the most powerful rail gun ever created which shoots liquified slugs of copper into orbit"" or ""a network of lights underneath your floating city that's powerful enough to induce photosynthesis in the deep ocean.""
+ Trading system is based on political capital exchanges which provide you with civ-wide bonuses instead of paltry resources. You get resources with trade caravans, you talk to other civs for much more important deals. What a breath of fresh air.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Not really worth playing without the expansion.
- The flavor learning curve is pretty steep as you learn what the Armasail is and why you should research Tissue Engineering if you want to go to combat.
- There's only two ways to win: kill everyone, or tech up to a certain level, build a thing, and complete that thing's quest. It may seem different, but it plays out in broadly similar strokes. No cultural or political victory here, it's all science victories. 

[h1]Meh[/h1]
? The AI isn't incredibly bright. Not too dumb, but I think it doesn't understand naval battles and under-utilizes air units.
? Each building comes with an inherent upgrade that happens after the building has been built. It's always a choice of ""benefit a"" versus ""benefit b"" but I always tended to choose the same one. The intention for this mechanic is to customize each play-through, but for me it was almost always a non-choice. I like that this mechanic exists, but it doesn't seem to do what I think it wanted to.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Does more things right than wrong, and really a shame the great things from this entry are forgotten by the franchise. You cowards, give me my meaningful tech web, interesting trading, differentiated civilizations, and quest system.

I had this wishlisted anyway since the trailers, screenshots and *stated* features still appealed to me, but finally bought this recently after I ran dry of all the other Sci-fi/colonization games ahead of this on my list and was still itching for a space colonization game.

If you came here seeking Alpha Centauri (SMAC), you'll be utterly disappointed. I replayed Alpha Centauri about 5 years ago and its amazing how well a game with great design and depth of detail can age over all these years.

If you came here looking for just a space colonization game, this isn't that great either, unless you're a very amateur gamer, simulations don't appeal to you, and just wanted make-believe space-flavored 4X game that appeared complex at first but actually extremely simple and shallow.

Pros:
- Great graphics and music. Its cosmetically well presented.
- Interesting take on technology research. I might even say it was inspired, but the execution felt incomplete, and the way it is introduced to the player makes it appear very overwhelming. It certainly didn't help that there is no zooming available so you are forced to scroll around what LOOKED like a massive tech tree/web but actually isn't that bad at all.
- Same old Civ/Alpha Centauri's playstyle if that's your thing.
- If you can get past the APPEARANCE of complex game mechanics, its actually a very simple stress-free game suitable for casual gaming. (It plays like a mobile game)

Cons:
- It plays like a mobile game. This is probably the best we can expect out of any game made after 2010.
- It lacks personality and flavor. Despite the well rendered/animated characters and actually hiring native speakers for each language to act the characters, all characters are completely bland, generic. The AI differentiates their preferences like a robot with an on/off switch. They feel NOTHING like SMAC's Lady Deidre, Sister Mariam, Colonel Santiago, Brother Lal, Chairman Yang, Prof. Zakharov, and CEO Morgan, who each have unique dialogues and clear personalities in how they interact with you politically.
- It lacks substance. All political interactions are just buff/debuffs, there's no social engineering tradeoffs like SMAC where you have to carefully plan for what's the best policy suited for your current situation. Any kind of ""Customization"" ins CivBE is permanent, straightforward, and designed in such a way that you don't really ahve to put much thought into it, hence why I say its more fitting for casual gamers who wants to pretend to be hardcore. This might actually be the first desktop game I've played that I might consider ""Midcore"", but not a very good one.
- There's no sense of progression. In SMAC you can clearly feel time elapsing and the planet fighting back, harmonize or dominate it. In CivBE its just 300 turns of I have another city. I have another unit. I have another improvement. Oh, now I have to war with X that i could've curb stomped 150 turns ago but didn't want to b/c reasons, because I maxed on Harmony affinity and triggered the ""DESTROY HUMAN PLAYERS!"" switch.

It's not a complete waste of digital space, and since Sci-Fi is still a relatively small genre if you've already finished other games and are still itching for more space-themed strategy games it can still give you a nice hit. It's absolutely not worth the full price of $59.99 for the set.

Beyond Earth is full of content, and it sell worth an exploration. Don't get me wrong, if you were choosing this and Civ 6 or 5 get those two. I really like Civilization 5 and still play it to this day, I'm waiting on Civ 6's expansions to cheapen before really taking the plunge into Civ 6. I have played Civ 4 extensively and started playing with Civilization 3.

How Beyond Earth differentiates itself is in the way it approaches a few mechanics:
- End Game goals being tied to 'affinities' which are essentially unlocks and upgrade paths for units.
- Beyond Earth also takes barbarians (aliens) and makes them interesting, this plays alongside two of the affinities and is a welcome twist.
- Tech tree is more flat with the system of branches and leaves. Leaves essentially are additional techs you unlock that don't block tree progression. The choices are numerous and require some strategic thought.
- Story based mechanics that tie into ruins and also relics that further customize your civilization with additional powers.
- Diplomacy is less opaque than in older titles, if I remember correctly they took this approach forward with the Civ 6, less fleshed out here.
- Lots of leader customization
- A boring overlay that adds another layer of resource management with satellites.

The rulers themselves don't stand out, but they didn't in Civilization 4 or 5. I personally like gameplay over that aesthetic tack-on.

Should it have been DLC? Maybe? It's actually pretty big and the visuals are 100% different and WAY prettier, so I personally don't think so. 

People complain there's no units, there's 12 units that are all upgradable to 5 different units, meaning theres over 50 units!

People complain about the city building, If you don't spec right in the research then you're gunna have a hard time. Just read what it says, I've had zero issues, it's just not nearly as fast paced and doesn't throw 6 new buildings at you every time you research something. The game requires TIME and LOTS of resorces.

People complain about the other leaders, Here, you are correct. They are boring, but they're really not designed for the core of the gameplay, it's more of you to focus on not getting destroyed by aliens that spawn 6 people right outside your door every 10ish turns, and they actually BUILD armies that you HAVE to defend against, even on the easiest setting most people throw 6-10 units at you instead of civ v where it's like 2 or 3 at MOST.

People complain about the research tree, Are you serious? Over 200 researchable things and that's a problem for you? I see people who have over 300 hours in this game and STILL don't understand what most things do, it's not that complicated... Again it's not civ v, it's not streamlined for children. You NEED to pay attention, you NEED to read, and you NEED to make sure you're doing/getting what you need at the time and not just ""Oh I guess I'll get this"". 

The game requires more sit down time than normal civ games, even on quick pace this games long. You don't fly through an era in 50-100 turns (Depending on game speed). Your era's are your research and the more you dick around and put your research into things you don't need, the harder the games going to be.",1563595530,1563595530,True,19,1,0.627467811107635498,2,True,False,False

What I do see is how CIV6 was developed from.  Once you get past the novelty of the new bits and the eye candy which at first seem refreshing, it becomes an onslaught of futurism and concepts. Then there are side missions and you feel like you're playing monopoly on a board that has 6 chance landings.

The interface is okay, once you get used to it, terrain isn't easily distinguishable at times. The ""leaders"" are just...boring (they lack personality.), the units are boring as well, esp. since you don't really get new ones, you can only upgrade the ones you have, once you have enough points in one affinity or another. Speaking of which...the affinity system is interesting, but ultimately boring as well imho. Beyond Earth just lacks...""charm"" and interesting systems imho. It's serviceable, but never really good, and instead of ""just one more turn"" I felt like ""oh, one more turn, ugh"". It's just so ""meh""...

Even fighting the aliens gets boring halfway through a match, because you just need 1 or 2 ""Armor"" units to steamroll the alien resistance. Even the basic infantry are getting very adept at that. At least this is the first Civ game no enemy civ has declared war on me within the first few minutes of gameplay. :D

Even with Rising Tide it just didn't grab me.

Plus, there've been a lot of issues to get this game even running again. Verify integrity, download drivers...uninstall all mods (even if you're playing without them there was a graphical map bug, and the game was unplayable), it permanently locked up my whole computer (and no, I don't have a weak machine). I finally got it running after 2 hours or so, and decided I'd run it in windowed mode (no borderless of course...and you can't even change THAT during a match, no, you have to go back to the menu and the load times are terribly long). After about 6 or so hours I just didn't feel like playing anymore. I wanted a science victory, but after having met those prerequisites the game suddenly decided it needed something more for me to win, something, which would have prolonged the boring match I was playing by another 5 hours...(from 5 affinity to 15 in harmony...to then build a wonder that makes you win...ah, fuck this. It follows no logical path).

And what is it with the CONSTANT leader notifications and ""advice""? You can't deactivate the former, so you have dozens of ""ping"" sounds every few seconds...and you can only completely deactivate the latter...thank you game, you don't need to remind me every few turns about trade routes...

I did enjoy the quest system though, gave you something to do, even though it's bloody RNG at times and makes no sense (the same ""quest giver"" wanted me to simultaneously destroy a neutral outpost AND establish trade relations with that same outpost I was supposed to destroy...yeah.).

As a sucker for hard sci-fi, the lore and backstory, lovingly crafted wonder, unit, alien, and building codex entries lend a life to this game that I feel lacks somewhat in the more historical versions. I find the negative stigma around this game to be deeply disappointing and firmly believe that this game would have been nearly perfect if the team had a second major DLC green lit.

Things I like:
- Well thought out progression paths that seem, at least to the setting, very realistic and make a lot of sense
- Generous amounts of well written lore entries for just about everything in the game.
- Beautiful graphics and soundtrack (As a brief aside, the art direction in Civ6 was a huge disappointment)
- A variety of different faction/planet specific mechanics and quests that add a lot to the replayability
- Unique unit upgrade and Affinity system

Things that needed improvement:
- Many of the quests have two/three choices and one of them is usually far superior to the others so after some time spent playing, you just know what to pick.
- Game feels slightly rough around the edges, probably as a result of not receiving a second big expansion.
- Hutuma is broken and makes it very easy to out compete even the hardest difficulty AI due to the way internal trade routes work in the game.
- A few of the victory conditions are orders of magnitude more easy than the others.

I have played Beyond Earth: Rising Tide, 618 hours of my life and am ready to give my review of it. The pros of this game are the immersive storyline and gameplay, the exquisite and powerful creativity that went into the game, the really balanced and challenging artificial intelligence, and lastly, the beautiful graphics. The major cons of the game would include that it lacks the same balance when you are playing on landlocked maps as when you are playing land/ocean maps because the artificial intelligence lacks the capacity to wield armies of ocean faring and land faring units well enough for synergistic land / sea attacks. I also will criticize the technology tree's outer-most technologies for not being proportionally useful to their costs and giving us a character that's overly broken, named Hutama. 
But anyways, I'm someone who prefers to play games on their hardest available difficulty. I think that the AI in this game is sufficiently powerful to pose a challenge that can keep a person interested, but on top of that, what makes this my favorite civilization game, and one of my favorite games of all time is the immersive experience that they created with their story line. The way they make it about coming from Earth, settling a new planet, having the whole planet to yourself while staggering the other leader's later arrival, and ESPECIALLY by giving you the opportunities to explore and create expeditions for useful artifacts is all just so beautifully done. I really admire the graphics and the way the workers look. I love that in order to master the game I eventually had to make every worker do what I wanted to and even manipulate which tiles the citizens would work sometimes. 
If you want to know the value of this game, divide the base price by over 600 hours and calculate that for entertainment. Also, if you want some tips from an expert: Start aristocrats, a worker, and always use Hutama if you really want to win but haven't been able to at the difficulty you've picked.",1560128869,1560128869,True,9,1,0.561828076839447021,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed this game. Usually in Civilization I just go for the 'Victory' and conquer everything in sight if I can, feeling not much incentive to engage in diplomacy or even trading. This game feels more like a race but the backstory does make me feel more inclined to engage in diplomacy, trade and peace in general.
The different affinities you can pursue which range from what feels to be a right wing, conservative 'Purity', to the adapt'ing', pragmatic best of all worlds 'Supremacy', to the atapt'able' symbiotic 'Harmony' - give the game a lovely twist on the Civilization model which is in keeping with the story line. 
    I think the 'Rising Tide' expansion pack makes the game an even more interesting departure from Civlization V - however at the same time it also radically changes how diplomacy works in both positive and I think unnecessarily negative ways. It got me engaged in diplomacy, but then I found actions that I wanted to do which I had previously ignored appeared to have been removed from the mechanics of the game. If you haven't yet but are thinking of trying Beyond Earth then you should definitely get the 'Rising Tide' expansion pack which makes the game quite different overall for the clear better. I have found that you might quickly want to make the game more challenging and slow the pace for a larger map, as the resources were too plentiful on my last play through. The balance feels a bit off in that respect after Rising Tide.
    It's a bit late now, and its doubtful I would have made the difference but I feel it's a bit of a shame that I didn't support the game earlier. I might like to have seen more DLC content to expand the story line and the biomes and the technologies. That said maybe it becomes a bit difficult to make such things add up to much more than skins and trivial changes to stats.
    I would like to have seen more exotic and exclusive environmental challenges mixed up together within single maps, with units and even city improvements fairing drastically differently outside of their optimisation.  

I would like to see a turn based game like this, confined to the planetary scale, but with a strong city builder/resource management element to it. This would really bring out the challenge of the alien environment.",1558180212,1558180701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is not really a story, its basically humanity failed to Earth and went to an alien world to start over. This isn't a generic future thing, this is a specific type of alien world, which varies based on your settings. What I mean is, the aliens work the same way and there will be poisonous clouds everywhere.

No advanced start options (unless i'm blind), and i'm so sick of starting over. The endgame doesn't seem so balanced, as when you end wars or take over someone you can get their techs, and thus super speed thru affinities and get super units instantly. Even still some units don't seem to be good at their job when they haven't advanced for awhile, and sometimes overpowered when they just did. Also didn't like how boats were so dominant and land units so secondary (unless on land maps of course). Also embark speed mod makes game better (3-4 tiles is fine).

Especially with the expantion (Rising Tide) this game really brings about a filling of the fresh start on a faraway planet. The lore is rich, the atmosphere is gorgeous, and it brings all the right fillings when you sit to play on a quiet evening. With that being said, to the pros and cons. 
+++++++ Music. It is just outstanding and feels elevating, helps to disconnect from grim reality and dream about the greatness of the future.
+++ Graphics, especially the nature and basic affinity units. Game feels polished and well-designed, even though sometimes it lacks veriety.
+++ Lore, philosophy and ideology behind the game. As any Civ game, this one brings with it it's own message. A strong message about ecology, human society and consumarism. But it also lets you feel the glory of technological sinergy and imperialistic purity, which in my opinion are the only sencible ideologies in real world and in sci-fi. 
+ The leaders are beautiful and changing with the rising Affinity level giving fuel to imagination and just being eye-candy :D

- Lack of clarity. The terrain is not distinct and therefore sometimes leads to stupid mistakes. 
- Eventual animation bugs and minor grafical glitches, for example - units being stuck in one another. 
-- High level of random. The behavior of the aliens, the random missions, the landmarks and artifacts (expantion) - all that can be either extremely in your favour or ruin your development a lot.
---- Diplomacy. Especially with Rising Tide, the Alliences are NOT recommended - othervise, you get automatically pulled to wars with all of your ally's enemies. Even worth, if your ally decides to go to war with your other ally - during some of my playthroughs the world collapsed into Battle Royalle with AI declaring war on each other and bringing all theit allies with them. 
------ Balance. As I've said, sometimes Artifacts can be quite broken, but even more so are Affinities. On higher levels of difficulity all AI starts with 1/1/1 points in their affinity trees, which means if you're unlucky they will just steamroll you with their superior units. There is no way to upgreat your army without upping the affinity level, so sometimes you can quickly fall behind in the arms rase.

Now don't get me wrong, in comparison to CIV 5 this game is simpler and in some areas (like diplomacy) worse; however, I love this game because it is a middle-ground. Yes it is simpler but that's it's strength. I grew up playing Civilization Revolution on the 360 (I know I know) and I loved that game back in the day. Beyond Earth feels like the evolution of that simpler Civ game. Beyond Earth works not because it's very complex or has tones of different options and possibilities, it works because it doesn't have all the excess. Now don't get me wrong, if your a long time Civ fan this game probably isn't worth picking up. It is only really a dumb down Civ 5 with cooler context, being on an Alien planet and all; however, if you are new to Civ games or want a more streamlined experience, this is the Civ game for you. The three afinities each offer a compelling and different gameplay experience with great unique units. The tech web is a little odd at first, but it becomes much better then the tech tree of old after you get accustomed to it. The new quests, while they do have their downsides, being tied to buildings and all, are great for immersion and story and really work to enhance your connection to the world and your civilization's place in it (some good moral choices as well). Finally, the wildlife, the aliens, are much much better then the barbarians in other Civ games. They are extremely hostile and have great rewards attached to them. For example, you can spec into the aliens giving science buffs for defeating them and their nests or perhaps if you can go down the path of harmony and tame the wild beasts to use in your war effort. Overall, if your looking to take your first steps into the series or just want a simpler more streamlined version of other Civ games with a kickass world, you might enjoy picking this title up.",1557033562,1557033562,True,24,0,0.762401998043060303,0,True,False,False

Wouldn't recommend the game in its current state.

Now for the game itself, it is a refreshing take on the civilization games and I kind of liked it (despite the crashes). Also you can set the game to save every turn (still when the game progresses and your turns take longer also make sure to save within a turn). The game takes play on a planet invested with alien life forms and of course competitors (either NPC's or other players, whatever you prefer and/or is available).  I played solo and sort of enjoyed it. The 'technology' schema is very  extensive and forms a network. So you can pick any technology to discover but still need to discover all technologies in between to get there from your current knowledge.

Instead of colonizing Earth, you establish a foothold on an hostile alien planet that features lifeforms and other dangers. You explore, exploit, expand and exterminate in a similar fashion to Civilization 5. You build buildings, recruit scouts and units, improve the infrastructure and generally try to stay on top of the other factions that seek control over the planet while managing the hostile fauna.

Like most of these games, it's incredibly rewarding to build your colony from scratch with making new decisions each round that impact your progression. There are always ways to optimize your empire and improve your cities with upgrades and buildings. 

One of the new elements that was introduced in this installement is the faction system, there are not predefined nations anymore. You can customize your faction by chosing between various backgrounds at the start of the game, giving you various bonuses at the start. You can either focus on production, science, military or other things.

Furthermore, you can earn affinity points which determine the aesthetics and gameplay style of your nation. There are three affinities which can be generally summed up as ""military dudes"", ""nature loving dudes"" and ""other dudes"". Well, this mechanic is neat and it makes the units somewhat unique.

That said, there are some glaring issues with this game. Let me start by mentioning the awful AI, even on higher difficulties, the AI is fairly docile and easy to deal with. They will never really pose any sort of threat. You can calmly pursue world domination with only minor nuisances, there is no real pressure from the AI once you played a few games. This really renders a lot of the gameplay tedious because there is no real incentive to maximize your strategy, in the end your opponent will never really be an issue. Another issue is that the factions lost a lof of personality with the new customization. All the nations are rather bland and represent some sort of ideology but it's very superficial. I can barely discern them. 

Finally, I feel like the decision that you make never really have a huge impact. You always keep building the same buildings, the game tries to give you the illusion of choice but in the end each game feels rather similar. Out of all of my games, I always went down the same path despite trying to play with different affinities and factions. All the buildings and improvements have some generic sci-fi names and give you bonuses on things, none of the buildings offer any sort of exciting gameplay elements.

While it gains a nice graphical face-lift, I prefer the original for not being railroaded down a particular ""focus"". This is because the game implements a inner>outer ""sphere"" tech tree similar to Endless Space that is linked to three primary resources in the world, so depending on where you land and build your first few cities you basically have your optimal tech progress pre-planned for you and, what's worse, it then extends into the unit customisation system closing off certain options.

I understand why they did it, to differentiate factions during the game rather than purely based on their starting bonuses. However, I find this is just frustrating when you want a game with a specific strategy in mind.

Other than those two main points, it retains a lot of the qualities that made the original a great game. It really just warranted an engine upgrade in the end though so grab it during a sale.

For example, I chose purposely not to piss off any aliens but when I told the unit to go to a spot that was in the fog of war, it defaulted to shooting at an alien when it encountered one. This caused my game to go downhill quickly. Any well-thought out game would ask you if you really want to attack the alien before doing so.

Once pissed off, the aliens also don't stop attacking... if I try to ignore them they attack and I'm forced to defend, but then I'm told by the narrator that I had better not make them mad because they are a hive mind which will make life harder for my entire civilization.

I know there is more that annoyed me, but I can't recall all the details at the moment and I haven't the inclination to write it all down. I will probably still try to make a go of this game because I've always wanted the beyond earth concept.

I have honestly become very bored with 4x games, often not completing them due to a ""lack luster"" end game. Early expansion and exploration really is where its at with 4x games, unless ofc their is great fighting to be had, which often isnt the case (in 4x games.)

Non the less, the diplomacy mecanic here is very engaging, i find myself constantly using diplomacy to push forward my story driven game. I quickly realised that allying more than 2 colonies in a game of 8 difffering ones, meant i was being dragged into proxy wars often. This was great because it gave me more engament and allowed me to further expand on my story based game play. I may not have started the war, i may not invade your cities, but i will take out your units attacking alien nests in my territoyies. (purity for the win)

Diplomacy also showed me that to be at peace, i had to be smart in how many allies i had. This is further made interesting because the better your realtionship with some one, the better your trade agreements are. in my game. my enemy had the best trade deals on health, so i always wanted to keep her around to persuade her to a nuetral stance for that bonus. (Health = expansion) (Expansion means winning) However my allies kept dragging me into wars with her, so finally i ended my alliances with them because i was sick of their wars runing my bonuses. All so, so engaging. 

Finally i want to highlight the victorie conditons, i feel like i am truely working towards a end goal whilst enjoying the journey. I am playing the purity rout and am aiming at bringing the rest of earths inhabitants over to the promised land, all whilst trying to maintain peace on the new world.

I thought id miss religioun ect.. but i dont, id be happy if they added this but since i suspect the developers have moved on from the game i doubt it.

I don't find Civ5 that fun anymore, no real reason, probably just after over 500 hours into it gets one drained from it. Civ6, broken as ever, but Civ BE, a game that upon the first months of having, was a terrible game to me. However, coming back to it nowadays, it was a hidden gem. I'm not sure if it was the updates since, but I cannot see the things I used to. The technology, although crazy and something that will take a longer time to learn, is not that difficult to grasp anymore. The AI is pretty good, I can warmonger and have more than half the other civ's still love me. Getting up-to-date technology is also not that difficult, as I've learned how to balance technology. Overall, BE takes a bit more time to learn, but once you understand how to play it, it can suck you in just like Civ5 does. Still haven't bought the DLC, but cannot wait to buy it and explore the new features I'm still missing out on.

Old Review: Fun in its own way, but after playing countless hours of Civ 5 this game feels and looks like a whole new series. I find most of the mechanics confusing, especially with the technology and buildings. It's hard to keep my military up-to-date and I do not know what to build with my workers so I have to put them on auto (if you've done this on civ 5 passed the guilds technology you know how big of a pain they are). The civilizations seem to focused on one thing, not to mention they automatically start doing them once they get on the planet, whether that be a warmongerer or force settler, and this ruins gameplay as I constantly have to worry.",1455570491,1543001456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not a cricism, just an observation.  I happen to enjoy playing Civilization and I happen to enjoy speculative fiction, so this is a happy blend for me and if you enjoy those things this may be a happy blend for you too.

It does diverge from more traditional Civilization games in a few ways that make it an interesting experience though.  The tech tree is replaced with a ""tech web"", which gives a lot more freedom in what order a given player unlocks new technology.  This also means that two colonies toward the end of the game can have vastly different approaches and abilities, even assuming their science production was equivelant, due to the kinds of things they chose to unlock.  It creates an interesting asymetric balance that other Civilization titles tend not to have as much of.

The affinity system intersects with this tech web and is also really interesting.  Affinitiy levels are gained from unlocking certain technologies, those affinity levels come with helpful buffs, hitting tiers in them upgrades your units in ways that let you customize their perks, and you can gain the benefit of multiple affinities at once so you aren't too ""locked-in"" to any one of them early.  However, they do have an effect on diplomacy: colonies tend to trust and align themselves with other colonies that take similar approaches to the challenges of the new world as they do, while distrusting and alienating from other colonies that diverge too greatly from their approach.  This produces a balancing act where players have to decide what kind of victory condition they want to go for as well as who they want to align with while trying to both boost their affinity levels but not boost them in the ""wrong"" way at the wrong time.  It makes for an interesting strategic challenge.

Finally, there is the way that players interact with the new planet itself that provides much to challenge.  The native lifeforms are not inherently hostile, but they can become so when antagonized, and they don't distinguish between different factions of humans.  Trying to clear them out might provoke a response, but also antagonize other colonies as they have to deal with aggressive indigneous lifeforms too.  Leaving them alone, at least for a while, might provide an early buffer that keeps other colonies from getting too confident in their ability to make war.  It also means that even the most peaceful colony needs to keep at least a few units on hand to keep their own territory secure.  Some zones on the planet are especially wild, filled with toxic miasma and territorial creatures, but also lots of good resources.  This means that the initial ""land grab"" phase of the game tends to be drawn out into the mid-game since those zones need strong military and technological resources to clear out and exploit.

All in all, it is a fine addition to the Civilization series that gets to add a few new twists onto a familiar formula.

/edit
---
I've spent too much time into this buggy sad excuse for a AAA title.

At turn 150ish of a save, after killing aliens for a few turns, I raze an alien nest which results in me declaring war on my longtime ally. 

Another save, this time 300 turns in. A station sets up shop right where I was about to put a city. Literally the tile next to my colonist. I decide to build an army to take down this station and while doing so I get a quest to kill the station. I go to kill the station to find that it can't be brought below 1 hp. Screw you Far Base One.

---

For the first six months I had the game I couldn't play it full-screened. I'm still salty about that. It was a bug, people that had screens that went over 60htz could only play in windowed mode. For full priced software, I expect basic code like that to be taken care of before launch. Six months... for a patch.

---

For a Civilization game, it's bare bones. For a better experience get Civ V. Don't buy this until ALL the DLC is out, and get it in a pack, on sale. I don't know if they planned to have the base game lacking content or not, but it feels too simple after playing Civ V. I can't manage what I'm trading to people.

On the moderate video settings I am using (on account of the clunkiness) the map is a bit hard to make out what exactly you are looking at sometimes.  The colors are just kind of unnatural compared to the greens and browns of Civ and it adds some difficulty.

Two years later after playing thousands of hours of Civ 6, I bought Rising Tide on sale and again, it bored me with one Harmony playthrough.
I'm not gonna pick on its hedious UI or failed competitions with Civ 5 or Stellaris, I just want to extract the reasons why it as a strategic game without a storyline managed to bore me with a single try.
1, extremely weak and ridiculously based Wonders. Everyone strives to grab Great Library, Chichen Itza, Forbidden City, and Big Ben and relates to them as a core objective for every new game. But look at the Wonders in Civ BE RT, over 40, none useful or interesting. The best and the second best are both marine Petra. With overpowered PAC I got every single Wonder but none made me happy.
2, sterile plot output. In Civ 5, my capital is always producing hundreds of each output in mid-late game; in Civ 6, plots of 8+ output always makes me thrilled after improvement management and Wonder synergy. In Civ BE RT, no resource is lucrative, and many improvements can be built on any plot, and the main Food and Production source is domestic trade routes. So I ended up building Acadamy everywhere that doesn't award me anything and never had the same excitement as other Civ games to roll a truly legendary start map.
3, totally predictable victory. I didn't just pick one victory and went for it. In fact I built all three Affinity victory wonders and let them compete which is faster, but never managed to complete the second step of Contact, which I actually wanted to see. 

I only turned to Civ BE when I had really enough with Civ 5, Civ 6 and Stellaris. So I would suggest you only buy BE with the same conditions. On sale.

First, the important disclaimer: Do not play BE without Rising Tide. While RT isn't perfect, BE without it is atrocious and I hated it. With RT, it's playable. Does that set the tone for this review? Yeah, basically.

Mechanically, if you played Civ V you more or less know how to play BE, but there are enough differences with enough opacity to make that initial learning curve pretty obnoxious. The tech web, for example - rather than a relatively linear tech tree you get a web where you can branch out in any direction. Conceptually, good. But since all the techs are named things like Protoplasmic Hyperspace Field Generator and Neuromineral Extraction Supercoolant or whatever? There's no meaning to these terms. Figuring out how to navigate it and how to get a research order that makes sense in the early game is trial and many errors.  

And yeah I guess I could stop there. ""Trial and many errors,"" the Beyond Earth story.

But let's be evenhanded. There are things I believe BE does right.

The diplomacy system:  AI characters are mad as usual for Civ but treaties letting you accumulate diplomatic capital which you can turn into other treaties, civ-wide bonuses, units and buildings, or almost whatever you like? Nice. I like diplomatic capital.

Within my first half dozen playthroughs, it became obvious that the game's AI was incapable of exploiting the ridiculously powerful synergies the developers built into the tech tree. This game is nearly as enjoyable as Civilization V if you play it with friends who've all learned the tech tree, and how to abuse it, but even then the game experience pales next to its predecessor.

I had decided to purchase the expansions for Civ BE in hopes of improving my overall gaming experience and it did not disappoint.  The addition of being able to settle on water as well as the inclusion of new units and character skins gave me a greater sense of depth.  Also, in terms of the Affinity system that was restricted to 3 distinct ""advancements"" to humanity.  Ialways felt pushed into only researching tech that complimented one of the three affinities which to me felt too linear.  With the expansions however there is more choice and it is much more difficult to stay strictly with one affinity or another.  Though the character skins for hybrid nations severely lacks imagination.  Everything just turns white....  Also with AI, the inclusion of personality traits as well as diplomatic capital alongside an overhauled diplomacy screen made me feel like my decisions had more consequence and it was beneficial to stay within a rival's respect than fear.  Though at one moment i noticed that in one turn where I was praised by many, the following turn my name quickly turned to mud and 3 of 5 nations declared war on me calling me a warmonger.  A side note with the overhauled diplomacy system.  While you can gain capital by selling the benefits of your personality traits to others and making alliances, there is no longer a way for you to send money or science to allies and friends and you can no longer offer gold per turn to friends.

First, yes, it IS Civilization: But They're In Space!. No denying that. But to call this a straight up reskin is just false. The mechanics have strong tweaks. Upgrading units is revamped and more in-depth, aliens are more than just the game's version of barbarians, and the miasma mechanics allow for entirely new strategies and planning. And that's just the surface. It's a surprisingly deep game.

Most interesting is how tile improvements function. It's like a mix of Civ 5 and what they did for Civ 6.

The biggest weakness is the Civs themselves. They're balanced, but lack unique units and the leaders are pretty flat. Very small pool of Civs too. Also I hope you like playing for Science victories because all the win conditions except the requisite Time Limit and Conquest conditions are basically variants of Science victory.

Is it better than main Civ? No, unless you REALLY love sci-fi. Is it worthy of the Civ title? Yes.

Mods are a massive part of this game, they allow you to spice things up with new techs and improve the game in subtle ways such as providing a clock in-game. The multiplayer I've never done so I'll skip that. While the graphics are decent they could be done better, many mods have been dedicated to doiong just that.

Now for the bad parts, mainly some things in rising tide and the bugs I've encountered. In rising tide they scrapped the original diplomacy system, and added a..weird system where the Ai will just randomly declare war on you for no apparent reason, but that has been a problem for the most of the civ series.

The game has been very well put together. The music is excellent, the graphics great. I love the animations of the units as they move and fight, and the land improvements have animations too. I love the combat animations the best. The variety of units is amazing. They get more cool as they level up. I love the ability to set out across water with any unit to get to a new continent or island. I made a huge invasion fleet in one game so I could take out the opponents Mind Flower wonder. It looked like D-Day. 
The game play is wonderful with lots of building improvements and discovering new technologies that really help you succeed. The tech web is confusing at first but then I found the filter option and then it all made sense. You can filter discoveries based on what you are trying to achieve in the short term. Want your units to get more buffed? Then filter  research for your specific affinity techs. You can get to level 13 quite easily and then rock your enemies. Want to build certain land improvements like float stone or firaxite, or maybe science boost? Filter for it. Its great.
The AI is challenging, alien or human. Diplomacy is just like Civ-5. The espionage missions are pretty cool too. 
The added quests during every phase of the game is a real gem. I find tremendous enjoyment fulfilling each one and getting the reward.
The victory conditions are varied and interesting. Each has a path to fulfillment and you can follow multiple paths, if you have time before the AI get there first. 
All in all I was very surprised how fun this game is. I love to build and improve my civilization and this game is right up my  alley. Highly recommended. 
BTW I am a huge SMAC fan. This game is not SMAC but it is still great. Maybe some day Firaxis will upgrade SMAC to HD and we can all be happy.

The base game offers some modifications to your starting setup, though it doesn't take long to realize that some are much better than others.  The maps are varied, which is good, but inevitably it tends to be the same thing over and over.  The different Civs in the base game also tend to be very vanilla; there's not much flavor there and everything, like special units and upgrades, are based off of one's Affinity level.  This is a neat way to level up units, but it also guts the special characteristics that we're used to seeing in Civ, like specific units that can only be built by that Civ and the like.  The graphics are pretty, though probably not up to what Civ is capable of producing.  The soundtrack is pretty awesome and seems to pay homage simultaneously to Gustav Holst's ""The Planets"" suite and the score to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".

The Rising Tide expansion does add quite a bit to the base game, adding four more Civs and redoing the Diplomacy system by adding Traits for your character which impacts the way your cities grow and develop.  Aquatic cities are interesting, but their main feature of movement is rather slow as it has to be ""built"" like any other city improvment and once you get to the mid-to-late game, you'll just buy tiles rather than wasting the time of moving.  Artifacts are also a nice McGuffin for your explorers but I've so far been underwhelmed by what they do.

In the end, it's a formulaic chapter in the Civ catalog, but if you're looking for a relaxing game to eat up a few hours of the day to, it's perfect.  This probably isn't everybody's mug o' ale though, so if you're looking for a more in-depth game with lots of nuances, this isn't for you.

Is it as Good as Civ 5? No. However, with the DLC, civ beyond earth is better than the current Civ 6.
The Good:
-The races are all very well balanced. While the races in Civ 6 are very unbalanced (Ex: Alexander is broken and is too strong. See My Tier Guide for Civ 6 and you will see why), Civ beyond earth civilizations are all fairly equal with respect to each.
-5 different victory types. Do you want to keep the traditions of old earth or adopt the new traditions of aliens
-Pretty cool units. Hybrid units are awesome.
-Naval warfare is so much fun. While naval warfare was annoying in Civ 5 and Civ 6, it is actually super fun here.
-Units upgrade automatically just research technology
-The Spy system is awesome you can steal technology, money units and even attempt coups! 
-Awesome internal trade routes.
-Achievements: much easier than Civ 5 or Civ 6. Estimated time: 100 hrs-150 hrs. 

The Bad:
-Graphics could have been a bit better
-Leaders look really boring. 
-You can no longer bribe to AI to go war (similar to Civ 6)

This game is trash.

They had the opportunity to spin any kind of story they wanted, and went with the most simplistic ""earth is doomed, gotta go!"" one. Very much done before and poorly done here.
The gameplay was pretty dull too, the explorer dies very easily and if your base in the middle of at least 2 alien spawn points, the start is a real drag. Moving on to the diplomacy, again, no feeling of story. Who are these other factions? Also, with regards to the gameplay of diplomacy, this was explained poorly as far as what ""personality"" you have. It feels like they have fallen into the no mans land trap of ""you can do anything"" which sucks imo.
The tech tree was a nightmare. It was difficult to understand what the hell you needed for the purposes you had, because it seemed like they focused more on making it look streamline and space-like, than actually easy to use.

I am on the fence about this one. Compared to other iterations of the Civilization series, this is not a great game by any means. Civ V and even VI blows this out of the water in my opinion. However, this is not meant to be a direct descendant of Civ V, but rather a spiritual successor of Alpha Centauri. Alpha Centauri is certainly better than this version, however this version is more up-to-date with the graphics and the new Civ mechanics. I can only recommend if you get it on sale. You may love it or, like me, you may play a few games and then never come back (despite mostly enjoying those games).",1520609980,1520609980,False,55,8,0.622208356857299805,0,True,False,False

---------------------------------------------------
1.Gameplay
Most Civ5 features are changed:
Espionage includes more options;
Tech tree transforms to a web form;
Aliens have responsive aggressiveness;
Wonders are less determinant with great persons removed.

New features are funny and complex as well:
Diverse quests;
Amphibious hovering units;
Orbital units can fulfill various functions;
Xeno-gas can be defensive or supportive terrain features;
Explorer can achieve diverse bonuses through expedition;
Affinities differ in terms of resources, quests, upgrades, units and buildings.
---------------------------------------------------
2.Visual
BE is visually appealing with concise UI, gorgeous artwork and decent sci-fi style.
Bright colors, dynamic lights and vivid terrain features combine to build scenic and exotic worlds.
However, some UI elements seem over-simplified. Wonders appear as mere blueprints in popup window. All tech, unit and building icons are logo-like.
---------------------------------------------------
3.Music
Music is as grand as in Civ5. Some tracks resemble the Blade Runner theme with an industrial, cyberpunk and apocalyptic atmosphere.
---------------------------------------------------
4.Other
Most conceptual designs are relatively original. Narratives and fictional references are affluent and profound.

-The factions have no personality and are a joke, you've got space Brazil who contacts you every turn to tell you HUEHUEHUE (literally) Space Brazil STRONK, then you've got space Merkel who rambles about diversity and then you have space Australia who has this perpetual shocked-and-gay look on his face like you just caught him giving someone a handjob.
-There's a million different units depending on whatever affinity you happen to stumble into, however all these different units have different names so you gotta memorise something like 60 different units all names stuff like Immortal, Golem, Angel etc. that leave you no clue as to what they do. I'd rather I just have something like ''Infantry (affinity name)'' or ''artillery (affinity name)''
-The same for other, non military units, I don't know if what I'm hovering over is a satellite or what the hell it is, only it gives some bonuses to some stuff
-Affinities don't really feel like a choice, you just randomly stumble into them most of the time while doing research or during pop-ups
-the tech web is a mess, it worked in Endless Space, it doesn't work here, again you've like 60 technologies with random technobabble names that you have to memorise, you'd want about 80 hours in the game to get a grip on them all but the game just isn't good enough to hold you for that long most likely.
-When you gain an affinity level or research a technology, there's an Alpha Centauri inspired bit of dialogue, but in beyond earth it's pretentious waffle most of the time. Alpha Centauri wasn't pretentious.
-Again, the leaders and factions are beyond horrible, you remember that guy in Civ 5 called Askia who would stand in front of a burning castle waving a sword about and having a laugh about how he was gonna burn your civilization to the ground? that guy is more of a pal than any of these space-metrosexuals or space-boomers you have to suffer in beyond earth.",1519246976,1519246976,False,35,28,0.523562014102935791,1,True,False,False

It has some very promising ideas but feels unfinished in many aspects. Imo a lot of potential was wasted. But the new features should still be enough to provide 30-80 hours fun.



Pros:
-I like happiness being replaced by health. There are still disadvantages for low health but not as crippling as it was with happiness in Civ 5 (happiness 0-->everything is cool; happiness -1 -->youre economically dead)

-water cities are a cool feature and have nice mechanics

-diplomacy went in the right direction (but it still feels unfinished)

-the affinity based unit upgrade and victory condition system is very nice and (theoretically) leads to many viable strategic decisions

-i like aliens far more than barbarians (there are still questionable mechanics with aliens attacking settlers and workes but not soldiers and explorers when ""at peace"")

-the war-point system is great


Cons: 
-Miasma and tile graphics make it somewaht ""blurry"", i liked the clear graphics on Civ5 more

-The AI is so extremely bad (in the sense of basic) 
-->As a veteran Civ player i immediately won on second highest difficulty
-->Captured cities show AI almost doesnt build any buildings (often only 3-4 of them at turn 150)
-->AI spams military which acts dumb. AI is easily countered by air units and decents micro management.
-->So game gets boring after every victory condition/unit/building has been tried out (6-8 games), so you gotta go to highest difficulty...


-->On the highest difficulty the AI cheats so hard, Deity in Civ5 pales in comparison. It has Tier 2 units soon after game start. If youre lucky Ai builds only 3-5 cities meaning you can still beat it as it is dumb. But if youre unlucky AI spams 20 (!) cities by turn 80. As the AI tends to declare war on weak opponents and as it pumnps out military almost exclusively the game becomes basically unplaybale.

-In my opinion there are too many ressources
-->Too many kinds of different ressources that have not much use beyond giving +2 food/+1 science/etc.
-->Airplanes dont need petroleum like in Civ 5, there are no nukes (and hence no plutonium), no iron or in this case ttanium is required for tanks/ships and so on.
-->Only the three affinity ressources xenomass, floatstone and firaxite go somewhat in that direction, but..
-->Even on sparse setting there is such a high quantity of ressources that you never run short (and a spy can buy the too on the black market...)

-Balance sucks overall, especially for victory conditions (Contact)

-map size is directly tied to number of players

-traders are entirely imbalanced. Routes to own cities and stations are extremely strong (e.g. +5 food and production each is possible for the first, the second might give +5 culture or sciende), while trade routes to opponents give them twice the return you get for no effort",1517631165,1517631165,True,0,0,0.462986499071121216,0,True,False,False

Yes, there are changes to how tech works and alien/barbarian behavior and of course units are futuristic in their design but it just didn’t meld, for me at least.

Perhaps its futuristic units going onto more futuristic units just didn’t feel like an evolving time line, more it’s rather slightly stronger units with each tech jump.

I suppose there is only so many ways to arm a soldier with a laser rifle, so perhaps an unwarranted criticism.

So while I still enjoyed my playthrough, I believe its predecessor Civ 5 was a more enjoyable game, I am unlikely to ever dust this one off, as if I have time for another Civ game I would rather play 5 or now 6 (which I again rate much higher then Civ: BE).

CivBE is no exception, and with the amount of bugs in this game, and no incoming bug fixes for this game from the devs, its no wonder why this game is dead in the modding department.

Known Bugs that have killed my games:

1) Having to load mods twice in order to get keep the game from disabling the in-game UI.
     

      --It's true, and this game is even less mod-friendly than it's predecessors, so much so that the only way to make new maps is to import old maps from other civ games,

2) The game, no matter its map size, can only handle (at max) 12 players, CivBE:RT is vanilla capped at 10 civs.

     --This goes back to being mod unfriendly, the Codex mods that add new civs to the game disables map packs that the base game RT uses, which effectively neuters your ability to have good replayability due to the fact that you can't add new maps or new civs without having the game lock up over anti-mod security (Oh, did you not think that wasn't in the game?)

3) When using mods the game will lock up domination diplomacies, this prevents you from ending the turn and your only remaining action is to start a new game after you're already 300 turns into this current game. This is a result of the anti-mod security kicking in. 


If you don't mind playing a vanilla game, then go ahead and buy this game, but if you want a dynamic grand strategy experience: look elsewhere.

I would highly reccommend Civ5 for a dynamic civ experience.

Overall the marketing team overhyping this game as the next Civ (at the time, they acted like it was Civ 6) really hurt it on release day when people got ahold of it.

I love the three different ideological paths you can take your civ down, and upgrading units to the next tier in this game is extremely satisfying.

Imo Rising Tides is not worth the money, so stay away from that dlc. All it adds overall are water cities, if that's your thing. 

One odd thing about BE in recent years is it appears the team has snuck in updates of new events and a couple quality of life features like having your spies buy luxury goods on the black market. It's a good kind of interesting to see this happening.

Overall, I think this game is delightful and underappreciated but I would never recommend it for $40. It goes on sale during every steam seasonal sale for around 70% off and for $13 it is a steal, so get it then.

Bad
-Not enough Leaders there is only like 9 compared to the earlier games who had several more
-Massive Learning Curve even with the tutorial I felt like I was blundering through the research and diplomacy screens completely lost sometimes
-AI for the other Leaders is very erratic one minute they are appluading you for something they like the next they are declaring war because you made an outpost miles away

The gameplay is, largely, identical to what you'd get in Civ V, but where it differs is where it shines.  Namely: empire customization, local fauna interaction, and scientific progress.  You are much freer to design your empire and evolve it through the game, and diplomacy while simplified, is also much more straightforwards and understandable.  The local fauna is not 'inherently' good or evil, and will *generally* leave you be if you do the same, and can even be turned to your side if you so choose.  And lastly, scientific progress is far less linear and feeds into the 'affinity' system which allows you to further tailor your empire.

While the game plays largely identically to Civ V in most mechanics, the variations make for a different tone and, in my opinion, make Beyond Earth a bit less rigid.  The strong emphasis on customizing your empire through it's technologies, diplomacy and affinities is something the mainline series cannot match.  In many ways, it's a bit overwhelming and as I said before, is a nice departure from the largely linear experience of the main series.

Lastly, rather than write a review for Rising Tide, I'll just cover it here: given how underwhelming the response to Beyond Earth was, Rising Tide is probably far better than it has any business being.  It really shows the significant investment Firaxis has in their games: it was clearly made for the players who enjoyed Beyond Earth.  Rather than try to 'fix' the game, it simply takes what made it different and keeps going.

Maybe when it first launched, it was crap, but I just picked it up today. After 2 hours of play (which, I know is barely playing when it comes to any Civ game, but trust me on this), I really have no complaints at all. It's a very interesting game based on the Civilization series. It's not a whole lot like the regular Civ cames, except the very bare bones concepts. You really have to look at this game and understand that you have to restrategize all together to play it. Everything is unfamiliar because it's on an alien planet. I saw multiple reviews that were upset because this is a ""reskin"" of Civ V. But I have to disagree. So far, I find this game deeply creative and intriguing. I find it more difficult than the regular Civ games, if only because it's so different. There is a lot to take in at first because, while the basic functions and gameplay may be the same, the way you go about winning the game and strategizing is vastly different. 

I guess it all comes down to personal preference, as it always does, but I really think you should give it a shot.

I would also like to say that a lot of my game time is on the largest possible maps, with the most teams, for the longest playtime. 

Ok, now that that is out of the way, lets start

Firstly, I have yet to see any bugs. Mechanically speaking, the games works great for me, and having played on a low end and high end platform, a basic i5 bearing laptop and my current i7 gaming laptop, i can say that, although it does work on both fine, you are more prone to crashes on the lower end of the spectrum. Higher end i have yet to see a crash or a startup error. 

Secoundly, this game is a lot of fun, and good for someone like me who just wants something to focus on for a while. Set the gamemode to domination, massive world, and whatever else, and you could have a game going for months. Needless to say you can make this game last a very short time as well, but I would not be a good reviewer for that. 

I would like to say the relationship system is a bit wonky. leaders get mad at you for just doing your thing, peaceful or otherwise. Whats more, the AI will praise you for rading their own trade convoys, as if oblivious. Hutamara is a faverite, who will yell at you for expanding and conqouring cities, then turns around and expands and conqurers cities. SOME CONSISTANCY PLEASE!!!

Last real complaint is the auto explore function. When applied to explorers and some military units, instead of actually finding resource pods and expedition sites, they will wander aimlessly until the find an alien to agro. then guess whos city gets hit by a kraken or siege worm? One of two things needs to be done, either fix the explore mode, or install a ""stop all automation"" button in the menu. 

Other than that, this is a great game, and i higly reccomend the rising tide dlc. not sure what exoplanets really did, but i play with that one too. Rising tide adds so much mobility, fun and exciting gameplay, and new ways to lay siege to your enimies.

1. Alpha Centauri did it better. That's not usually an issue with a game. For example some desire Civ V over Civ VI currently, and each has different design and gameplay aspects that lends credence to that. The issue is that while you're supposed to feel like someone creating a new nation on a frontier where there are no rules, what it really feels like is a conglomoration of people who are very far apart and aren't interested in having relations. I felt no form of cooperation with the other civilizations, and no need to converse with them. This is also due to the rate that borders expand for a new city. Placing an outpost is a huge investement, and then it rarely pays off with border expansion. Thus, you rarely find yourself sharing a border with a Civ unless you design your gametype around that.

2. The gameplay of animals replacing barbarians is interesting, but almost falls flat due to the numerous bugs surrounding thier inclusion. Often I found the fields used to keep them away not working, which makes it really hard to do a pacificst run with animals when a rock is destroying all of your oceanic tile upgrades. But that's the song of the whole game: cool concepts that aren't implemented correctly or that bugs completely diminish the successes you try to achieve.

It's sad that it had to be this way, because I found a lot to love with the alien design they were going for, and the cool concepts they touched on. Unfortunately, the sloggish gameplay, the bugs, and the inability to expand and develop a nation meaningfully (you didn't have to see that you were a culture Civ in V or VI because it reflected your play on the international stage more than ""don't do that"") creates an atmosphere that quickly feels old after one or two games. That's not what Civ is about. I feel just as enthralled as my new budding nation in Civ VI on my 30th game as I do on my 1st.

Overally it's like a 4/10 for those that have played a Civ and a 6/10 for those that haven't.

I've seen several reviews that complained that this game was just a reskin of Civ V. I've seen others that complain of it being too different... and I think I can explain why this is.

TL;DR - unlike previous Civ games, this game allows you to pursue many different paths but prevents you from doing it all. You have to make choices of what to do and what to neglect. Play with this in mind, and you will have a lot more fun.

When you begin the game, the mechanics are very similar to a traditional Civ game. Food, production, energy (gold), and culture production per city. Workers to improve tiles. Strategic and tile bonus resources to work. Military units, trade units, etc. You can see why someone would call it a Civ V reskin. But very quickly you begin to see the new mechanics that make this game different and, in my opinion, better in some ways.

The two major mechanics that make this game different are affinity and the tech tree. Affinity is an ""alignment"" of sorts that you gain as you perform research and make quest decisions. Gaining affinity unlocks certain units and buildings, but it also is the main way that you advance your military and proceed towards certain victory conditions. The three affinities are Purity, Harmony, and Supremacy (I think?). Each has their own unique victory that they can unlock and accomplish. At certain levels of affinity, you upgrade all military units of certain types to more powerful versions, which is the main way of building a more powerful army. Each affinity also has a style or theme to it, and tends to consume more of one of the three alien strategic resources.

Research is quite different as well. Instead of starting at the bottom of a technology tree, you start in the middle of a technology web. You can choose what direction(s) your research path will folow, but odds are, you won't research all technologies before reaching a victory condition. This is a great change from previous Civ games, where you are proceeding along a fairly uniform track and your strategies revolve around slingshotting or beelining to certain units or wonders. Remember, what you research also affects your affinity. You have to choose, will you focus on cheaper researches near the center of the web and work outward? Will you focus on techs of a certain affinity in order to chase a certain victory or build a more powerful army? Or will you focus on techs that will best benefit your cities' growth? The fact that you can make so many different choices, and that you can't have them all just because you are following a science-heavy strategy, makes the game very replayable.

Diplomacy has changed a lot as well. For one, you can see exactly how other factions think of you in terms of fear and respect. Fear is based on your military strength, and respect is based on your actions, what you build, and your affinity. Trade deals are somewhat simplified and yet also open new possibilities. Cities produce a new resource called influence (I think?). Influence is used in three ways: personality traits, trade deals, and purchases. Personality traits are passive bonuses that apply to your faction, and are unlocked by spending influence. A faction's own traits also affect how other they view you (what they respect or dislike). Trade deals no longer exchange energy and resources, but instead allow the proposing faction to gain a passive bonus in exchange for a payment of influence. So, my personality trait might give me +10% food, and allow other factions to ""pay"" me in influence to gain +2 food per city. So each personality trait is a coin with two sides. Finally, you can use influence points to make purchases just like you can with energy (gold).

Virtues (social policies) are unlocked with culture just like you would be familiar with from Civ V. There are only four now, though, they have over a dozen unlockables each, and there are some synergy bonuses from unlocking a certain number of tier 1 traits across all trees, or a certain number of traits from the same tree. Otherwise it's as you would expect.

Two more minor mechanics that add a lot to the game: quests and customization. You will receive a number of quests over the course of the game, each which have their own rewards. None are vital, except those that lead to a victory condition. All give nice bonuses, and you will get a quest chain that allows you to develop an affinity of your choice more quickly. Also, quests are a part of customization. You get to choose between bonuses to your units and buildings throughout the game. Once they level up through affinity, you can choose one of two bonuses for a unit type, which can radically change how you use it. For example, artillery might gain +1 range if they have not acted yet this turn, or alternatively might gain the ability to fire without setting up. Each with a different, meaningful way of using them. When you build a building for the first time, you will be given a ""quest choice"" that will give you one of two bonuses. There is some nice narrative behind each choice, but more than that, it allows you to customize how you develop your cities. Do you want this building to provide +1 health (happiness), or would you rather get +2 production per turn? Your choices often can compound on themselves to create very powerful builds.

I appreciate that Firaxis wanted to do something different with this game, and yet they also needed to satisfy fans of the series. I think they did a great job. They also have created a fun 4X game that offers a lot of replayability. I strongly suggest you give the game a shot with all of this in mind, and experience it for what it is: a more freeform, customizable, choose-your-own-path style of Civilization game.",1511763312,1511763312,True,101,2,0.892339408397674561,2,True,False,False

On the one hand, it is (mostly) what I would want from a sequel/remake/redux of Alpha Centauri.  Updated graphics, same concept, familiar storylines and turn-based, sci-fi-fun!  I love the addition of the Virtues and Culture along with a better laid out tech tree.

On the other hand, the personalities of the factions are stagnant and impossible to really be surprised or developed.  The diplomacy of the previous game is far more limited than before, the alien races are unplayable (and sterile) (however it was not until Alien Crossfire, the expansion that this became an option).  With these fixed parameters, it makes replay value depreciate as each game goes through almost the same motions time and time again.  Also, I miss the victories from the previous game (getting elected to world leader, corning the Energy market, etc).

That being said, I still really enjoy the game.  Maybe it is the nostalgia, maybe it is the storyline but I appreciate the challenges each world, starting location, etc can bring.  The bonus is the fact that this game came MOD ready and there already tons of great add-ons that players can add to spice up the game.  As of the time of this review, I have yet to sample any as I'm still enjoying the vanilla version of the game but will find myself adapting it to my preference as time goes on.  

Final words?  The gameplay of Beyond Earth is on some levels far better and more interesting than Alpha Centauri ever was and at the same time, simplified and well, vanilla.   As of right now, I do recommend the game, I really do.  It is a lot of fun and there is a bit of a learning curve for players to understand things like Health, Culture, Science, and Energy balance.  My hopes is that there is a shake-up to the factions with more dynamic personalities and increased diplomacy options.

Usually, Civilizations games have just enough overlap with grand strategy games like EU4 or Victoria 2 that starting a new game of Civ just makes me want to jump over to something with greater verisimilitude once the ""history"" of the world total falls off the rails. [b]Beyond Earth[/b] solves this is issue by putting the timeframe you're working within in the future (and not on Earth), freeing you [i](well, at least me)[/i] from any unconscious associations with what ""should"" be or happen.

I nominated this game for the ""Choices Matter"" award due because as you advance your colony by expanding, researching techs, building structures, interacting with aliens & other colony... pretty much everything, you're presented with a series of choices which can modify the yields of buildings, give large lumps of resources or other rewards.

Your choices in tech pull you towards certain affinities (or hybrids between them if you have the DLC, which does greatly improve the game), which is how you unlock unit upgrades with different units available depending on which route you take.

Over-all, I think it’s a good game & the DLC makes a huge improvement on the base game (as is usually the case with Civilization games).",1511393600,1511393600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The best example is when your civilization is close to a war based civilization(s), and niter or the resource that gives you gun powder based units. When your civilization has the ability to train/upgrade units that are adequate to properly defend/attack, the other civilizations have already surpassed you in arms all because niter did not spawn in or close to your cities of your civilization. 

There is still the plague of overpowered wonders or must have wonders in order to gain victory. Forbidden City is extremely powerful, because it gives you a wildcard slot for your policy cards. Even certain civilizations start off with 3 policy card slots, which is beyond retarded for the early game.

Other than that, the game is interesting with challenges that are pretty good without the above mentioned complaints. Yeah, the game sometimes crashes.

1. Compared to Civ 5 w DLCs, this game is way too complex to follow even the basic of getting your city/collony off the ground. 
2. Way too slow paced for my liking. Just to move a little forward takes about 40 turns, and by then you fall asleep.
3. Aliens just added for sci-fi effect. Dont hit them and its like you dont exist to them the entire game.
4. AI is wonky as heck. Diplomacy system is less diplomatic than Civ 5. Impossible to follow or keep up with. 
5. Peronsally, the design and color scheme of the game put me off. After waiting 20 turns to get a Settler or worker and staring into a dark green vomit splattered map, I was feeling my eye to get strained and just overly turned off by the let down this game is.

I don't like that you have to get DLC for the full game or that you can't really do much in terms of going over water without the full DLC. I love the water city idea but dislike that after a while it feels like the developers gave up on endgame content. Right when a strategy game is coming into the most fun part as your own personal interstellar Council of Allies gears up to take on the space travelling Axis of Evil, you run out of sciences to research or culture leads nowhere or your allies turn on you because one of your armadas (which you most definitely would have communicated was going to do) passes too close to the outskirts of one of your allies' tiniest city. I mean it's worth hundreds of hours of gameplay and if some modders could actually get the professional feel that the rest of the game has I would love to see some new sponsors or odd buildings or science revamps or something of this nature. I love strategy games and wish there was some way to link up online with other people but mostly I'm just fighting bot after bot (which is honestly fine because if I did play this game online, it would take me days to walk away from it). I absolutely love this game which is why I am so critical because its just short of that critical mass required for that nuclear meltdown of pure happiness. It is a convergence of some of my favorite genres, strategy, interstellar colonization, political, aliens, just to name a few. Another thing I do find this game sorely lacks is that the gameplay should include multiple planets at once. It would mean the difference between playing checkers with your rumba and playing four dimension chess with Einstein. Like the idea of even just bringing this awesome graphics fun design to a solar system level almost makes me want to cry pure tears of distilled joy. Also the aliens tend to fall flat especially with the fact that one of the victory paths [spoiler] is to bring the progenitors back to the planet and then the game ends and even continuing on is just the same as before. the progenitors should be a stepping stone to unlock all new sciences, whole new ideas on culture, revolutionize the divide between biological, mechanical, and humane, creating more than just three different ideologies and their blended subideologies. [/spoiler] I feel that the developers didn't truly understand the platform that this game could be, I mean look at their biggest DLC pack instead of revamping technologies, overhauling culture, creating inspiring new sponsors, throwing caution to the wind and creating inspiring new lifeforms, doing multiplanet strategic content, or even just making the aliens more of a challenge, they allow you to float a city on water. I'm sorry but ""what could have been"" and ""what is"" are so far apart that I think the Civilization team kinda phoned it in for the DLC overhaul that they made seem like it was the biggest thing to happen since the ""Big Mistake"" but really it was just the ability to actually use water channels (which lets face it even modern day society has cities that float on water so ""come on dev team, use those brain cells a little harder.""

I find this game to be one of the best 4x I have ever played. For sure it has limitations and fails but, which game has not got them? I feel it has been done with a final purpose and with a lot of care and it shows even more in the expansion ""The rising tide"". Good 4X games are to be enjoyed reading the texts that tell you the background story of every  decision you take, the smooth sound effects that take you from one decision to another, the care in the graphics of the world and the units, and the strategic sense of all the units-resource-map system. 

This is a science fiction game set in another planet, so do not expect to find the concepts you can read in the History books and that are present in Civilization games. I think this is what has led to many people find this game strange, but if you are open to the vision of the future, that the developers propose, you will enjoy it very much. And here is where the core of the game is.

The Humanity colonizes a new planet but divided in several Earth culture factions,  but that is it, what the have to decide from then on is completely new and based in three options of what we might be in the future. Are we going to keep our nature despite living in a new world? Are we going to merge our genes with the life we have found to improve our existance? or are we going to take the path of the biomechanical possibilities to overcome any odd circumstance we will have?

Depending on what you decide, which will define your main ideology about the future, you can use certain buildings and units that have some advantages and disadvantages comapared to the other ideologies. And in the expansion you can have units and buildings that are product of taking a intermediate path, which is great. So at the end it is a much more complex system than usual Civilization games which leads to a deeper strategy experience and a lot of replayability.

In the expansion you can colonize the ocean, which is also filled with alive and mineral content for good and for bad.

In 4x games I use to play the greater maps and lots of factions, but lately I am playing grater maps and reduced number of factions so the gamplay is less demanding and gives me more room to learn things and develop the solutions I thing will lead me to victory or to stay alive at least. With this game it has been a very much big fun.

I am playing the game in Spanish, and I must say that voices of actors, specialy the actress that shows when the dicovery of the technologies, are so profesional. This, among the other things, makes me realize the care that the developers have put on the production of the game.

Beyond Earth is, instead, a sci-fi 4x game that unfairly suffered the scorn of a fanbase expecting the aforementioned AC successor, when in reality the title is more aptly described as Civ 5 IN SPAAAAACE!

While that is as much a compliment as a critique, that does not change the fact that accusing Beyond Earth of lacking merit solely because it did not turn out to be the realization of a long-desired pipe dream is foolish.  Again, there are fair points of criticism for this game, but it not being Alpha Centauri with a different skin isn't one of them, not by any stretch of the imagination.

Beyond Earth's strengths (assuming one owns the Rising Tide expansion) lays in a number of things.  The most apparent is the diplomatic system which, unlike Civ 5 or it's successor, Civ 6, actually treats the player with a degree of fairness and sensiblity in actions taken by an opposing sponsor.  Reactions to a player's developing affinities, perception of military aggression, expansions, trade deals, routes, and agreements are not subjected to any degree of mood whiplash.  An AI sponsor's attitude towards the player is clearly demarcated and reasoning is provided that explains what contributes to your positive or negative perceptions.  If a player's developing colonies are on equal footing with another sponsor's, the player can expect that sponsor to actually treat with them in a mutually respectful manner, and within the context of the sponsor's preferences and personality.  Expect ARC to backstab you.  Expect Brasilia to respect your military forces.  Expect Polystralia to appreciate your accumulating energy stores.  The AI will not unilaterally decide to threaten hostilities with reckless, manic abandon regardless of existing factors that should reasonably dissuade them from doing so.

Enemy military forces are often competent and capable of making intelligent decisions regarding which of a player's units and colonies to target.  Token player forces, even on lower difficulty settings, will not be enough to prevent an aggressive AI sponsor from probing defenses, weak points, or making attempts on colonies with low fortification values and population.  Sea-borne colonies are more at risk, as they often lack geographical obstacles that would otherwise limit avenues of attack, and AI navies are quite capable of swarming and overtaking an offshore asset.

The customization available to a player, not only of their tech affinity (and the potential hybridization of multiple units), but also of their chosen traits during the course of a game allows adaptation to different situations as play progresses, rather than railroading a player into a set strategy every single time.  The ability to pursue a different affinity and victory condition that aligns with the affinity-reliant resources available in a given area means that no individual sponsor a player chooses is necessarily at a disadvantage compared to other sponsors.

The expansion of the variety of alien life, and differing scales of their associated strength with Rising Tide, means that colonies located close to alien nesting sites will not find their initial military units steam-rolled and thus left defenseless in the eyes of AI sponsors right at a game's start.  At least on land, middling-tier and higher alien units will not begin to spawn in sufficient quantities to become a major threat until a player can reasonably be expected to have unlocked affinity-related upgrades of their own.  Early forays into the Harmony affinity will also grant Explorer units the ability to leash alien life, bringing them under a player's control.  However, despite the introduction of a variety of weaker sea-borne alien life, sea dragons and tile improvement-wrecking kraken still spawn with too great a frequency in the early game, and can prove especially troublesome for players using a sponsor that makes Plantefall on ocean tiles.

On the subject of critique, however, there is too little synergy between the newly-introduced hybrid units and victory conditions.  While there is a bit of apparent purpose in pursuing an affinity that serves as a compromise between the three major possibilities, it very much feels as though this feature was only partially implemented, or expected to be further fleshed out in a future expansion which, of course, never came about.  Consequently, the hybrid affinity system, while providing interesting options for units, otherwise has no real impact on a player's pursued goal.

While AI sponsors will now act more in accordance with their implied personalities, and customization options in-game allow supplemental traits to be adaptively selected by a player, the lack of units and/or buildings unique to any given sponsor still accentuates a sort of banal uniformity that is unfortunately present with each sponsor.  While all sponsors do possess a ubiquitous characertistic, that all sponsors make use of the same types of units and buildings (that are only adjusted depending upon affinity selections within the tech web) does little to dispel the feeling that no sponsor bears enough identity in gameplay to provide a player with a truly different experience.

The most glaring issue with Beyond Earth remains that one's enjoyment of the game will ultimately heavily depend on how much one enjoyed Civ 5.  If the structure of that game appealed to a player, then that player is almost certain to enjoy Beyond Earth.  On the other hand, if a player found Civ 5's interface and gameplay unbearable, then there is no guarantee (even with the changes to the diplomacy system) that Beyond Earth will be different enough to enjoy on its own merits.

Regardless, Beyond Earth remains something one would recommend, even though it has to be wondered what this game might've become had it benefited from the release of another expansion or, at the very least, continued developer support.

While built on the engine of Civ V, Beyond Earth is more than a re-skin or an übermod. It's its own game with some interesting ideas. Variable starts. A first-of-its-kind diplomacy system (for Firaxis, anyway). Pronounced changes in AI aggression as you get closer to victory. There are certainly some things from Beyond Earth that made their way into Civ VI.

Including one very crummy thing: sloppy quality control. The text has more typos than is acceptable for an American, triple A studio. Some of the in-game events are buggy or just don't seem to have been well thought out. For all the neat features, many games seem to get bogged down in a joyless death march to inevitable victory. All of these things, in my opinion, are present in Civ VI, and Firaxis caught them when making Beyond Earth.

Nonetheless, Beyond Earth has some of the best lore ever made for a Firaxis game—or any strategy game. If you're fan of sci-fi, especially the oldies like Heinlein, Asimov, and Bradbury, then you'll appreciate the thematic elements of this game. It's almost worth it to just peruse the civilopedia. Almost.

**HUGE CAVEAT** The animations for units always bug out in the middle of a session. As the game progresses, this bug out happens sooner in a session, eventually happening after the first turn of a loaded save. While this could be, and seems like it ought to be, a performance issue, it has happend on multiple machines and platforms for me, and it seems to happen across the community. It is probably something broken with the software itself and Firaxis never was able, or willing, to fix it. It's a damn shame because, like the lore, they clearly put a lot of love into the art of this game, but a good chunk of that work is inaccessible to me. If you don't care about these sorts of things, then this may not be a problem for you. But if you like to do a little procedural narration when you're gaming, like me, then it is a glitch that almost entirely kills the experience. This is the caveat for which I do not recommend the game.",1507259977,1507259977,False,13,0,0.629630684852600098,1,True,False,False

Let's go into some positives, I do like the idea behind Beyond Earth and see what they want to create. The idea of Sci-fi and being free from history can allow to create incredible things that can go beyond our expectations.
And I do like the upgrade units from different ideologies like Harmony which can give different appearances and stats which is awesome and epic when you're in a battle.
And I still love the idea of creating your own story still (but I'll talk more in the negatives) like I was doing very well with my economy and returning from my low Health until the slavic federation attacked because I was weak, which I was and he had strong units like the CNDR. However, I had more money than anyone which allowed me to purchase units and my units were better trained in Harmony. We took a beating but we managed to push them back and destroy most of their army. And I offered peace. That's a moment I will remember.
I do like the different appearances of when you choose an affinity, that's a nice touch.

The bad points, I adore Civ 5 and I welcome the engine and gameplay to Beyond Earth. Although I don't care about graphics, I can understand where everyone is coming from and I admit that there is a lot of reused features like the water and map design with a new coat of paint.
The sponsors...oh where to begin? They are the most boring, uninspired and generic factions yet. They have little to no personality, they give slight hints of what kind of person they're like but they have no unique dialogue or gestures. And my god...how dare they not add any backgrounds....WHY!? In some Civ games they kept true to what the leaders were like, like Washington, a noble and strong leader. Napoleon, a mighty leader and smug attitude, these old leaders had their charm and you can understand their personality just by hearing them, looking at them, hearing their theme and looking at their background. Beyond Earth? No, I really REALLY hope they get their act together and start creating some better characters that we can remember and want to play as.
I actually like the tech tree, it's different and of course non linear which I highly enjoy but wish it was better executed when zoomed out, but I can't see the advisor recommendation and sometimes just seeing the horrible design of the logos doesn't help with one I need to choose.
Building wonders is terrible, there's nothing really worth while when building one, the design of a wonder when you achieve it is so bland, just some concept art of what it could look like striped.
This also goes into the art direction, the logos in this game is very disappointing, I know this is the future but I highly dislike the new design by simplifying it. Why can't we have a proper drawing which can help us figure out that's the one we want and it looks appealing like in Civ 5. Art in this this game created by the....'professional artists' is so poor.
And the lack of creating your own story as you play comes to the comments before you start the game each time, who you play as can give out his/her personality or opinions. I don't like this, Civ is always about playing as someone like America and becoming a powerful taking over the world and you can tell how you did it like a fanfiction. But Beyond Earth tries to get a pre-determend character which ruins the tell your own story idea of Civ. This is easy to ignore but it's a the small things that matter.

Overall, this game doesn't have the impact like Civ 5 did. However that game had two amazing expansions and I think it's what this game seriously needs. An expansion pack to make it a better. But I will say this, Beyond Earth is a good game. Much much better than Civ 5 at launch. Despite all of it's problems, the game has many great ideas that wants to be explored. It just needs a major expansion pack to fix it.

I say wait to this game is discounted or until the expansion pack comes out.

I completely disagree.
This game offers a refreshing take on the Civilization series. I've loved previous Civilization titles, and although this game runs on the Civilization V engine, things are very different.
The tech web makes the game different each time. Rather than researching the next step to victory, you research what your civilization needs, whether that is food, science, culture or production. You choose the path and this makes your play far more individual than to any others.
Affinities are perhaps to some of you, a reboot of your ideology in Civ V, but if you just take the time to look a little closer. They are actually completely different ways of play, while ideologies gave you bonuses for production or perhaps a 10% science boost. Your affinity changes your military, your cities, what you can actually build and what resources its useful to have. It also completely changes your play style because you need to achieve a different victory.
Virtues, admittedly they do look a lot like social policies, but, again, delving deeper you'll see that they provide much better bonuses and are much, much more diverse and more open to individual play. You will get bonuses for specializing, or diversifying. And ultimately, this is the sole purpose for culture, so it had to be powerful, which it is.
Diplomacy is much the same as Civ V, however, they've balanced your relationship with the AI with the new favors feature. You will gain and spend favors so that you can perhaps get repaid when you gave the Pan-Asians some gold when they hit hard times, rather than the AI never repaying as they did in Civ V.
The aliens, unlike the barbarians actually mean something late game, they will either help or hinder you. Perhaps if you choose Harmony as your affinity then you can call worms, and create loyal versions of the native creatures, perhaps if you choose supremacy, they will constantly try and wipe you off the planet, the point is, they are relevant late game, because unlike barbarians, which could never do even a little damage to a city, they are dangerous, and can wipe out an explorer instantly, right at the start of the game.
Quests are completely new and give you bonuses right throughout the game, they are useful and plentiful. They will offer you an opportunity to complete a series of tasks, in return for a reward, often you get the choice, in order to advance your civilization in the way that you need to. This creates another way to customize your civilization and get a different play style to your opponents and allies.
The orbital layer is something that is not to be overlooked, you can launch satellites to improve the land around, shoot lasers down on your foes, improve science, culture, energy, growth, production and more. These can provide a strategic advantage in battle (I find that an orbital laser above an enemy city can prove useful...) and they can provide other advantages such as increasing stats or even defending against spies and creating strategic resources.

All in all. Civilization Beyond Earth is more replayable, more fun and more individual than Civilization V. Yes, there are some features that are pretty much unchanged. But there are also some new features such as the orbital layer, there are some well improved features, such as technology and there are some things that work better in this game than they did in any other before. I think its polished and excellent. It exceeds Civilization V in my view, and that's saying something because Civilization V was frightfully epic.

Pros:
-Interesting graphics and alien/unit designs
-The tech “web” is an interesting concept. It certainly could have been polished better but it adds more strategy than normal Civ's tech trees.
-Interesting victory conditions that don't all come down to conquer/dominate/convert all other factions.
Cons:
-The factions and leaders feel shallow and underdeveloped. You're really just choosing your unit color and city names rather than choosing between unique factions.
-The wild aliens are a menace at the beginning of the game but, after that, are just annoying for the rest of the game.
-They took the diplomacy system of Civ5, took away the good parts, and added in a weird... deal... system... thing...

This game is very engaging, at least to me. The one thing I found unfortunate is how the technology and the potential ""foes"" all play toward never actually getting into a protracted war. I submit also, that the defense levels of cities is unrealistic. I enter for proof how, within the first 50 to 100 turns of the game 20 tanks cannot take a city despite having most of the combat achievements completed. I thus suggest that this game was designed to deny a quick warlike resolution to competition in preference for keeping people at the table, in the game longer. While I don't want to give the game a NO recommendation (I like playing it for other reasons), I must say it is as if Ghandi and King designed it.

Personally I enjoyed the game a lot. Especially with the Rising Tide DLC it is a pretty decent game. Too bad they abandoned the project so unfortunately there won't be any further DLCs to flesh out the experience.

If you are looking for a game like Alpha Centauri then I would not recommend this game to you because this is nothing like it. However if you played the heck out of Civilization V and don't like Civilization VI then I would suggest you give this one a try. Think of Beyond Earth not as a standalone game but rather as the final DLC to Civilization V that takes you on a journey to other planets after winning the science victory in Civilization V. 

You most definately will not get as many hours out of this as you got with Civilization 5 but then this game also has only 1 real DLC and therefore can never compete with the complexity of Civilization 5 which has far more.

Part of me feels it should have just been an update / extension to Civ V rather than a stand alone game. On the other hand, given the odd colony back ground information you learn ingame you can see why it's a stand alone title (though...isnt it supposed to be a continuation from a science win in Civ V)? Visually the games just a reskin of Civ V making it feel like a mod at times but the music sure is haunting.  The Wonders are...well lacking any level of detail about them other than a short voice over, there's way to many end game units to choose from and Aliens are nothing more than roaming barbarians you can choose to ignore or battle. 
 
Beyond Earth can be good at times and over the last 3 years I've clocked up a bit of play time always hoping Firaxis would address those issues but they never did and now Beyond Earth is all but abandonded it seems. 

I cant really recommened the game at it's current full price though.  Whilst its a decent enough game, it only becomes that  with Rising Tide. Since Beyond Earth is close to 3 years old and desperatly needs the Rising Tides expansion to fill out gameply issues, it's going to cost you about £55 to buy. Meanwhile Firaxis just went ahead and released starships as a standalone game then Civ 6 rather than fix any underlying issues of Beyond Earth. 

£20 or less for Beyond Earth + Rising Tide...have at it. £55 for the pair...avoid like the plague as you can get alterntive, if not better games of this genere for a much better price.",1499892921,1499893018,False,11,0,0.599287271499633789,0,True,False,False

I have read other reviews and I see that this game gets a lot of heat from fans of Alpha Centauri and the other Civilization games. In a sense, its not fair to compare the game to any of the others in the series because of either a lapse in time (Alpha Centauri) or the sheer difference in content (Civilization series). I think the game is definitely not as deep as a traditional civilization game, but that is because it doesn't have thousands of years of history to lean on. Therefore, the game has to rise or fall on what the creative elements are. I think the three factions are perfect in that they are distinguishable, believable, and seem to encapsulate the options that could face humanity. I like the aliens dynamic and the tech tree web. I think the tech tree web makes games more interesting instead of the linear tech tree in a traditional civilization game. I also like the factions, I think the vanilla factions were well thought out, although the Rising Tide factions are not exciting to me. I like the outpost idea and I love that units upgrade based upon your affinity level. Nothing frustrates me more than paying to upgrade units in a traditional civilization game. I like the options to customize your loadout before you start a game and I like being able to pick where I land. I like the addition of the marvel quests, more diplomatic options, and the artifacts in Rising Tide. I am disappointed with the lack of other DLC as it feels like Firaxis has abandoned the game.

It's much, much worse.
It features:
-Crappy-looking, small, and unintuitive UI. Civ V's user-friendly and easy-use UI is replaced with futuristic, square garbage.
-A confusing and cramped tech tree that throws the balance and forward flow of previous Civ games' technology systems out the window. It's unclear in which order techs are supposed to be advanced, either for specific goals or for plain efficiency, and while this does give the player more freedom, it also opens the door to extreme imbalance. I get that this was going to be harder since BE doesn't have previous Civ games' advantage of historical tech trees but it's done quite poorly.
-Reskinned social policies that offer a grand total of 4 different policy trees. Not even close to sufficient. They are somewhat larger than those of Civ V but still offer less unique optimization and direction for your civ to go in.
-A redone version of Ideologies from the Brave New World expansion for Civ V, except they start at the beginning of the game and you ""unlock"" things by researching certain techs. As far as I can tell, they have pretty minimal effect, except they help you win? Maybe? I don't even know if you can unlock them outside of tech. Pretty much the three ideologies (Harmony, Purity, and Supremacy) are really cool lorewise/conceptually, but fall totally flat in practice and just make the other civs who choose different ideologies hate you.
-Unit upgrades. This is a cool idea, as it took the place of units earning their stripes through combat and instead they upgrade from tech and maybe ideology? I'm not sure. However, the downside to this is that they took away actual unit promotions, leaving just the instant 50HP heal or some standard 10% strength upgrade. Promotions were conspicuous in their absence and the upgrades through tech were not a good enough replacement by any standard.
-Barbarians, except instead of barbarians they're aliens, which is cool, except instead of just being hostile they have an opinion towards you, except there isn't anywhere to actually see what their opinion of you is except by the colour of their icons. It took me about three hours into a game and a wonder that mentioned ""Alien Opinion"" before I realized this was a thing and they didn't just randomly switch icon colours.
-Diplomacy which is severely lacking, much like that of Civ V, so not that big of a disappointment except there's also no diplomacy screen where you can see each leader. Big, annoying loss. In a similar vein lots of little things which were very useful in Civ V, like the hex grid option, strategic/luxury resource icons, and the demographics interface were all missing.
-Health, which replaced happiness and is even more annoying as only specific buildings/policies increase it, not luxury resources, and the same things decrease it, making early game expansion far more difficult. All resources are strategic, although it's still unclear to me which ones are actually useful and which are the equivalent of cows.
-Victories. The victories in this game, much like the ideologies, seem really cool lorewise but again fall short when applied. I'm still not sure of anything regarding the confusing new Victories (you research techs, then build some stuff and then you need points or something) except Domination is still one of them.
-Ten or so civilizations, which is way, way less than I expected and wanted. They lacked the pull of having cool historical leaders, which isn't really possible in the setting of the game, so fine, but they also all had bland, boring abilities that didn't particularly interest me at all.
-Quests, which are the only good thing this game added. Random encounters and benefits you get from them, all with lore, were a nice win.

Unfortunately, as Quests were the only upgrade to this game from previous Civ titles and everything else was a severe downgrade, I can't recommend this game. It's worth mentioning that I don't have the DLC (Rising Tide), and it is apparently pretty good, but it doesn't appear to fix most of these glaring problems, and instead probably adds more with all the aquatic stuff.

Yes, yes, let there be love, provided…

1. You play with the Rising Tide DLC and certain game-enhancing mods.

2. You do not expect a new species of Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri, that 1999 gem of planeteering .

Alpha Centauri and Beyond Earth are really two different species. 

With Beyond Earth, those clever developers at Firaxis started out with some fascinating ideas for a game set on another planet but then… well, something happened. Perhaps they lost that essential inventive, inspired edge crucial to all successful game developers. Instead of dreaming a game that was truly “out of this world” they fell back on the conventions and game mechanics of Civ 5. 

Not that this was a tragic mistake; it just leaves the gamer with a certain unfulfilled feeling, a yearning for what might have been. Still what we get is quite engaging, wonderfully colorful maps to explore festooned with secrets for your explorers to dig up, upgradeable weaponeers, odd wonders to build, an expansive tech tree, affinities and virtues that add variety and spice to the unfolding events, several interesting victories to strive for. BE does have some dandy toys.

But not the “sponsors.” What a pack of dullards they turned out to be! Whenever Suzanne Fielding of the ARC drones yet again: “As Adam Smith once said, trade is the lifeblood of nations” I gnash my teeth and rend mine garments. Why is it in all these years strategy developers have not been able to improve upon the eccentric, conniving, endearing denizens of Alpha Centauri? Where art thou, Son of Yang of the Hive?

I mentioned mods. With a grateful nod to their creators, I use most of the “Awesome” mods, “Immersive Armies”, and “Visually Distinctive Terrains.” Add these mods and you’ll have a ton of fun and, perhaps, just perhaps, develop some genuine love for the game. 

It’s a pity that the Firaxis team “abandoned” the game after the “Rising Tide” expansion. Sad example of what happens all too often in the gaming world. The devs pack up their gear and move on, leaving a good game dangling with a lot of tantalizing possibilities. By contrast, think of Amplitude Studios and what they’ve done with their line of “Endless” games. They continue to polish and improve. They add love. Kudos to them. And shame on you Firaxis for abandoning your bright, bouncing baby and leaving her to be found along the River of No Return and raised by the hatchlings of a Lush Protean World.

Graphically its well tuned and can easily be ran same as Civ5. Gameplay itself is rather interesting to be honest. Replace Religion or the ideology from Civ5 with Affinty. As you are now a Civilization on a new plaent you effectly now can form them however you'd like (Purity - Human's stay True to humanity, Harmony - humans blend with aliens to adapt, Supremacy - Cyborgs and such) there is also a blending of these as well so you are not locked into any one affinity, however certain ones are tied to certain victories. Affinty is earned via technology and quests, and give bonuses to your civ at certain levels, as well as upgrade your units and give you unique units that based on that Affinty. Aliens themselves are more or less insectoid in nature (think Starship Troopers) and represent barbarians from previous Civ games. However these are tameble and tie into other aspects of the game. Spies have more actions they can perform such as steazling science and energy, as well as recuiting defectors and even smuggling nukes into enemy civ's cities and leading a coup de ta ( literally overthrowing the city and giving it to you).

Fleeing Earth after the Great Mistake that ruined it, you land on a distant planet to establish a new world, building cities, dealing with rival factions and determining the ideological path you want humanity to take for its future to come. This review takes into account the [i]Rising Tides[/i] expansion set.

[b]Pros[/b]: After picking from one of twelve sponsors and customizing your faction, you start off with a single colony, building units, researching technologies (through an improved tech-web) and expanding your borders. You also manage (or automate) trade routes between your cities, other factions and neutral outposts. You can now build floating cities that behave differently from land cities: land cities expand their borders through Culture points, while floating cities claim territory by moving around. Also, while land has plains, grasslands, hills and forests, the sea bed will have coasts, reefs and oceans floors with its own lot of strategic resources and unique bonus resources. The five biomes are more than land/alien color palettes, they determine the map generator's algorithm, defines alien strength, speed and behavior (much more varied than the barbarians from [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/][i]Civilization V[/i][/url]), and each biome has a unique Marvel quest. The reimagined diplomatic system is a breath of fresh air from former games of the franchise: gone are the resource trading and tribute paying, you now accumulate Diplomatic Capital points from buildings and agreements others buy from you, which you then spend in purchasing agreements from others and picking personality traits (each unlocks bonuses and unique agreements). Peace treaties are now negotiated with the new Spoils of War system, comparing scores from both sides' war accomplishments, the difference is then used to determine the ""payment"" (technologies, cities, resources) the loosing faction grants the war's victor. Furthermore, A.I. behavior is now defined in fear and respect levels: fear being your military strength compared to theirs, while respect rises and falls over time based on how well your faction is performing (ex: production rate, health, land improvement, each rival caring about different things) and actions you take (ex: build wonders, attack common enemy's city, sign agreement with common friend). Through science and a few mini-quests, you accumulate points in one of three different human evolution paths: human purity, cybernetics or gene tempering, eventually settling into either of six paths (the three affinities and three half/half hybrids), giving a much needed variety to factions' tactics and appearance. Archaeology comes around with its own twist, as you dig up artifacts that can be consumed for an immediate bonus, or collected for a larger bonus (including unlocking unique wonders). The game looks awesome graphically, and the soundtrack is worthy of a space opera epic.

[b]Cons[/b]: As was case with previous games of the franchise, it's an incredible resource hog, each passing turns getting slower as the game progresses no manner how powerful your PC is. The performance issues also cause textures to occasionally load wrong, and the game is constantly re-applying textures as you move around the map. The fact that each factions are randomly customized for each playthrough removed a lot of the individual personality rival civilizations had in past games. You get so many bonuses (affinities bonuses, building bonuses, sponsor bonuses, diplomatic agreement bonuses, Wonder bonuses, etc) that they become meaningless as they aren't as fun to get anymore. Even with all the biomes, planets, and customization, the game still feels somewhat repetitive from one playthrough to another and I can't put my finger on exactly why.

[b]Verdict[/b]: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!

This is not Alpha Centauri 2, but it's still a pretty good game (just as long as you get the [i]Rising Tides[/i] expansion set. Seriously, it's required). The re-thought diplomacy, its twist on water-cities and archaeology, and all the flexibility for buildings, units and factions, are enough to make it its own thing. It might not live up to everyone's expectations, but I'll nevertheless be getting a few hundred hours of gameplay by the time my focus turns to [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/][i]Civilization VI[/i][/url], which in my book is plenty of bang for my buck. For all its flaws, it's still a game I recommend.

Very few civs
Health, replacing happiness, almost always goes down unless you focus on just that
Civs never declare war in the beginning, making armies useless until late game

Why I do Like this game though:
Aliens are way more fun to fight than barbarians
Early game can always be different
Web research tree works great for this
Armies are *WAY* more interesting

1. some customers they are Sci-Fi fans. What they were expecting before purchasing were spaceships, laser guns and high-intelligence aliens. There are so many sci-fi products on the market, and most of them are focusing on combat, unlike Beyond Earth.
These customers didn't expected that in this game they will have to spend hundreds of turns to FINALLY see what they really want to see at the beginning.

2. some customers they had a deep experience with Civ 4 or Civ 5, they are real ""history fans"". They love to see those countries, cultures, leaders and weapons they know appear in game. However, this game Beyond Earth, I have to say, will certainly disappoint them.

3. some customers, when they are playing the Civ games, instead of enjoy the sence of human-history, they perfer the concept of the ""Anthropology"". They dont need to be Anthropology major, but they really love to spend some time every day to silghtly learn and experience the human society development process, in a causual way like gaming. For these customers, i would say they might like Beyond Earth, they might not like it.

But, regarding the quality of the game development, nice UI with Sci-Fi taste, nice features, highly detailed terrain, plants and alien-animals are great imagines! And most importantly, the BGM, they are, although not as cultural as Civ 5, but BGM in this game they are matching the space theme, and they sounds EPIC!

But I must say this one for me does not hold up to the quality I expect from civilization games at all, and I am not just refering to a couple of design flaws, the game is notorious for getting bugs and have the game crash between turns or during loading a savegame, making me unable to finish my game at all.

I guess if you aimed simply for the shortest path to victory, with no more than a handfull of city's, do not load savegames and play in one single playtrough this is playable, but even that is no guarantee for no facing game crashes. And any game that just does not work properly, even if it has some merit I will have to advise against buying.

Overall this game just lacks the ""just one more turn"" that for me enbody's civilization, and trades it in for ""aim for the shortest path to victory"" the hardest opponent you will fight is the constant crashes, and bad game design.

If you love Civilization, I'd advise against buying this one.

Now as for the game features itself

The Bad :
 
-your diplomatic options to end a war are severely limited : you cannot declare peace no matter how well you fight untill the enemy is willing to talk with you, meaning you'll have to wait many turns after already winning the war. You cannot vassalise your enemy's nor demand a minimum number of turns of peace of them, only a very small bit of their money and perhaps 1 or 2 city's that are much easier to conquer than to politically aquire.
-speaking of war, the AI is acting random, one moment your allied, helping them in war, agreeing on everything they want from you, the next they suddenly declare war for no obvious reason, you may have 9 relationship and 9 fear from them, they still do this.
-trade is non-existant, you cannot sell or buy technology, city's or even strategic goods with the other players.
-you cannot delite city's you build, only hope your enemy conquers them and burns them down.
-you cannot delite tile improvements ever, you can replace them with other improvements, but aside from remove road there is no way.
-if you pillage tile improvements it only damages them, not removes them.
-the ability of satelites to generation new resources only works on uninproved tiles (and you cannot turn improved tiles back into unimproved ones) and this ability gets available to late in game. Also it seems to be per satelite, meaning that in later game when your satelites last 360 turns, instead of 60, you just will have to wait 6 times longer to get those tile bonusses
-it is not possible to move a city from land to sea or reverse as was possible in this games predecessor alpha centauri
-water city's do not culturally expand, and can only take the tiles next to it, when moving, so they can only can grab coastal tiles, not inland ones.
-buying tiles is empire wide, making it insanely expensive to buy more than a handfull of tiles empire wide, further making water city's less usable/.
-it is not possible to culturally push borders or buy tiles your enemy controls
-you cannot change your unit upgrades after you selected one, so you are forced to stick with a bad chooice and/or delay upgrading a long time.
-there are tons on types of impassible and unbuildable tiles, making the concept of controlling the entire map, with hundreds of city's a chalenging puzzle to say the least and not a fun one.
-to few relics on even the largest of maps to unlock all wonders, buildings and ability's, it's always waiting wich one you'll get this time.
-while from a playable vieuwpoint you can control many city's if you not want to lose you still are limited to a maximum of 15, and more realistic 5-8 city's, as every city still increases the cost of reasearch and civilization bonusses and virtues a lot.
-this game even on the hardest difficulty is ridicously easy, oh the AI cheats and will beat you in any victory condition on hard difficulty, but it will build hardly any buildings or units, forcing you to an easy domination victory all day every day.

The Good :

-there are satelites in game that generate new bonus and strategic resources on tiles that not yet have any. 
-you can build city's in the water that can move and hence can be relocated to a better position if so needed.
-you can grab a few extra tiles inside your borders by moving an floating city even if those tiles belong to your opponent.
-while you do unlock new units, you can unlock 3 tiers upgrades for regulair and 1 tier upgrade for special units. In every tier you have 1, 3 or even 6 multiple possible bonusses each unlocked by differentpre-requestments and those bonusses do stack alowing for a lot of unit customisation without overcomplicating things.
-it is again possible to own hundreds of city's and still have postibe health, the effects of ""corruption"" in this game called unhealth, have been tuned down to more reasonable levels.
-while this game still has the hated 1 unit per tile, at least in this game it is per type. I can have 1 military unit and 1 non military (trade unit, worker, settler) working/guarding the same tile, making this limit much more playable.
-lots of ruins to explore that yield relics that in turn can unlock special ability's, buildings or even wonders that cannot be obtained any other way.
-customisable civilization, a custom civ bonus that cannot be changed, though it can be upgraded, and you can pick 3 more, 1 from each group of 8 available bonusses those 3 you can change mid-game if you so please.
-no goverment type, but you get to pick from a wide range of virtues you unlock during the game that grand permanent bonusses, including extra bonusses for having enough of the same tier, or type on top of that alowing quite flexible playtrough.

THE GOOD:
-Basically Civilization V... IN SPACE!
-Tons of customizability for how you want your civilization to develop.
-Original lore and world-building that proves fascinating and overall very interesting.
-Unique biomes for each game that gives a fresh new look to planets.
-Well thought-out tech web that allows for non-linear development.
-Tons of flexibility on how to play.
-Has full Steam Workshop supports, and some mods make the experience even better.
-Fantastic music score.
-Great graphics.
-Aliens are a fantastic replacement for Barbarians.
-Stable game performance.*

THE BAD:
-Basically a reskin of Civilization V
-While not flat, leaders are less larger-than-life than they were in Civilization V.
-Alien menace makes earlygame a toughie to survive.
-Diplomacy still needs work.
-AI is pretty stupid at times.
-Some faction bonuses are better than others.

* = Do know that I have a 2016 model of an Alienware, so my exemption from a lot of reported buggy crashes may be because of my computer.

Initially, I was pretty wary on buying this game, especially since it received a lot of controversy for being a reskinned Civilization V with several tweaks, and... that presumption is largely correct. Despite it being my first ever Civilization game, Civilization: Beyond Earth had an uncanny amount of similarities with Civilization V (which I bought at a later date). I understand the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" approach Firaxis took with this game, yet I also understand why it upset a lot of people, especially those who are die-hard SMACers.

That said, this game has proven to be my favorite game in the series so far, controversy be damned. Even though on paper, Civilization V is the better game by far, I honestly couldn't help but greatly enjoy Beyond Earth far more that I enjoy Civilization V.

There's two big reasons why I feel this way: the customizability of the civilizations, and the lore and story behind the game. In regards to the former point, Civilization: Beyond Earth gives an unprecedented degree of freedom for you to build your own civilizations however you please, customizing everything from what it's tools, colonists and specialty is aimed towards, to it's unique sponsors that represents a nation from Earth, to the lategame-defining Affinities, where you choose from one of three ideologies to shape your game experience as a whole. While Civilization V is a damn good game, it honestly felt claustrophobic over the direction the faction I chose guided me in: Danes are strongly encouraged to conquer everything they see, and Indians are nudged to be a peace-keeping nation as a whole. Overall, it felt pretty restrictive what each nation can do, and the great part about Civilization: Beyond Earth is that you can choose the nation you like the most and play however you want to play it as. This was highly enjoyable for me, and the mod support giving access to great mods like the Nordic Union, Japanese Empire and so on only further made the game fun.

The latter point is that I feel the game does a great job at creating a unique and intrinsic world in the distant future than rely on history. I was able to enjoy the game far more than Civilization V, not only because the reasons for the atypical Civilization game had it's own justifications, but that there's a LOT of cool information and lore to be found in the Civilopedia, which has an entire library's worth of information on the game's world, politics, infrastructure, and even biology and ecosystem of the planet, which does a lot to make the world I'm playing it feel more than a wargame.

Aside from these extraordinary aspects, the game plays similarly to any Civilization game: you build up your empire, try to reach the victory for the faction all while plotting world domination or some other victory of some kind. I guess the reason why so many people were disappointed by this game is because there were plenty of expectations of it being the second coming of Alpha Centauri, but I don't think that's a fair comparison, especially when the game is executed far differently than that game. Does that mean you'll enjoy this game?

Well, it depends. I don't recommend getting it at it's lofty price, but is it still a good game? In my honest opinion, yes, yes it is. I still recommend that you get the game on sale than buy it at full price, but it's still a very good game, and if you want a Extraterrestrial Colony similator, well...

8/10 - Not as deep as Civ 5, but a bit quicker to play as turns for the A.I don't take forever. 

The long Review: 

Having poured countless hours into Civ 5 I was very curious about what changes were brought into this game, and I'm pleased to say I'm happy with the majority of them. 

Where some people will critise this game for playing it safe and not adding much to the series, I personally think it's kept familiar on purpose, so the initiated can appreciate the new additions and not have to contend with learning a whole new method of playing. This Game is very use friendly for both new and returning players. 

It's more of the same, but it's more streamlined then previous entries into the series. The overhauled U.I makes things simpler and you feel less bogged down in menus compared to Civ 5, the espionage system is a great addition and is very easy to learn and monitor. With the ability to use spies to steal tech, plant bombs and even instigate politic uprising in other Civs nations is a great addition. 

The Civs you play as and with are a bit lacking in the personality department, and they're a bit bland without defining bonuses like previous games, the ones they offer are sort of generic, but that's my only criticism of them. They either like you or hate you depending on your affinity which is fair enough to me. 

Speaking of affinity, there's the best addition to the game. A System where research or quest decisions affects which affinity (of the three) you learn towards, each offer new unit skins and bonuses, depending on which affinity you mean more towards, and even specialised hybrid affinity units if you favour more then one or research tech that encompasses more then one affinity at a time.

8/10 - overall a solid entry into the series, with some fresh ideas, albeit with a familiar feeling that doesn't alienate players of previous games",1493935042,1493937158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a result, Earth was overpopulated, its resources exhausted, and everyone was forced to watch Reality TV.  Because Reality TV is an abomination, it led to a thermonuclear war called, ""The Great Mistake"", an obvious reference to The Bachelor.  After decades, humanity recovered and sent an expedition to a distant world...

[i]Beyond Earth[/i], or ""Beyonce"" as I like to think of it, is a 4X strategy game set in the distant future.  A number of factions land on an alien world filled all sorts of resources, but also all sorts of dangers.  There's all sorts of ways to win (and, for other factions to beat you.)  I could easily go on and on about the mechanics, but this is the wrong place for that; it's much better to talk about that in [b]What Works[/b], [b]What Doesn't Work[/b], and the [b]TL;DR[/b] of why this game, easily considered one of the worst in the Civilization franchise if not the worst, gets a thumbs up from me.

[b]What Works[/b]
First, if you're a Civilization V player, you'll notice huge similarities; that's because this game is built on the Civ V engine.  The UI is really polished and does its best to let you focus on making strategic decisions...even if there's problems with how exactly that happens, which we'll get to.  The point is, the UI doesn't get in your way, something I rarely get to say with most of my Steam reviews.  It's refreshing to praise the UI of a game, for once.

The various paths can be really, really satisfying.  Do you want genetically-enhanced humans riding alien bugs into battle?  You can do that.  Do you want to create a warp gate that lets your faction of cyborgs waltz through and take over Earth?  That's another possible way to end the game.  Your 'Affinity' is defined by both research projects you complete, as well as rare other actions like completing mini-quests, and it changes both your units, and your leader.  It's a cool concept, and one I'd like to see in more games - multiple diverging ways to win.

Lastly, the music is very well-done.  In my experience as a gamer, music is an absolute deal-breaker, and the tracks well-suit the environment of the game.  The music also changes as you change; go for a Harmony, or 'let's become one with the Planet, but less like Sephiroth' path, and you get some interesting, sweeping orchestral music.  Go for giant death robots, and you get something more technological.  It's a neat touch to reinforce the weight of the decisions you make.

[b]What Doesn't Work[/b]
The tech tree in general.

Some people will compare the game to Civ V, and blame it on familiarity of technology.  That's valid, but not what I see to be the true problem with Beyonce's tech tree.  The problem, is that the game simply doesn't give you enough up-front information to make informed decisions.  Being an experienced player can mitigate this somewhat, but frequently it's the case that a particular research will simply not grant the affinity you'd expect it to.  Put differently - the tech tree's contents are counter-intuitive, a big problem in this sort of game, where you're dealing with a lot of information at any given time; help the players by making some things 'obvious', or at least, not completely cryptic.

This game is an obvious spiritual successor to Sid Meyer's Alpha Centauri, but without the vision that made that game work, of the factions slowly evolving into their relationship with Planet, as well as the default enmities with each other based on established politics.  Why should Brazil and the African Coalition be opponents?  Why not!?  Oh, it makes sense from the 'this is a game!' perspective, but by having certain factions be hostile or friendly by default, it gives a certain grounding to the game experience...something that, in addition to the cryptic research system, this game lacks.

More concretely, the AI is somehow even worse than Civ V's, despite being built on the same engine.  In my most recent game, for example, The Franco-Iberians got me and the Asian Consortium to go to war with the Serbian-whoevertheyares (I'm going to call them ""Nikolai Tesla: The Faction"".)  After sailing some of my basic units over - losing one to shelling from their capitol - I managed to not only defeat two infantry units, but when he retailiated by storming one of my coastal cities with overwhelming naval force - btw, I sunk a battleship with a squad of machine gunners - he immediately sued for peace, despite having overwhelming force, and that city nearly razed to the ground.  I had no right to emerge ""victorious"" from that.  I could chalk it up to being on a 'normal' difficulty, but even then...that's pretty dumb, even by normal difficulty standards.

[b]The TL;DR[/b]
This is a game I like, and enjoy.  This is also a game with serious problems in the content.  To say it's not for everyone is like saying, ""the sky is blue!""

For my part, [b]I recommend it.[/b]  While the problems are immersion-breaking, they're not breaking enough to suspend my enjoyment of this work, or needing to play just one more turn!

This work does need to be improved, though, or iterated upon to reduce some cognitive load on the player.  The suggestion others have made that, when dealing with stuff that can't possibly be familiar to players, you need to be more obvious, is absolutely valid, and really needs to happen.

Lastly, a word of warning - it's been a while since this game was released.  That being said, [b][i][u]NEVER BUY A FIRAXIS GAME ON LAUNCH DAY.[/u][/i][/b]  They're just not worth it at that point; if you wait a couple of years for patches and stuff to enhance the game, you'll be a lot better off.

Unfortunately, despite my enjoyment, and recommendation, of this title, it's also a truth that this is probably easily the weakest Civ title out there.  I'd suggest trying it, and seeing if it's OK to you; remember that the 2-hour/14-day refund policy exists, and that you can and should take advantage of it when necessary.",1493182029,1493182029,True,11,2,0.569707691669464111,0,True,False,False

(Though I question most Mods) The entire game is more balanced, focused, and entertaining with turn after turn of movement with units, and research, that may I say, was finnaly rebalanced, after you could accidentally fuck up, and earn a free tech..... When you researched it all with Affinity/Virtues.... You have a trait of evolution, mixed with added bonuses for tiles and rescources, that could either A.) Add more resource earnings from tile/building or B.) Focus on a certain thing to be built within a less amount of turns, then it originally is.

I can't help but feel let down. I've played the game off and on since shortly after it's release so I've noticed alot of changes to the game.
With the Rising Tide DLC the game becomes actually playable. The AI doesn't just get offended by every action you make that doesn't directly benefit them anymore and that's nice. I like that you can now trade diplomatic advantages instead of -just- resources, but having that part completely removed from the game sucks. Sometimes I'd like to trade some titanium I have no use for for some research per turn. Why can't I do that anymore?
The aliens AI has be significantly improved. Now they don't simply attack you every chance they get, and ther don't kamikaze on you either.
The addition of aquatic cities was a must and they did a good job with it. I'm happy about that.
Quick side notes:
I don't care if it ruined old Earth, I want nukes.
Orbital stations/cities should be added to the game.
Subterranian station/cities should be too.
Trade stations show up too quickly and disappear too quickly. Unless you prioritize trade from the beginning you often lose out on trading with the first station.
There isn't enough explanation on wonders and all the images for wonders look the same.

Positive points: 
- Provides a twist on the main series if you want a change of scenery
- Visually quite pleasing, especially the different biomes of the planets, giving it some replayability
- Continues the journey after the science victory in the main series

Negatives: 
- Very limited selection of factions, and factions lack personality
- Voice acting is extremely bad
- Lacks a feeling of ""polish"" - seems rushed
- Not intuitive (e.g. tech names, resources and concepts)
- Diplomacy makes no sense

Do not compare this to SMAC - you will be very disappointed, as SMAC is a much better game, with a much better story, excellent factions and fantastic voice acting, keeping you invested in the experience. I would recommend buying SMAC instead if you are looking for a space strategy adventure, even if the graphics are now sorely outdated.

Otherwise, save your money. It improved...somewhat, with the DLC, but it's very obvious that after its release Firaxis moved away from this project faster than Subway moved away from Jared Fogle. Some of the science fiction concepts are neat, but for the most part the lore is really a bunch of pretentious and nonsensical takes on science concepts made by in-game characters and voiced by some diversity-hire mystery meat lady.

The tech ""web"" and affinity were interesting concepts, but unfortunately executed poorly. You basically get to choose between the Galactic Empire, Warhammer 40k, Avatar/Fern Gully or some bastard combination of any two depending on your quest and tech decisions. Besides some civ-wide benefits which get overshadowed by upper-tier ""virtues"", these affinities really only change the aesthetics of your civ (the sleek transcendentalism of Supremacy, the quite literally W40k aesthetic of Purity, or the fugly space-hippy concept art of Harmony). You also get some unique units which act as counters to each other and to pretty much all of the regular units.

Culture can be totally broken, and at some point you either win an early Contact victory or you follow some stale metagame into any of the other victory conditions. After you've played through each civ once, you really don't feel inclinded to play them again a different way. The civs themselves are also seem to be an ideologic leftist-globalist concept of what a post-catastrophic Earth would look like, which shouldn't surprise many as to why they're so bland--the only moderately interesting civ is the North Sea Alliance, whereas the rest are either future versions of stereotypes or an appeal to Diversity™ as is the case with the ""American"" civ. Let's be honest, in no universe--especially one where slavs run the slavic civ and indians run the indian civ--is there a latinx Career Female running a corporate government on the North American continent and is able to compete with other space-faring organizations.

The combat is more or less the same as in Civ5, and some of the soundtrack is admittedly pretty dope. Planet customization is pretty cool too, and maybe offer the only reason you'd want to play the game more than once.

2 things are common knowledge; 1} that we cannot travel to other worlds and colonize them yet, and 2} the ability to do so would require a major advance in techology and understanding of science and the universe.

Why then would Aircraft carriers regress in the future? Currently they can hold tens of planes, but according to the game they can only hold 1. I understand limiting the number they can hold for strategy and simplicities sake but seriously? Only one?

It's the future, why are animals so destructive? Wouldn't we be able to figure out some effective and efficient way to deal with them?

Why is diplomacy so basic and limited?

+ The 'one more turn' mentality is still present in full force
+ Indigenous wildlife boasts much more of a challenge, of a variety, and of a better collective design than barbarians of the previous installments
+ Combat against cities and units is as well-implemented and satisfying as ever; the audio design and smooth animations make for a very fulfilling experience
+ Upgrades are free of resources requirements and are universally applied amongst all units of that type; does well to eliminate the need to hunt down and manage obsolete units
+ Research tree is vastly improved; it can be daunting at first, but the superiority of this system comes through on subsequent playthroughs (once the player is more familiar with the 'branches and leaves' and what they unlock)
+ The three possible affinities are a welcome addition and do much to offer great variety and customization in the mid- to late-game
+ 'Favors' are a very welcome concept, and work perfectly to improve productivity of player-AI interactions and general diplomacy
+ Sleek, aesthetically pleasing, and functional UI
+ Effortless and rewarding to experiment with mods through the Steam workshop
+ Satellites are a welcome addition, adding another layer of possible resource buffs to the game without cluttering the map
+ Stunning environment designs; flora and resources really stand out in beautiful and creative ways
+ Espionage and trade work in largely the same ways as in Civ V, with some minor improvements

- Culture is now an empty and lifeless statistic in the absence of art, musicians, etc.
- Confusing loss of custom game modifiers as compared to the previous installment of the series
- Steep learning curve, mostly due to alien and unfamiliar terrain features
- Finishing a game is underwhelming, and does little to reward the player, especially compared to previous installments
- Health, as a resource, seems to be a slightly poorer implementation than the happiness of Civ V, and feels unreasonably difficult to manage effectively
- There are no more natural wonders to be found, taking a bit of fun and reward out of exploration
- Quests are boring and repetitive; they do little to add to the game's dimensions
- The available factions feel somewhat bland and uninteresting
- There are no faction-specific units; the only difference between factions lies in the starting bonuses
- AI have almost no aggression factor whatsoever, even into upper middling levels of difficulty

-Great design
-Better aliens
-Respect/Fear additions in diplomacy

Speaking of affinities, this is where most of my appeal in the game comes from; it genuinely dives into possible future paths for humanity, especially on the themes of transhumanism, extropianism or simply traditional humanism.

It's issues are mainly balance issues, mixed with a few fundamental flaws. The most unpleasant being the technology curve.

Your cities can produce buildings much faster than you can research tech for new buildings, even when you focus mainly on getting science. This is something that happens in civ 5 when you don't build any science buildings, but happens all the time in Civ BERT. In Civ BERT, there is never enough science, forcing you to build armys or developments to pass the extra free turns, which leaves you with that deeply unpleasant feeling of not using your time optimally. Now it is possible to play in a way that you don't run out of shit to build, which is how I play, it's just that it's annoying.

Now normally you would think that in this kind of situation where you have extra production, that you would put your production to something constructive like getting more settlements, but due to how health and the number of city's effect on science and culture, it is counter productive. More cities means more science and culture costs, and more unhealth, which means negative percent culture and science costs which ultimately results in you getting even less technology, which means now you're bogged down with low health little technology gains and still nothing to build. What's worse is that culture rounds down, as in if you have even a -1% culture modifier, all your cities will produce 1 less culture (Going the 8% culture domestic policy is a great way to counter this btw). Culture is the only way to get health early on outside of diplomatic policies, meaning that the speed at which you get the solution to your health problems is now much slower thanks to your new cities. It really is getting stuck in the mud.

Another problem that I will quickly mention is that there is far too much good land to settle on, and not enough incentive for taking other peoples land. This is once again because there is too little health and no luxery resource system that would make such an opperation worth it. You take over someone elses shit not because you want their stuff, but because you want to elimate a player. You settle not where there are unique luxery resources, but based on productive (and in my case fireaxite) resources.

A lot of wonders are rather garbage for their rather high production costs, and are usually put in separate leaf techs which is a problem. Technology is valuable, so you don't want to waste your research on something that doesn't give you access to more science buildings so that you can stay ahead of the production curve. Although I will admit there are many useful wonders that you will gain access to because you wanted the affinity points it's research had to offer, which is something that does inevitably happen in the rush for 6/6/0 affinities.

Speaking of 6/6/0 affinities, the first dude to get there get's incredibly op boats that have like 48 strength and heal every turn, while everyone else has 24 strength boats sitting in 10-34 strength cities that it could actually 1 shot. It's pretty dumb when you also consider that there was very little time for middle ground between lvl 2 boats obtained at 6/0/0 affinity, and lvl 3 boats 6/6/0 affinitys. You basically turn into a giant stomping on little lvl 1 boats the moment this happens, and you actually cannot lose in this situation, no matter how many lvl 1 boats they have built.

Now the thing is, most of these problems are fixable. If you got rid of the increased culture cost per city and had a local health system like civ 6, and if you increased the max city building settle distance, as well as making production more valuable in the early game and, science less valuable whilst still having dem late game techs being expensive (which they are absolutly not when you get your science going) and getting more ways to get health (luxery resources?) Then that feeling of catching up with technology, and value in taking over enemy cities and territories will be much better again.

Love the game tbh, but i'm skeptical if it would be worth it to continue it's development considering how fundamentally broken it is, especially in comparison to civ 6. I imagine it like a drawing that feels off, I mean I could fix it, but it would probably be easier to start anew.",1485710127,1485710127,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yeah, it has no personality but I think they make it up for all the different ways you could customize your colony.

The lack of a trade table is a bit bizarre but then again I just abuse the trade table against the dumb AI in every game anyways. Trading traits for your colony was a neat idea to further customize your colony, and I see they took parts of the concept with them when they were designing Civ 6 AI behavior.

The premise in SMC:BE is interesting, being in space in the near future, and it offers a different aesthetic from traditional Civ. It also does not advance through historical ages the way that the traditional series does, which can be a good or a bad thing: good because it's a new play-style; bad because that's what kept other Civ games interesting. In place of historical ages, the society that you play advances towards three different futuristic ""affinities"": either superhuman, robotic, or alien-hybrid (or a mix of all three).

Diplomacy is somewhat lacking, but let's face it: there's yet to be a 4x game with perfect diplomacy AI (leave comments if you know the best ones out there!).

Well... Okay, cool, chill, zen... Realy if you are about to buy this game, that you are on windows 10, you will probably come across some trouble to run it correctly. I tried hard to run it by using a dozen of technics I found through the net and even now at this point my only hope is to wait months after months to check if I can run it after severals wild updates done by microsoft and developpers of the game. The problems can come from various tiers programs(McAfree, if remember well, as an exemple), windows defender or even Steam itself. 

Seriously, if you buy this game and you are on win 10, try to start it as quickly as possible and if you can't play it, try all the solution you can find before the date you can't get refund. Please if you read this, don't do stupide things like me, do not wait too long to test it or simply do not try and retry in circle all the POTENTIAL solution until it is too late to refund. (and I instist on ""Solution"" because problems are apparently frequent on windows 10 and furthermore, can depend of your PC specificly)

Civilization Beyond Earth (CBE) is without a doubt my favorite turn based strategy game ever.  Don't expect Civilization 5 with different clothes; they have superficial similarities but play Very differently. 

The good: 
1. You may develop in different directions depending on what takes your fancy.  This game has little of the linear development found in other Civilization games. 
2. I love the research system which is without direction.  From the start of a game, you can research anything within a few steps.  Yet, it would be suicidal to go for the advanced techs immediately. 
3. The game has lots of interesting land units.  In addition you can select different upgrades for depending on your affinity. 
4. All units upgrade automatically.  You don't have to struggle to find them and then pay to upgrade them. 
5. You have very limited info on your opponents.  You don't get those detailed comparison charts like in other Civ games.  This increases the tension. 
6. The game is full of balancing factors which you need to keep in mind when building your empire.  The most important ones are Health, Number of Units and Number of Cities. 

The bad: 
7. The game has some interface issues.  They could have made it easier to wake you sleeping military units. 
8. The game needed different types of aerial units (at least for specialization against air, land and sea units and cities).  The game also needed anti-aerial units. 
9. I like the diplomacy system.  It is unlike other Civ games where empires hold a grudge for ever over insignificant scuffles started by them 200 turns ago.  Unfortunately you cannot trade technologies or resources like in other Civ games. 
10. The game really bogs down if you have lots of cities.  My (oldish) PC struggled a bit.  But more importantly it can take you a long time to play a few turns because of all the choice you need to make.  Some city build automation options would have been welcome. 

The ugly: 
Nothing

It's just a bit too similar to civ V for me to feel like I really got what I paid for. It's worth it if you're a diehard civ fan, like complex games or if it's on sale. It's just not worth it for the full price. This review takes into account the purchase of  Rising Tides (the dlc) as that's the only way I've played the game.

Pros: 
+Nice music, and the interfaces and biomes look amazing. 
+There is a lot of detail put into the backstory.
+The orbital layer is an interesting add on to the map. 
+Affinities are used throughout the game instead of being picked up midgame as it was in civ V, which I preferred. 
+The Tech web is a really interesting system and the sub-layers in the tech web really add to the game. 
+The quests, artefacts and exploration sites were a cool addition. 
+Sea cities
+The diplomacy deals add a dynamic to the game that I really liked and were a really neat concept. 
+Outposts are founded before cities
+I liked all of the different options for biomes and planet types.

Cons
-The map is really hard to see. This sounds sort of minor, but it was really hard to tell the difference between ocean, land, and unexplored areas and it bugged me a little.
-While a cool concept, I found the orbital layer really useless. 
-I found I always had to level up affinities I didn't want to level up in order to do research I needed, so I found it really difficult to focus on one particular affinity.
-There are way too many bonus resources, so many that I sort of lost track of all of them and they became trivial because I had no idea which ones did what. 
-There are way too many techs, and it's hard to tell a lot of them apart. 
-The virtue trees are just the social policy trees from tech five, but with fewer options. I didn't have a huge problem with the civ V similarity, but only four braches wasn't enough.
-Near the end of the game, I found there were way too many unit and building options. Since the names are all futuristic it was hard to tell what any of them were supposed to do as well as being hard to tell apart. 
-It's hard to tell how many trade routes are active at any one point in time
-There's no demographic bar. It's kind of a minor complaint, but I like being able to see how I stand in comparison with other leaders. 
-There are very few options for different civs. While the ones they have are well-developped and have decent benefits, it would have been nice to see some more options. Part of what made me like civ V so much was the number of civs to pick from, and Beyond Earth just doesn't have the same number of options.",1481744663,1481745090,False,63,1,0.751394271850585938,0,True,False,False

I've seen people say that the options for building and unit upgrades are ""dead brainers"", but that just itsn't so.  It all depends on the terrain and who you are up against, and which win you are going for. And some of the maps are complicated. Some just don't have the resouces, so you have to work around that, and resources might be hotly contested.   So maps have tons of resources, so the other players can build much advaned units much more freely. Water world have to be played very differently than worlds with no seas  - the water cities  have to move to expand, and that makes the play very different.

Overall the game play feels the same as Civ 5, but with ""future tech"". Though it doesn't have the depth of ""Civ 5 + Expansions""; more like Civ 5 when it first came out. For some this will be a boon, because micro-managing isn't for everyone.

But, honestly, if you were expecting innovation and something grand....ya...just go mod Civ 5 with all its expansions.

It's a shame, most sci-fi 4X games have you managing planets, Civilization-style 4X have you manage 'a world'. Would have been nice to take our 'future tech' empires we've built from the bronze age to other worlds...

Last Civilization games I played were Alpha Centauri and a little bit of Civilization III. I played Civilization II for countless hours when I was younger. Beyond Earth is basically to Civilization V what Alpha Centauri was to Civilization II and it shows. It shows in the land features such as ""Miasma"" (blue) instead of ""Xenofungus"" (pink).

[b]The Good:[/b]

There are no more governors to deal within the cities you build. That might seem like something that would increase micro-management, but it isn't. The way this was automated is simpler, you don't have an incompetent governor deciding to build scrap anymore. You simply set the focus of the city and fill its build queue to your desire. These 2 activities are not without their frustrations, but I find that I do a lot less micro-management with the simplest way of addressing a problem.

The difficulty levels seem to have been tuned down a bit. When I use to barely be able to play at Warlord in Civ III with normal game parameters, Beyond Earth offers a kinder difficulty curve and I was able to beat it at its worst.

The upgrade system for units has been greatly simplified compared to Alpha Centauri and that's a time sink which is appreciatively gone. The upgrade system features 3 affinity branches with 3 levels of upgrades per units and 2 choices per level to make. What's better than before is you don't have to spend coutnless hours upgrading and designing new units. The upgrades are applied instantly. 

[b]Same Old Civ:[/b]

The AI is still completely wacko. One turn it might decide that you're great enough for an alliance and the next it just declares war for no apparent reasons. That's the usual Civilization knowledge base. The AI just evaluates its decisions based on very slim criteria which may or may not make sense. For instance, if you play on a tiny map versus a single AI opponent, it may effectively ask you to never buy any land because it is too close to its territory.

Diplomacy is still lacking. The AI can insult you, but you can't insult anyone. Overall diplomacy in Civilization has always felt like 2 robots talking to each other and Beyond Earth is no different. I find the constant harassment of AI players asking for resources in return of favors to be ultimately worthless as far game experience goes.  

[b]The Bad:[/b]

Setting the focus of a city and build queue would be great if the UI wasn't complete trash. There's just too much clicking to go around this interface. For example, to setup the build queue, first you need to activate it with a check box, then you need to click on add queue, then you fill it. If you want to convert production, you have to uncheck the activate check box, then click on choose production. If you want to remove a convert production, you have to make sure the activate check box isn't on. It's very tedious.

The diplomacy UI is also just as horrible as the city management screen. Options show up the list which you just can't pick because of some precondition not meant. Too many times I just tried to pick those just to find out they're actually disabled.

To conclude, Beyond Earth is 6-7/10 depending on how much of a fan of the series you are. Most of the flack I would throw at it comes from the UI and the user experience. There's also a few bugs here and there on SteamOS. Still, I find no problems in recommending this game.

I really dont get why so many bad reviews, this game definitely doesnt deserve it. Below I will point some pros and cons of the game and stuff that i would like to see on future dlcs/expansions:

--> Pros:

- The new aliens are a nice challenge on the early game, especially Siege Worms because you never know how they will react.
- The new Affinity System is great, it gives players an option on how to devote their colony, so do you want your colony to remain pure and follow Old Earth ideologies? Or maybe make cybernetic enhancements on your people and spread chaos and havoc with robotic armies? Or maybe be one with your new planet and domesticate and integrate the alien lifeforms for your own purposes? Well, its your call!
- The new map exploration is awesome, with your explorer units you search for Supply Pods which will give you small yields of Science, Culture or Energy and even a free Solar Collector or you can reveal the secrets of Ancient Ruins that will give you boosts on researches or the option for an affinity level or even investigate a crashed space ship which could countain the logs of a failed colonization mission giving you acess to new quests.
- The new quest system is very interesting and offers the players many challenges across your games, the quests are generated based on how you are playing the game. Example: Spotting a Siege Worm will activate a quest that involves killing it and the reward will surely pay the effort, or making a trade route with a independent Station may trigger another Station to give you a quest to destroy their rival Station and as a reward they will give you a boost on the yields they provide. There are also quests that involves affinity levels and they will help you to develop you colony based on your actions during those quests.
- The new orbital units are a great new feature, it allows you to deploy from Solar Collectors to boost the energy generation of your city to satellites armed with giant lasers that you can use both for defend or attack.

--> Cons

- There are very few sponsors (only 8) so there isnt much diversity on the games, at least they can pick different affinities.
- The combat on Civilization Beyond Earth surely need some balancing, cities are much more powerful now and if you want to play Space Atilla early game it will be kinda hard since most units will be melted by the cities defense on the early game so you need to spend a lot of time on making very large armies if you want to conquer cities early on, however later on that is not a problem because the units at around 12 Affinity Level are already very powerful and it takes less than 5 turns if you are well positioned to conquer a capital, based on this the game pratically forces you to go for a domination victory on the late game where everyone else is at around 50%-75% on another victory type.
- Trade routes are waaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered, every city can set 2 trade routes and if you get an auto plant you can get another one so basically its 3 trade routes per city. In my opinion a good number would be a max of 4 Trade Routes per Civilization and you can improve that to maybe 6 or 7 by making wonders, affinity bonus or quest reward.
- The wonders on this game provides very weak bonuses, so most times you dont even bother making them because the bonus they grant you aint that great. The ones i usually make are the Ectogenesis Pod and the Gene Vault mainly to aid the city growth on the early game.
- All the units are of the same color, ok you can see the colored icon but it would be nice if the units had your sponsor color.
- Only 2 naval units, there is a ranged cruiser and a carrier, it would be nice if we could build submarines or a melee naval unit to conquer coastal city using only naval force.
- The User Interface is confusing since everything is pretty much of the same color, seeing what is your city producing, on how many turns it will grow or how many turns to finish that beautiful wonder is very confusing and hard to see because everything including the small numbers are of the same color of your sponsor but im sure that can be polished.
- The tech tree is nice and gives you freedom to focus on what you want, but it takes some time to get used to it and know what leads to what or what you need to reveal or improve the resources.
- Covert Ops are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered.

--> What I would like to see on the future

- A religion system that could work with your choosen affinity
- More military units, especially naval ones
- More sponsors, i think a number of 16-20 sponsors would give a good diversity to the game
- Sponsors should have unique units/buildings. For example the PAC could have a special worker unit that improves tiles a lot faster and have +1 movement since they are focused on production or the ARC could build a special Spying Agency or another build which improves the spying activity.
- Different alien types, it would be badass if there were different types of aliens based on the map type or something like that, that would add diversity to the game.
- Improved military AI, sometimes the AI takes some very dumb decisions when you are at war with them.

Well, thats my review for Civilization Beyond Earth, Im really enjoying the game and i believe that this game just need some polishing and im sure that with the future dlcs/expansions it will become even better than it already is.

Its a shame that Beyond Earth didnt receive all the love it really deserved, the expansion did good but the game sure could use of more content, sadly 2k left it to die and now the game barely gets 5k players, but the game is still amazing and u can have as much fun as u would have with civ5 but with an sci fi theme",1416244734,1479952449,True,63,0,0.664199292659759521,0,True,False,False

Gameplay and turn times are much smoother than in Civ 5, especially in later phases of the game in a very large map you'd feel the difference of ai completing their turns much quicker.

As i read the comments i see people who haven't played Alpha Centauri but fans of Civ series are a bit confused and calling this an expansion pack of sorts. It simply isn't. Just take it as exploring, or rather migrating to an alien planet because earth is no more habitable and imagine all that 'future tech' in Civ games are new set of techs in here. Sure it takes time to get used to but it doesn't prevent it being so much fun.

It will become a legendary successor when they add more factions, a little more unit diversity and some other dlc add ons but it's still a must buy right off the bat for any Civ or Alpha Centauri fan.

Never-Enough-Space Review:

I never thought I’d have to write a review for Civ BE. As a hard-core sci-fi fan, I’ve only liked the Civilization series to a point, which has everything to do with the fact that it’s a 4X game. For the record, I’ve played several non-sci-fi 4X games (e.g. Endless Legends, Sorcerer King), which I have liked. But Civ does nothing for me. My favorite “Civ game” up until the release of Civ BE:RT was Pandora: First Contact. It was everything that I’d wanted from Civ: sci-fi, aliens, robots, and black hole generators.

Civilization: Beyond Earth: Rising Tide is a sci-fi 4X game from the developers of the Civ series of games (including Civ 6). And it’s better than all of those games. I will skip the usual delineation of the 4X aspects, since Civ is basically the Ascendant of the genre. What does Civ BE:RT have that makes it better than the other Civ games?

* Sci-fi aliens, robots, and planets! To paraphrase Barney from HIMYM: “Sci-Fi is always better.” Civ BE:RT is a game like any other Civ game: hex-based, turn-based strategy on the face of an entire world, facing off against other players/AI, minor players (i.e. city-states/trade stations), and creeps (i.e. barbarians/aliens). But it’s sci-fi, so it’s better.

* Health vs. Happiness. Happiness has been replaced with a Health mechanic that better suits the theme: like many of the research options, the ‘story’ of Civ BE:RT is one about trying to colonize an alien world. Don’t eat the damn fungus without testing it for alien parasites!

* Organizations/Corporations vs. Historical Rulers. Many reviewers who didn’t enjoy Civ BE:RT cited this part of the game—that they couldn’t fully engage with the game by assuming the leadership of one of these organizations. Poppycock. Each of these ‘Sponsors’ have their own interesting, futuristic histories and philosophies. The Pan-Asian Cooperative! The People’s African Union! Franco-Iberia and Polystralia! The story of these Sponsors is great! I can relate to them just fine.

* Pan-directional research. The research tree in Civ BE:RT starts in the middle, and branches out in all directions. Your unit upgrades depend on your Affinity, and your Affinity level depends on your research progress.

* Affinity. This is the most enmeshing mechanic a 2K/Sid Meier Civ game has ever introduced. Essentially, there are three possible ‘philosophies’ a Sponsoring organization can profess while competing to colonize this planet:
- Harmony: Humanity’s dominance on Terra’s ecosystem destroyed our old home. To survive and thrive among the stars, we must co-exist in harmony with the flora and fauna of this new planet.
- Purity: We are the last hope of sustaining Humanity’s genetic legacy. We must force the landscape to cater to our biology to continue the Humanity of Old Terra.
- Supremacy: Screw biology: we should’ve hybridized with cybernetics long before life on Terra became unsustainable!

Everyone with whom I’ve discussed Civ BE:RT identifies quite clearly with one of these Affinities; it's a very engaging mechanic!

Rising Tide benefits:

* Exploring Better…ish. Explorers can take control of aliens at the cost of Explorer health. RT also introduced the Artifact system. Combining three artifacts will reward your civ with a unique benefit (e.g. double worker speed). And, using different combinations of certain artifacts will award different benefits!

* Water cities! Different…kind of. So you can have cities in water now! And the center of the city can move around the water, spreading its territory to every adjacent hex that it has touched! The downside is that each city is still limited to working the tiles within three hexes of its center. However, in RT the amount of resources (strategic, bonus, etc.) found all over the map is now massive! And for the six strategic resources, as long as a worker builds the appropriate tile improvement within the boundary of your floating cities, you still get to collect them for as long as you possess that city. Even if a citizen can’t work the tile, your civ still gets the resources. 

Note that water-based cities do not automatically grow their borders; you have to move the cities to increase their territory. “But Jessi! Water tiles aren’t great!” Good news! All land units can embark onto water without a research, and your workers can build ANY tile improvement on a water tile as a land tile!

* Diplomacy now based upon Diplomatic Traits and Affinity! No one likes the diplomacy systems in Civ. No one. The RT expansion handles it in a pretty decent way. Now, one’s diplomatic standing with another Sponsor is based on affinities, diplomatic agreements, and Civ traits.

Many buildings, all Wonders, some spy actions, and some artifacts/expeditions provide Diplomatic Capital. Leasing agreements from other players costs DC up front, and per turn. Having other civs lease your agreements gives you Capital. You also use DC to buy, upgrade, and/or change your Traits, and you can use DC to buy units (like Faith in Civ 5/6) and buildings. It’s a very cool, predictable—therefore strategic—system.

* More Affinity options! Now you can adopt hybrid Affinities! Some abilities, bonuses, and upgrades requires you to have dual Affinity levels.

The “Rising Tide” expansion does everything that an expansion is supposed to do: fixed systems that were broken, expanded systems that were limited, and provided more variety to systems that were already good.

Look: in the wake of the Civ 6 release, there are lots of reasons to jump on it. If you enjoy 4X at all, and have no particular dislike for historical-themed games, then you should definitely play Civ 6. Everyone seems to love it. I will probably break down and buy it with my holiday money.

But when “Civ: Beyond Centauri: Falling Stars” gets released, I will never play Civ 6 again! 2K! Heed my words! Make the sci-fi companion of Civ 6! Doooooooo iiiiiiiiiiiit!",1478379631,1478379631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Best place to start is with the aliens. Are they innovative? Well, yes and no. They have a hive mind that has been retold countless of times since Ender's Game. But there is some sort of quasi-significant AI in there. They aren't just barbarians, spewing forth from camps to raid your villages over and over. You can be at peace with them. You can also bond with them, creating alien units, or leash them with your explorer, even the colossal ones! Even your spies can call upon a giant sandworm with enough intrigue!

The quest system I think is also a highlight. Now you can build buildings and extend their stats with multiple choices. No building is the same. Tired of creatures killing your trade convoy? Build an ultrasonic fence and the choice will present itself: repel aliens further or make your convoys tamper proof.

The Diplomacy system is the lowlight. I like that you can see the incremental increase and decrease in rep along with the foreign Sponsor's commentary, but you have little control over agreements. Most of the time I just accept all their agreements, rack up points, and buy all the policies. Only afterwards do I forge agreements with them. Wars are solved with War Score, a point system based on how much damage you've done to the enemy vs what they've done to you. I don't like how you really don't have a decision in what you can earn as the spoils are automatically generated.

I do suggest you get Rising Tide as well. This expansion does a lot for the game, including the ability to find artifacts that can be combined in giving your Sponser (civ) unique abilities or more stats.

Pros
+Lots of variety of planet types, from fungal to scorched.
+Spying is high risk/high reward. Most prominent and developed I've ever seen in a Civ game.
+The tech web is daunting at first, but gives to a lot of consideration. No longer are you just trying to build wonder after wonder to outmatch your opponent. The affinities, a leveling system based on ideology, makes it so you have to decide what you need: Is it more buildings and developments? Or more afinity to upgrade your units?
+4 ways to upgrade: Virtues, Diplomatic Capitol, Affinities, and Tech Tree.
+Exploring and creating expeditions to hunt for resources and artifacts (If you have Rising Tide)

Cons
-Wonders. They are just not as prominent in this game, nor are they something you usually want to spend countless turns buildling. 
-Diplomacy is essentially broken (see above). 
-Sometimes the territory with its cracks and miasma poisoning clouds make it extremely hard to navigate for confrontations.

I like this game, but it's gotten a bit boring.  It's not a bad game, just a repackaged version of a game I've already sunk over 300 hours into.  I never played Civ 5 until G&K but from what I've heard this is similar to that, but from what I've seen it has less bugs.

Alternatively, go pick of Civ 6 when it gets its DLC.  I plan on coming back to it a little bit sometime soon, maybe playing a game or two while waiting for Civ 6 to get its shit together.

This game may be my favorite Civ game to date, but having only played Civs 3-5 I'll let you guys be the judge of my experience.  That may be considered blasphamy, but I really enjoy this game.  I do enjoy Sci-Fi more than fantasy/medieval type of games though so I fully admit some bias here.  

I really liked the tech tree (sorry tech web), in this one.  The web feels daunting at first, yet I enjoy it better than the other Civs.  Mostly because it feels like, no matter what path you choose you don't feel hopelessly outgunned in terms of technology advancement.  Whenever I would play the other ones, if I did it on any higher difficulty level I always felt like my Civilization just figured out gun powder while my cpu compatriots just spliced the atom when I played Civs 3-5.  So maybe I'm just bad at the games.  But the tech web makes me feel like everyone is close to the same level so you can forge your own path without being left behind because you didn't research  a certain tech first and thusly you are way behind.  If you really enjoy Civ 5's tech tree this one could be a bit off putting.

I also felt like the game wasn't a drag, you had plenty of places to explore, things you were working toward, but it didn't feel overwhelming.  Maybe Beyond Earth is a bit simpler in that respect, but I personally found that nice.  The AI and companies/civilizations aren't as memorable unfortunately but in a way I also kind of like that better too.  You're an unknown face facing the unknown world leading your people to (hopefully) victory.  I guess I can put myself into the game better than playing as Bismark or etc...

I can see the complaints about it being a Civ 5 mod, but the different tech tree/web, the different starting options, and some of the mechanics make me think their complaints are a bit...nit-picky.

Anyhow, if you like the other 5 Civ games and the way they work this one may not be as deep or game-changing as you'd expect.  But if you'd like to try something Civ-like but a little different, pick it up on sale with the DLC.",1468701828,1477399003,True,11,0,0.627391695976257324,0,True,False,False

As you can see in my original review (scroll to the bottom), the Beyond Earth Vanilla game was an overpriced turn-off, and I rated it 4.5 out of 10, and didn't recommend it. 

After buying the Rising Tide DLC at about 65 % discount in a bundle during the Summer Sale, I am now ready to change my review to ""I recommend it"" (WITH the RT DLC, that is). This is because this DLC fixes a number of short-comings in the Vanilla game. First, and most importantly, it makes the gameplay innovative and different enough from Civilization V - in Vanilla, it felt almost like a skin package mod for the Civ V basegame, but now this is a separate game in it's own sense. And adding to that, the diplomacy part of the game is now surprisingly good, and feels fresh and fun for people like me, who have played almost all the good 4X turn-based strategy titles from the last three or so decades. Sea exploration and exploitation, and building cities in water, refreshes the game incredibly for me. The aliens feel more diverse and more interesting now, too. Technology and unit development is decent. Combat is fun. 

Conclusion: I feel the quality of the gameplay of Beyond Earth + Rising Tide combined could be enough to qualify for an 8 out of 10 rating on the Olafr scale, but since both BE and RT are overpriced, I cannot give them more than 7 out of 10. BE and RT should only be bought at a decent discount. Ideally, Rising Tide could and should have been a free content patch for BE, since the base game was so lacking.

Original review (3rd of February 2016, Vanilla game without Rising Tide). 

Disappointing game. I can't explain it, but the game just turns me off. Not fun. Not inviting. Sad graphics. Insanely overpriced when the quality of the gameplay is compared to the competition in the turn-based strategy segment (games like Endless Legend, Civilization V, Civilization IV: Colonization and Galactic Civilizations III are better, and you get them for about half the price). I see people say the expansion Rising Tide makes it better, but I do not risk more money on this game until I get it at a 80-90 % discount.

This game lacks everything Alpha Centauri was and much much more. Beyond Earth draws alot of parallels with Civilization 5 despite tech tree changes and ocean city building. The only redeeming factor is the alien lifeforms, which shares the same mechanisms as barbarians with a hostile/friendly switch depending on whether you attack them or not. Alpha Centauri does this dynamic much better by incorporating the player's enviromental impact on the planet, with the planet's innate terrestrial lifeforms.

The AI in this game plays very defensive and is relatively easy to dominate on the hardest difficulty. Diplomatic power plays well with the different tradable doctrines. However, falls short when it comes to the classic Sid Meirer narrative.

The early-game is mostly fighting the planet, and feeling out other colonies, mid-game is choosing an affinity, and making alliances, late game is eitherdominating the planet, or building your affinity's victory tech, or contacting aliens.

More customization to your faction beyond your faction's effects adds more depth than previous games.

I very often hear ""all the units look the same""... ... ... So did they in Civ 5? Actually they are more diverse here, due to the alignment effect on appearance. Literally all units that weren't special units in Civ 5 looked the same.

The game is less of a wonder-rush. Which in turn is more welcoming to new-comers and diversifies the game. Which is good.

Probably the worst is the diplomacy. With people who can't even reach you declaring war because of a silly deteriorating point system. Also there is this constant stream of taunts coming in from the other rulers which is kind of annoying. It got so bad I stopped accepting  the inevitable white peace entreaties after 20 turns of fruitless non-conflict war. 

There is a kind of bug or something too where this diplomacy traits menu keeps popping up asking you to change your diplomatic traits. It says you have enough points to make changes even when you don't. And since the pop up is audible with a long speaking part it gets very annoying. Best to just turn advisors off as soon as you can.

Another thing wrong with the game is that there is no unit designer. The best thing about Alpha Centauri I thought was the unit designer. This allowed for a lot of customization in the units. This was really neat because the units can take a long time to produce so they should be distinctive and awesome. Rather than expanding on this idea of customization it has been reduced greatly. It isn't gone from the game but customizations come in form of these value alignment things.

Another really crappy thing about the game is the unit advancement mechanic. Here is where the game is really not as good as Civ 5. Instead of the big tree of advances that were available in Civ 5 you only get to either heal the unit or make increase it's basic stats a little bit. No terrain customization, no attack vs defense or healing abilities. 

I don't want to say the game is trash becasue it's not. It's kind of fun especially with how hostile the planet can be with some of the super monsters. But having to share it with stupid pointlessly bellicose AI detracts from the experience. I am just really glad I bought it on a steam sale and didn't pay full price.

If you have played and enjoyed Civ 5 you will probably feel right at home with most of the game.
If you haven't it's your average 4X game where you build cities, build buildings, research technologies, train units, fight wars, and try to ultimately win by completing some goal like conquering the world, building some building, or getting everyone to agree that you're way more awesome than them.

Some differences worth mentioning are, in no particular order are:
* The player begins a few turns before the AI opponents, and the opponents drop down a couple of turns after each other.
* The game features quests with similar objectives and rewards as the client states in Civ 5, but that only apply to the player.
* Technology now forms a web rather than a tree.
* The game seemingly at random gives the player a choice between two bonuses.
* There is an affinity system which is leveled up by researching key technologies associated with an affinity, or completing quests. Higher levels some times provide some bonuses and&or allow the player to chose to instantly and globally upgrade a unit type to a new improved version.
* There are explorers who are weak and slow units that can excavate some tiles for bonuses.

Other than that Beyond Eearth plays a lot like a reskinned version of Civ 5, and I would be ok with that if the AI wasn't so dreadfully dumb.

As in all Civ games the intelligence of the AI doesn't change with increasing difficulty, instead they are given increasingly more resources than the player. In Beyond Earth the AIs are so hopelessly stupid that it is really easy to win on Apollo (Deity) difficulty. Some of the stupid things the AIs will do are:
* Refuse to expand (They will rarely go far beyond 4 cities)
* Randomly declare wars they have no hope of winning
* Not attack after declaring war
* Attacking cities with nothing but ranged units who are unable to conquer the city
* Throwing a few units at a time into your comparably huge army
* Attempting to conquer cities with embarked units

The game would be ok, but nothing revolutionary if the AI problems were fixed, but as it is I only feel like I am bullying small children who have no idea what they are doing as I'm so very very slowly without making any interesting decisions working my way towards whichever win condition I chose.
I would recommend that you pick this game up on a nice sale after a big update states that they finally added AI that can play the game. or if you are only going to play it in multiplayer, because I consider the single player game to be horribly broken at the moment.",1474733079,1474733079,False,1,0,0.528209328651428223,0,True,False,False

I've played them all since the begiining. Civilisation and Sim City were amongst the very first PC games I ever played and owned... and I've played them all since then, I've purchased every one inc Alpha Centauri which was a bitter disappointment.

So when I decided to buy this, it was with the memory of AC in the back of my mind... How would the format be altered and would it hold up to the standards I expected.

In a word... no.. it didn't. It was a another disappointment and not a patch on Civ V.

I hoped that it would be fixed and imporved, that they would add features that were so desperately missing... it took a very long time, but eventually they released Rising Tide... But I waited... and waited... until it was on sale for less than £10 to buy it.

I'm glad I did, because whilst it does add a lot to the game it still doesn't bring it up to the standards of Civ 5 and it's expansions.

Buyer beware... wait for it on sale as a complete pack/bundle.

Having seen the trailers for Civ 6... I am fearful for the franchise... the price they are asking for the new one is ridiculously over the top. It's one of those games I used to buy on release at full price... and I rarely ever do that because I refuse to support the price gouging game companies that over price for unfinished games and then charge through the nose for DLC that should have been in the game to begin with.

On a theoretical level the game had the right ideas; more compelling 'story' elements to individualize your civilization, relevent and distinct cultural tracts that can intermingle, non-colonist NPC units that are more relevent and engaging than barbarians, and perhaps most importantly, the asymmetrical nature of the single player (the player starts before other NPC colonists do)- all that on top of art direction that implied futuristic societies steadily expanding.

It falls significantly short of the goals it sets for itself, however. The story elements feel too much like branches from a tech tree that have special requirements, rather than actual social differences and decisions. Similarly, the cultural differences are more related to scientific achievement and infrastructure development than any sort of social phenomenon like language, religion, traditions, or government. Other than alienating other NPC colonists with different technology, there seem to be few effects of differing ideologies or cultures. The 'asymmetry' of the game still leaves the late game very stale- either you are hopelessly overpowered or boringly unchallenged. 

The actual gameplay mechanism functions as a very poorly balanced version of Civilization V. The resources required to build special units and buildings are accessible depending on your technological focus, but due to the zero sum nature of the tech 'web' rather than a 'tree', that means you're either relegated to being stuck with just one special resource option or accept being technologically inferior to the other NPC colonists. 

Rising Tide resolved some significant balance issues, as well as finally creating a balanced and satisying trade system that is relevent without becoming the focus of the game. Unfortunately, it also introduced the necessity of such tedious and continual micromanagement that the sense of satisfaction by building a new facility or researching new technology is entirely sapped.

It's difficult to understand what resources I need, what they're used for, and what they look like as they just blend in with everything else. The other Civlization games were at least intuitive in that sense; I obviously need oil to run motorized vehicles, coal for factories, and so on. In this, there's no natural link between Firaxite, whatever that weird gas is, and whatever they're used for as they're completely made up and there's nothing to really connect the resource to the technologies and buildings. It would take a number of plays for that to become something easier to understand but they game just isn't captivating enough to make me want to.

Good
-----
One of the few games that run on OSX and even on a MacbookAir if you don't mind using minimal graphics settings.
It's a civ like game with SciFi theme with more variety in regards to alien 'barbarians'
Something that I really enjoyed are expeditions where you research artiftacts, wrecks and more that can be found across the map.
A few aspects a streamlined and overall it's a Civ game.

Not Good
---------
For me the game is boring - and the key reason is that the AI characters too dull / generic. There is just no story emerging.
Stellaris does some aspects better but in general I think this is an important area for improvements in the genre.

Also AI repeats same statements very frequently and therefore destorying the 'supension of disbelieve' / player immersion. This is actually a trivial problem to solve and therefore even more disappoiting.

Gameplay overall also seems to be slow. It looks like there are some mods out there to address this. Also 'health' is probably one of the reasons to make the game slower as it's an intense limiter and it's the thing you want to boost first - removing real choice.

They also want to do a lot of decision making about what bonus you want but honestly I don't really enjoy it. I rather 1 to 1 mapping of upgrade and the bonus it represents to simplify the topic.  

Summary
---------
Maybe Stellaris has a similar problem of being boring when not in war / conflict, but it handles some mini-stories (events) better. If you informed yourself and still want to give this game a go - go ahead. I played it longer than I thought I would, thus 'one more turn' is there but at some point you may get too bored.

Unlike Civ 5, which had a shaky start and got progressively better with its expansions, BE stagnated and finally collapsed under its own misbegotten bulk. The Rising Tide expansion somehow managed to make the faction balance even worse than it already was, at which point the developers threw up their hands and walked away. As such, this sad husk of a game that never lived up to its lofty heritage and goals lies now on the rubbish pile of gaming history. Crack out your Alpha Centauri if you want the better Sid Meier space 4X experience, which really speaks volumes to how poorly this game fared.

GOOD:
+ New setting for Civ franchise (well, new for the core Civ games - see SMAC)
+ New paradigm for ""civilizations"" i.e. sponsors and a re-configurable starting bonus system
+ Stations system doesn't block out expansion as much as city-states did in Civ5

BAD:
- Abandoned by the developers
- Faction balance never achieved, further ruined in expansion

PROGRESS:
+ I don't know if I will ever love the affinity system, but after the patch, the progression feels more natural; most of the time the decision is somewhat arbitrary, but that might be intentional (you can change it after all)
+ Affinities less thoroughly anchored to the tech web after a revamp of the game's quest system
+ Wonders are now clearly marked in the tech tree
+ Trade routes are now separated if they are previous routes, which makes managing them less tedious; trade system received a major overhaul in the Fall Patch
+ Victories are still underwhelming, but defeat at least tells you what happened now

Like most folks, i was not very thrilled by CIV BE when it came out back in 2014. The initial release was a little bare bones to say the least. Seemingly weird and different 'just' to be different. Yet, with an engine and interface virtually identical to Civ5. It felt like a full price mod or worse a re-skin of Civ5. To be fair, that alone would have in my eyes justified a purchase. But it was not what we expected. Or wanted to pay for. Now, those of us that remember SMAC, are definately remembering it through thoroughly rose tinted glasses. It was seminal, ground breaking, freaking awesome BACK in the day. Now, its still good, just not that good. Beyond Earth is not SMAC 2. And I would argue it doesn't have to be. Its a different game, set in (more or less) the same ""place.""

Fast forward to Rising Tide, a bunch of patches and sale prices later. 2016. Should you buy it? Yes, no question. the only caveats I would offer to those of you who are very picky eaters. I have replayed it start to finish and have just started another game immediately. i love it! I think you may also. But keep the following in mind:

It has a science fiction feel that you need to embrace on a role playing level. Watched Interstellar? Want to find out whats happens after the ending? THIS is your game!  Read the individual writeups and if you have time, read up online how many are based on actual science/scifi concepts. The various buildings and abilities make the game so much more dynamic, than the Civ5 map-based resource structure. Building an empire on a desolate wasteland is an interesting challenge.

The 'Barbarian' life forms keep the AI in check, especially on large maps, so you get few vast AI empires.  Interesting things happen, even without the added events. The quests are a very nice touch and now have structure/reward, beyond the simple +1 whatever resource of the vanilla game.  Game winning victory devices are built in vulnurable hexes outside your cities, foreshadowing Civ6 city districts. The tech tree is a weird mess, but after a few play throughs you will understand its structure and know how to pick your own path. And over-lapping Affinities really spice up units and abilities.

yes, some parts of the game are STILL a little rough around the edges, but I think that is mainly due to the lack of customer support for the game. Why should Firaxis keep working on a game that was so negatively received?

Buy it for a very enjoyable take on what happens after a Civ science victory. Just don't expect it to be earth shattering.


2014 Review:

No idea where all the hate is coming from. Its more Civ. Whats not to like??

It uses the Civ5 interface, so yes, it will seem familiar. What do people want? change just for the sake of change?

Beyond Earth is similar to other Civilization franchise games, but different enough to feel fresh. It's like a new game that you already know how to play. With aliens. And lasers.

It is not as profound as classic Civ games, but I like the fact that the average game is shorter, with this game a quick skirmish doesn't last weeks. I feel that because of this they removed the cost for upgrading units, changed the evolution tree and made affinities...
Without the DLC the game feels like it is lacking, but with the Rising Tide complexity rises considerably; I adore the new hybrid affinities, the new diplomacy is ok, personality traits are awesome. Connection to Sid Meier's Starship is also a neat bonus, ehich enhances immersity in the game universe.

It also runs well on non-gaming laptops and steam cloud save works seamlessly; to me this is of a paramount importance, because I like to play it on my gaming PC as well on my laptop.
A Steam controller is almost a must have for Civilization games, after a quick personalization it makes everything so much quicker and effortless...

The main CON of this game is it's full price. If Beyond Earth, Rising Tide and Sid Meier's Starship came on the market as one complete game I feel it would get the praise it rightfully deserves.

Once you do get the Rising Tide expansion however, it's so much better and is worth playing. Combat at on water is pretty much ignored, in fact, just about anything that has to do with the water is ignored. This is fixed in the DLC. I feel they could have added more in terms of the satellites. You'd think, with this taking place in the future, that air/orbital supremacy would be a little more important. Yet, you only get one type of air based unit, and the satellites are largely not worth producing. Furthermore, the AI is stupid. Even on the most difficult settings, it's very easy to beat, unlike Civ 5, where it was actually challenging. Maybe I'm just really good? But, I doubt that. Diplomacy is seriously non-existent. Again, this is something they improve upon in Rising Tide, quite significantly. It's also a shame that there's no technology that reveals the entire map. Exploring every inch of the map on quick or standard game speed is near impossible. This is even more of a nuisance when you have the Rising tide expansion. ARC's civilization bonus is OP. Lastly, the naming of the technologies and buildings needs some work. They literally just stuck nano- or xeno- in front of half of them and called it day. 

As for some positives, I like how it takes some time for outposts to grow into new cities. The technology tree is non-linear, allowing you to research what you want to fit your favorite game style. The aliens can be very troublesome, especially the colossal units. This adds some difficulty to the game, that is lacking elsewhere. The affinities are unique and have different buildings, units, and perks, also the victories associated with them are cool. 

All in all, don't get this game by itself. You're gonna want to get the Rising Tide expansion to make this a complete game, hence why I'm not recommending this game. They should have released a complete game to start off with. It really is almost unplayable by itself.

I feel like a traitor for writing this as a long time Civ fan, moreso because I do believe the team put an awful lot of work into making this game. Unfortunately, however, I cannot recommend making a purchase to others. It's hard to place my finger on exactly where this went wrong...it's more that nothing really stands out as being 'right'. There just doesn't seem to be any flavour between factions, no interesting boosts or unique abilities besides +2% trade gains or -0.5% pollution and other uninspiring traits.

There is no real sense of wonder or excitement exploring this new world. Just a feeling of a reskinned Civ V with all the resources named something else so you need to remember the new names. The technology web is confusing as there is no organisation allowing that pushing in one area will benefit military or integration or science. Just drawn out periods of scanning the web for something...anything...that interests you. Generally you just end up picking something that won't take too long to research and hope you'll have a better idea what you want the next time you look.

For me, the whole game just becomes an aimless series of clicking one thing to do another thing and move that thing over to that place. This goes on for several hours before you realise the addictive nature of Civ is still there, but the fun just isn't. It just feels more like a well polished time sink than a game and I haven't bothered to finish a single campaign after starting several.

For me:
The game was announced and I was really excited. Usually I like most games with a space or sci-fi theme and I love the Civ series since I started playing Civ 2 back in the day. So this HAS to be the game for me right? Then the game came out. Played a few games on my own, with a friend and more on my own. Tried different strategies, maps, starts, mods..

You know how Civ 5 feels really exciting when you get to your last few 50 turns and you know the other players or AI are about to win just like you? This Civ doesn't give you that feeling. It feels like a long chore, with repetitive gameplay, to finish a game. In the end I only finished 1 game and I didn't even get the achievement for it.. 

A couple of days ago I felt like playing a space game and had already finished a few Civ 5 games that week. So I installed and started BE again. Restarted a few maps like I usually do and started playing for a few hours. You know how all other Civ games give you that 'no sense of time' thing? Again, this game doesn't give you that. After about 2 hrs I stopped playing and started a Civ 5 game and it became 4 am that night.

So yeah, in overall its a good 4X game and still better than a few other titles I could sum up. That's why I recommend this game for gamers new to the Civ series. Civ veterans are definetly not going to like this game.",1472648546,1472648546,True,2,0,0.505611240863800049,0,True,False,False

Pros:

-I really like the Afinities and non-linear tech tree.

-The fact that this is humanity in the future and a break from the standard Civ games.

-Different enviroment, but not really different. 

-


Cons:

-Aleins seem to randomly attack for no reason. Sad I have to find forums to understand that mechanic. Plus they hit hard, especally early game. I could see a tiered difficulty overtime.

-Game forces you to almost always choose bronze over brains. With aliens attacking even though I am not hostile towards them. Hostility with AI.

-Diplomacy is lackluster. Dont know how the Point system works in the game. Why does it fell like other Civ magically pull ahead for no reason what so ever.

-Favor system is broken. AI civs always want things but never give. Possible trading flaws.

-Convert ops seems it needs to be polished out more. 

-Tutorial is helpful but then falls short mid game, then just becomes annoying and repedative. 

Overall, it is a disapointing game especally with Civ games being around so long. 4/10

I like xeno mass when playing harmony and spreading it all over my continent to PO the other Civs and proect my units. Nothing equivalent to that with the barbarian hordes. I also like that the aliens will play live and let live until you start killing them or getting too close to their nests.

The affinity system is interesting to me. Sometimes difficult to focus on just one. I don't see purity mixing with harmony much but have had levels of harmony get up there on my purity runs.

Overall I enjoy playing BERT and that is what it boils down to. Fun to be had. Interesting strategies to try and fail or succeed with. Replayability with the different sponsors affinities and social stuff.

Pros
+ It's fresh. It's a nice change from the other games.

+ Upgrading your units in this game is a more fleshed out experince.
+ Cool units, buildings and wonders.
+ Multiplayer is pretty stable from what I've seen, less buggy than CIV V.

Cons
- It's just not as addicting. I can see myself putting around another twenty or so hours into this game. I have over 250 in CIV V and I imagine that will reach 300 hours eventually.
- The leaders are not unique and are just aren't interesting. Part of the fun of CIV is playing as historical leaders through history, not random characters who you don't care for.
- UI can be confusing at times.
- Also, not enough leaders.

It was nearly perfect and the two big DLC/Expansions made it get there. So, how did they try to top it? With… Whatever this is. As usual, I will start with the things the game does wrong:

First of all, what most people like about Civ games are the civilizations themselves. Well, that’s missing here. None of the civs are interesting at all, something that’s quite disappointing. Not only that, their differences in gameplay are also a bit shallow and can barely be distinguished one from the other. Even worse, there's BARELY A FEW OF THEM. It’s quite a let-down, really.

The second problem this game has is… Well, something I haven’t experienced. A lot of people say that this game ain’t worth playing without the DLC expansion. However, since I bought both together, I don’t quite know what’s the difference between the DLC and the base game. You’ll have to look into that on your own. However, it has the same issue that the previous game had: it's too expensive.  30€ for something that's supposed to fix the game is quite a scam.

The third and I don’t quite like about this game is how shallow it can feel. Sure it’s fun, but it doesn’t even come CLOSE to the previous CivV. The units, the city building, upgrading tiles, it’s all there, but just not as good as it was. Even worse, some of the stuff that I LOVED in previous Civ games are outright missing. Trading is gone and replaced with a limited option that I don't like: One guy gets cool bonuses, the other one gets capital. It's just sh#t compared to the trading system of Civ V. Also, the leveling system for units has been butchered. Remember how troops could upgrade in different ways to get better at the thinks YOU want? Well f#ck that, here you only get two different choices when an unit levels up: either get a 10% more strenght bonus or heal half of the unit's HP instantly. WHY DOING THIS!? WHY FIXING WHAT'S NOT BROKEN!?

Something else I'm not a big fan of has to be the new technology system. Again, something that worked perfectly before has changed, and although not being completely horrible, it needed some work. Instead of being a Tech tree, you start at the center of a giant tech clusterf#ck. However, important things are all thrown into different directions, so you'll usually have to choose between having energy to power up everything or starve to death. It's a pain.

Lastly, something that seriously pisses me off is the AI of the Civs. The mood system they had in CiV, which by the way worked perfectly, has been replaced by a respect and fear system. If they either fear or respect you, you'll constantly get them on your doors, asking for dumb trades that will only benefit them. However, pretty much ANYTHING you do will constantly upset them, to the point that dumb things as making a new city OVER A 20 SPACES AWAY FROM ANOTHER CIV CITY WILL STILL PISS THEM OFF. The worst part is that, while it has an interesting system to upgrade an alliance between being neutral, allied and so forth, the AI will CONSTANTLY feel the need to downgrade it for any of these stupid actions, and more often than not, Civs that are AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP will start pointless wars that will acomplish NOTHING. There are good things on this system, sure. But for the most part it just makes a constant stream of passive-aggresive texts pop out every time you hit Next Turn, and each one of those will most likely be to make fun of you.

However, overlooking those problems, what do we have left? An average sequel that’s quite fun if you liked the previous ones.

The best part about the game has to be the alien life. If there was something I didn’t quite enjoy about CivV, that had to be barbarians. WELL F#CK THEM, ALIENS ARE COOLER. And not only that, they work seriously well. In fact, they’ll only be hostile if you piss them off, instead of being extremely f#cking hostile by default. There’s also gigantic f#cking aliens in big maps which serve as a boss of sorts, and I don’t recommend taking them on early, as they’ll rekt your ass whide open. There's also artifacts on the DLC that can be found in the alien's nests that can be quite helpful to make your Civ stand out.

A little detail that most people seem to ignore is the War Score. Remember in old Civ games when a dumb Civ decides to start a war, gets trashed and then tells you that if you want peace you have to give them ALL OF YOUR MONEY, ALL OF YOUR RESOURCES AND A CITY? That won't happen here. The game keeps track of what both sides of a war do to each other and gives them a score. Then at the end of the war, either if you get peace or one of them got destroyed, that score can be used to steal some of their money, cities or even technologies, something I hope Civ VI has as well.

Also, exploring units have gotten quite the overhaul. Now they're a bit stronger than in previous games, something that helps a lot if you piss off the aliens early on and they get hostile, and they can also explore anything fancy you find. Remember the ruins of Civ V? Instead of giving you a buff instantly, you gotta explore them, which makes more sense. Maps also usually have some sort of big marvel on them, as oposed to the natural wonders of Civ V, and following a quest you can get some really neat buffs.

The game also has quests, something somewhat new to the franchise that feels right here. On a game you'll get new things to do as you play, and buildings also give you these once in a while, giving you two options on what to improve on them, thus each of these buildings will now give you more of a specific resource or so on. I like that, as on each playthrough you might need something different.

The music and the setting of the game is also quite good. It helps immerse the player deeper into the idea of being the first #ssholes to explore these damn planets, although it would make sense if it worked in a similar way to Civ IV’s Colonization expansion, with the old Earth giving you money in exchange of shit, and then becoming independent. 

In the end, do I recommend this game? If you already played the shit out of CivV with the DLC’s and all and want to experience something new, then yes. However, be aware that what you're getting is nowhere as good as Civ V, and at times it even feels like a fan-mod rather than a new game made by the same devs. If you do plan on getting it, do it so on a good sale along with the DLC Expansion. Otherwise, just buy Civ V with the two DLC Expansions it has, way better in every way.

TL;DR Edition: Decent sequel to CivV, although not even CLOSE as good. Lacks a bit of content, but will please fans easily. Pick for cheap if you have the previous game, Civilizations V, pick that one instead if you don’t have it yet as it offers way more for less money.",1471610714,1471611638,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

Graphics are well done
Tech Tree is unique and well made. (If not a little confusing)
Overall Gameplay is engaging, if not a little repetitive.
Affinity trees finally have been paid attention to, and are moving in the right direction
The engine runs very smoothly. Even on Huge maps my slightly above mediocre computer runs it smoothly, with minimal load times for textures.

Cons:

AI is blah.
Diplomacy is not only utterly confusing, but also very 1 dimensional.
The range on units feels off. How can a guy on foot travel half the distance in a year as a boat can?

The AI is insufferable, they don't detect terrain differences, they can't handle 1 unit per tile, and the air units will ONLY drop strikes.  Entire cities will be defended by suicidal strike only air units.  It's a joke.  It's the worst AI I have ever seen in a 4X game, yes even worse than anything in the red alert series.  As if that wasn't bad enough though, there are only 1 real factions, what your 'race' or whatever is in pointless as well.  Instead you basically pick from 3 ideologies, whether to love, hate, or simply ignore the planet.  I wish I could simply ignore all the god damn choice pop-ups.  Sure in the early game it really has an purpose and does guide you on your 1 of 3 choices in life, but after a few hours it just needs to stop.  After a certain point you realize all you're doing is making choices and hitting next turn and suddenly you realize you're in the end game because you can build what you need to win.  How exciting.

The Aliens are fun to fight, but they quickly grow stale as you learn their behaviour and manuever around them.

Any features that they have added feel half baked, ie satellites and miasma to name a few. They're more of an inconvenience than anything and lack any impact on your game as a whole.

However the core gameplay has gotten much better it seems. Regardless of its previous state, it is currently very enjoyable - I personally think how the victory conditions are implemented here may even be better or more interesting than in Civilization V. The unit upgrades are a nice touch, though nothing revolutionary for a SciFi 4x game. The tech tree is a mess from a UI perspective, but the numerous technologies and lack of focus on completing all of them to instead strategically completing only the ones that will bring you victory is a refreshing change in the context of a Civilization game.

This game never lived up to its potential.  Every once in awhile I jump back in and give it another go.  Never play for more than an hour.

The uninspired tech tree and the ""requirement"" to pick one of three paths to focus on for technology are what killed it for me.  I just find it uninteresting.  I don't want to spend 20 minutes every time I research a technology looking for the next best technology from the dropdowns and the circular tech path.  And I don't want to look up a ""proper"" tech build so I can just pick generic technologies along the way.  For all the hype about this tech tree, I found myself simply picking the exact same technologies every game and being somewhat bored with it.  

This is a rare bad game from great developers.  I still play Civ V regularly.  I'm eagerly looking forward to and will probably prepurchase Civ VI.


The short version:

If you haven't already bought this game, wait for an expansion to give it some life.

The longer version:

For some context on my analysis, the first time I played a Civ game was on my Amiga.  I've been playing Civ ever since.  Civ V took me a bit to warm up to like many of us fossils, but overall I think it's the best Civ game to date and I was (and am) a big fan of the single unit per tile (always disliked unit stacking and thought it was the cheesiest element of the Civ series).  And while I think Civ V is the best Civ game to date (I have a lot of afk time but Steam says I have over 2000 hours logged in Civ V) ... I have a warm spot in my heart I've always held for Alpha Centauri.  I still have my original disc.

I've been looking forward to Beyond Earth for months.  Civ V + Alpha Centauri vibe?  This has to be the best game ever made!  I preordered it.  I even took the Friday after release off from work (I'm self employed so that's less dramatic than it sounds).  And then I spent the entire weekend doing nothing but playing Beyond Earth.  

I played the first game on the default setting and expected it to be easy so I could learn the tech web.  It was easy.  So after winning that game I started a new game on ""Hard"" difficulty.  And after awhile I realized consciously what I knew subconsciously all along.  I was trying to force myself to love this game.  And after that first weekend marathon, I've tried starting games and lost interest quite quickly.  Today it occurred to me that I have no interest in even starting a game, and simply fired up Civ V instead.  Beyond Earth is just missing that ... ""something"".  I could go into a litany of the things I feel it's missing, but I've seen many Steam reviewers do an excellent job of stating the bullet points quite eloquently so I won't bother.  

Some sensitivity for the game developers:  I love you guys.  I will buy anything you release with Civ in the title.  I know you've poured blood, sweat and tears into making this game and I'm not posting this to hurt you.  This is the first review I've ever done on Steam.  I'm posting this to help.  I'm posting this so you know that, even though I preordered the game and will instantly buy any expansions you release for this game, I am disappointed in it and I'm going to be playing Civ V to satisfy my Civ Jones until an expansion adds something to the game that brings me back to give it another try.  I have full faith and confidence that you'll fix this.  

And for those who haven't bought it yet ... just give it some time.  It'll be great.  It's just not atm.",1414695113,1470434150,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like what they tried to do, but the gameplay changes that were made really bogged down the game for me.

Also, they increase in number if you are lucky enough to be stuck next to a nest. Unless you want to commit all your resources to taking their nests down, you have to accept that large swathes of territory are dead to you and that trade is a no go. This puts you in an early hole and makes it hard to keep pace with the civilizations that aren't been harrassed by monsters. With that asside it's a good enough game.

• I've only played it with Rising Tide.

• A few days before I bought it I finished playing Civilization V one last time before waiting for Civilization VI.

• After about 60 hours it still seemed new and interesting.

• As I approach 100 hours its flaws are showing.

End of Context, Beginning of Review.

From what I've seen so far I consider CivBE (with RT) to be a deeply flawed game.

There are more ways to customize the way you play, which increases the replayability. There are a lot of ways of approaching the tech tree and I've only scratched the surface of the ways to leverage that.

It's now lost that one-more-turn thing.

There's more going on in each turn than in Civilization V I think. The choices are more challenging, but once you've made them once a replay won't show you anything new nor add much challenge.

One major downside is the diplomacy. The vast majority of the deals clearly aren't value for money. Diplomatic capital is so much more useful for personal traits, but by the time you've filled those up it's doubtful that your opponents will deal with you and it probably won't be clear why not. The diplomacy is a perpetual drivel of stuff you only care about if you either want war to be declared on you or want to avoid it and the politics itself is so one-dimensional that it's pointless. Build up your army to avoid war from the natural aggressors and the others won't deal with you. That's about it in one sentence. The only other way you deal with your neighbours is through trade routes and they are always a significant nett benefit to your opponent. There's no indication of how you're doing compared to them, though they know everything you're doing, which is unfair. In short the diplomacy is pointless, a frustratingly impossible balancing act that's no more complicated than a litteral balancing act, and so not fun that I've started reducing the number of opponents. Maybe then I'll be able to make some sense of it. To make it worse, unlike in Civ V, you meet them all very early in the game because the map sizes are way too small — The 'massive' map seems to me like a below average map.

Now for the dealbreaker, the reason I'll be uninstalling it: I hate the undersized maps. The largest map should be about 8 times the width and height, but instead an opponent can land a quarter of the map width away and they're virtually in your back yard, on a 'massive' map.

I dislike the one dimensional aliens. Either they all like you or they all hate you. Each nest seems to spawn multiple different species of alien, which is scientifically ridiculous. Why would they not make separate nest types? And why do they stop spawning aliens after a while? Also the aliens are a frustrating nuissance from a gameplay perspective – navigating out of a nest area is a huge waste of my time, during which I'll often just hit space because there's no way forward – not exactly deep gameplay.

I like the enhanced exploration.

I love the customisable faction stuff.

I like the movable floating cities. I used one to great effect where it started and then moved it to retask it, but they're a gimmick really.

I like the story elements.

I like the quest decisions and the quest system.

I dislike the balancing. I've loaded up a mod to deal with that, but I've lost interest before I've had time to find out if it's really helped.

Despite everything that I like about the game it's too flawed.",1467852630,1468456355,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Consider this a review of Rising Tide, because without it I do not recommend the game, but with its additions (floating cities, the new diplomacy points system, the increased effectiveness of Spies) the game feels less like a clone with a new paint job and more of a very clever total conversion mod. If you find this game on sale with Rising Tide and have already logged your hundreds of hours in Civ V, go grab it! You will not be disappointed, assuming you've already heard all the (mostly undeserved) negative press.

Then go to war with eveything until you do exist then get bored and leave!"" In this game you already exist and there is so much to do that you want but can't do it all. I rate 8/10 for it being an awesome game. But It can get boring without any people to play with. Unless you go down purity and LEV everything and its mother.

Despite the relatively low scores this game got I was pretty excited to play it when it went on sale for the Steam summer sale. I've played a lot of the civ games and really enjoyed alpha centauri. I figured even if it wasn't the best game in the series I'd still enjoy it. In the end while it wasn't awful it really didn't live up to my expectations.

A few observations from my first play through:

- I figured for my first time I'd play 8 player, large map, standard difficulty, pace and world type (i.e. ""terra"" type planet with continents)

-Game pacing felt all off: some things seemed to progress pretty normally such as leveling up the virtue trees with culture or having your cities grow, but otherwise a lot of stuff just felt to go at an uneven pace. I didn't feel like the tech trees were set up well. Also the progress to victory conditions felt waaay too fast. I normally turn those types of things off on my first playthrough of a civ game but somehow missed it on this one. I don't really find it fun to suddenly be faced with the game wrapping up because one of the AIs decided to start a space program or trying to get elected in the UN, forcing me to do the same or lose (in this case it's things like finding alien signals or opening a portal to earth). I found myself having to start my own game ending project around turn 250 and at that point I hadn't even made contact with all of the other players. By the time I won I still hadn't explored but about a quarter of the globe.

-Somehow despite being a ""civ in the future"" type game progression still seems really shallow. Basically it feels like there's less progression and not more. Like I said above I barely got to explore the map, this is in part due to the fact that unlike other civ games you don't ever really get progress on unit movement. There's for example one type of land based explorer unit, it's extremely weak and can only move a max of two spaces (only one if you're doing something like climbing a hill). I think the unit with the most movement is a naval one that can move 5 spaces a turn. You'd think that after mastering the non-trivial task of interstellar space flight our colonists would be able to develop a technology to let their explorers move faster than on foot, like, I don't know a car maybe? Other bonuses such as those from wonders seem uninspired, basically boiling down to things ""get +10% production in this city"", making them either basically worthless or OP. There were plenty of other things like the artifact system and satellite system which seemed tacked on half finished.

-Alien ecology balance seems really off: so basically the alien fauna is the ""barbarians"" of this game. The game explains that they're a collective so attacking one alien unit decreases your standing with all of them, and makes them more likely to turn against you. I think my biggest gripe here was the alien activity didn't ramp up over time like it did in alpha centauri. You're just kind of there on the planet with all these aliens and ""miasma"" (condition on tiles that does dmg to you). I decided to play nice with the locals on my first playthrough but they still seemed to randomly attack me. Early on I got not one, but two high level kraken aliens pillaging the crap out of my first city which was on the coast. Luckily they couldn't raze the city and I was able to eventually bombard them to death, but for what seemed like forever I had to just stop making improvements in the water. By the time I finally got the technologies to make them friendly to me it didn't really matter anymore, even on the few occassions I fought wars with other factions who were hostile to the aliens they would steamroll my little green friends.

-Certain things still felt very obtuse and unintuitive: I've played a lot of these games. It still took me a while to, for example figure out why my explorer couldn't do any more excavation sites early on. I had to look it up and it turns out you have to resupply them back at your city every time do that. A popup saying ""hey your explorer needs to go back to town now"" would have been nice.

-Combat is awful: I saved the worst for last. I'd have overlooked all of the other stuff but combat is abyssmal in this game. It's due in large part to some of the things I mentioned above, such as the progression tree for units being really shallow and not being able to do things like upgrade unit movement very far. There are other things that they have in other civ games that it just doesn't make sense they didn't include here. There's no stacking of units for example, no general type of units etc. Also the overall balance is really off. For example I built one of the ""ultimate"" melee type units, a golem, only to have it get trashed by opposing infantry because they had a lot of veterancy. It would by like having spearmen take out a tank unit in civ V just because they had a lot of experience. The way cities are taken doesn't make a lot of sense either. When you attack a city you fight and do damage to the health of that city rather than any units stationed there. When you reduce the health of the city to zero it just automatically kills any units previously on that tile and turns control over. It also for whatever reason instantly destroys all building in the city even if you're annexing it. I started just razing every city I was able to capture, partially out of spite and partially because I couldn't see any reason to do otherwise.

In summary: the game had a lot of promise but in the end it feels unpolished and unbalanced to the point where it really diminished my enjoyment.",1467564825,1467564825,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The way they did the units seemed cheap and tacky, just using different models for same units and changing their stats. It left me feeling that the three different paths you can take for technology in the game was almost pointless since the variety of units were practically the same.

All up, I was disappointed with the game since its replayability was minimal (same thing each game just different RNG map, pretty much). 

Honestly I feel games designers have lost their way. There is no depth anymore. Everything seems to copy another and I can see why - cheaper development costs. But in doing so, they have lost their flavour completely. I recall Dune 2 way back would have 3 houses to pick from and each had its own flavour and it's own set of units unique to it. The play-styles were also different. Or for a turn-based, MOO3 or Master of Magic. Insane tech tree's, and so much to explore and so many different ways to play.

(2) cost - this is really a mod for Civ5 and as a complete game with all the expansion packs should never cost more than $20, its worth $5-10. (3) coming from Civ5 its the type of game you play half an hour and then remind yourself why you liked Civ5 so much and always, always, go back to Civ5.  (4) the content for me just make my mind wander off and get no feel for my empire... cant explain that but Civ with the actual historical human history its so much easier to visual a building upgrade than with fictional data imho -- this is just me, but when you go away from units into the building up of the cities it is pure boredom... i cannot for the life of me get into the actual building of the BE factions, the combat is OK, but the civ building is sooooooooooooo opposite of reg Civ5 its almost amazing how opposite in satisfaction it is.  this version repels from the same things that make Civ5 so addictive.   its like that stuff they give to heroine addicts that looks like heroine but really gleens them off the stuff and eventually they quit all together...

I can't say that the game is bad, its just lacking heart. Civ games ground you in the world providing factions wonders and characters that are relatable. A game set in space, needs to go a step further and build a lore. Make us care. Alpha Centauri did this by providing a backstory (factions at war, living planet, alien guardians) and distinct peronalities for the factions (the religious zelots, the nature loving extremists, the corporation, the warriors) Even a decade later I remember these personalities. This leads games to have emergant stores.

Beyond Earth has no heart, and no lore. People go to space. Build there and fight. Game play is fine. Tech tree is fine. But I came, I build a civ. Built portals and conqured earth. The end. Uninstall. Why would I play again?

I really hope that Fraxis will get its shit together and release a second beyond earth, this time with lore. With heart. Heck keep the same mechanics (or incorporate the new ones from Civ 6?).

The Rising Tide DLC adds much needed depth to the base game but the overall experience still feels lacking. Ultimately, it's Civilization V with a sci-fi twist. I don't recommend the game withtout the DLC and even then, only if it's discounted.[/h1]

If you're new to the series, you should buy Civilization V: Complete Edition instead. If you're a returning player, know that Beyond Earth is essentially a rehashed Civilization V in terms of looks and mechanics. The core experience is still enjoyable and addictive, however, it's hard to shake off the feeling that you're simply playing a big Civ V mod or expansion with a few new, but fairly inconsequential, gameplay mechanics. 

This is hard for me to say given how much I love Firaxis, but Beyond Earth comes across as a safe, and quite frankly lazy, attempt on the part of the developers. For this reason, I can't wholeheartedly recommend the game, but since I played the hell out of Civ V and seeing as this game uses of the same solid foundation, I can't bash Beyond Earth solely for not delivering on what it could have been; what's there is still good.

So is Beyond Earth (BE) as bad as most of the Reviews here are trying to tell you? No!
Is it a good startegy game? Sure!
Is it as good or as deep as Civ V+Expensions? Hell, no!
Should you buy it? Well...

That depends on two very big and very improtant""If""s:
First of all and most important: 

[b] If you like the Setting [/b]

With the expansions, Civ V offers a way deeper and more diversified experience. If you are not into the SiFi-Setting and like the imagination of a few refugees trying to colonize a new alien planet, there is no reason to buy this game instead of Civ V. There are just so many Gameplay elements missing like Cultures, buildings and units you actualy know, Religions, Unique Units and buildings for every Civ. and so on. While at the other hand there are only a few new elements like:
[list]
[*][u]The affinity system:[/u] This is mabey the coolest inovation of the whole game: You can become a culture of geneticly modified Treelovers who want to become one with the planet"" (literaly), technophile Cyborgs who want to anihilate the filthy human race, or a group of soldiers which are only a orbital deploy system (which is researchable) away from beeing the ""Space Mariens"" which is almost a violation of Warhammer Copyrights (just kidding).
Depending on your research- and questdecissions (which are the biggest influence for progression in the 3 types of affinity), your Units and Cities start to look more and more like those folks and get different stats. Together with the different planetskinis, that also affect the gameplay a little bit, this system gives the game a lot of replayabilty in addition to the already known variety of a campaign which is entirely based on random events.
[*][u]Aliens[/u]
Which are a silghtly more extensive version of the barbarians from other Civ-games, but dont expect more. They clearly missed an opportunity there.
[*][u]Quests, Decisions and Planet Exploration:[/u] 
First of all, there are a lot of things to explore with your explorers. This gives you especialy in times of peace sth to do appart from building new colonies, building roads, building farms,  building buildings, or my favorite: Building buildings, that increase your production rate, so that you can build other buildings faster - build building-building buildings so to say (I love this language). Additionaly there are some bigger quests unlocked through exploration, research, progress or random events. They are intresting written (not extraordinary good nor bad) and give you a little bit of roleplay. Unfortunatly all the quest work the same way: Do Sth (most of the times constuct a building or research a tech) and then a decission which gives you some bonus out of it. But its still bigger and better than the Citystate-Quests from CIv V
Additionaly, for every new building, there is a small decission-quest which gives you the opportunity to unlock addtional bonuses from them.
[/list]
All of those quests are only written down - there are no videos or even pictures throughout the whole game, which is not only my biggest point of criticism but also the second If:

[b]You can only enjoy the game, if you are willing to read through TONS of [/b] (at least in German language version) [b] very complicated written texts. [/b]

In Civ-Games, you know exactly what you are doing, when you order f.e. the Pyramids, a Knight, or a City Wall, or research the Wheel. You know these things from your live, documantaries or from history education in school. In BE we are in a SiFi-Setting with tons of buildings, tech, units, resourses and so on you don't know. They have strange names and minimalistic Icons, that tell you absolutly nothing about how they look like, or even what they do at all. Even if you have completet a wonder, you get nothing but a lousy blueprint of that building. Yes that's right no video like in Civ IV or Civ II not even a freaking picture of how this would look like - just a STUPID BLUEPRINT! When you build the Great Wall in Civ 5, you know how it looks like from thousands of pictures and videos - you even might have visited it already in reallife. Whilst in BE you have NO IDEA what youre spending your production on, when  you build the ""Tectonic Anvil"", or the ""Stellar Codex"".
This game would have desperatly needed videos, that show you your wonders in action, or at least big 3D-Models of all your Buildings and Wonders (like in Civ 2) in your city screen or at least some FREAKING PICTURES. But there is nothing of that. So you have 2 options: You either say: ""Fcuk it"" and just build strange icons with strange names only for their stats, then you're not goint to enjoy this game at all - as you just cant identify yourself one bit with your Colonies. This is why many people descripe this game as ""soulless"" even if the developers actualy put a lot of effort into the lore of their universe. The problem is, that the only way to ""find"" the soul of this game, is through the descriptions.
So what I recomment you to do is to read the description of EVERY SINGLE unit, every building, every wonder just everything. This is the only way to get an Idea of the lore and the universe you're in and the only way to get attached to the game. So while this is already a lot to ask from the modern gamer, who is used to have at least 5 hours of cutszence in their CoD Story Campaign. it's getting even worse:
All the descriptions are written from a retroperspective point of view: All, or at least most of your actions through the game have already happened. It's just written like the events in BE were based on our actual history (just like the other Civ games) and we are some colonists from the year 2400 or sth like that who are replaying their own past. While this might be a cool idea they just took it over the top by putting an overhelming number of scientific special words in their descriptions. It might be conceivable, that those words might be part of general knowledge in 300 years, but for today, you almost need a universty degree in Medicne, Biolgy, and Physics to 100% understand, what they are writing in those texts. Of course u can also get the point of the descriptions without understanding every single word, but if you're not used to a certain pretty high level of scientific parlance, you're going to have struggles to understand those descriptions, even if you are already willing to read them.
The decissions of how they try to immerse the player into their game are so poorly made, that i wish the responisble designer to get eaten by angry Xenos! 

But if you think, that you are fulfilling both ""Ifs"", and are that type of player, that likes to create the biggest part of the story in his imagination and through the gameplay, just like it is needed in games like Skyrim, other Civ games or Total War games, you are going to have a lot of fun with this game. At the moment i enjoy BE more than Civ 5 just because of the Setting and the way the actualy pretty well written and described universe fuels the biggest graphics engine that exists: My imagination.
But if you're not a fan of the SiFi-Setting or are not that guy/girl that likes to read him/herself trough tons of text just to get a better immersion, there is no way to recommend this game over Civ V. Mabey you can check it out when it is at 10 Bucks on a Steam Sale.",1463714056,1466256092,True,35,1,0.763217449188232422,0,True,False,False

- The tech web allows for extremely creative play styles. You can play the same faction, on the same world type, with the same starting resources and situation, and have *completely* different experiences. 

- Aliens provide an interesting early-game foil, since you can easily opt for a pacifist stance, go full-on xenophobic and kill every one you see, or somewhere in between. There are benefits and drawbacks to each. 

- The affinities could use a bit more depth to them, I think, but with the addition of hybrid affinities with Rising Tide they have started moving in the right direction.

- The military game in Civ BE is *fantastic*, so much more to it than Civ V's combat. Especially with the hybrid units from Rising Tide, you have a lot more abilities and variation available to you. Units pretty much never go obsolete, since they automatically upgrade when new technologies are developed.

1) Too many aliens.  At the start of the game the entire planet is covered in randomly aggressive aliens.  With the starting soldiers you can't kill them quickly enough to get to the nests (spawn points) where you can only temporarily stop the spawning.  The Seige Worms can one shot most every one of your units until you've really improved them.  If they started the game with only one alien unit at each spawn point (like barbarians in Civ V), you might have a chance to explore before your explorer gets killed.
2) Your units are too weak to take out another civs city.  I attacked a city early on with two soldiers, two ranged units, and three seige units.  I couldn't scratch the city.  In Civ V, I would have taken the city in at most three turns.
3) It's almost impossible to keep your civ healthy (happy) if you expand quickly.  And there are so few buildings that keep your health (happiness) on the positive side that once you fall behind you're stuck there for 40+ turns.

I could go on, but I just stopped playing and so didn't explore more of the game's flaws.  A waste of money, don't bother, even if it's on sale.",1465706267,1465706267,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The goal was obviously to take the game in new directions, abandoning things such as linear tech trees, unpredictable AI, and unit obsolescece.  Credit where credit's due, those have been major complaints of the community for several iterations and they are no longer part of the game.

However, what they were replaced with seem shallow and unintuitive.  Unit customization is just a shade of what was present in Alpha Centauri (a game which inevitably became the comparison for CIV BE), offering only two options that at times seem equally unimportant.  The tech web was a difficult to navigate and harder to comprehend mess.  The AI opinions were slim, and you can easily spend the whole game without ever drawing any opponent into meaningful conflict no matter how abusive you became towards them.

My main complaints about the game are: tech tree and no real outer space building or exploring. The tech tree at first is a clusterfuck, its a web thats hard to understand at first. It'll take a while to actually found and remember the tree. As for exploring space I understand the story starts as you only find one suitable planet and everyone rushes to control it for their faction. But it would have been awesome if you would have been able to build on a moon or possible another planet. For example something like Planetary Annihilation did with building on different planets.

I really enjoy interesting sci-fi concept of this new Civilization game. Several earth nations after a hard trip from Earth are landing on the unknown planet. First contact with other civilization, mysterious capsules with resources and tech from unsuccesful predecessors and ruins of vanished alien civilization. I imagine how game could be much more exciting if that ""exploration"" part of it would last for at least 30 minutes. Also I'd add different alien species not only those ""bugs"" :) A possibility to confront or even play for a race of intelligent aliens could add more atmosphere to the game. 
I am pretty sure, that this game can not be succesful at multiplayer. Instead of it Beyond Earth could be the greatest game for playing with AI. It could be made by creating a constant feeling of exploration of the new world - more events, more targets and so on. 

Diplomacy system is also very interesting. The only problem with that, that it takes too much time to study all possibilities of making agreements with other nations and to choose the one, that will lead to improving your position. Also nation leaders have their unique skills and features by which they evaluate their neghbors. If you want to play without fighting too much, you must study all that features not too accidently disappoint your neighbors. If you are playing on standart map with 7 AI players keeping all that information in mind is a bit challenging even if you consider yourself expirienced CIV player. 

I love the way Civilization series are going, if I got it right :) I understand, that CIV games start to give a player more choices and possibilities in order to build a unique nation. Hope, that we will see more DLC for Beyond Earth.

Then Civ6 was announced with the usual push for pre-orders and I remembered what a waste it had been to pre-order this one.

I'm a huge fan of the Civilization franchise and have well over 10k hours logged on Civ5, so it was with much anticipation that I pre-ordered Civ:BE.

My first impression? Wait... this is just Civ5 with a new ""skin"" and a completely revised tech tree.  I set about to figure it out.

I quickly learned that it should say ""Abandon all hope, ye who click here..."" over the launch icon.  Everything can and will kill you. Quickly.  Everything AI (aliens and other civs) can and will grind you under it's boot heel without so much as getting winded.

Health is of critical importance and oh, by the way... you'll never have it.  Want to build more than a few cities? Forget it. They'll be diseased cesspools.  Think technology will help? Some will, but never enough.  Go ahead, answer every choice in how you play in such a way that it will benefit health... Still not enough. Build different buildings. Still helps, but never enough.  Social policy choices?  Sure, pursue everything related to health into the gates of hell or madness.  It's still not enough.

In the meantime, the AI civs are all 3 times your size and building every wonder before you can even research the techs to start them.

This is what game play is like on the relatively easy settings.  I've never played it beyond the ""A 3 year old should beat this"" difficulty setting.

Nothing makes sense, nothing works the way you think it should (or at all, really), every choice you make will just hasten the progress of the AI and in short, you don't stand a chance.

I've never bothered purchasing the expansion ""Rising Tide"" because frankly, even if it really improves the game, they would have to sell it for $4.99 just to make up for how much I wasted on the original game.

This, in a nut shell, is why I won't be duped into pre-ordering Civ6.  I'll wait to see whether it more closely resembles Civ5 or Civ:BE first.",1462995739,1462995739,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Performance is excellent with no bugs, glitches or issues I can find and runs very well indeed.  A very different experience to Civ 5 which did have a lot of problems early on.  This one runs likes a dream.

It does feel like a very different game in many ways.  If, like me, you have spent a ridiculous number of hours playing other Civ games, your used to the Earth based style of graphics.  This one has reimagined the environtment a great deal and someone has really let their imagination go when creating the units, technologies, buildings, landscape and features and it looks great.

New concepts such as orbitals are interesting and add a new dimension to the game.

Covert ops etc are very much a factor.

If I have one single issue with the game it is that I do not much like the way trade routes work in comparison with previous games.  I also think they are very over powered and need rebalancing.

If you love sci-fi and love Civilization games, ignore the negative reviews. This game is awesome, it just takes some time getting used to. When I played this game for the first time I felt lost, which I didn't expect after putting 350 hours into Civ 5, expecting this to be just a reskin. The game also felt so flavorless to me just like the negative reviews say, and leaders were without personality.

But when I've given the game enough time and started to understand it, I realized I was looking at it the wrong way. The game is not a reskin of Civ 5 unless you want to see it that way, and that's when you'll hate it. There are many layers to the game that gives it its independent personality and lets it walk on its own feet.

The biggest thing I'm referring to is afiinities. Affinities are the main pillar this game stands on, and it's the main factor seperating it from Civ 5. Affinities are what give this game its identity and flavor, not leaders. As you progress in each affinity, you get awesome snipets of story unique to each affinity that drives the story forward in a way Civ 5 never could. You start getting awesome unique units, buildings, and even a unique rich-in-story-and-flavor victory condition for each affinity as you tread their paths.

There are many other mechanics that make this game cool, like the sattelite layer, interacting with aliens, and artifacts. The tech web, while not beginner-friendly at all, makes for very interesting and diverse choices every single game once you are more familiar with the game.

Also the expansion ""Rising Tide"" makes the game even better, and the positive reviews on its Steam page prove that. Such a shame that didn't reflect on the game main page reviews as well.",1461731687,1462652715,True,21,1,0.686264634132385254,0,True,False,False

Having played Civ II, III, IV, V and BE before and after the Rising Tide expansion, there are pros and cons to each. Civ 5 is currently the most popular game in the franchise, and as such, I'll be comparing Civ BE to it.

Pros of Beyond Earth:
*Building wide (many cities) is viable, and even preferable. ""Health"" replaces happiness as the population limiter that was in Civ 5, and it is much much easier to deal with. For starters, health is more of a spectrum. There are bonuses to having extra health while the penalties for negative health are less intense and more gradual. I've always enjoyed being very expansionistic in the Civ games and was disappointed that this is less accessible in Civ 5. If you enjoy playing wide, ruling a vast empire, and have a thing for manifest destiny, Beyond Earth will certainly fill that more than Civ 5.

*Combat and tactics is the best it's ever been. Civ 5 made great progress in removing the ability to stack units, but my biggest complaint about it is the lack of unit diversity until around the WWII era. In Beyond Earth, you can get your infantry, cavalry, ranged, siege, air, naval, submarines, etc. all relatively early in the game. In Civ 5, you're stuck with only about 3 unit types for over half the game. There are also several special units for each ""affinity."" Each unit can be upgraded with different promotions selected as you level up your affinity. There are also sattellites that can be launched. These orbital units range from simple solar collectors that give you extra energy (gold) on the affected tiles to lasers that can bombard cities from space.

*Affinities. These are essentially the ideologies Civ 5 added in it's Brave New World expansion. You have one of three affinities to choose from which will dictate how humanity will progress through the game. Purity focuses on perfecting the human form. Supremacy merges humanity with machines. Harmony merges humanity with alien life. Your affinity can affect win conditions, unit types, available buildings/wonders, and diplomatic relations. It also functions as a great narrative device.

*Tech web. In Civ 5, you start in the ancient era and research technologies through a tree. In Civ BE, you start in the near future at the center of a tech web. The end-game techs are on the outside of the web, but you still choose which techs you want and when you want them. Though this can be a lot to take in, this does allow much flexibility in the way you build your empire.

You may have more things you like, but these are the large selling points for me.


Cons of Beyond Earth.
*Few victory conditions. You have a choice of domination, contact (similar to science victory), or an affinity-based victory. Though I personally go for domination victories regardless of which Civ game I'm playing, it is nice to have more options. Civ 5 allows you domination, cultural, science, and diplomatic victories, all of which have a fairly deep way of obtaining them. Beyond Earth basically has a domination victory and two separate science victories. (Your affinity victory will be largely dictated by your science and production.)

*Culture is shallow and there is no religion. Religion was added to Civ 5 via the Gods and Kings expansion. Though there was no religious victory, religion could influence your civilization greatly and influence diplomatic relations as well. Culture exists in the way of virtue trees, similar to the social policies of Civ 5. These virtues are well-worth gunning for which does add value to culture, but there is no way to ""win"" with culture. Focusing on culture would allow more virtues thus resulting in a stronger civ, but again, you can't win on culture alone anymore.

*Civ leaders are relatively stale. The passive buffs to each civ are interesting, but the personalities of each leader are pretty dry. Honestly, I think the biggest reason for this is that they are not representations of historical figures. Rather, the leaders are entirely fictious. This makes it more difficult to develop and flesh out an impressive persona. I find the leaders and their dialogue to be just as animated and dramatic as previous games in the series. The difference, however, is that when meeting Genghis Khan in a Civ 5 game, I have historical knowledge to draw on and it helps bring the character to life. Meeting the leader of Space Africa, I only have what I experience in-game.

I've also left out several aspects of Beyond Earth that others may enjoy. The Pros listed are simply the reasons that bring me back to BE. The game gets a bad rep, but there are things about Civ 5 that make me want to play it, and there are other things about Civ BE that make me want to play that instead.

At the end of the day, Civ 5 is the deeper game. There are more victory types allowing in different ways to focus on building your empire. All yields are critical in Beyond Earth, but not all of them result in victory. There are more leaders to choose from in Civ 5 as well. Despite this, I keep finding myself coming back to Beyond Earth. Both games feel different to me, and I highly enjoy playing them both. I personally have always loved having a massive army and empire while fighting wars with other superpowers. That experience is a rarity in Civ 5 whereas it's a promise in Beyond Earth.

I've left any mention of the Rising Tide DLC out of the review as I have not had ample time to play it. These are all my assertions on the base game. If you like civ, outer space, and are looking for a new experience then give Beyond Earth a shot. It's worth the price tag, but sales never hurt either.

The appeal of the historical characters, buildings, wonders etc. It can all seem a bit meaningless to build away without this  familiar narrative underneath. Such as making sure that you get the Eiffel Tower and Louvre when playing as Napoleon.

1. Warscore broken: You can pound a nation into the dirt for several turns, but without a land unit near their city to threaten taking it, they will never surrender. This means naval nations built on trade are rendered useless. Wars will start you can never finish.

2. Diplomacy: While there are some neat improvements since the original, the new system lacks key components.... such as defensive alliances. Ally with a small power and they will use your power to declare war on a big guy. Not a broken issue, makes sense, but the lack of options for pacts and agreements make the diplomacy system not even half what earlier Civ games were.

Do NOT recommend this game. Wait till they come out with more expansions to fix the broken issues, then wait till it's on sale in a gold bundle so you aren't ripped off for each individual release.

Sorry Sid Meiers, you've lost a fan.

This isn't an objective review but as a long time Civ player this is what I came away with, if you like these aspects then this game was designed for you.

I feel it tries too hard to city-block you by surrounding you with alien nests that prevent you colonizing nice resource rich areas, hot dropping in other civilizations where you are sending your colony vehicles, and spawning those stations where ever they can do the most to prevent you from expanding.  Then the AI complains that I have sent explorers and colony people into their territory, which brings me to the next point.

Diplomacy is never civilization's strong point but I feel it is particularly weak in this game.  Favours may be a nice idea, maybe, but it's not psychologically satisfying to give me a pop up and say 'Give me 3 gold per turn and I'll give you good will because reasons' that blows.  We have the worst negotiators in the land where the player always has to accept less than what he will pay if the deal were reversed.  Also the leaders always say the same thing.  That cocky guy who keeps saying ""what's mine is yours...for a price"" pops up every couple of turns and is extremely irritating (he only wants open borders).

Finally I think combat is poorly executed compared to mainstream civ.  Cities are too tough to crack.  I'm willing to admit it could be my skill level but you basically need to flood their territory with missile guys and rovers to get anywhere, nothing else works.  I'm talking about occupying every square around their city.  It's like the creators deliberately set out to force you into certain playing styles instead of allowing you to play the game how you enjoy it most.

I would say the lack of known historical characters have a lot to do with this... Except Alpha Centauri had that soul even without the use of the famous and infamous leaders of real earth history. 

The lack of customisation of your units (a great feature of Alpha Centauri) means you do not feel as personally invested as you were in your own crazy nuclear powered, armoured former (worker) or the making of super cheap cannon fodder troops. Beyond earth offers a choice, but only within predefined builds. The choice is nice, but not a patch on mixing and matching to build your own unit. Civ 5 and their older titles still captured peoples investment because we already associate with units such as the longbow man or stealth bomber. Beyond earth units kinda fall in the gap between these two and as such lack that player interest. 

The expansion has definitely improved things, much like the way civ 5 is now so great after the brave new world patch. All in all a great start to a brand new..ish world, but it feels like this game has a way to go yet. Would recommend picking up after another expansion.

What works? It has that ""One More Turn"" vibe like Civ V. Interresting Scifi twist. Plays fast. Love the Quest Based Victory system. Music is great but limited and needs more variety like in Civ V where each leader had thier own music from moment to moment.

Things they still need to work on? Give the other leaders more dialogue and personality. Add more music. One long large map game, I had all my workers stop and it was several turns before I realized it. That was frustrating. I had to manually assign tasks to many of them.

Overall if Civ V is a 9/10, this game is 7.5 in it's current state. Quite playable and rewarding but leaves you wishing they had added a few more final touches. At this point, I do recommend it to fans of the previous games provided expectations are slightly adjusted.

1. The Science Fiction setting, with the ability to start on several various types of alien worlds, from the earth like ""Lush"" to the very un-earth like ""fungal."" Each offering different types of challenges and curiosities to explore. 

2. The affinity system. You improve your civilizations military not just by unlocking new technologies, but by upgrading your platforms along the lines of your affinity. This gives your units a completely different look and feel, plus different bonuses and abilitites as they develop from other players who develop a different affinity. Whereas in Civ V, every civ had very generic units, with a unique thrown in here and there. Also the use of certain technologies requires a baseline affinity level, and diplomatic relations are affected. 

3. The alien fauna. Adds to the feel of exploring an alien world. They are unpredictable, but you can either attempt to tame, coexist, and ultimately use them to your advantage, or attempt to wipe them out. 

4. Terraform the planet to make it into a new Earth, OR change humanity to live in harmony with the world. 

5. Strategic resources matter more. Strange in Civ 5 how oil is important for early modern units, but suddenly all you need is aluminium?  

6. The orbital layer. Neat. Includes fun toys such as orbital laser beams to turn the tide in war, and even global teleporters.  

The game could use some improvements in the following areas:

1. The AI, of course. I did find the game challenging and fun at the ""Soyuz"" level, with alien fauna cranked up to ""frenzied,"" where the AI would finally credibly threaten you, and aliens would make life difficult for all. Very easy before that. The AI should aggresively pursue an affinity and be more willing to attack the player with sufficient units to do serious damage. AI does not seem to aggresively pursue a victory however. 

2. Would like to see the orbital layer fleshed out more. Sattelites have more options to defend themselves from strikes, and sattelites to kill other sattlelites. Maybe add a space crusier that flies through the orbital layer, bombards and carries fighters toward the end game. Maybe space fighters too instead of just ground support or air to air attack air units. 

3. Would like to see more ""super weapons."" Nukes are missing. Controlling the orbital layer to prevent nukes would be key here. Fortifications and something like the ""citadel"" in civ V would be nice. Maybe let players build rail guns on the map to bombard at range.  

4. Would also like to see players be able to damage cities and population with air strikes, assaults, and bombardment to reflect the brutality of war.  It takes too long to raze larger cities. You should also be able to damage tile improvements at range with artillery or air power.",1458945654,1458945654,True,2,0,0.557522118091583252,0,True,False,False

BE has been shut down and shoved into a closet by many gamers and reviewers for various reasons. I believe that the primary, unspoken reason for this disenfranchisment is that the fans of Civ 5 were expecting a sequel. BE IS NOT CIV 6. This game is incredibly far from a sequel to Civlilization 5 and should NOT be judged based on what people wanted BE to be. BE, by itself, is a fantastic, in-depth, and very enjoyable turn-based strategy game. 

Notes( I believe pro and cons lists to be inadequate)

-This game can be slow sometimes. There are many points in the game where I wish the amount of turns for something to finish would be greatly reduced. This is a criticism in my belief because at some places the game just feels boring. This can, however, be remedied by changing the game pace from ""Standard"" to ""Quick""

-The Affinites are incredibly interesting and are a marvelous game mechanic. There are three affinites that the player can follow. These affinites affect: diplomacy, alien relations, research, units and more. The chosen affinity has a very large sway in the game and I personally love the customizable units based on affinity. To give a quick summary, when certain affinity checkpoints are reached, players are given options to change a standard unit such as ""soldier"" into two possible unit types that are unique to that affinity. This creates many interesting strategies and battles.

-The tech web is enormous and very interesting to explore. Not much to be said here except that, in relation to Civ 5(which I said I wouldn't compare to) there is almost no chance that you will have completed the entire tech web by the end of the game. In Civ 5, it is almost guaranteed for skilled players. This creates an interesting choice of prioirites for the player. Should you research technologies that will benefit your economy? What about your military? You can't always have both.

-There is a limited cast of playable factions. I consider this a criticism as I would prefer if there were more factions with more interesting special abilites, as I have found choosing factions to be more of a chore than an interesting, though-out strategic decision.

-The concept of the aliens is very well drawn out and interesting. Unlike barbarians from previous civ games(broke my rule again) the aliens are a threat the entire game and encompass many different aspects of the game. I have found dealing with Siege Worms a larger priority than waging war, as it takes about the same amount of units.

I would give tips like I do in most of my reviews, but a part of the joy one gets out of a game such as this is learning the tips and strategies and being able to formulate plans for one's self. 

Civilization Beyond Earth is an interesting, creative game that does it's job well and is a good purchase when on sale. Thats the big kicker. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. IF YOU TAKE LITERALLY ANYTHING OUT OF THIS REVIEW IT IS THAT. This is a wonderful game and I endorse it completely, but the price tag is much too large in my opinion. That said, if you really want to buy it at full price(I did), then by all means go ahead.

Good luck and NEVER trust the Pan-Asian Cooperative

This is the first time that I see such a copycat work on a previous version (CiV 5). It is also the first time I don't get excited at all when I complete a wonder...maybe because they have very strange names and no clue on what they are and why they have their bonus...even in Alpha centauri with ""invented"" wonders (called secret projects) you could understand why the were giving a certain bonus (Human genome project, the cloning Vats, the self aware colony....).

In BE we have: Cynosure! (wtf), Panopticon (is it food?), The Akkorokamui!!!!!! (I cannot even pronounce this shiet...) 

In addition...I have just 40 hours of gameplay and I finished already the game 3 times: The first on beginner (sputnik!?) to get used, the second on normal (Gemini??!!) and it felt like the beginner one...and the third on maximum difficulty (Apollo..) and I finished without major problems.... 

....THIS NEVER HAPPENED!!! I needed always several trials in order to master a civ game and finish it at highest difficulty! Here I needed nothing! 

I guess the reasons are: 1) broken AI 2) Already mastered Civ 5 so easy to do the same with BE....

The game builds on a lot of aspects from CIV V and dumbs down a few. I've played the game repeatedly and beat it on all affinities except Purity (in the process). However the game lacks in its replay-ability and it feels sort of hollow after so many rounds of playing. May be so spoilers toward how AI act  in this review. Current state is a 7/10, and would buy if on sale.

Early Game:
Game is absolutely awesome in the beginning and you feel like you are on uncharted grounds that you must conquer or become one with. The aliens (bugs) in the game are a true threat and very commonly there is always one CIV waging a war against the bugs in the game causing more initial tension in the game promoting some early game warfare with astronaut suits and weaponized rovers between CIVs that adore the bugs and CIVs that want to kill them.

Mid Game:
Starts to get boring because all your doing is just hoarding buildings/wonders/victory quests. Diplomacy is not existent at this stage and if you want war just do it and there are little consequences except being condemned (but no one cares about that). What is good are the stations (city-states) were quests ask you to destroy certain stations because of their beliefs/practices or stations just don't like each other and want you to kill either off. The war against the bugs sorta dies in this stage because your units start simply overpowering the aliens and their is no sense of true danger. Unless your fighting siege worms or krakens but it's meh.

Late Game
Tensions rise!!! And alliances form, sorta  mainly tensions rise... You get these godly über units that are specific to your affinity choice which makes war fun when the two top dogs start slugging it out. The AI is most aggressive at this point and wars sprout everywhere commonly dividing the CIVs into three factions based on the affinities. However the AI have little room for diplomacy no matter what and wars commonly cary on until one or the other is wiped out. The bugs are just pests at this point and get one bagged from the weakest units in an army. Harmony affinity CIVs do little to protect the aliens and the aliens do little to join with Harmony Affinity CIVs effectively getting rid of the purpose of going harmony. Leading to Supremacy and Purity becoming the most war like and best because of their major production buffs. Than victories vary from going back home and helping humanity, killing off humanity and seduce all into supremacy, or becoming one with the planet. Each victory requiring a massive amount of settlers, or war units, or going turtle mode.

CIV AI
The CIV AI is real basic and they feel overly predictable. It's few instances were a supposedly friendly AI because of trade actually declares war on you for hostilities toward other CIVs or the Bugs. Therefore the CIV AI feels kinda blah and kinda easy to push around with little consequences.

Diplomacy
Nothing like CIV V and this game did horrible on diplomacy IMO. 

Aliens or the Bugs
Fun at first and mid game but die late game and the bugs don't side with harmony CIVs making them a simply annoyance to all.

Affinity
Supremacy: You incorporate chips and metal into your people effectively making them cyborgs but ridding yourself of humanity and being and CIV all about numbers and results but no emotion. Essentially a robot CIV get nasty buffs toward production and science and get cool sounding uber units with the best ranged unit in game. Black and yellow color scheme that looks good. Basically go back home and commit mass extermination of the human race. Most radical and few AI choose this. Will constantly be at war late game.

Purity: Keep humanity pure and keep our culture and heritage alive and save earth if possible. 49er colors and feels the most familiar out of all the affinities. Victory goes back and saves earth. Cool uber units and has production and growth buffs with some culture. War is so so

Harmony: 
Best melee units in game and sweet looking über units that rain hell and have the fastest healing rates, especially if there is miasma in game. They get buffs toward health, food, culture, a little to science. Greenish and bluish color schemes. They fall in the middle and choose to abandon earth and become one with their current planet keeping their humanity but embracing the minds of the native aliens and the planet.

When I saw the trailers for ""Beyond Earth,"" I immediately got pumped for a spiritual successor to ""Alpha Centauri.""  After playing many hours of this game, I can tell you this:  Alpha Centauri, it ain't.  

My main problem with the game is its drab, unengaging, and copy-pastey factions.  In Alpha Centauri, all of the faction leaders had their own goals and personalities.  The dialogue options were unique and tailored to each faction leader, and gave the single-player experience a satisfying political feel.  Beyond Earth, on the other hand, uses the same dialogue for political interactions with every faction.  Faction leaders have no personality, and as a result, dealing with a faction feels more like hitting the snooze button on an alarm clock, rather than having a wheel-and-deal with the supreme leader of a unique nation.  

Additionally, the tech tree feels boring and unexciting.  Almost every technology gives you a percentage increase to military, science, or economy.  It's common to spend twenty turns researching a technology, only to find your reward being a .2% increase in faction-wide economic revenue.  In Alpha Centauri, researching a new technology could give you access to missile weapons, flight, or hovercraft.  Racing toward the Flight technology could give you a dominating advantage.  No such analogue in Beyond Earth.  It's just a boring march of percentiles.

Full disclosure:  I haven't played the Rising Tide DLC.  I've been told that it fixes a lot of the problems with faction leaders, making them more unique and fun to interact with.  However, after my disappointing experience with Beyond Eath, I'm not sure if I want to sink more money into what's turned out to be a lackluster experience.  If I change my mind, I'll update this review.  As it stands, I don't recommend the game.  Firaxis is an excellent studio, and I own and enjoy a lot of their games.  This one, however, could have been done much better.

Doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement, right? Well notice how most of the reviews panning this game suggest that the reader go and buy Civ V for a better experience. Civ V was dumped on when it first hit the market. The vanilla game was called a bland and unfinished product and everyone said ""go play Civ IV for a better experience"". See the pattern? Civ V was released in 2010 and has two excellent expansions behind it that turned a solid, if bland, foundation into the game that everyone now praises.

Beyond Earth, like Civ V, needs time to be excellent. The vanilla game is a sound product for the developers to build on and turn a good product into a great one. If you don't want to suffer through the games growing pains, then don't buy it. That's cool. But if you did it with Civ V like I did, you may not mind doing it again with Beyond Earth. So if you're like me and want tomplay through the game as it evolves then grab it now. If on the other hand you want to wait for the game to see more additions and polish, I certainly won't begrudge you.

The first few minutes were excruciating simply because the tutorial is all but nonexistent and the interface is unintuituve. It does a great job telling you what units are supposed to be able to do, but little more.

Second on my list of complaints is the graphics. No, I'm not saying they're poor, I'm saying that the graphics settings don't stay up to date between launches. The default is ""Low"" for anyone not using AMD and will stay that way until kingdom come. I was able to adjust the screen resolution in game and have had to redo it with every startup. To me, that's unacceptable. 

For experienced players, I'm sure it's fine. I bet I can even get some good advice by watching a ""let's play"". I'm sure I will come to enjoy it, but it is too soon to tell.

10 HOUR UPDATE:

After reading the better half of the hundred and twenty page instruction manual and playing a few hours, my complaints about tutorials and graphics stand. I had to go through NVIDIA to keep my settings and set it to windowed to keep the right resolution, but at least I was able to get them to stick.

Now that that's out of the way,

Yes, the game gets more entertaining after playing for a while. I imagine it will take more hours than I will ever have to become ""good"" at the game.

Until you get crushed by the Health mechanic. Especially on higher difficulties, the Health mechanic pretty much forces your hand in terms of research, buildings and virtue specialization. Health is similar to Happiness in Civilization 5, and is reduced as you have more cities and population. While low on health, you suffer penalties to important gameplay aspects, such as population growth. The lower your health, the worse it gets. To counter it you must research certain technologies, gain certain virtues and build certain buildings. But the rate at which it is reduced forces you to rush health virtues, health technologies and focus on health buildings just to keep level in the health game.

This type of game design doesn't foster good gameplay. I'm okay with it being used as a way to limit empire growth a little by forcing you to invest in infrastructure, but the extent to which it goes in this case straightjackets your gameplay style. Want to win the game through might? You'd think you'd go for military tech, but no - you have to make health your main research branch, focus on health virtues and you better prioritize health buildings every-goddamn-where. Want to colonise and expand? Again, health, health and health. Build an outpost? Disease spreads throughout your empire. Capture an enemy city? Plague runs rampant everywhere. Better invest more in health.

First, talking over it with some friends of mine, they mentioned that they didn't like Civ5 as much as Civ:BE simply because they couldn't connect to Civ5 as much (see Ghandi nuking everyone). 

Second, one negative review caught my eye... something about ""not being able to build a sprawling empire"" until you have researched more technology and other things later on. Going with the tradition of sci-fi thought, among other things, it doesn't make sense if you could make a sprawling at the start on a completely alien planet with rather hostile wildlife or other dangers. Also, something about ""this alien planet looks like earth, wtf."" Well... sorry to burst most people's bubbles... but if humans are going to try and settle a planet, we'd probably look for something close or similar to home. I mean, I don't know about anyone else here, but I'd rather not live on a planet where the oceans are liquid methane...

Hell, forget the first guy and his want for sprawling empires. You wouldn't even get an outpost going on a planet such as that!

Are there flaws with the game? Yes. I'm not going to sugar coat it and say it's perfect (because it's not). But you know what? When Civ5 first came out... it was pretty silly too and it eventually got much better with GnK and BNW.

Also, I've only put about 2 hours into the game so far so this is more of a first look than a review, but here is my opinion thus far. 

So why am I recommending this overpriced, glorified expansion pack? Because personally, I had to force myself to close it down to write this review. There's no Earth-shattering (pun might be intended) changes in the mechanics, but for me that was a plus. You will feel right at home with this game if you are a fan of CIV. The gameplay and the setup are all very similar, while at the same time different enough to make it fun to play. Honestly, It feels like it picks up right from the point of a Science victory in Civ V (hence why I think it feels more like an expansion than a new game). The main gameplay is very familiar. Happiness, gold, culture, etc are all present (albeit in different methods), as well as trade routes, city states, etc etc. Unit upgrades are more in-depth, there seems to be more to explore on the planets, diplomacy has an interesting twist, and the whole alien methology makes you think twice about eliminating them like the barbarians in the ""old"" games. So while it initially looks like a re-skinned CIV V, there's enough done to the game to keep it interesting and different, and for me it kept that ""just one more turn"" hook that Civ games should have. I haven't had the chance to play it for endless hours on end quite yet, but I've spent more than enough hours on CIV V. So if you like CIV V you should enjoy yourself immensly with Beyond Earth. Although I should add, I've only ever played it with the expansion packs, and the game without the expansion seems less than adequate based upon what I've read. 

In the end, I could find myself treating this like the expansion pack I feel it is and opening it up once my ""Earthly"" CIV V civilization reaches the end of the tech tree. If you can sacrifice your wallet, Beyond Earth seems to provide a pretty good CIV experience with a twist as long as you know what your money is getting you.

Second, there have been a lot of 4X competitors in recent years, and they've really shown up how poor the Civ series has become.

While Rising Tide fixes various issues, it makes others worse. Diplomacy is notionally more sophisticated, but very easy to farm.

Beyond Earth was simply put half a game in content, it was the core, a taste of what Civ V would look like if it left earth.

don't get me wrong, i love this game now... after Rising tides was released.
I therefore highly recommend buying this game when Beyond  Earth and Rising tides are bundeld for €/$40 or below. Civ V is presently better priced and more value for your cash.

The game was disapointing but not to the point of frustration, it was playable, Civ V was just more fun to play. The game was not downgraded nor upgraded, just patched to iron out bugs, nothing more, nothing less.

The UI is hard to see, you can go almost 500 turns without ever interacting with AI Civs, and somehow 200 years after Brave New World somehow everyone ""forgot how to diplomacy""? Lack of religion in the future makes sense, but Diplomatic features are completely non-existent. Non-existent in a budding new world where, for some civs, coexistence is the only option. Failing to add this to the game makes little sense to me, and apparently to others as well. I would hope that diplomatic features similar to BNW will be added in a later expansion, if not in a needed overhaul update, and while I would be upset that the players would have to front even more money to get features that would seem necceassary for this game to ""work"", I'll most likely purchase it without much complaint.

If an update is posted with at least some sense of direction as to where they plan on taking this game in the future, as far as diplomatic features go, and some UI enhancements, I will happily reccomend this game to everyone. Although it lacks soul, it is still an excitng game, and I'm sure it will get better with time.


Update: Rising Tide:

This expansion has changed Beyond Earth in many ways the Gods and Kings and Brave New World changed Civ V (Vanilla).

Many of the things I grieved about above were addressed in this expansion. The Civilizations seem to have more personality and soul, the personality trait customization adds for unique strategy and so far seemingly limitless replayability. There is now ""Diplomatic Capital"" which is generated using buildings, technology, and offering deals to other civs, capital is spend accepting deals from other civs. These deals offer many strategic bonuses that can change the way your Civ operates.

The hybridization of the three paths offers more unique gameplay as well, from what I've seen so far, the AI's usually stick to Harmony-Supremacy or Harmony-Purity. I tried a Supremacy-Purity build with Brasilia and it makes for an interesting combat Civ, but it's not my preferred play style. Harmony-Purity could make a great defense for combat civs if you don't Aggro aliens.

The New Civilizations: so far, I've only tried the North Sea Alliance, to mainly test out aquatic cities, it's not bad, it's bonuses are decent and the other civs will almost always ask for political deals because of them, making it easy to generate political capital. Aliens in the ocean can be annoying until you get them to like you.

All in all, this expansion has brought me back into the game, hopefully more people will come back to it as well. Multiplayer is pretty empty during weekdays.

I like the idea of different planets, aliens, colonizing, Unit upgrades, and water bases. The planets have different look and feel to them which makes the unique. The aliens add a layer of challenges and even have the ability to capture them for your own use which is cool. Colonizing now is more challenging due to needing to protect your new found colony before it becomes a settlement. It gives the aliens a chance to take out a weak addition to your empire. The unit up greats gives you a chance to pick how you use you units based on different stats to choose from at the time of upgrade. My favorite addition is water colonies. You can found a settlement on water and even move it around the ocean tiles to expend your empire quickly. It adds a few cool things to the mix and keeps it fun.

Some of the annoying things are the limited units, aliens, artifacts, and exploration. After a while, the units just feel lacking and depth is missed. I liked the air and ships in Civ 5, but here you only get one air unit and 4 ships, but 20 different land units. Aliens are a cool addon, but at same point, it is like the spawn like no tomorrow. Most of my end games are just filled with them in spots I haven't colonized which make exploring hard. The thing I find annoying with artifacts and exploration is the lack of in game information on it and makes it hard to do the achievement for the artifact wonders.

Over all with the expansion, I wouldn't pay $40 for it like I did. I would say about $25 worth of entertainment since most of it felt reskined Civ 5 with a few new features that aren't explained well in the game. Still is a decent strategy turn based game.

It basically took the core gameplay mechanics of Civ 5, and changed over to a Sci Fi setting. It is a still a relatively different game from Civ 5, and I think that does need to be stated. The buildings are different, the units are different, the culture trees are different, and the tech is different. It still has that Civilization gameplay, with a lot of core mechanics still in place though. I enjoy how it took a bit of the clutter from Civ 5 and touched it up to where it feels much more natural (such as the trade routes, and the culture trees). The aliens are interesting, and I'm hoping they add more since there does only seem to be a handful of different critters you run into throughout the galexy, and all of them can be found on every planet which kind of takes away some of the excitement of starting a new game (just like how every planet has miasma, and endless chasm canyons). There are three different affinities which really define how you build your Civilizations; those being: Purity, Harmony, and Supremacy. All three are fairly different, and have very interesting and unique units and styles. It makes it very interesting since you can definitely see the difference in the technology you decide to go with every playthrough. With that being said I thought it was interesting that your sponser doesn't effect the appearance of cities and buildings in anyway like it did in Civ 5, but I can't really say I would have expected everything to add diversity to every playthrough. Overall I was happy with this game and would definitely recommend it for anyone out there who's looking for a good turn based strategy game and is sick of a historical setting.

Beyond Earth: I'm writing this part now since Beyond Earth came out and I have had a chance to play that expansion. So for Beyond Earth it basically makes the water tiles just as useful as land tiles on top of adding four new factions, the ability to cross/class affinities, a couple new biomes, and finally a few more alien monsters. The water tiles thing is a neat concept, and it illiminated the desperate need for a good start (every game of Beyond Earth I played I landed on the coast, and the AI, up to Vostok difficulty, rarely expanded in water tiles, no matter how resource filled they were). The new factions were definitely needed to bring a unique feel to every game since now you can no longer get every faction into one game; the new factions are Space Korea, Space Vikings, Space Germany, and Space Middle East, and both the Space Vikings and Space Korea can start with their capitols in water tiles. The cross/classing affinites was cool at first, but became annoying when I would accidentally get the wrong upgrades to my units when I research into upgrading roads into railways so it altered my gameplay a bit and it became a little clumsy when I wanted to get specific with my builds. The two new biomes were pretty, but frigid world already had a planet type that catered to those who wanted to play on ice worlds which leaves the primordial worlds as the only really new unique biome. Lastly there is the new aliens which I definitely liked, and I liked how the aliens now change their colors in different biomes, but it would still be cool to see some biome specific species.",1415064797,1455559432,True,3,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

I kind of got bored, powered through turns but eventually found interest in the different gameplay and techs. Second game was a lot better, I had a better understanding of how everything worked and removed the whole ""Why isn't this like Civ 5"" mentality from my head. 

The game was worth the $15 and I will get another few games out of it before moving on. But it definitely needs some improvement. 

Some negative points:

If you liked Alpha Centauri in the days, then this game is really an upgraded version of it. It does not have the same alien species, but it is still close to the game.

I really like the customization of the factions. You no longer play nations that do not exist in the beginning of time like in Civilization.

Factions don't declare war to you just for fun anymore (unless you play one of the hard difficulties that is). There are two important things in diplomacy, respect and fear. You get respect by conducting deals and being just with your neighbours while fear is measured by comparing your military might with their own. I like that, and in my games, factions declare war on me only when I ignore these factors. But sometimes, there is a loser with 3 cities that declares war on me when I have like 8 cities and dozens of units, makes no sense, it is like suicidal for them, why would they declare war on a faction that will simply pulverize them?

The AI still needs some tweaking at normal difficulty.

But still, it is a good game, but I would not pay more then 25$ for the whole package, and that is what I did, paid like 27$ for the entire game (with all dlcs).

And lastly you can choose to live side by side with the aliens, gaining alien units to command, which will (like the robotics path) piss off the other civs and they will attack you. 

Another comp[laint I have is about the different victories, for each path you choose to go down and how they are acheved. One involves opening a massive stargate like portal letting an invading army through and coquoering the alien world for earth. The second on involves building a super advanced A.I. (or achieve singularity). The last one requiers you to build a massive alien flower like structure to ""talk"" to the planet. To sum it up you can either be the marines from Avatar, the Na'vi from the same movie, or Skynet from terminator. The victories can be ahcieved way to quickley.

Finally and this is the biggest complaint I have about the game, and that was Sid Meirers: Star Ships, which was supposed to be compatable with Beyond Earth. When I heard about this I was really excited. I love Sins of a Solar Empire. Space combat combined with managing my ground forces could make this game a lot more intresting. But it wasnt so, The compatability hardly worked (meaning It didnt work at all). I couldnt even get Starships to work by itself, let alone with Beyond Earth.

Civilization Beyond Earth, is not a horrible game by any means, the graphics are good, the idea of setting a Civ game on a hostile alien world is an idea that has alot of potential. But Beyond Earth doesnt realize that potential very well. They have the settings and the charecters down. The aliens as enimes as far too powerful, and as your own units theyre far to weak. (Siege worm Im looking at you here)

The traits they reworked from the older Civ games (the tech web, and the new Civs) are like puzzle peices, that fit but have the wrong picutre on them. they work but not very well. The victories can be achieved to quickley. And the fact that any diplomacy you achive wiht a Civ can be negated by simply choosing differetn tech options annoys the hell out of me. 

Both Beyond Earth and Starships had so much promise but failed in a massive way. if your looking for a quick Civilization fix, that wont really take to long, then ny all means play this game. But if your looking for a Civilization gam that won't end in a few hous stick with Civ V. Dont even bother with Starships.",1455043225,1455043225,False,1,0,0.484429091215133667,0,True,False,False

New features and revamped systems provide a somewhat different experience from Civilization V, but many of these seem to be gimmicky or simply not fleshed out enough. The tech web for example is supposed to encourage diverse playstyles and vastly different choices. What it actually does is ensure that anyone who doesn't ""rush"" one of the 3 finisher techs (those that give access to Victory Wonders) is almost certainly going to lose.

Warfare is simplified, with there being a massively reduced number of units to choose from, and there are no faction specific unique units any longer. There are also no forts or citadels, making defensive playstyles somewhat less lucrative. 

Rising Tide is a good expansion, although I don't think its worth the asking price in any scenario. It simply doesn't have enough content to justify a $30 investment. At most, I'd recommend dropping $15 on, and that only if you plan to play it for a significant amount of time.

PROs:
+ Its CIV!
+ Exciting setting and concept
+ New affinity system
+ Frequent side quests and decisions (my favourite feature!)
+ Badass units 

CONs:
- No luxury resources (some people prefer this, but I personally enjoyed trading and utilising these resources in Civ 5)
- No AI depth in diplomacy or gameplay
- Many of the windows and even the text used by the AI has just been lazily copied from Civ 5
- Computer opponents are discovered as soon as they enter/land in the game (Again some people like this and I suppose it is more realistic, but I enjoyed not knowing where my opponents were and it encouraged you to explore the map!) 
- No context to buildings or wonders etc - this was disappointing, that gorgeous artwork that would appear after building a wonder in Civ 5 was amazing and really gave you a sense of context and that WOW factor of thinking it belonged to you! All you get in this game is a brief description of what the building/wonder does and that's it.

I kind of forgot about it, but I recently noticed there was a DLC out, right about the time I was looking for something new to play, so I figured I'd get the DLC and give this game its rightful chance.

I can't give you a thorough review yet, but I can tell you that at least so far (10 hours in), this game feels just like the previous games in the series, or at least like Civilization 2-5. I've never played the first, so I don't really know what it was like. I'll get to the specifics after spending some more time playing, but generally, it's pretty much what I was expecting, and what I suppose anyone who's ever played a Civilization game before should expect.

Anyway, I know this game wasn't received as well as the last couple of Civilization games, and honestly, if there's a good reason for that, I haven't found it yet. I'm writing these very lines after forcing myself to stop playing, so I could get some sleep before a long day tomorrow. I could have otherwise easily kept on playing for a few more hours at least.

More info to come as soon as I feel I have a good enough grasp of the specifics, especially in comparison to the previous games in the series.

Update (14h+):
While my general opinion of the game hasn't changed much since I started playing, I figured I'd share what I now consider to be its biggest flaw, which was also mentioned and discussed by many other reviewers. While the formula hasn't changed much since Civilization 5, the game's main backstory theme has, and in my opinion, it has changed for the worse. Up until Civilization 5, the series, at least for me, was about history, culture and progress. While Beyond Earth is also about progress, it lacks the other elements. Sure, each faction has its own history and culture, but those are totally alien and meaningless to me, as they're not an important part of the game, and I feel no urge to learn about them. If Civilization 5 was based, loosely as it was, on some true historical background, Beyond Earth is pure fiction in that regard. Some people may find this futuristic theme curious and refreshing, but I, for one, would rather have it the way it was before.

Having all that said, as of now, there's no other strategy game I'd rather play. Not even Civilization 5, which has my highest playing time count (500h+) on record ever since I installed Steam.",1454202086,1454629529,True,8,0,0.579449892044067383,0,True,False,False

I keep trying to find something to like about it but it just doesn't do it.  Lets start with the map. Even on the largest sized map it insists on plopping the other players only a few hexes away. There will be huge unoccupied areas, and most of the players still end up tossed together on one small continent. I have tried mixing it up with the map settings available but somehow some other, or many civs ends up nose to nose with you with a mainly empty map elsewhere.

The AI leaders are extremely predictable. If you don't agree with their choice of purity / supremacy / harmony they will hate you by the time you hit level 7. The diplomacy is limited and has never been fixed. 

The tech web is a mess and makes it difficult to get anywhere.  You have to try to remember where thing X falls in this mess every time you play it. The wonders are mostly meaningless and underpowered for the amount of time and energy you need to put into building them. There are way too many normal buildings which do the same thing in most cases. The cost / benefit ratio is just so wrong that I don't really bother trying to build most of the wonders. Its better if an enemy builds one because they're wasting time and resources.

The aliens... Passive agressive jerks. They make a big deal about how the aliens are supposed to be more intelligent than barbarians in civ. The only intelligent thing about them is if you keep killing them eventually they get agressive planet wide. Which pretty much guarantees that the purity factions will eventually tick them off to the point that if you defend yourself they will swarm. If you play the harmony affinity they are supposed to bother you less, but they don't. They still randomly swipe at workers or anything that wanders by so the best way to play is complete genocide, no matter which affinity you pick. If you blast them from orbit with lasers or planet carvers somehow they still know you did it. I guess thats the intelligent part? LOL

A huge chunk of every map is wasted with arctic ice so you can't navigate through it. Its like a brick wall. Please, they're trying to say a civilization with tech to colonize another planet can't build an ice breaker or submarine? Really? 

Alliances are for the birds with AI's. Just don't bother, you're better off without friends.

The game is seriously a mess and all they're interested in doing is attaching even worse DLC's to it, instead of fixing the mess they made with this. Skip all of it until 2k sells the franchise to some other developer with brains.",1454386343,1454386343,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- the tech web is a confusing mess
- the art is hard to parse when looking at the game screen
- there's some kind of weird blur filter over anything not centered on your screen that makes my eyes hurt
- did you LOVE the barbarians in Civ 5 b/c this game has them and they have tanks (siege worms)
- the theming is barely there :/ you build a wonder, and you get shown the same schematic image FOR EVERY ONE OF THEM :( what happened to AC's amazing movies? what happened to at least having a unique pic? fuck.


Pros:

- Makes you want to play Civ 5, which is a stellar game with clearer themeing and excellent UI
- Makes you want to play Alpha Centauri which is only a few bucks on GoG and is a stellar game with a super weird theme and story seeping from every tech and wonder

Its a beautiful blend of the classic Civ games, with influences from other games like Alpha Centari and Fallen enchauntress. This games best features in my opinion are the Unit Customization, and wide varieties of wild life in the form of aliens to kill or be killed by (instead of those stupid barbarians that never change...)

In this game you choose between 3 affinities, and between those three, there are drastic changes to units, bonuses, victory conditions, and it even effects how you are treated by the alien life. Making them either be horribly aggressive to you, or even helpfull to you to the point where you can start to train them for your armies.

This game has also completly redone the diplomicy aspect of the game, and while there is no longer a diplomatic victory type it is arguably more important now, and will be very important no matter how you choose to win. Instead of letting you choose some helpfull or harmfull game disissions, Diplomacy now grants you permanent bonuses to your troops, economy, and relations with other civs. 

In short, this game is nothing shot of amazing, with a very well thought out gameplay system that makes every game different and challenging. its everything I have wanted in a civ game since I first descovered the franchise. However.. if I am to say there is one bad thing about the game, it would be the tech tree. 

Science has, in my personal opinion, gotten a little bit frustrating at times mainly due to the change to there new ""wed design"" basically your starting tech is in the centre and you move outwards from there, strung together like a spiders web, while this can be very fun and bring an even greater challenge to the game (mainly because you and your opponents could travel very different scientific paths) it is frustraighting.

the techs arnt layed out in any kind of catagorys liek they were in the other civ games, you will have to go all over the web to get all the ones you need for a specific victory. While i will say none of the techs are ""usless"" i often find i dont need a lot of the once I am forced to get, and the time it takes to reaserch them and move on means i loose some of the wonders I was looking for.

This is a minor problem for me, and I will admit its not that big of a deal when you compare it to all the fun of seeing widly diverse scientific paths all the players take. so my final decission for Civilizations: Beyond Earth, is a Must buy

(-) Espionage is still unbalanced. ARC and Chengsu can make enormous profit by simple rushing for Computing and Spy Agency.

It is really regretable they felt the need to change the diplomacy from Civ 5, which was great.  And then they made it a new system of boxes to fill.  Ditto with the inclusion of espionage, which neber sworks smoothly in a game of this scale, and was once again just abou filling boxes with points.

The new tech web is interesting if hard to organize/interpret at times.  The affinities are a cool idea, but they both seemed to get swamped by the new diplomacy system and don't seem to actually take you down that different of paths.

The colors on the maps while nicely alien, are a little too smiilar to the faciton colors and so everything blends together.  
The decison to include robust ocean colonies was a mistake, more is not always better and having even more of an already cluttered map clutter visually is kind fo jarring.  It breaks  the peaceful contrast from bustling land and relaxing sea.  The whole map is just a srawrm of units/improvements/cities.

One day they will figure out less is more.  There is a nice middle ground that is fun and a managble time commitment between the near mobile game STARSHIPS and this.

PROS

- Civ in space. Do i need to say more? If you are a fan of everything scifi and space related, it is a big plus.
- Brand new tech tree, futuristic and scifi inspired. It is fun to think about how humanity might evolve in space. Even though there are some nonsensical stuff like ""physics"" tech. I am pretty sure you have long mastered physics if you are exploring space.
- A bunch of new mechanics that feel fresh if you played civ5 to the ground and are tired of it. New affinity system, new virtue system, miasma, alien creatures, etc.

CONS

- AIs lost their flavor. There is nothing as charismatic as montezuma for instance. Also a useless ""favor"" system where AIs will basicly ask you for free stuff instead of offering money and goods as usual.
- Some short sightness in design. For instance there are no melee boats (for taking cities) and you can't boost embarked move speed, so going for a sea conquest your boats will move 7 tiles at a time while your melee units (necessary to take towns since there are no melee boats) will lag behind at 2 tiles per move.
- The tech tree is a head scratcher. More complex without any streamlining or core axis of development. After 10 games i am still confuzzled everytime i look at it.
- It feels like you need to by the DLC (that is also overpriced) to get the complete experience. Some things are missing from vanilla like melee boats and diplomacy is almost non existant in the base game.
- Color scheme feel weird at first but you get used to it after a couple of games. Still don't understand why grassland looks almost exactly the same as plains etc. Would have been nice to be able to tell the difference without tooltips.

I'll start with the positives: This civ has a lot of really cool ideas such as aliens, tech web, orbital satellites, 'archaeological findings' and other interesting quests. On high settings, the game looks very pretty. If you're a civ fan it's worth checking out (depending on how much this costs at the time). Maybe try for free if they have that for a couple days.

Unfortunately, there are aspects of the game that bring it down, such as diplomacy (which is huge), lackluster wonders, very uninteresting leaders, lack of end game info/stats and the small roles aliens have. You can make a limited amount of trade deals with other civs. This is literally almost the only things you can do with them. You cannot really bargain like you could in past civs, and ask for items/cities/favors, etc. Civs are just plain boring and using the new diplomacy currency to make deals is not very exciting.

Now I did not pay full price (40$) and have never played without the expansions as they were included in the price. So I cannot tell you anything about the vanilla game. 

-So far I have enjoyed exploring the planet and wondering what lies around each corner. There is stuff to find all over. 
-The map is very nicely done and the game is easily the best looking civilization game made. Sound is very good too.
-Alien life is rich and diverse, though you will still see a lot of the same ones, their is enough variety to keep things interesting.
-Interesting planets from frozen wastelands to volcanic ones.

I have not finished the game yet, but was worried to try this game after all the bad reviews it got. Well if you love Sci FI and enjoy playing civilization casually, then you will probably enjoy this game. With the expansions it is a good game.

If you rush through every game and try and play competitive matches, then maybe a science fiction game about exploration and colonization is just not your thing and you should stick with civ 5 and/or wait for civ 6. 
Also if you are burnt out on civ 5, keep in mind this is a reskin so you will probably get burnout on this quick too.

Alright, so here are the questions I wanted to ask before buying this game.

WOW, IS THE GAME REALLY AS BAD AS THE RATINGS SUGGEST???

Most (not all) of the negative ratings are people uber pissed they paid $50-60 dollars for the base game back in the day.  If you paid $50-60 for the base game, you'd be uber pissed, too.  If, however, you paid $20 like me (or even less with recent sales), you'd be fine with your purchase.  The base game really isn't that bad; it's not particularly memorable, but pay $15-20, and you should avoid any buyer's remorse.


DOES THE DLC HELP? IT'S KIND OF EXPENSIVE.

Yes! Rising Tide boosts Beyond Earth from an okay game to a very good game.  If you even remotely liked Beyond Earth, pick up Rising Tide immediately.  If you have neither, you should be able to get both Beyond Earth and Rising Tide together for around $40-50 in a future sale.  While the DLC might have too high a price tag, the two items combined are definitely worth $40-50.


LOTS OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE SAYING TO STICK WITH CIVILIZATION V.  SHOULD I BOTHER GETTING BEYOND EARTH IF I ALREADY HAVE CIV V?

Most defintiely.  Beyond Earth is NOT just a poor man's Civ V with a space skin thrown on.  Instead, I would say it's built on a Civ V chassis.  Players will recognize many of the same concepts and game mechanics, but also notice significant differences.  

Just a few: 

1) ""aliens"" function quite differently from ""barbarians"" in older games 

2) the tech ""tree"" is really more of a ""web"" now, and many of the technological choices have no equivalent in previous Civ games.  They didn't take the existing tree and say, ""Ooooooh, let's just call it 'space bronze working' now.""

3) affinity levels -- how your civilization will relate to the Old Earth and your new home -- have a significant impact on the types of buildings, military units, etc available to you.

4) there are some cool new types of victory scenarios.  Ahhh, nothing like the feeling of sending giant alien hybrids through a warp gate back to old Earth to ""emancipate"" them from their petty bickering.


It's a decent base game, well worth a $15-20 investment.  As with Civ V, I think it will become a truly great game once all the DLC dust has cleared.  Jump on the bandwagon now and enjoy the ride.",1451756253,1451756253,True,7,0,0.554833948612213135,0,True,False,False

Am enjoying the game at the moment 11 hours in.

Good;

- Diverse unit upgrades
- Distinct characteristics and victory types
- My archipelago map looks very alien
- Great Civ V aspects easy to learn
- Tech map is very daunting web, but nicely sci-fi
- Performance is great on i7 4770, zero crashes so far is excellently reliable compared to other game experiences
- Alien life is interesting adds to game more than barbarians in Civ V
- Leader traits are diverse, can situationaly change them which adds depth
- Orbital layer is interesting adds new dimension to standard Civ V hex map, literally

Bad:

- Mini map colors are dull
- Map color pallette is alien which is good, but hard for my terran biased mind to easily distinguish sea / land / terrain types, getting used to it slowly
- Tech tree is very different, not immediately easy to use and master
- Alien life seems very easy with higher upgrades

Enjoying the game so far much more than I thought I would, though have this with the Rising Tide DLC and all the latest patches which have probably added a lot to the base game.

 I have found ""nowadays"" that buying into games much later with all the DLC at a discounted price is often worth it to experience the game better than the early less complete releases. Not so great for game development, but games are so often ""bare bones"" at release now and fill out with time.

I got this game day one. I've played it about 5 times inthe last year or so (I forget when it came out).

Dialogs and windows pop away as you are selcting thing so that the game can show you a stupid combat or alien animation.

Maybe these bugs get fixed inthe rising tide expansion -- dunno and don't care fix the first version and maybe I'll consider the expansion.

I bought it and gave it a shot. Please be aware that while I recommend this game, it is ONLY with the Rising Tide DLC. It is absolutely not worth playing without it.

I've only played for about 9 hours, and I can say that I am having a lot of fun. I played a bit without the DLC and it had a lot of issues, but they were mostly resolved with Rising Tide. Here are my pros and cons:

PROS:
[list]
    [*]The music is outstanding, I have to say. It's very beautiful and made the game feel epic.
    [*]The espionage system in this game is excellent! It is a ton of fun. I hated the system in Civ V, it was next to useless if you had researched the most technologies. You couldn't do much with the spies other than make them diplomats and protect your cities from other people stealing technologies, which was a huge nuisance. In Beyond Earth, there is so much your covert agents can do. They can buy materials on the black market, steal science, food, energy, steal units, and other really awesome things. I kept hoping for more agents so I could do more.
    [*]The various quests that allowed you to customize your individual buildings really added to the game. There was a similar feature in a Civ V mod that I thought was pretty much essential for that game.
    [*]The respect/fear of the various leaders that go up and down depending in their personality and your choices as a leader are much more dynamic than civilization 5 (these come with Rising Tide, without it they are utterly boring and lifeless).
    [*]I love the ability to build cities on ocean and move them around, it really opens up some interesting gameplay ideas.
    [*]The fact that upgrading units is free and upgrades all of them at once is was less of a pain in the ass
    [*]All in all it's smoother and doesn't seem to tax my system.
[/list]

CONS:
[list]
    [*]The technology tree is a mess. Don't get me wrong, the general idea of making it non-linear and allowing you to develop in different ways is a good one. But there are so goddamn many technologies, and since this is a futuristic game, they all have funny names with no explanation as to what they mean or what they do. You are really given no idea or direction as to where to begin or what is useful. Again, all of the buildings and units they grant are not explained well and have funny names that don't really explain what they do. After a few hours of gaming I started to get a handle on it, but it is definitely not newbie-friendly.
    [*]I do miss a lot of the personalities and familiarity that came with Civ 5 and its leaders. However, this isn't the game's fault so much as mine for prefering a 4x game based on Earth's cultures and civilization development. Rising Tide did fix a lot of the problems with personalities.
    [*]Expansion definitely isn't as fun in this game. In Civilization 5 I loved taking over the entire world. I spent about 7 hours in one game and it was very tedious. I maybe managed to cover 1/4th of the map and was ready to end the game. Other leaders were complaining about my expansion when I only had 4 cities and was far away from them.
    [*]Some of the quests are bugged. There were two quests I was unable to complete as it wouldn't let me perform the tasks they set before me.
    [*]I miss the religion system from Civilization 5. There is no equivalent in this game.
    [*]The price. Neither the base game nor Rising Tide is worth what they are charging, period. While I am enjoying myself, I definitely think I overpayed, even buying both during the Steam Winter Sale. I got the base game for 15 bucks. I think that 10 is the max you should pay for it. And Rising Tide? Charging 25 dollars during a sale is practically theft, let alone its normal price of 30 dollars. Rising tide brings the game up to the level of what it should have been on release. You should not pay more than 10 bucks for the game, though in my opinion it should have been free, as the base game feels completely unfinished without it.
[/list]

So I do recommend this game, with caveats. If you enjoyed Endless Space, this game has a similar feel, though you're colonizing one planet instead of many. You should be willing to get the Rising Tide expansion, and you should be willing to overpay for it if you want to buy this game.

I haven't played this game for a very long time, however I have formed plenty of thoughts on it.

PROS
It is an interesting concept
The layout and aesthetics of the game are extremely fun
You have lots of choice in the game (which is good after you begin gameplay)
There are a few new challenges to face

CONS
It is too familiar for old civ players, it feels extremely similar and doesn't really add anything new. For players new to, it could be confusing.
During the setup of the game, you are given many choices to make, however not much information on what those choices mean. This makes it harder to strategize and understand what you want out of the game.
Although it is fun for a bit, there's not much motivation which quickly loses my attention
It's a great concept, but definitely should not cost as much as Civ V.
It feels very predictable, and fits well under the stereotype of what it would be like to go to another planet. For example the aliens, plant species, and technology are exactly what you might expect in a sci-fi movie about aliens, or space. It would be a lot better if you didn't know what to expect. 

THOUGHTS
It is a wonderful concept, and a very visually pleasing game, but could've been executed more thoroughly.  Personally, I would like this idea a lot better if it was another era at the end of the timeline, so you can bring your tech, xp, gold, etc. to space and feel more prepared to begin on a new planet.

The biggest downside is moronic AI teammate and the diplomacy system. They will declare war on their own, only to negotiate peace on their own a moment later. That's all good and fine... Until your relationship with them take a huge nosedive because they tell you to ""Don't trust them!"" and promptly take away 2 points from their relationship with you.

Common Resource have almost no meaning, especially after a certain point in the game where a common farm can outperform plantations et al.

Orbital Units are fun, but after they are launched, you can't move them at all. This includes a certain flying octopus. ""Hey, flying alien monstrocity, you want to nudge over a hex so that you can eat that ship alive? No? Ok."". A lot of that make no sense.

Leashing alien was fun until the 5th time you leashed a scarab and realize how pointless it was.

At least they are fun way to make energy. ""Come here, lil monstrous faceripping alien. That's a good boy, now into the gene smelter with you!""

[h1]PROS: SOME AREAS OF THE GAME ARE GREAT...[/h1]

If you're familiar with Civ at all, it plays like a Civ game for the most part. It keeps the hex tile system first introduced in Civ V, as well as the basic systems behind cities, i.e. build a settler/choose production/units-buildings-wonders separation. However, there are a LOT of changes made. The familiar, somewhat linear tech tree has been replaced with a tech web; there are base techs that are interconnected in layers, with ""leaf"" techs attached to individual base techs and the ""Habitation"" tech your root technology, akin to ""Agriculture"" in the numerical Civ games. There are also more sea resources, a ""virtue"" system that encourages selecting strategic virtues and discourages trying to put all your culture points into a single tree like in Civ V, an exploration system that stays relevant throughout the game thanks to satellites that have dis-orbited becoming like the Ancient Ruins or ""goodie huts"" from previous games, and with the Rising Tides expansion, sea-based cities that don't grow their borders with culture, but rather by moving to new tiles.

TL,DR: It improves upon a lot of established paradigms within the Civ series but still stays mostly true to form.

[h1]CONS: ...BUT WHAT THE FUCK WERE THEY SMOKING HALF THE TIME?[/h1]

The classic complaint with the game is that the ""Affinities"" system, which is similar to ""Ideologies"" from Civ V, feel kinda samey, with little variance between the three, but I didn't personally see that. My problem lies with the diplomacy system. Civ V got a lot of flak from fans when it first released because many diplomatic features such as vassalage were lost in transition, and Beyond Earth (with the Rising Tide add-on) continues that disappointing trend to the extreme. Gone are demands and more complex dealings with other colonies, replaced by a system of personality traits and ""Diplomatic Capital"". ""Diplomatic Capital"" is something introduced in Rising Tide, and it's a counter that increases or decreases each turn similar to gold in previous games. Saved ""Diplomatic Capital"" can be used to purchase or upgrade personality traits, which provide a bonus to you and provide diplomatic options that the other colonies can use. You don't get the benefits of those diplomatic options, the only thing you get is a set amount of ""Diplomatic Capital"" per turn that they're providing as payment. This system would be fine, were it not THE ONLY METHOD OF DIPLOMACY YOU HAVE. Need a strategic resource you're running low on? Well you have 3 options: find a city that both has that resource and doesn't already have a trade route going to it (because cities can now only receive 1 trade route total), send a spy to buy it on the black market for a large amount of ""Diplomatic Capital"" per turn, or wallow in your own self-pity. As far as I know, though, this only applies to the Rising Tides expansion, so feel free to turn it off/not get it, provided you're willing to live without aquatic cities, submarines, and the other myriad changes Rising Tide included

I tried up to level two, with each leader before I got real mad, frustrated, and said - no more.  I expected so much more from a Sid Meier (designed?) game.  The graphics are dull, the play is slow (even on quick),  you have no pull out/drop down for all the details of research advancements, and combat is again lacking basic understandable attack/defense ROE.

+ A streamlined Civ V formula brought into space and the sci-fi era.
+ A solid forward-telling story of a likely ""future scenario"" done in classic Sid Meier's fashion.
+ Solid replayability with the three paths you can take to bring your faction to the end, and even mixes.
+ Some carry-over into and out of Sid Meier's Starships.
+ Rising Tide adds a lot to the game, like fleshing out the aformentioned barebones diplomacy and spying systems.

- Lost a lot of the X-factor and character that the original Civilization series had in spades.
- Diplomacy is bare-bones, akin to on-release Civ V without expansions.
- Science-fiction future setting may put off some purists.
- Sid Meier's Starships is a multi-platform (mobile) game and as such is not as deep as Beyond Earth.
- Rising Tide is needed to extend the game beyond the barebones problems it has.",1439492013,1450814465,True,3,0,0.501347720623016357,0,True,False,False

This is only the first part of the game and to get the full experience of the game, not just for the added bonuses, you have to buy the expensive expansion ""Rising Tide"". After purchasing the expansion, the game is great fun and has many new features which make the gameplay interesting and dynamic.

I would have purchased this game for the price of the two downloads combined but to release a half finished game and then to release 'an expansion' which is actually just the rest of the game is verging on dishonesty. 

Also this game has now decided to stop starting and I can no longer play it.

That tells what a disapointment Civ Beyond Earth has been for me.

Civ Beyond Earth is just Civ 5 with different factions, different techs and wonders. That's it. 
Nothing more.

Civ 5 (and all those before) at least creates an emotional bond with the player as we got to replay the history of our world.
There are no emotional bonds between player and game in Civ Beyond Earth. The aliens are just like Barbarians in Civ 5. And the interaction between human factions is even more diluted than in any Civ before that.

Really, really, really disappointing.
Sid Meier: Please come back and re-invent the game that you created to the utmost delight of the hordes of fans we are.
Those in charge of your game are now killing it slowly!

UPDATE: I just bought and played with the ""Rising Tide"" DLC. It does make the game a little more enjoyable folks. But it is not worth the headline price. I recommend you to wait that it is on sale and grab it then. 
As per my previous review: Only buy this if it is heavily discounted by Steam and make your opinion by yourself. 
I still do not recommend this game. 
I love CIV games so much that I got tempted again to buy this DLC.... But, again: disappointed.

The game is lacking any sort of character to make it memorable. You open diplomacy with the other leaders, and they say the exact same thing every single time, whereas Civ V gave them some variety. The consequences of picking a different affinity to the other leaders are generic. Even having specific insults for each leader and sponsor would have made them stand out.

Like many Civ games, it is filled with quotes, but the quotes read when you discover new technologies are read in the same voice, and just seem silly or absurd. Why is it wrong that the world is unspoilt and beautiful? The thing that made Alpha Centauri so memorable is that the issues explored in that game are real philosophical and ethical debates. Yang may have seemed like a monster, but he was only acting according to the principles of utilitarianism. What motivates Kozlov's ideas of progress? You never really know. 

The gameplay has never been balanced well, and there's nothing really to strive for. No must-have wonders, strategies to complement your sponsor's unique abilities, special terrain features like Kilimanjaro in Civ V or the Monsoon Jungle of Alpha Centauri, or any real military advantages. You get to make choices throughout the game about what new effect each building has, but for most of them there's either only one right choice in all cases, or it doesn't matter.

The DLC made me sad.  Real sad.  Base game is alright, though.  

Updated 12/12/15

The new expansion did not meet expectations.  6/10 cannot recommend.  
Go play Civ 5.  Rising Tide made me feel as if they don't want me to play this game anymore.  

This is an old review based on the base game, so I'll keep it relevant to that but I warn you:  if you enjoy playing 4x strategy games, stay away from this one.  It's not headed in a reletively good direction.  Take this review with a gigantic grain of salt.  

Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a game seemingly intended for veterans of the 4x strategy genre and not Civ fans [b] directly [/b].  I believe this ultimately hurt the game, but it does not detract from the gameplay if you are prepared for it.  The game does differ in a lot ways to Civ 5 in many ways and has many different mechanics in terms of how to allocate your time and resources, but it is also similar in some aspects.  

When I first began playing this game as a sort of newbie to the series starting from Civ 5, I did not find this game very engaging and I felt like the game was lacking in a lot of ways that made Civ 5 such an outstanding title (if you include dlc).  It was not until I had played and understood a more complicated 4x strategy that I began to play more about this game (specifically Endless Space).  Now that I do understand more about this game, I'll attempt to explain some of the more basic elements.

[b] Mechanics [/b]

Affinities:
Affinities are basically the freedom/order/autocracy of this game, just much, much more important.  Affinities are what define your civilization.  There are three kinds: Harmony, Supremacy, and Purity.  Affinities affect how other civilzations react to you and what sort of victories you can achieve.  Delving deep into an affinity is necessary to win certain victories and is beneficial towards your military, as units grow in power as your affinity strengthens.  The more you develop into an affinity, the more your civ becomes like that affinity.  Your actions quickly become louder than your words as you and the other civilizations advance into their affinities and you will find friends and foes alike based on nothing but your ideology.  

Science:
Probably the most important thing in the entire game next to affinities.  The science web (yes that's web, not tree) comes in two parts: branches and leaves.  Branches are the basic parts to a technology that allow you move further into the web by researching them.  Leaves allow you to speciallize in a tree. Unlike branches, you can't progress further into the web by reasearching leaves. Leaves, however, often offer better benefits than the more generalized branches do.  Unlike Civ 5 where the science tree is linear and you must keep up research in order to progress as a civilization, you can pick and chose exactly what technology will help you the best for what you are trying to do.  As a new player to this game and games like this, that's a lot of choices to pick from and it can get confusing at times.  It's important to understand what victories there are, what victory you want to pursue, and decide on researching technologies based on what victory you want. 

Virtues: 
Like previous Civ games, culture is also an important aspect of the game.  Culture allows you to obtain virtues which provide boosts to your civilization.  There are 4 virtue trees: might, prosperity, knowledge and industry.  Delving deep into a tree will boost combat, food, production, energy (money), science, culture or health based on which trees you chose.  Once again, this game provides with the choice of what virtues you want to pick, and how you want to allocate them.  If you chose to speciallize in a tree, you will get unique benefits the more you put into that tree.  If you chose to go into multiple trees, you get unique benefits generalizing into the same level in each tree.  

Spying:
Spies provide nice, one-time bonuses you your civilization ever so-often.  Spies can establish spy networks, siphon money, steal science or even call giant siege worms to wreak havoc on another civilization's city.  Spies, although not vital, are very helpful to your civlization's goals. 

Aliens:
You can make aliens friend or foe - it's entirely your choice.  The harmony affinity allows you to be at peace with the alien life on the planet and even use them against your foes.  Supremacy and Purity, however, could care less about the aliens.  If you don't wish to make the aliens friends, they quickly become nuissances that must be dealt with from time to time.  Keep in mind, though, that attacking the local wildlife can put you at odds with other civilizations bent on protecting and preserving the alien life.  

Miasma:
Some of the most annoying stuff in the game.  Miasma covers certain land tiles on the map and it slowly deals damage to units that end their turn on it.  You can get rid of the miasma by researching the right technologies and using workers or satellites, or use the miasma to your advantage by delving into the harmony affinity allowing them to instead heal your units for the same amount every time a unit ends their turn on it.  

[b] Conclusion: [/b]

The only reason I could recommend this game before was because I thought the DLC would fix some of the issues I had with it.  Now that I am thoroughly disappointed, I can say this game is not something I will be enjoying for awhile.  


[b] TL;DR [/b]

Game is okay. 
Put time in and you might like it... or hate it.  Probably hate it.
On the surface, kinda boring/lacking potential.
Rising Tide is garbage.

The game feels like there's more choice of customization, although the unit customization was effectively just picking from a pair of upgrades every once in a while. Choice for which technology to research is however more open than ever. And the diplomacy system is a welcome change from the standard trade/declare war/ask for alliance I've been used to in Civ games.

However the game didn't stray enough from the basic civ gameplay, sure you have new features but there's just not enough for them to provide a whole new and unique experience. If you played a lot of civ 5 before, it's likely going to feel more like a reskin, you're probably going to use alot of the same basic strategies of how to develop cities and so on, though there is novelty in the new decisions to make, the quest system and the new technologies, so there might be enough to keep you interested too.

In the end, if you never played a civ game or did so only casually and like the genre, go for it. If you have played civ 5 it might be good to first look into what's new in this one before purchasing it and whether the new features are worthy of your money as the core experience is still very much the same.",1449963148,1449963148,True,3,0,0.534306943416595459,0,True,False,False

TL;DR:
+Great sci-fi setting
+Interesting Civpedia entries
+Affinity system
+Unit upgrades

-Lack of variety in leader animations and backround
-Bland pictures in techwebs and unit icons
-Barebones trading

I like the setting in the game. Humanity has more or less ruined Earth because of the ""Great Mistake"", which was the devastating war that was fought over dwindling recources. Now the brave few must take to the stars in order to find a new planet for humanity live in.

Judging from the factions (or sponsors as the game calls them), nations don't exist as the same as we know, but are divided into companies, unions and commonwealths. This is a very interesting way of defining the playable factions. However the leader variety is lacking in terms of animation and backround in my opinion. Variable backrounds and personalities are nowhere to be seen like we've seen in games like Civ 5. More variation in this section would've added to the immersion of the game. The leaders still represent their ethnicity and nationality in looks, and it is very amusing and cool to see them change as certain affinity is gained.

Diplomacy in this game was bland at best when the game was inititally released, but the new diplomacy system that came with Rising Tide introduced a more interesting way of politicking. You gain diplomatic capital and you can make deals with other sponsors in order to gain benefits from them and vice versa. There are domestic, foreign and military sections in the diplomacy and they have much variation to choose from. Unfortunately you can't trade strategic recources like you trade in Civ 5. If you make a trade route, the trade route automatically export the city's strategic recources.

The techweb was a mess, but Rising tide added some logic to it by adding colors to certain techs and units to help players navigate through it. I usually prefer techwebs to techtrees. What I would've wanted was a bit more graphic and vivid pictures to the techweb and units. Think how cool it would've been if there was a fully colored picture of a Master Control-wonder or Gene garden? Of course I understand that it takes a lot of effort and imagination, but I'm just throwing it out there.

The combat is pretty much alike to Civ 5, but with the addition of orbital combat units. Personally I like the affinity-bound unit upgrading system, where as you gain more affinity, the more your units improve. You can even choose hybrid units that the Rising tide expansion introduced.

The AI seems very easy to defeat! I was suprised when I played with the second hardest difficulty (Soyuz) that I hardly broke a sweat. And this is coming from a player who has had under a year of experience of 4X games.

The Civpedia articles are interesting to read and they (unfortunately) are one of the few factors that add in to the immersion of the game. I would have wanted some lore on the hybrid units, but the only thing that you can read about, for example, the Hellions (Supremacy/Harmony soldier unit) is the same entry that is written about the starting soldier unit.

In conclusion I enjoy the game, but in this state I wouldn't buy it for a full price. I recommend that you buy the whole thing when the base game and the coming and current DLC's come in sale.",1449932488,1449932488,True,1,0,0.511560678482055664,0,True,False,False

It's a nice change of pace from playing Civ for the thousandth time, especially if you like the scifi genre better as a backdrop. Fans of the ancient ""Alpha Centauri"" game will see a lot of thematic similairites in this game, but that's where it ends. It has some good aspects that set it apart from the rest of the Sid Meier's games: The affinity system makes for interesting game play, the cultural track is far more versatile, and the victory conditions seem to have been refined somewhat. On the downside, the new tech track looks cool but is kind of an inchorent jumble that doesn't encourage a tech-based strategy. The new espionage system is clean, but seems to lack depth. The trade system was completely annoying and a drag on gameplay in the earlier incarnations of the game. Though much of that has been fixed, there are still aspects to the trade system that seem somewhat mystifying (e.g. why can I send my trade missions half way across the globe but not to the settlement right next to mine?). 

One of the issues this game shares with it's sister game Civ V is that in the interest of having a robust platform for future expansions and modding, the game has gotten somewhat bloated, and will tax even beefy systems when you have all the bells and whistles turned on. My middle-of-the-road gaming rig huffs and puffs on it, and the desirability of playing large scale campaigns on a laptop when traveling is sub-par. Hopefully, in the next generation version of the platform they streamline not only for gameplay but for efficiency as well.

I used to play civ 3 with my brothers, then i played civ 4, and then onto civ 5.  When I heard they were making another civ I was really excited,  each new installment had been an interesting new development.  I admit I was rather skepticle of civ 5 and took awhile to get into it.  I really hope Beyond Earth turns out to be the same although I don't see it happening.

When I first saw gameplay of it i thought, hey... this looks a hell of a lot like civ 5.  I was right, except it's worse.  Whereas civ 5 gives the clear progression of technology, beyond earth has this horrible confusing tangle, which lets you (try) to jump straight from what would be ancient era, into the modern era.  I say try because the tech will let you sit there researching your butt off for 150 turns until you get it.

They tried to reimplement health, from civ 4 into Beyond Earth but really it's just a replacement for happiness from civ 5 except without a good way to generate it.  I found myself, after settling one new city struggling to even maintain net 0 health.  Being attacked by, and capturing a city of some randomly named ass hole only plunged me deeper into unhealthiness, when annexing the city said it would give me 0 increase...

Aside from gameplay issues this game just doesn't feel clean at all.  I started it up for the first time and immediately noticed how jerky everything seemed to be going.  I was moving the mouse across the screen as if my fps was 2 when it said it was 1200.  I figured of course it would be because the ""optimized"" starting graphics would have messed it all up as always happens so i went in and reset them all.  As soon as I changed the resolution everything seemed to clear up.  The mouse moved smoothly, just the way it should and I was relieved.  I thought I'd solved the problem. How wrong I was.  See, changing the other graphics settings from minimum to maximum said it required the game to be restarted, which I did without fuss.  Only to find my horrible stuttering mouse returned on startup, not only that, but for some reason my mouse was overlayed on the screen during the opening cutscenes, as well as the loading screen, before turning into the regular civilized mouse you see in game.  I went back into the options to make sure everything was set how it should be, which it was not.  Everything had returned to minimum settings.  Feeling slightly miffed I set the resolution back to 1920x1080 59hz and instantly noticed my mouse had smoothed up again.  ""This isn't right I thought to myself, what's going on here.""

So I decided to have Nvidia GeForce Experience set my graphics for me.  It worked, set everything to max just like it should and I started up the game.  Again, mouse overlayed over the startup, no sound until i get to the menu, horrible buggy mouse.  I go in, change the resolution to something else, then back to clean up the buggy mouse and decide to start the game out for real.  Give it a test drive.  

I must say I did enjoy the starting bonus selections.  It was like taking the best parts from all the nations in civ 5 and putting them into one perfect nation to suit your play style.  However I was quickly thrown by layout of the UI.  Small things were annoying, the map was in the top right, instead of the bottom right like in EVERY OTHER CIV GAME EVER.  The buttons to exit various menus were all in different locations so there was no ""go to exit button"" which you don't really notice in most games because it's not a problem.  I decided I was going to get a mod to replace the UI with one more similar to civ 5, just so things felt a little more comfortable.  That's where I went wrong, see.

Upon opening the in-game steam window with shift+tab i knew something was very wrong. Nothing was responding when I clicked it.  The ""hover over"" indicator on some of the buttons would light up when the mouse was nowhere near them.  It was like everything was offset and I couldn't tell where I had to click to do anything.  Then the game crashed and the whole thing starts again.  First fix the jerky mouse, then go to mods, open the steam window and bam, it's still all messed up.  Surely restarting the game should have fixed it.  But no.

All in all, the game just feels horribly incomplete.  Things don't work the way they should, small errors on top of small errors compound into a game that's no longer enjoyable to play.  Add that to the fact that the game is really just a retextured version of civ 5, with a less cohesive research screen and city modifiers that make no sense and you get a game that's just not fun.

Civ 5 has its bugs, many of them, but compared to Beyond Earth it's a well thought out, planned, and implemented game.  Civ 4, a masterpiece if a bit dated.  Don't get this game.

I played over 80 hours in this game. I would say maybe less than 10 of those hours I was experimenting with other builds. The civilization choice you make doesn't have much of an impact in your decisions, or lackthereof.

There has never been a Civilization game that has railed you on as one particular path is clearly better than this one. You should do one of two things. You either play Harmony or you lose. The other two affinity trees are so underwhelming because of the lack of diverse units.

The units are imbalanced because once again, Harmoy allows you to just breath in the Miasma and eventaully make your units more powerful, while it still posions everyone else. The mechanics for the other affinities don't activly reward you and the units are not nearly as good.

Furthermore, the nations are all about the same power level, with a couple of them being slightly stronger than the other ones. They don't actually offer unique choices other than a small bonus that the other nations don't get. This makes the Harmony problem that much worse because everyone is rewarded for going down the harmony path.

Ok, so if you're still here I'll explain. I've put in over 300 hours in Civ 5, and I was very excited for this game at launch. I played several games when it launched, but never had any fun. I've come back to it every few months to start games, but I simply didn't have enough fun to go beyond turn 160 or so.
It's been enough time that I decided to try it again. . . And it still isn't fun for the reasons listed above. Although the DLC looks great, and yes I've watched several people play the media demos, it makes me feel betrayed. I spent a time and money on this game, and what should have been a major patch seems to be going into the DLC instead.

It is boring and bland and all together poorly thought out. I was really excited about the aliens. Seemed like barbarians with more flavor from Civ 5. So here's the key to dealing with the aliens: Ignore them. Just completely ignore them. Pretend they aren't even there and they just leave you alone. The alien AI is pathetic. If you decide you want to shoot them, they get mad. Ignore them and they ignore you. So stupid. They missed a beautiful opportunity to add a layer of novel complexity to the game. Instead they just put a bunch of silly bugs in the game. On top of that there is a silly bug where if you send your unit into the fog of war and there is another unit there that they can't see, they just attack it! How frigging stupid is that? It's not like that in Civ 5. If there is a unit there, they stop and wait for further orders? But in Beyond Earth, you go to WAR with aliens or another faction if you ACCIDENTALLY CLICK ON THEM. So stupid! 

In my first playthrough I fired exactly 0 shots. I never needed to. The map was so big and so full of resources I never needed to lock horns with anyone. I just expanded and out-researched everyone, and that wasn't even my focus. I was planning on fighting. It just never happened. And the tech tree...? I just kind of stumbled around because it was so poorly thought out and confusing. Initially I was going for a Supremacy Affinity, but about half way through I realized I didn't have any Supremacy affinity points, so I went with a different affinity and still dominated. In other words, I needed exactly 0 planning to completely dominate the other factions it was laughable. (And I was playing normal difficulty, mind you). 

This game doesn't feel finished. I had weird sounds bugs all throughout the game where the sound would just disappear for a few seconds, which doesn't help immersion. The resources are too plentiful and kind of stupid how they did it.

Wow, first off, I'm only bothering to add a positive review because I just realized the review rating right now is like 53%! Holy shnikes!

I understand, though. Really, after playing Civ 5 with all the DLC, Civ BE is kind of underwhelming. I think the biggest reason it comes short though is because of the limited number of factions. Only 8! If you want to play with more than 8, you either have to mod up (especially a pain in the ass for multiplayer or nigh impossible for non-Windows users), or overlap different players with the same ""sponsor."" Yes, the game does make it possible to do this and changes the color for the players using the same team, but, it's kind of a turn off to me to have to keep track of purple Brasil and green Brasil...

On the plus side though, and overall I do give this game a thumbs up (when it's on sale!), it does add a number of cool things ..... the Affinity branches and the technology web (that's right web... not tree) come to mind. The way units upgrade across the board as you increase Affinity levels is kind of cool. Being able to pick your upgrade bonuses and even mix Affinity branches up a little bit is kind of cool. Barbarians (aliens) are now much more interesting and can actually change hostility toward individual civs. And purely for flavor, the sci-fi battles and multiple terrain textures (desert / fungal / terran planets) are fun.

So, for Civ 5 + DLC fans, Civ BE right now is indeed not worth the big $. You'll miss nukes. You'll miss 20+ unique factions. However, if you enjoy sci-fi flare, it's worth it on sale. Get it for $20 or maybe even $30, depending on your impatience levels. Meh. Poor game deserves better than a 53% rating. Awww.",1426204776,1447722140,True,4,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

--Initial look/Hype--

I have always been a big fan over the civilisation series, all the way from the original on the Commodore 64 to Civ 5(which is currently my favorite in the series). So when i heard that a new game taking place after Civ 5 with influences from Alpha centuri was about to come out, i was understandably excited.

--Graphics--

It's basically what you would expect from a Civ style top down strategy, the graphics would be the same, if not better than the last. Unfortunately this was not the case, they obviously took the time to put some detail into the animation of the units and aliens but the finish was more reminiscent of Civ 4.

With the small file size of the game and the lackluster graphics, it still managed pushed my duel graphics card and CPU to the max. So much in fact that the game was lagging heavily and i could not figure out why.

--In game world--

The world kept true to it's promise, a Civ game on another plannet. If you choose to create a game instead of doing a quick start, you can choose the plannet, your sponsors, factions and colony type.

--Game-play/Controls--

Again fairly standard and what you would expect from a Civ game, point click interface in a turn based setup. The strength of units also felt unbalanced but not nearly as much as the city progression did.

I found the tech tree and culture tree to be a little too involved and complicated. So far as to not have a great progression of tech, instead it was haphazard and some tech seemed to be in the incorrect category, all of this made it abit hard to try and plan out the colonies progression.

--Story--

I'm not going to rate this, the Civ games have never had a story beyond you start with nothing and build up to something.

--Overall--

Again being a huge fan of the series, I was greatly disappointed. Badly rendered graphics, maxes out hardware for no reason and an expansion that just adds more crap to the game without really fixing any of the problems.

If you want to play a great strategy, play Civ 5, don't waste your money on a rushed and in my opinion, unfinished game. This will be the first time I have ever requested a refund from steam.

It IS a new game, which, although share some features of Civ5 (hex grid, battle system, unit classes, wonders, resources, neutral units) and AC (ideologies, sci-fi techs), is played differently.

The main focus in BE is on affinity (ideology) choices. As you specialise towards a particular victory type, you need to focus on specific technologies. Each next progress level gives you an affinity point, which in turn provides you with useful perks (upgrades) for your units + bonuses. These specific perks will radically change your units as you progress on specific affinity path (alien-like units, machine-like units or human units).

The culture works in a similar way as in Civ5. After certain level of culture is reached, you can acquire virtues (4 virtue categories – Might, Prosperity, Knowledge and Industry - in 3 tiers), which work in a similar way as social policies in Civ 5. There are synergy bonuses for focusing on same category virtues or same tier virtues.

Also, there are quests, research pods and exploration areas, which substantially can boost your progress over the time. As well as the destruction of aliens and alien nests, especially with certain Might virtues.

The victory types are following: Domination - conquer all other players; Contact - contact alien civilization; Transcendence (requires Harmony specialisation)  - civilization fully adapts to the new planet and becomes enlightened; Promised Land (requires Purity specialisation) - bring Earth population to the new planet; Emancipation (requires Supremacy specialisation) - conquer (""free"") Earth.

So, it's a completely different setting in Beyond Earth. And you require a different approach from what you're used to in Civ5. Although, the same basic rules are still in place: e.g., a) food is population, population is everything; b) science is progress, progress is victory.

When I played Beyond Earth for the first time, there were certain innovations that annoyed me, but after playing a while, I got used to them and they started to make sense for me.
For example:

1. Technology tree is replaced with technology web, which makes it hard to find things, unless you haven't played few sessions. However, with filters and search option, it becomes quite easy to find what you're looking for and to plan your strategy.
2. Miasma - spore clouds on some tiles that damage human units. This was really annoying in the beginning. However with right technologies, it actually is kind of cool way to have something to transform. And besides, it makes sense, that alien planet is initially hostile towards humans, but as human population adapts to the new habitat, it learns to use the nature for its own good.
3. Aliens – very hostile, very procreative and (some of them) very strong. Initially, it is very hard to avoid them or kill them, so it might be annoying experience for beginners, but, again, with right technologies and strategy, there are ways to overcome this problem and turn it for your own good. After you have the right technologies and units, it's a great opportunity to gain XP for your army. You can have neutral relationship with aliens (by not destroying their nests), but I have never tried this option, because they are always in your way and threaten you on each turn.
4. Colour balance - blue and green are dominant colours, it's hard to distinguish miasma and resources. By turning resource yields and icons on, it's possible to minimise this problem, but, still, why couldn't they make miasma red or purple?
5. There is a radical shift towards agressive playstyle compared to Civ5. It's almost a must to constantly build units and to defend or attack somebody. It's not something I was used to in Civ5. And at first I didn't really like it. But then again, the overall gameplay is more versatile and balanced and the player gets to use and enjoy all of his strengths in a versatile way. It really freshens up the TBS feel in this game.
6. AI behaviour. AI players are either nasty or stupid or both. The diplomatic relationship and deals do not make any sense. There is no solution for this. Just forget about reasonable trade offers, when playing Beyond Earth. You're on your own. I hope Firaxis will change this with future updates.

So, with that said, I think Beyond Earth is really a great game. Not perhaps as good as Civilization V, but it certainly feels fresh, runs smoothly and each game session offers a different experience. 

I would recommend it to all Civilization fans, not perhaps for its full price, but with atleast -40% discount (30 €), it's worth the price even in its current Vanilla state. However, I do hope there will be new expansions, scenarios and maps.

A lot of the wonders made sense, the restrictions of water/mountains/ravines you could overcome. All in all, I did enjoy this game, despite its tiny leap away from Civ 5. 

However..... With this new water expansion, that defeats the entire purpose of civ based combat, all the changes to the affinities, the tech tree, the wonders becoming next to useless and offering very little in the way of civilization bonuses, this game has devolved into a shell of its former self.

It’s good how you can customise your world at the start however with the one 6 hour game I played I noticed that other civilizations have no bonuses and play just like each other.

There is an affinity and quest system which I found a good addition and the updated tech tree with leaves and branches is a good change. One thing I liked is the spy system has been improved and you can easily take over a whole civilization with high enough affinity.

There are aliens instead of barbarians and they over populate the world which is annoying when you are just starting out and trying to expand but later on can be used to farm xp.

Overall I’d say it’s an ok game. Not the best Civ game out there but it is still a civ game and I could see myself as well as any civ fan spending countless hours playing this.

Is the game good ? 
it is a good game that needs a bit to get better

Is it better than civ5?
no

did the addon make the game better?
yes

What is the part most laking?
I believe it is the tec tree. The net is a new andnice idea but the classic system works better for me.

Any unique systems?
- the affinity system. But it is half cooked. You can get some points through tec and other through quests. What they do is well done but to be honest it is not complete as affinity would make more sense to be created through actions not only ""choosing"" the right answers/tecs. Hence killing Aliens should be rewarded with small amounts purity affinity and maybe even a small recution in Harmony. But here possibilites have been missed. 
- the customize your leader system is quite interesting despite me ending up with a quite similar ""leveled"" leader.

Worldwonders?
yes they got some. As they are set in the future they are not as relatable as e.g. the Pyramids in Civ are. The bonus created by the different wonders differs greatly from very strong (any new foudn city gains a free worker) to compareable little 

Other leaders?
The addon helped here as leaders now react quite different from game to game. 

overall game?
its good but not up to par with CIV5. IF they give the tec tree a nother pass it might be though.

I hate this game. This is one of the worst games I've ever played.

65980,18823163,76561198028135831,0,6,32762,0,22964,1700262568,"Disclaimer: My very large 388 hours was mainly me leaving my PC running after getting bored and wandering off to read books or whatever. I've actually ""played"" the game for a fraction of that time.

I have always loved the Civ's, which is why it's very difficult to vote this one down.

With a £25 price tag on top of the base game, it's difficult to justify this purely because of it's complete lack of replayability.

The good:

New factions. This is mainly just because it's something different to try out. I used to play a lot of the SMAC and alternative history faction mods so this was right up my alley.
New biomes. The unique world quests were a nice touch, and the biome-specific alien behaviours were exciting to sink my teeth in to. It really changes how you play each game and that lends to replayability.

The bad:

The diplomacy system, even with the recent patch, was a sad failure at correcting the initial system. It's better, but it didn't quite ""get there"". Yes, there more buttons to press, more things to do... but it's still just as irrelevant as the old system was. Simply put: you work to please your neighboring AI, raising respect and fear... and they declare war anyway? Might aswell go full military build from turn 1.

The dev's have done difficulty... wrong. In my view, handicaps != difficulty level. Difficulty level, for civ should equate to smarter, more agressive, less compromising AI. The AI shouldn't simply have ""better stuff"" than you. Yes, people have said that they've beaten this game on top difficulty. No, they didn't say it was fun. Just look at SC2's AI for a good example. The AI there executes unit build orders and issues battlefield commands to ultra tight timing and precision, but crucially, never actually cheats. It's more fun and rewarding, win or lose, to compete on a level playing field against a better opponent. It's never fun to beat an opponent with inbuilt advantages over you - all this shows is that the game is too easy to exploit/AI is dumb.

No diplomatic victory conditions. Remember Alpha Centauri, with the UN victory? Bribing players for votes? If you wanted to win diplomatically, you had to play a really cleaver game of plate-balancing to keep all the AI's on your side, while not upsetting any of their rivals too much, and it was really fun. In Rising Tide, there is little reward for keeping the AI happy, since it's far far easier (and safer) to build up a strong military and just crush them.

The ugly:

Hybrid affinities. They just aren't very useful. Sure, they look cool, but strategicially they don't seem to have any personality of their own despite what the dev's claim. I think that the hybrid affinities should instead have been ""more"" affinities, with more strategic resources to support them.

Ocean cities. It's fun at first, but after the initial buzz you begin to realise that sea cities are just... strategically weak, and boring, all at once. It's too hard to expand your territory to get at the resources you need, and there are no defensive terrain features to exploit (mountains, etc...). My game with the NSA was me in the middle of the sea all by myself (save the occasional AI unit wandering by) with almost zero interaction with the other AI's who were all land based. Forever alone.

Conclusion:
It appears that the dev's do not place any value in good AI for this game, and I feel that this was a grave mistake. With a bit of personality - faction agendas, personal feuds, political backstabbing, secret alliances, taboo strategies (where are the atrocities?) - the game could be a vibrant breeding ground for creative play, and I would be coming back to it again and again. Sadly however, it's effectively a selection of small, shiny-looking and well marketed mods created for a quick cash-in on the fans for little return.

pros:

the tech ladder is changed from a ladder to a web where you get to choose many technologies that you think is good for your colony.

the affinity feature is basically the same as the ideology feature from civ 5 but better because you can now improve your affinities by unlocking tech or scenarios. you could actually improve the 3 affinities if you want it may take a long time.

mixed opinions

another feature that i really like is the scenario feature because certain scenarios can affect your buildings on what you think is good for your colonies and resources. i think the scenarios can be improved if they could add in scenarios that could negatively impact your colonies. the scenarios are mostly the same whenever you build something like petrol plant and see how the plant should produce.

negative

if you are expecting the faction leaders to be like the characters from civ 5 then you are wrong because they are extremely boring and lack character when you meet them.

the AI hasn't been improved yet, they always cheat and gang up on you, including making dumb offers that you can't agree and very annoying.

there are no different variety of planets.

the turns are limited 

a civ 5 game but with aliens

crappy units

no military buildings to help improve your units

cons 
- no linear research progression. --> I like the linear search progression coz i give a strategic element to the game. The new research web is confusing, overwhelming. infact is such a hot mess that they have search box in top to find  s h i t . 
- countries/players don't have much a district personality. they all share the same units and the cities looks the same. 
- it's easy to conquer city. i manage to conquer a city by using a single sub and a tank.
- the map is hard to read or look at. it's hard to find units because almost all the tiles are cover in s. h i .t . too many variety so resource. too many!! 
- quest --> the quest are more annoyance than anything. it's another popup that prevent you from playing. they're pretty much fetch quest. ooookay. it's a fetch quest in a turn base game. i have to send a unit across the other side of the map... sounds fun
- not too many units.
- too many options!! the satelite thing is kinda cool but it doesn't really add much to the game.. its just annoying than anything else. why can you just deploy them in the regular screen ????? the culture thing is another confusing thing..... just too many f u c k i n g options and it doesnt really add much to the strategy aspect of the game.

Pros
- it's Civ 5 but scifi


don't buy it. if you already did... I'm so sorry i feel your pain.

The Tech Web compared to Tech Tree is nice at first, but then it gets annoying because it doesn't feel like you are progression through ages (which you aren't).

I still recommend you try out this game, but only if you can get it on sale. Not worth full price.

Before you read this review I would like to mention I have been a Civilzation series fan since I was 8.
________

The Raw Review (the one you most likely want):
Although I do recommend this game for alot of people, I do not recommend it for people who like real-time strategy AND (AND) do not enjoy sci-fi because those people would find this game boring and uneventful, as well as very similar to Civ V (Sid Meier's Civilization V). If you do enjoy sci-fi as well as I do, (time travel, warp engines, transparent titanium, etc.) then I do recommend this game for you. The more you like sci-fi the more you will enjoy the game.

________

The Detailed Review (the one you will want if you are borderline going to buy or not):

As many other people have mentioned in their reviews, the Rising Tide of Sid Meiers Civilization Beyond Earth has brought people back to multiplayer. The problem is though, you basically need to buy the game AND the expansion so the cost of the game is in reality 20-30$ more if you want to play multiplayer because no one seems to want to play vanilla Beyond Earth anymore.

Summary: Multiplayer (in a way) needs to be purchased because it is hard to find players who don't play the Rising Tide Expansion Pack


Aside from the Rising Tide Expansion, Single Player is too easy (AI vs. you). You get used to the easy difficulty (Mercury) and learn the strategies of the game, and you find that all the sudden you're so good at the game after only 90-160 hours that the Gemini difficulty (meant to be the medium-hard difficulty) is insufficient for your need for hard opponents. 

Summary: The hard difficulty more easily than it should becomes the medium difficulty.


I hear other people talking about how the game is too unreal, and the reason why they feel that way is because that floatstone (a major resource of the game) is just a rediculous idea. They are right, but everything in the game can be at least vaguely (correctly) scientifically explained except floatstone and stationary ""orbital"" units. However, Orbital units are one of the things make the game unique and different from others.

Summary: (Aside from that un-realistic-ality) The game itself not affected very much by the not-very-realistic/possible things, but how you feel about the game is affected.


(Aside to creators of the game):
In the real world, landscaping exists. In this game, there should be floatstone workers (or named Drone Workers) added to rising tide as a unit that can move mountains or seal up canyons.

I thought the game play was entertaining and immersive, with an interesting story.  The aliens were a fun variation on the theme of barbarians.  I really loved it.

Complaints:  It was a little difficult to tell what the opponent civs relationships with one another were, at least until I realized what the little colored pips next to the leader pictures represented.

Honestly, the affinities didn't seem to offer any real distinction between paths of development, it was mostly a matter of appearance.  Also, the victories all seemed sort of like palette swapped versions of the same thing.  That being said, they were pallet swapped really well, and I enjoyed the ideological decision making that went into playing out the victory.

Loading screens had no sort of progress indicator.  I realize that these things are often more of a placebo for waiting than an actual indicator of progress, but they do serve to let you know that the computer isn’t locked up doing nothing.  Civ always had something to let you know that it was working during load times, it was a bit neglectful to just leave the thing sitting at the load screen artwork with no explanation.

Lastly, I had a really hard time understanding why I could or could not start a trade route.  In fact, the whole trade system seemed really opaque.  That may just be me being dense, though

I may have been a early booster for Civ: Beyond Earth, but eventually I came around to the consensus. The folks who claimed it was an overpriced re-skin of Civ V became more right than I wanted them to be. But I really liked the dense and overwhelming tech tree and little things like how your military upgraded itself for free were a huge relief.

And unfortunately, Rising Tide is not the momentous step forward it's biggest detractors want. But it fixes my biggest and most personal problems I had with the game. If I'm being perfectly honest... two of the best games I've ever had in a Civ game were with Rising Tide.

The most obvious changes are the overhauled diplomacy system and aquatic settling. What's something the origonal Civ, shackled to human history, could never do? Cities in the ocean! While it is a neat trick and potentially makes the most boring part of Civ worth fighting over, it's no where near as game changing as what happens when your supposed trade ally drags you into a war on two fronts.

Pretty and functional.

But lets get the little stuff out of the way. For one, the tech web is much more user friendly. Stuff like wonders and units are now color coded and there's a handy search bar if you just can't remember what to research to get those handy solar collectors. I always forget those. Also most techs give a little affinity xp instead of large payouts and you can combine affinities to unlock special upgrades and units. Want your gunners to be able to heal automatically every turn? How about a dedicated medic unit? They make defensive builds much more fun

AI players also won't bee line to the easiest victory anymore, resources are much easier to find, and you can mod your leader's traits to upend the vanilla game's draconian restrictions on health. I reached a point where I was sending out three settlers at once with a 40 health level when I was finished! They'll uh... probably patch that out eventually.

It also seemed like I was just making more money (scuse' me,""energy"") in each game overall. Even jacked up the difficulty to see if that changed anything. Loosening the purse strings just made the game more fun. Though certainly not any easier. No, my biggest enemy is still not having a plan for the end game. But I haven't even touched upon the best part of this... slightly overpriced expansion.

I say slightly because the soundtrack ishonestly worth $20 to me. Two more glorious hours of work from 3 amazing composers. Kirkhope, Knorr, and Cohen completely outdid themselves again. But they still arn't the best thing about RT. That would be the completely overhauled Diplomacy system.


Diplomacy is now all about deals. Every Civ generates diplomatic capital that can be spent on deals with other nations. Give Bartra 10 DC per turn and have your outposts grow 30%. They'll also ask you for such an arrangement netting you more DC... but possibly giving them a severe advantage. The thing, the brilliant thing, is that these deals get stronger if you ally with that country. There are deals such as ""every trade route that nets resources now nets 3 times as many"" that are worth defending the weakest player in the game from a war on multiple fronts.

Polystralia was single-handedly bankrolling my entire military's supply line. I couldn't support a force half my size without him. The AI felt threatened by a couple players, saw how much the others feared me, declared war, then promptly hid behind my skirt.

I thought I had that game in the bag. For once, the end game became the most interesting part. I made peace with some, bulldozed over others, but that was singularly, the best game of Civ I ever played. Rising Tide made that possible.

I'll never forget that.

The winter update improved the base game a fair bit and made it more enjoyable to play but then Rising Tide came out and kind of threw a lot of that progress away, and introduced a mix of good and bad ideas that will require further balancing. Rising Tide has significantly changed certain aspects of the game for the better--water settling/tile development is huge--but the balance is completely out of whack again. 

The pacing of the early game is completely random now. With the amount of resource pods and expedition sites whoever finds the most can boost a crazy amount in the first 50-100 turns. Single or multiplayer, you're going to want to spam explorers and rush anything (3 Prosperity virtues, 2 levels of Supremacy, and a building quest) that can net you more expedition pods early-game because of the insane boosts to culture, production, science and energy they provide. On top of that there's the possibility of discovering Relics in each expedition which in turn can be spent to further boost culture, science, food, and production or saved to be used for unlocking Relic Buildings and Wonders, some of which are incredibly broken. Internal trade routes are back to being broken, especially with Al Falah and a specific Relic Building, and certain Relic Wonders are completely broken. 

Hybrid Affinities are kind of a dead end, you still have to chase a specific Affinity to get its victory wonder. Even though the Affinity victory condition has been pushed to Affinity level 15 (up from 13), games are roughly still 200-300 turns long. Beyond Earth games are 200 turns shorter than Civ V on average. There's an early-game, a mid-game, and then the game is done because someone trots out a victory wonder. There's no late-game in Beyond Earth where late-game techs, wonders and units get a chance to shine. So Rising Tide has changed how you play the early-game you're ultimately still playing the same limited ""end"" game. Build some wonders and turtle or go for domination.

The way Affinity experience is acquired now is a mess. Previously neutral tech branches that everyone will research over the course of a match now provide multiple Affinity experience. You will easily end a game with multiple levels in multiple Affinities without even trying. It's even possible to get every Affinity leveled up to 18 before the 300th turn and basically have access to every unique Affinity/Hybrid unit in the game outside of what you've locked your generic units into being. It's also worth noting that not every unit in the game gets a Hybrid Affinity variation and there's no Hybrid Affinity City art. Cities and armies in Rising Tide can be a hodge podge of every Affinity and Hybrid. In Beyond Earth vanilla you had to focus on an Affinity and chase those techs in order to be able to hit your victory condition in time, now everyone just sort of has access to everything. Going Harmony or Supremacy and expanding aggressively early? Don't worry, now you'll likely be able to build a Gene Garden (lvl 2 Purity health generating building), without even trying you'll likely have the necessary Affinity levels. Health has gone from being a constraint to a basically a non-issue with everyone having access to everything in conjunction with the new orbital unit that you can access fairly early on top of all of the health wonders in the game now.

There's simply so much in Rising Tide that needs to be addressed with later balancing patches. Certain Factions Unique Advantages are insanely powerful if not outright broken, while others border on being useless. The warscore and peace negotiations are kind of busted as of now. The old diplomatic system was completely gutted from the game but in some respects it was better than the new diplomatic system that was added in Rising Tide. There are more kinds of aliens but they are less of a threat. The list goes on and on. While it's nice that Firaxis have committed to doing balance patches, it would have been better if they did a public beta first. Discover all of these balancing issues that their own internal testing somehow missed and address them before releasing the expansion. Instead it's another mess, further frittering away what goodwill people may have left. 

I would recommend Civ V Complete or Endless Legend over the current iteration of Beyond Earth and Rising Tide. Later patches may change this, again, but for now Beyond Earth is a mess.",1445509955,1445509955,False,174,5,0.823173344135284424,3,True,False,False

As expected, Firaxis tries to repeat the success with Civilization 5 by improving and expanding the original game in the DLC. Rising Tides is miles worse than Civ5 Brave New World. 

At it's very core, the gameplay is still a bucket filling simulator. You collect all sort of different resources, fill different buckets with them (food bucket for population grow, production bucket for buildings and units, culture buckets for border growth and empire wide bonuses, science bucket for technology). Once the bucket is full, you get to fill in a greater bucket and so the grind continues. 

And somehow this gameplay is less fun than Civilization 5. Braw New World. Probably because the choices that are presented to the player are not that engaging.

Rising Tides brings the following:

1. Aquatic cities. They give you more room to expand on the map, and because of that you will have a more peaceful experience because there is no need to go to war really. If you want to actually have a reason to use those military units, you actually have to deliberately set up overcroawded maps. Like 9 players on a small map (for 6 players). 

2. Hybrid affinities units. Just a bunch of more units, that either hit harder, or allow for healing/debuffing stuff. 

3. Diplomatic agreements. You this new resource Diplomatic Capital. With it you can buy all sort of bonuses either by improving your traits (work like virtues), or by buying different agrrements from your neighbours. It's good, it's something i haven't seen before. Kudos for some innovation here Firaxis. 


Apart from that the game is still plagued by the same issues as the original title: 
a) The sci-fi setting, the factions, the overall feeling is inferior to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. These leaders lack personality. You attitude towards them will never get personal. You will never feel hatred or love for them. You will simply not care. 

b) Borring buildings, wonders and tech choices. While tech web is an amazing innovation, the stuff itself that it unlocks is not that exciting.  There are tons of buildings that increase by +1 the yield of some resource. It's just not fun. 

In conclusion, if you didn't like Civilization: Beyond Earth, you will probably not like Rising Tides either. There are still bits of decent gameplay here and there, but the game is not there yet.",1445098641,1445112872,False,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

I, like many others, was left with one hell of a bitter taste in my mouth by the initial release of Beyond Earth last year. I felt like we had been given an incomplete, sub-par product. It felt hollow and empty, the AI was shoddy and diplomacy was pointless as they never seemed to cooperate with you, or even put up a fight if you were at war.

Thankfully, Rising Tide has padded the game out a lot more and also made a load of changes that makes it so much more enjoyable. It finally gives me that irresistable 'ONE. MORE. TURN...' feeling I've had with every other Civ game in the past because now I am actually playing because I am having fun, not like with the base game where I felt like I was playing it just to force myself to enjoy it.

Rising Tide has added aquatic gameplay, letting you settle cities on the sea. Two out of the four new factions can do this right at the start, while you have to get the tech for everyone else, which is not too hard as the tech is easy to get in the tech tree. The oceans have been graphically updated and look gorgeous, they have a real feeling of depth to them. They also have a load of new sea-based resources, and the strategic resources can also be found in the sea, also resource pods and expeditions so you can build your empire entirely on the sea without having to venture on to land for anything at all if you wish.

The best big change is to the diplomacy system and how you interact with the other factions. You earn diplomacy points per turn that can be used either on yourself to develop some new traits exclusive to you, or you can spend them on other factions to form agreements - AWESOME! 
Each faction you form these agreements with have specific deals exclusive to their own traits; Polystralia will offer you deals that improve trading for example, while the Slavic Federation will have deals that can improve the way your orbital units work - so it is really to your benefit and makes sense to form deals with everyone rather than just the main faction you get on with the most and gives a really good feeling that these factions arent just there to get in the way of your progress by competing against you, more like you are cooperating with everyone for the better - it is so much fun and adds so much more depth to the game. You can also use the diplomacy points to rush-buy buildings and units.

Your explorers are more useful, as when they conduct expeditions, there's a chance you will get an artifact - collect three of these and you can combine them for a bonus that gives you a unique building to build in your cities with some nice benefits that you wouldn't be able to get any other way.

There is also planetary 'marvels' (a unique one per each biome) that you can find that lead in to quests, find specific things relating to them and it will give you a nice bonus once completed!

There are two new biomes - Primordial and Frigid. New alien lifeforms too, with different colours to suit what biome you are in and also specific traits to that biome, which is a nice addition to keep it from getting too samey, and gives the impression that these aliens evolved alongside the planet/biome and are adapted to its conditions.

A cool feature is that you can now combine affinities! A big change from the 'do I choose Purity, Supremacy, or Harmony?' now you can combine to suit your needs! Doing this gives you some really cool new unit designs with different functions and they all look awesome! So your units can look even more unique than just the standard origianl 3 in the base game.

Other notable changes to the game are in the form of new music (which is really lovely and sets the tone nicely) and some new artwork in the loading screens and on pop-up notifications when you find something, etc.

Overall, Rising Tide is a step in the right direction regarding Beyond Earth - it has improved everything for the better so far and my faith in this game has been restored!

The situation right now is that the devs seem content with the game whereas I, and I daresay a significant portion of the community, is not. The reason I would not recommend this game is that there is no indication that this situation would change, so BE will be weighed down by many problems that may very well go unresolved.

However, first I will give the positives. This isn't said as a token remark before I starting to bash the game. I bought it after all, and I don't regret it despite all its faults.

The art in BE is simply gorgeous. Without the constraints of a historical civ game, the artists can really let loose their imagination and create some wonderous looking units, terrain, and buildings. For a vast majority of my games I go for the supremacy affinity simply because I enjoy its aesthetics so much, and it makes progressing from a single city to a bustling colony very rewarding. The soundtrack more than lives up to the standards set by Civ 5, so there is not a doubt that the artistic talent behind this game is top-notch. Unfortunately, that's where the talents end.

Now, if the gameplay of BE is indeed irredeemably bad, the players could just write it off as a piece of shit and be done with it. But what it actually feels like is that the devs very carefully crafted the building blocks and then threw them together in the most haphazard way possible. What interesting and innovative mechanics they manage to incorporate are either sloppily implemented or poorly balanced, and very often both.

For starters, wonders do not feel wonderful at all, to the point that some of them are only marginally better (or even worse!) than the regular building that produces the same yield. When it comes to winning, building academies to the exclusion of everything else always works, and beats the next best strategy by a mile. Some virtues are no brainers to take, while others are ridiculously weak, ditto for sponsor abilities. From the game's release until now the player can still get stuck in permanent wars with AI(s) due to a bug or the war score mechanic. Trade routes were grossly overpowered initially, then nerfed, and then grew even more overpowered. The list goes on and on, but the biggest problem is that it seems the devs aren't really interested in fixing those issues. Patches were few and far between, and when they did roll out they rarely addressed the problems adequately. As a result, the game is a chaotic mishmash of great ideas set in a gorgeous background that trip over each other rather than synergize.

In the end I think I'll end up echoing the sentiments of many other reviewers in that Beyond Earth has a huge amount of wasted potential. Bits and pieces here and there gave some fleeting taste of a good game, but they just don't come together, and all signs point to that they never will.

You're one of a few factions trying to make your claim on the new planet you arrived at after your seed ship falls apart. The other factions are living expletives. Prepare to hammer them down in force while running diplomacy to keep the others off of you.

In the meantime you have a few win scenarios by unlocking the end branches of the tech trees, but don't focus too much on one such branches or you will get seriously obsoleted in others. Going at it full-balance is also not a good idea as the NPCs will run ahead fully dedicated to one branch or another and you'll have to knock them down a notch or otherwise play catchup.

It's decently engaging, but I had more fun playing the original Alpha Centauri. Still, with Alpha Centauri being a bit of a pain to get working without bugs on newer systems, it's a decent timesink that comes close to, but grasps right behind, the original's standards.

This game WITH the expansion Rising Tide make it so much better, they have implemented a few cool new features that brings this game to life. 
First of you can build cities on water, those cities won't expend their borders like cities on land, instead you have to buy tiles or move your water city. Moving costs production and as long as you are moving you can't build anything else. I like the new cities tbh. They have also revamped the whole ocean thing. It looks a lot better, there are more and new recources, there are more aliens based on the waterworld (kraken is impressive),
There are (with the expansion) also 4 new sponsors to choose from and they are fun to play.
With the addition of the expansion Rising Tide they have revamped the trade and the diplomacy system, sadly there are a lot of bugs but when they fix those bugs, this game is stellar imho.
The new diplomacy system let you choose traits and with diplmacy points as I like to call them, you get one fixed trait that is based on what sponsor you are playing and 3 traits that you can choose and buy with those diplomacy points, they give you strengts in domnestic / militairy and political area's. Each of these Traits can be upgraded and switched around if you feel you are better of buying other traits.
The trade is taken away from the diplomacy and is new done via trade routes (makes more sense too imo), the diplomacy is where the biggest problems are though.
It seems this game put you to war auto mode. Last game I suddenly found myself at war with 4 other factions, the reason is unclear, when that happened even more so. Well you ask, then make peace why don't ya. Indeed why don't I. Because thx to the new diplomacy system war is now also visible with a war score. The more units you destroy and the more cities you take, the higher your score to the other nation will be. That score WILL automatically give certain terms to the other faction. Usually they must surrender 2 or even more cities to get a peace. Ofcourse they say no to that resulting in a war that leaves you no choice than to eliminate that faction out of the game.
Those are bugs that are known tho and I hope the devs will patch them.
With the addition if Rising Tide they have added a whole new layer, this game is actually fun to play but not as fun as it can be.
So yes, I recommend this game, after they have fixed the issues.",1444837893,1444837893,True,15,0,0.578993856906890869,0,True,False,False

Interface is clean and easy to navigate. But overall I have been underwhelmed by the gameplay. I agree that this just seems a like a hastily assembled mod for Civ V. 

What I like is the theme and the environment. The game is very vibrant and colorful, the worlds do feel alien. 

One of my biggest issues with the game is the technology tree. It is radial instead of linear which is fine in theory, but I find it exceedingly difficult to find the techs I want. It would work well if there were more numerous and better incentives to specialize your tech tree, but just as with Civ you ultimately end up needing to research everything anyway.

Too few civs as well, I expected the same level of diversity as with Civ V but that is not the case. Also I find there is no point in trying to help colonies as they always die or fail by the time you get to them. Even if you manage to help them once, alien worms or bugs always kill them eventually. 

Also I find espionage to be a complete waste of time, I have never been able to convert a city to my Civ, even giving myself every advantage possible. I honestly do not think it even works, even though others have reported being able to convert cities. The whole point of inversting in Espionage is to convert enemy cities, but if I can't even do that why waste the turns researching and building spy buildings when I can invest in other strategies. 

Diplomacy options are underwhelming, many aspects of the game feel like a step back for the franchise. I expected many of the new concepts in Civ V to be expanded upon with this, but the opposite is true. 

No unique units or buildings for Civs, they all feel more or less the same as a result. 

Ill wait a couple of years until all the DLC go on sale and give it another try. I have no interest in buying DLC for a game that is designed to fix all the issues the game has. That kind of DLC should be free. Releasing a mediocre at best product and then expecting us to pay to have it fixed is wrong. Especially when there is no guarantee it will solve any of the problems this game has.

Again, I tried to like the expansion but many of the original problems remain. 

Improvements: 
- diplomacy: is more complex but that doesn't necessarily mean better. Most of the time I don't bother contacting the other leaders but just blindly accept their proposals. At least there's a little more to it now. Still not my cup of tea. There seems to be too many optoins without any of them being overy substantial. 

- graphics: the sea is really nice. 

Problems: 

- wonders: are still horrible. None of them really are wonderful. Their effects are for the most part, minor. 

- map: too busy. There's so much on the map it's very often hard to see your units. 

- resources: there are too many resources. It's hard to keep track of what does what and why I need one over the other. None of them really seem special. I prefer Civ V's limited number, although they started to throw in more near the end just for the sake of having more which I didn't agree with. BERT could have done much better to have fewer resources but make the effects more substantial (needed for more buildings/units). 

- buildings: way, way too many buildings. This woudn't be a bad thing but they have many of the same effects (one will offer 2 health, another will offer 1, another will offer 1 health and 1 science). I'd prefer fewer buildings but with more substantial effects. 

Conclusion/short review: I applaud the efforts of the Devs/Firaxis and mainly bought the expansion out of loyalty and a wish to support Firaxis. I was hopeful but it's not the game for me. After 7 hours of play I've deleted the game. I'm now waiting for Civ VI. Certainly, a few of the things from BERT could be incorporated into VI like diplomatic capital which I thought was interesting. 



I really tried to like this game but I have to give it a thumbs down. 

Short review: 

- the game lacks personality.
- the leaders are bland.
- diplomacy is worse than Civ V
- colour palatte/graphics make it hard ot distinguish tiles
- buildings are boring and non-descript
- wonders are underpowered and unimaginative
- there are better games out there (Endless space, endless legend, Gal CIV III (when it comes out).

Don't buy it. 

Long review:

Problems: 

(1) Leaders: It's certainly been said before, the leaders are boring. They have no personality. They're animations are basically the same as well. 

(2) Diplomacy: Civ V's diplomacy was a huge stepdown from Civ IV but what made it passable was the excellent leader animations which made the model tolerable. With BE, you have the exact same diplomacy from V but with bland leaders. 
They had a real opportunity to make this game stand out but they decided to add in feature after feature rather than refining what was there. One common complaint regarding Civ V was the diplomacy but it seems the Devs here could really care less. Too bad. Great diplomacy could have rescued this game

(3) Graphics: Certainly the graphics are different than what you see in V but they are ultimately forgetable and very frustrating. The biggest complaint I have is it's impossible to tell what some tiles are without hovering the mouse over them. On some planets you'll have purple tundra which looks very simlar to purple grassland which looks similar to plains. ARRGH. 

(4) Too many buildings: I think what ended up happening is when they were making the game the Devs realized you run out of things to do quickly since the game isn't very deep. Hence, they added more buildings to give you something to do with your cities rather than just allocating them to wealth, research, production. The end result is you get building 1 which give 1 health, and building 2 which gives 2 health and 1 science, and building 3 which gives 2 health and 2 science. None of them are interesting or something you'd b-line a tech to get because it will help you. They are all forgetable. 

(5) Wonders are horrible: Wonders in every Civ game were something that ultimately could give you a good boost. In BE they are basically slightly more powerful verisons of the normal buildings you'd already build but they cost 5-10 times as much. I don't even remember the names of any of them. Again, they're forgetable. 

(6) Victory conditions are too similar: Three of the 5 conditions are pretty much the same: Build special building, then in 30 turns you win the game if you remember to click the buildling every turn (yes, this is a simplification but that's pretty much it). Again, forgetable. 

Really the entire game is: forgetable. There are other games I'd try before spending any money on BE. Endless space, despite it's shortcomings really had more charm and gameplay. Endless legend is way better. 

If you doubt my review, check out the latest game play stats. Despite getting a huge patch a day ago the number of players hasn't jumped beyond 6200. Civ V, 4 years since release, is still at 35000. 

Firaxis dropped a rare bomb here. I truely hope that the Devs who worked on this don't play any significant role in Civ VI.",1418189491,1444750746,False,636,9,0.865238964557647705,14,True,False,False

Fun at first, but after a while the issues creep in.  The game is a decent improvement from Civ 5. The mechanics are identical but they were never a problem, graphics/animations/sound are good, the units are exactly what you’d expect from a Civ game (with a few interesting twists), and the tech web is an interesting addition.

But, as with the last Civ game, performance gets exponentially worse the longer you play it.  I play marathon games, and by turn 900 it’s taking 2+ minutes for all NPCs to go through their turns.  The interface is clunky and unintuitive – worse than Civ 5’s since they’ve crammed in more things.  Navigating the the planet is a chore - aliens (like the barbs in Civ 5) are annoying, there are miasmas every other tile (which damage your troops), the other 1/3 of the tiles are canyons or mountains which your troops can't traverse (you'd think if you have the tech to colonize another planet you might be able to get over a hill).

Tech web was an interesting idea but clearly inferior to the tech tree it replaced, if for no other reason than that because the web is unordered, units upgrade not based on technology but instead based on affinity which is basically culture, and that makes absolutely no sense. It's basically Civ 5 except a bunch of stuff was changed to be less intuitive, and less immersive, while other stuff was just removed entirely, but they have shiny new graphics and space themed units so that makes it all better right?

I don't know exactly which element added in Rising Tide makes this work - it's likely a combination of many tweaks (both small and large) - but they pulled it off. It's much better, and results in the 'one more turn' syndrome we expect from this genre.

My only additional thought is the volume of information available at first can be overwhelming (option paralysis), but that ends up being part of the charm in subsequent playthroughs, as the depth of strategic options is really quite impressive... I think.

The mechanics and gameplay are stable and solid. It's a proper evolution of Civ, not extreme or groundbreaking, but correct and natural.

2nd Edit:  Half the positive reviewers (and forum crusaders) are Steam level 0 with private profiles doing their 1st review, which happens to make Beyond Earth sound like a game gifted from god.  See for yourself.

3rd Edit:  Returned to this game for the Rising Tide Expansion.  I'm not going to ""just buy"" a dlc.  So, I decided to give the vanilla game another try.  I can honestly say, it has been improved to ""enjoyable"" status.  Which is evident of two things:  1. They listen to the gamers, and 2. They released an incomplete game on purpose.

Pros:
+ Complete aquatic environment, no less detailed than the original: new resources, aliens, cities, units, quests, etc. If it strikes your fancy, you can play as a purely water-based nation and won't feel handicapped for it.
+ New aliens; water monsters (a lot), naturally, but also at least one new land-based one + one hybrid capable of switching environments at will.
+ New 'legendary' features explorable in their own short quest lines (no spoilers here, you'll recognize them when you see them).
+ New Artifacts system; ancient earth / alien / progenitor loot which can be found in ruins and then combined for unique in-game bonuses (resources, new buildings, you name it).
+ New Hybrid Alignment (combination of two alignments (Purity-Supremacy, etc)) complete with its own units and civilization bonuses.
+ New units & unit upgrade screen; submarines + a selection of hybrid units. Upgrade screen reworked from scratch, looks way better IMHO.
+ New technologies & new research screen; selection of aquatic & 'hybrid' research options. Alignment requirements & bonuses for technologies reworked (allow for hybrid alignment, for instance),
+ Diplomacy system overhaul; now many diplomatic options are driven by [political] capital resource, which is generated by cities much like culture points. More clear indication of PC status - how much respected and / or feared it is by AI players.
+ Overall stability increase; maybe not immediately apparent as the game core was pretty much stable as it was, but nevertheless. Less loading time, no CTD events (for me at least), etc, etc.

Cons:

Also resources can now be in water and since all your units can swim by default, there is no problem with that even at early stages of the game. The AI still is dull and pretty easy even on highest difficulty and since Civ has never been a multi-player game really, this one isn't either.

Having now three kind of ideologies to follow makes the game a BIT more dynamic but I think that most people go for hamony anyway since it reduces miasma affects which you need once your enemy can walk through it without issues. War while being exposed to miasma is a pain!

having bought every civ game ever released (and most other sid meiers titles) i am sorely dissapointed by their terrible distribution practices.

i think it was most evident when i played civ 5 with a buddy of mine who hadnt bought the expansion yet.  

my first thought was ""really, this was the vanilla game?  no wonder i was excited for the expansion.""

well, no longer will i purchase a truly broken and unballanced Half-a-game until they make the sale of the game and the first expansion cost what it should have cost on release.

would i reccommend this game?  no, emphatically no.  unless you buy it with the first expansion, then it is a whole game.

i havnt bought the expansion because it is too much money (dont make a ton, yo), but judging from what they did with civ 5, id say it beyond earth was fixed with the $30 expansion.  they should have made half the expansion a patch 6months after the game was released.

Many of the negative reviews fail to account for why Civ 5 is viewed as being so much better. It basically boils down to one thing, DLC. Civ 5 had tons of great DLC released over the years, and together they made the game truly complete/mesmerizing. People need to have some patience and realize the scale and scope of this game. Rising Tide alone has improved soooo much, and added so much new content! I can't wait to see beyond earth in it's true form, with all the DLCs to come! Civ 5 was the same way, it was always good, and only got better. The DLCs are NOT completing incomplete parts of an unfinished game, they are expansions upon an immersive universe that I personally love. No this isn't Civ 5 or Civ 4, both of which were great games, but this is comperable/better in many ways. While my personal favorite games are from Civ 5 still, the ever expansive systems that emerge from the new DLC for Beyond Earth will certainly prove equally as enticing!

I'd lovingly pay to actually have the complete version of this game, and I already have. But for now, let's outline some details.

-The diplomacy of the base game is absolutely halfassed, and the AI's are way too predictable.

- Affinities are a fantastic addition to the civ formula, but it seems like the Harmony affinity trumps all every single time. Thus surfacing some serious power balancing issues.

-The miasma. Who's idea was this.... it makes the difficulty so artificial it's crazy.

-The amount of tile improvements you can build gets extremely overwhelming. It would have been better to just upgrade each existing one and and a few new ones, rather than have a new one for every other technology on the absolutely massive tech tree.

I want to really like Beyond Earth however it has been poorly put together and not thought out as much as it could have been. I really enjoyed exploring the new planet at the beginning but the replayability diminishes each game.
The tech tree is really interesting but I would have liked some really interesting new world wonders.  
The different 'countries' have no culture or identity and I find that frustrating as they could have done so much with that side of things to make it a really interesting experience. First humans to go and live on another planet a lot of story and events from a cultural side could really have put depth into this game. Each country has the same skins for buildings.. I do understand that some changes come with the different paths you can take but I believe they should have started with some identity.

good: 
- i love all the civ games, but its nice to explore other planets using the same typ e of game so this game does that
- new quests that pop up as you play (which they did in civ 4) that give you a small goal that leads to small benefits to gameplay
- awesome soundtrack
- good graphics and interesting models for units, aliens, terrain
- affinity system is cool, updates units freely and gives your civ a unique look eventually
- i enjoy early game alot, forming your own civ traits etc. 

bad:
- the wonders are not really balanced. some are too good, others are meh.
- the tech tree seems a bit random as to what you should research, no obvious path to a certain goal (which ideally, can lead to very different civs but when it comes down to it, unless you research the affinity point techs, you'll lose cause the comp will get more affinity points, upgrade to much stronger units, and kill you even if you're doing ""better"" overall in the game)
- diplomacy is very basic, no depth. after 5 minutes of brainstorming i can think of simple ways that could vastly improve the depth 
- few civs to choose from. (civ 5 has 44? i think?) this one has about 8 or so

all considered, its a fun game, just not addicting like the other civs, mostly in part to the lack of depth the other ones delivered. looking forward to the expansions!",1444358596,1444358596,True,3,0,0.523744046688079834,0,True,False,False

Yes.  It IS an xpac.  You will be able to explore everything there is to explore in 3-5 playthroughs before you head to multiplayer. The ideology/tech branches feel slightly less important, as there is not much difference between the different units,  and you will often need something from the other ones anyway.

The game has a faster pace, different mechanics and the tech tree definitely is a learning curve. I believe the tech tree is overwhelming people in relation to how they help you attain affinities. Just take some time to map out your desired victory and you’ll learn it in no time. 

The AI could be smarter, less aggressive, have more diplomatic options of conversation but that’s always been an issue with Civ. Once you figure BE out it’s addictive, very addictive.

Civilization: Beyond Earth is not an exception to this rule.

All in all, it's not a bad game. It just needs to find its own way, and differ more strongly from Civ V.

If you played and enjoyed Civ V, you will find a lot familiar in here in a much more streamlined package.  Hex grid movement, basic diplomatic communications, and a familiar build system with a more intuitive flow to it's interface.  They also have an expanded espionage system from the Brave New World expansion of Civ V, and the Virtues system is a more long term variation of the social policy mechanic.

And why change things too much?  If they did, likely the fan base would have even more outrage.  In the end it was smart to have this basic and solid entry game to see what people wanted more and less of, then focus continued development into the future DLC.  Frankly, that's just the nature of big budget game development these days and Rising Tide is showing that it is likely going to work out well.

What's great:  The build system is smooth and leaves very little learning curve, and gone are the requirements for prerequisite buildings to make other buildings available.  Combat units will auto upgrade as you advance your Virtues, meaning no tracking through lists seeing who's still stuck in the bronze age when everyone else has machine guns.  The alien life forms feel much more intimidating early game than barbarians in Civ V, and mid game can still be a force to consider when making plans.

What needs improvement:  Exploration feels like it's going to need continued work, though they will be getting new content in Rising Tide.  Diplomacy also will be a welcome overhaul in the DLC, as the offer of ""favors"" from other leaders never felt like something I was able to use effectively in my games.  There are no ""luxury goods"" like in Civ V, which made diplomatic negotiations more interesting in my opinion, but there may be a new consideration in the new diplomacy system.  I also feel the Orbital layer of the game is under-utilized, and it seems like more could be done there than just the satellite units in future expansions.

As a sci-fi junkie I highly recommend this game.  I'm not a long time Civilization fanatic, but I have respected the series for a long time, so take my opinions as you will.",1443905984,1443905984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That Graphhic in this game while being good are impemented in the strangest way possible. The maps are way to busy and  look terrible when compared to CIV V. The way the research tree was designed makes it very difficult to understand what does what in terms of building, Improvment & affinty the colors are so similar that i can never tell what unlocks what.

Gameplay

The AI might as well not exist. In 30+ hours of playing I have never once been attacked or invaded by an enemy AI on any difficulty. The aleins are just more stupid barbarian with one super unit that could be a problem but rarely is. I always end up having  a corner of the map to myself that no one bothers me in.

aliens (major improvement on barbarians)

new resorces

new buildings

the affinity that replaces ideolgy is pretty cool



cons

unfair starting bonus for some nations

few military units

diplomosy brocken ( i had an allience with china and they declared war on me)

you need a cooperative agreement to give gifts making it hard to improve relations.

nations dont like you killing aliens for reasons

if you can build walls you cant for awile

If you are looking for a better Civ 5 I can say for curtain there isn't much. I only owned the last Civ 5 game and none of the expansion packs. For me it is a little of an upgrade. For people who have the DLC there is much lacking. Combat is very fast paced all the sudden. What used to take 20+ turns and 10+ upgraded units now takes 3 and a undefended city. Needless to say, you can spend 250+ turns building a city into science and get destroyed in twelve turns from someone who went all commando on your butt. Don't go all science....

AI is a bit more intellegent, but mostly just chaotic. If they feel they are about to get rolled over, they will try to make amends which is nice. But the original..... give me 500 energy plus 5 oil and I'll give you..... a favor. I have yet to find out what a ""favor"" does.

I was hoping there was a little more in terms of picking planets. Right now, there is pretty much only one earth like planet and that is it.

The only part about this game that I find is amazing is the social aspects it brings up that normally wouldn't be thought about.

As a big fan of Sid's Civ games I pre-purchased it and went straight into it. First playthrough the aliens were a nice change up, but other than that the game did not provide sufficient innovation and has nowhere near enough versatility to give the infinite replayability that I have always loved about Civ. I currently have 1430 hours logged playing Civ V. When Beyond Earth was released I am certain this was below 1000. So say 400 hours of Civ V since the release of Beyond Earth and a grand 61 hours total on Beyond Earth to date.

I have considered requesting a refund from Steam when refunds became available. I decided not to because I had hope that updates to the base game would provide the depth and width the game is so severly lacking.. Now we are less than a month away from the release of paid DLC and I am quite frankly OFFENDED. I can simply not  believe that the studios behind the literally and figuratively HISTORIC Civilization games is trying to make more money out of a game that was simply never finished. If they intended to take me for £60,- to begin with they should have finished the game and marketed it at that price. Not con me into thinking I were buying a full new episode in the Civ sage at £30 only to find that it is barely half a game with no more replayability than a common shooter.

So to all who consider buying this game, STICK TO CIV V and wait for Civ VI, IF it is developed to the same quality as Civ V originally was I will gladly fork over another £40 for a base game and 2x £30 for game-changing expansion packs!",1442013902,1442013902,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If this was a Civ5 mod I would say cool, great job. But it is not and it is not worth a full game price. The game is Civ5 without everything that makes Civ5 great, horrible factions, booooring everything. The computer varely does anything, regardless of difficulty and will always cheat on you near the end of the game, oh look I suddently got 13 affinity and many units I don't have the resources for wheee~  
 
The damn factions are bland, as bland as a Donald Thrump without his asshole behavior can be. There is about 7 units? One of each kind that evolves 3 times into a different color with minor changes based on affinity. The tech tree, now tech web is complete garbage, unbalanced as hell and doesn't give a feeling of improvement. Furthermore, health becomes such a powerful stat that you can ignore everything else. 
 
Diplomacy is crap. 
Spy game is crap. 
Combat is crap.

Now for the actual review.

One it's pretty much like any other civ game out there just this one is more futuristic and you are no longer on earth,so you won't be starting in an acient age or anything like that. So if you're looking for stuff like that,then don't buy this game if you're hoping it's like all the other civ games to a hundred percent,while it isn't. You got your aliens,which are like the barbarians,you can destroy their nests and if you're lucky you can actually domesticate the aliens and use them in your army! It's pretty cool and the aliens are worthy allies if you're able to domesticate a few of em,they're technically like pets. Along the side you don't have your warmongering Ghandi and personally I am kinda happy for that,though if you want to anger an AI and turn them in a warmongering annoying bambling idiot,just condemn them publicly and then they will become hostile along with being always angry at you,until you settle a deal with them later if they'll even accept it. Though they shall get annoying after a while of every 10 turns of saying your army is on the weak side and you should watch your back.

So other than that,you got your virtues as well,where one helps you with your armies,another helps with food,etc then science and culture. It's pretty interesting in my opinion despite it being like the other games just with different values to it.  You got your science tree as well,you got a ttoooonnn of stuff to choose from,everything benefits you no matter what almost.

So back on to the aliens,I said they were just like pets right? Well there is one alien I truly hate,it's a huge worm that moves around the map that seems near impossible to kill at the start as he is just completly op. He can wipe out your entire army with only one smack almost for ground units.

So that's pretty much everything I can say about the game,I truly like it I really do,it's one of my favourite Civ games,in a long time as to me,the other stuff,was getting kinda stale in my opinion,but it's still fun to play.

So if you like advance stuff,futuristic stuff,etc or just didn't care much for the old games,then this might be just for you! Just don't play it for 10 mins and decide you hate it,that's not even long enough for a legit review in my opinion,at least try and give the game a chance,even I wasn't in to like the game until an hour in to it when I finally got all the good stuff and my army built up to what I wanted it to be. It is really fun for most people.",1441536211,1441536211,True,0,0,0.377530753612518311,0,True,False,False
65980,12884683,76561198007535189,0,10,2219,0,2195,1428717729,"While it had potential, this game fell short of expectations.  To sum it up

-aliens are either a good time waster or a death sentence. They essentially act like barbarians in CIV V, so really they feel like a cheap reskin. The only difference is that they now kill workers instead of capturing them, which means no rescue missions and more risky early expansions. which brings me to my next point

-Takes forever to make the most basic tile improvements, and there isn't even any good tech or wonders to speed things up. If you lose your workers to aliens or miasma, well it can be difficult to replace

-the miasma mechanic, while intresting, is in my opinion a little backwards. Miasma limits overall growth and the technology to get rid of it is pretty high up.

-All these factors severly limit growth. It honestly feels like the game mechanics have been made to limit how fast people can expand to make the game feel ""bigger"" than it actually is, 

-Most maps are generally smaller than their CIV V counterparts, they only feel big because it takes forever to grow and expand your empire.

-You only will honestly use like 4 units in your army, of which will generally be infantry, artillary, tanks, and maybe some aircraft. Generally the game feels bland on account of this. The only upside is that when you can tailor the specs (only once) of said units to fit your playstyle and any following units of the same variety will share similar stats. This game be good or bad depending on the circumstances and the AIs playstyle.

-resources have been reworked, and while each provide ertain bonuses some will lower your ""happiness"". This does include some strategic resources, such as oil. The main faction resources which are used to more advanced units however are left alone. They however are fairly rare considering how important they are, and maps can determine your affinity rather than you, which is kinda a buzz kill.

-production, food, energy, and other tile bonuses increases are late game tech, and are generally pretty time comsuming and resource intensive. 

-The CIV BE AIs are all most likely related to Ghandi in some way. It generally feels like the AI is dumber than CIV V and far too aggresive. There isnt even that much insentive to make allies in the game. The small maps cut down on travel time, allies are generally unreliable or too aggresive, and resources are somewhat limited and without fair trade your only real option is to take it by force. 

-Even if you fight, it honestly seems too easy, and the AI unit spams are so laughably weak it's pathetic. There is no strategy, and the game mostly taxes you rather than buff the AIs on higher difficulties. A good killzon will murder any army of theirs and this only gets worse when you get better artillary or orbital cannons.

-the victory conditions are kind of..dark..in my opinion. In CIV V you could win the game by uniting humanity thorugh cultural domination and skillfull diplomacy, martial prowess and empire building, or expanding upon the stars as a paragon of science and prosperity. In CIV BE each affinity gets its own victory conditions and you either go full on Borg and invade earth to assimilate everyone (supremacy), stick tentacles in unsavory places and become a giant hivemind blob (Harmony). or copy that movie avatar and kill off all the aliens how earth can repoulate on the new world (purity). It really doesn't feel like your forging your own destiny like you did in CIV V, and this really cuts down on the rollplaying and immersion. You cannot be the enviromentally friendly borg, the non racist starfleet, or the mechanized and technologically advanced Na'vi.

-In some cases the affinity system is terrible. Your units will not evolve until a certain threshold is reached within your given affinity. This means you can't research multiple affinities for their bonuses no matter how important they are to your playstyle as this will ultimately mean you WILL be out teched even if you have beter and more technologies than your enemies. I've had a game where I went heavy eco/science and still had tier one marines even though i could spam ubers.


-the UI is cheaply made and poorly optimized, and don't get me started on the tech tree. You can’t tell what’s a unit, wonder, or whatever.

-said wonders are awefull...hardly worth the time to build.

-racials are useless unless HEAVILY modded. vanilla races hardly matter, and there are no unique units or strategies you can really employ. 

The only saving grace for this game is STEAMs wonderful mod community, who has more common sense and talent than a team of professional game designers; seriously they could have built on CiV 5 but no. They even had the lore friendly setting of the space race victory, imagine if you could import saves from Civ 5 to BE and play as you country in SPAHSE.But now...you have generic continetal flavoured nations with barely any unique flavours instead. 

All in all im giving this a (5) on a scale of (10), The game feels far too simplistic and the lore, art, and design are somewhat subpar at best and unoriginal and boring at worst. For its price, i would not recommend it except if it was on sale . It honestly feels more like a dlc to CIV V than its own standalone game. And as for my own opinion, i am highly dissapointed in this game and barely find it fun without the use of mods. It honeslty had great potential but it fell disastrously short of all expectations, even compared to vanilla CIV V.

The engine seems to be the same as Civilization V and the game is very similar. Hapiness has been replaced by health and gold has been replaced by energy so low hapiness (health) does no longer descrease gold (energy) income which is a nice change. Technology tree is in the form of a net, where nodes have 1-2 leaf technologies (technologies that do no lead to any other technologies). There are multiple paths to upgrade units and already built units auto-upgrade when you select an upgrade. The rest is like in Civilization 5 - trading, spying, diplomacy, zone of control, fighting, building cities. A limit of 3 air units per city is a nice change. And finally, the biggest feature is deploying satellites. These can give bonuses to production/energy/culture/food yield, bonuses to units strength, spread/clean miasma (aka radioactive fog),shoot or even spawn basic/strategic resources.

There are quite a lot of bugs
- once any specialist is assigned manually, specialists are no longer assigned automatically
- in unit upgrade panel sometimes multiple unit models are displayed together (overlapping)
- sometimes air unit attack graphics get screwed up and the unit keeps circling and attacking 5-10 times... it is necessary to play with auto combat enabled
- game crashes in later stages where majority of the map is revealed (and that was on a small map...)
- sometimes it is not possible to build a building which requires certain resource to be within city borders and upgraded even if it is
- often when starting a new game ""next turn"" button doesn't work and I have to exit to main menu and start a new game... of course all the setup gets cleared",1439753531,1441488105,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly I just wanna say, I've been a Sid Meiers Civilization fan since I was in primary school. A fond memory of mine is playing Civ 1 on my lunch and recess breaks while hogging the computers from people who actually wanted to study. I've been a really devoted and loyal follower of the Sid Meiers series for almost as long as I have been alive, annhilating and finishing all Civilization game series and their spin-off's (e.g. Call to power, Alpha Centauri, etc).

Civilization Beyond Earth has completely failed to grasp my attention for longer than one playing hour and has me very dissapointed in so many facets of the game. Since buying the game on release, I can't bring myself to play this game anymore because of how unoriginal and terrible the AI and gameplay is. Unfortunately this is even with the added steam workshop content that is 'recommended' after downloading the game, another area requiring work. I've tried my hardest to like this game, but I can't.

If you want some really healthy advice, buy Civilization V and download a whole heap of mods from the Civ Fanatics website and don't pay for any upcoming DLC from this game. By assisting this game in sales, you will not be teaching the developing team a lesson. It's also easy to say that you'll suffer the same fate like many others if you make that very risky jump.

The game is bland, and is really just an attempt from Firaxis to fill their coffers. The game is very similiar to Civ 5, both in gameplay, and in the fact that the only way it'll get better is with DLC. 

Affinities are a new way of showing how mankind will progress in the future, and they are really the core of the game. Units, buildings, and even victory conditions revolve around them. While this seems interesting at first, you'll start to realize that it actually makes the factions very bland. All of the factions must choose which affinity they will go down. They don't have their own ideas or philosophies as in SMAC, instead, they have to choose one of the three templates. While it seems like ideologies made the same impact in Civ 5, they didn't. In Civ 5, you had history to teach you how every leader is going to play. Montezuma would try to take over the world, Brazil would be peaceful and culture loving, etc. With no history behind this story, only a small lore, it makes the leaders all feel like bland politicians. Finally, affinites aren't really things you choose from the start of the game and say ""I'll go down Harmony."" No, it's your resources that dictate which way you'll go, which is realistic, but you would think a future society wouldn't be dictated by an environment.

Virtues are a nice addition to the mix. They are basically social policies, but will reward you if you want to go and choose every branch to go down, or just going down one. However, as in Civ 5, they are very unbalanced, even after the patch. Any sane person will always go with either prosperity or knowledge and choose a few other virtues in the three other trees to tag along. I really don't understand why Firaxis won't bring back Civics or Social Engineering. This current virtue system is a bit of a step up from Civ 5's, but doesn't make you feel as though you're shaping your nation or government. 

Victories are well thought-out and are somewhat different, but all in all, they're really the same. Build wonder. Wait 30 turns. Watch as AI doesn't do anything to stop you. Win game. Boring screen and you're back to the main menu. Really Firaxis? The only victory you'll really only be excited to get is domination, but that one is very hard to achieve when you don't have W.M.D.'s or a powerful army until midgame. Overall, they just feel pointless, and the victory requirements are hidden behind a terrible UI. The first time I played, I didn't even know which techs to research in order to win. 

Espionage is a bit of a step forward from Civ 5's system, but once other players get security webs or whatever they're called, you'll only be able to dream of setting a nuke off in Elodie's capital. 

Some final points:

-Wonders are bland.
-Trade routes are OP and are hard to manage when you have many cities.
-Leaders are also overpowered, and some are underpowered, such as Elodie after the patch.
-Windows 7 users are going to have a rough time trying to even get on.
-The AI doesn't know how to effectively use the tech web.
-I will admit, orbital units are pretty cool. So are the final units for the affinities.
-Beautiful map. Oooh, aaah.
-Aliens are super annoying at the beginning of the game, and are just an afterthought later on.
-Stations are a stupid approach to city-states. I wonder why nobody has said anything about this yet.

So the verdict is basically a 5 or a 6 out of 10. Pretty bad, especially for Firaxis. Can't wait for them to milk the next poor suckers with DLC.",1424286339,1440807647,False,2,1,0.499233603477478027,0,True,False,False

If you expect something new, you'll be in for a disappointing déjà vu.

I have been a huge fan of previous versions of Sid Meier's Civilization: I loved Alpha Centauri.
Now, many years later, I bought Civilization: Beyond Earth.
At the beginning, it was all fun. The graphics looked good; I liked the music a lot. But after some turns (about 100 or so) I realized there was NOTHING NEW about this game. For me it is a HUGE DEJA VU of Alpha Centauri.

After being such a succesful game programmer, I really expected Sid Meier and Firaxis to turn up with something NEW; something innovative; something we hadn't seen before. I didn't expect this cheap program recycling. Because that is what it is, disguised in some modern graphics and sleeker design.

- The aliens are boring. They're more of an obstacle on the road you just need to get rid of.
- The landscape isn't very ""beyond Earth"". Except for some exotic resources, boring alien insects and fish and a greenish fog, I don't see anything ""beyond"".
- What's with the resource pods? What the hell? Is that all the game designers could come up with for this ""beyond Earth"" world?!?! How boring and unimaginative! What about some alien technologies hidden in artifacts? Or strange ruins of civilizations long since disappeared? Nooooo: resource pods, abandoned outposts and bones. That's very, very ""beyond""...
- I got HUGELY irritated by the stupid, moronic, illogical and backwards ""diplomacy"" in the single player game. The diplomatic behaviour of the other faction's ""AI"" is erratic at the very least. Wars are declared, condemnations are spoken for NO apparant reason but some random algorithm. The ""forgiveness"" in the diplomatic area when it comes to covert ops is extremely one-sided and highly undervalued compared to the ""AI's"" blatant and ongoing incursions despite made promises or demands. It is highly unbalanced, illogical and stupid. There is nothing ""I"" in the AI...

This will probably be the last time I ever spend money on a Sid Meier's recycled game. It's Siphilization Beyond Boring.

I hope they keep going on the sci-fi line, I would like to see a civ game that changes in scale e.g. city/colony -> planet/region -> galaxy.

Bringing it back to what we have here; there are a lot of new bits to civ games here and they feel new e.g. not all that useful but cool all the same.

For me I like the core (or what I think of as core) of civ games ... manage resources take over the map, and that works well here. Some of the victory conditions can be a bit anoying though that can be adjusted for. The mods available add a lot replay not just new factions but some fundamental mechanics changes as well though they can be a bit spotty to get working at times.

First, Cities. If you build every single defensive structure in a city, it's literally impossible to take. No joke. The AI doesn't do this, so you can stomp all over them.

Next, health. Health is this game's ""Happiness"" and it's virtually impossible to keep up. but it doesnt matter, since it doesn't do jack. I once had -50 healthiness and I was still able to defeat all AI in a game without being stopped. 

Next, aliens. Aliens are actually slightly threatening early game, especially the seige worms, but once you get the alien repelling building, you don't really need to worry about them anymore. 

Next, AI. Their personality and abilities rival a cardboard box. They don't do anything to you. 

Next, Sattelites. They're slightly okay, until you get the orbital laser that essentially kills everything in a few hits.

Next, Affinity. It seems slightly good at first, until you realize how ridiculously unfair it is. When you get enough affinity points to select the next unit upgrade, it upgrades all the existing units free of charge. This is a huge problem since these upgraded units make can easily curbstomp any unit a level below them with no effort, meaning that if you decided to focus your research on something besides affinity points, you're screwed. Just imagine if in civ 5, all of your opponents warriors upgraded into longswordsmen free of charge just because they researched the tech. 

Next, victory. Every single one of them except domination and promised land is pathetically easy to get. There's contact victory: Build a tower and wait 20 turns, you win. Supremacy:build a gate and send 1000 military strength through a gate and you win. Harmony: build a mind flower and you win. Notice a pattern? It's just build a structure and wait. Since you're cities are virtually indestructible.

It is a simplified, relatively boring derivative of the Civilization series. It neither offers a breath of fresh air to the Civ veteran nor an exciting and interesting game to the newcomer.

Beyond Earth offers the slow-paced gameplay of Civilization but without the complexity and nuance. It ditches or simplifies many things that made Civilization more interesting: religion, a variety of military units and veterancy upgrades, a variety of civilizations and starting bonuses, diplomacy and trade, and great people. It tweaks cultural policies, gold (energy), and happiness (health) to make them slightly different, but makes no fundamental changes to these. The only truly new addition to gameplay -- quests -- quickly gets repetitive.

War/combat would be far more interesting if all civilizations and affinities didn't have essentially equivalent units with different graphics, and if the power of all these supposedly futuristic units didn't feel more limited than the ancient weapons from Civ V. Unfortunately, most games devolve into a military match, as in Civilization. This is in part due to the fact that most victory types involve some degree of military involvement. All victory types are no more than some combination of building an expensive improvement and building up your military. There is also no significant difference between the alien mechanic and the old barbarian mechanic.

The orbital unit mechanic is underwhelming. There might have been some neat ideas, but in practice, you can only deploy your orbital units if there are no enemy orbital units nearby. The only way to remove the enemy orbital unit is to melee attack it with one of your artillery units, which will magically float up into orbit to attack, even though it is barely able to move two tiles along the ground...

The differences between affinities seem better suited to a real-time game than a slow, ponderous turn-based game like Civ. You'll typically ""pick"" the affinity for the victory that you want or for the strategic resources you have nearby. The high-end units for each affinity, despite ostensibly being different, don't make you change your tactics to use them. It is much like Supreme Commander in this regard, except without the fast pace and epic feel. It comes down to mostly a color choice, really.

Despite being about exploring other worlds beyond Earth, every choice of planet has exactly the same terrain and aliens, which seems like a real missed opportunity. If the game creators wanted to open up the Civilization universe, planets of different types would have gone a long way.

I quite liked playing Beyond Earth, as it kind of changes up the formula from CIV 5. However, it does not change it up enough, in my opinion. Replacing barbarians with aliens and resources with different resources is not that creative. However the addition of affinities and the differing technology tree is really nice.

So does it feel like a CIV game? Yes. Yes it does.
Could it have been an addition or mod to - for example - CIV 5? Yes again.

DON'T! Just don't.. I did.. And I regret it.. 
Uglier than Civ V, WAY fewer options than in Civ V and very linear too!
For what you get, the price is ridiculous!


The less short version:

I played Civ V with all the updates and I love it! Incredibly addictive, and the 243 hours I spend on it, was during a few months only.. Then I see this Civ-in-space-game.. And I love space games.. Around 60% would recommend it then, it cost 40€ and I thought: ""What the hell.. Why not?"" well.. let me tell you.. 

I've spend 42 hours in Beyond Earth, won 5 rounds and lost 2.. And god ****** but I am disappointed... You can't change the victory conditions or the number of AI, and there are only 8 factions. 
You can use spies to steal money and tech, which is a good thing, but if you are caught, you rarely get an option to stop or face consequences, everyone just starts to hate you. You could just not use spies then, you think.. Well yeah, but it is also incredibly overpowered! You can get 2-900 energy (which is the new gold), a lot of tech, (which boosts your technology), several military units or other even more overpowered stuff.. 

The graphics are really disappointing! It seems far uglier than Civ 5, which is a little confusing to me.. Why wouldn't they make it look better?! In all fairness the game gives you the choice between normal graphics and the AMD mantle version, which is apparantly something incredibly pretty.. Which I can't use.. Even though my computer has a 2gb graphiccard, 16 gb ram, 3,5 ghz quad core and so forth, but apparantly I'm lacking something everyone else seems to have.....

Bandits has been replaced with roaming alien lifeforms, which are not aggressive until you move in on their turf.. Mostly at least.. And apparantly water everywhere is their turf. 

The religion has disappeared, which isn't a loss really, but have been replaced with 3 different idelogies, somewhat like Civ 5, but with the distinction, that you get points in either or all of them, but can only win the game if you chose one of them. One hates aliens, on loves aliens, the last is sort of in between. 

The resources has had a facelift ofcourse, and are now very confusing.. Tubers, Chitin ""fruit"" and other stuff which gives some kind of bonusses I'm sure.. But I really can't see where I'm supposed to monitor them... At all.. 

The units has also had a facelift, and they sound cool enough, but there are only 7 units plus 4 from which ever ideology you choose. The units gets up to 4 upgrades as you preogress in the chosen ideology, the starters being puny and the end being overpowered.. Units you already have gets upgraded automaticly, with cost of maintenance and so forth following.

I may be a criticizing turd, who knows nothing about computer games, but I was really disappointed in this game.. Compared to Civ 5, its seems like less than an expansion.. Oh, and did I mention.. Its only 6 gb big... Which somewhat indicates a game with too little content.",1440270377,1440270377,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Many negative reviews were written by people who bought Beyond Earth at $50, at which price the expectations outweigh the reality. This game is not a revolutionary addition to the Civ franchise; it is a high-quality, space-based DLC for Civ 5. The combat mechanics, diplomacy, and overall ""feel"" of the game are virtually identical to Civ 5. In that respect, Beyond Earth is very similar to the Final Frontier mod in Civ 4 Beyond the Sword. Both games do not deviate far from their parent platforms, and they both introduce new ideas to the series. The only difference is that one is $50, and the other is free.

Of course, Beyond Earth is different from Civ 5, chiefly in the artwork, which is great. Even in design, though, Beyond Earth has a hard time escaping the clutches of Civ 5. Sure, the units look completely different, but the same 12 man formation for infantry is present in Beyond Earth. Even the menus are identical to Civ 5, with sleek, futuristic text being the only change.

However, in the areas where Beyond Earth really needs to be different, it succeeds big time. The affinity system is great, and it lends much needed variety to the game. Also, the tech web gives a new perspective on research, forcing a player to choose one technology at the expense of another. These two features give the game replayability, something needed in any good Civ game.

I bought this game when it was on sale for $20, and I'm very satisfied. At $20, it's about the same price as a Civ 5 DLC, which is what Beyond Earth is, essentially. I'm perfectly willing to buy another Civ 5 DLC.

So here I am now playing the game with a sort of grim determination. I have put forth the effort I believe required to honestly judge it for what it is. And what it is is what I thought it was at the beginning.  This game is a lazy, redundant milking of a cash cow. 

You want pros and cons? Sure, why not:

Pros
It is the newest Civilization game
It is easy to learn (since it is just Civ 5 with different icons)
It has never slept with Peggy

Cons
It is the newest Civilization game
It plays exactly like Civ 5
It would probably be less painful if it had slept with Peggy


But to be truly honest... This game has a completely ""yawn"" storyline. Hell! That was wrong even calling it a storyline. It hides it's downfalls by trying to create intrigue from a ""backstory"" or half-baked attempts at futuristic technologies. So I won't bother you with trying make a failed attempt at finding pros and will just give you the cons.

- A total lack of story
- the ""different"" sponsors are identical other than one single ""bonus""
- The techs are the laziest attempt I have ever seen in any Firaxis game ever. They just colonized another friggiing planet and they still have to discover how to make a dang laboratory?
- The units are a joke. You start out with a group of five guys in space suits? Later they have sprites that are just ridiculous. Titan units that are larger than the friggin cities. But then again that would mean you are ignoring that the explorer unit is larger than some cities.
- The tech trees and the ""virtues"" are direct, and once again, lazy copies of Civ 5. 
- You have an ability to randomize planets that does NOTHING more than change the name of the world. (An obvious placement of an ability intended to be charged for later in DLC.)
- The AI is a complete joke. (Just like Civ 5) Higher levels just cheat buff the hell out of your opponents. I once had an island to myself for 10 turns. An AI landed on my island and I declared war. Within 5 turns the AI had built 4 military units (including an alien unit) and his city had grown to 4 population.


So in conclusion let me repeat... this game is a lazy, unfinished piece of crap. This franchise is dead folks. It has become a way for a corporate conclave to make money off of our memory of a great man's great works. SId Meier is somewhere right now checking his bank account and feeling ashamed at what he has allowed his work to become.

If you have a unit with lower stats than the attacking unit, you lose. But that’s true of most strategy games.

* The biggest map size still feels small and cramped.

* No more than 8 civs per map.

* I want slow-tech games to be about slow tech, not slow-everything else. With the marathon (or w/e it's called) speed, road building is slow as well.

* Techs are just boring. Descriptions are good and fancful, but just boring techs overall. Remember those 0-travel cost railroads in earlier Civ? Well, in this game we have roads and magrail.

As a die hard Civ fan, I was anxiously waiting up until release; where I started getting some mixed feelings. (Note that I have nearly 200 hours played, all of which are offline.)
So, whats good about this game? 
- A fresh, but familiar feel. 
- A large graphic overhaul from the previous, Civ. 
- A very impressive Tech. Tree. 
- The true introduction of a ""Third Party"". Aliens>Barbarians. 
- The initial depth of the game is very impressive. Where as Civ. V didn't really pick up until the release of Brave New World. 
- A much more relevant, and sophisticated espionage system. 
- Finally, it runs near the effeciency of Civ. V. Key word here is, ""near"". 

The not so good:
- Religion is now a thing of the past. This has basically removed a fairly large layer of the game. 
- Technology at and around the early phase is dreadfully slow. 
- The story is relatively boring. There's no real immersion, I don't lose track of time, and suddenly find myself playing 3 hours later. 
- The maps. This is a doozy. It feels like they just took the Civ V design, and then took a colour pallet and just re-painted it. There are no real texture changes. Just colours. It just looks, boring? 

All in all, the game meets my expectations. It's hard to come up with another Civ. game after the arguably best Civ game from the franchise.

You get to chose what ability many buildings will have the first time you build them creating many more possibilities for how you develope. The aliens (native species) seem to like you when you're not attacking them but they will still occasionally attack even when they do. They go blue, yellow, then red when they get angree which is quite different than the Civ V barbarian tribes that just plain hate you.

The spy network is another interesting game development. Being able to steal reasources from oponents without them knowing is helpful. The trade network is also a good addition to the game. With each trade route you can see the potential exchange of goods you will receive, and if you check not to renew the route, you can see what new offers are on the table when the route is complete.

I think the city view should have a toggle for showing the man power placement. Those people icons make it difficult to see the resources that each tile produces. Perhaps making the people icons small like the resource icons would help. Knowing what resources are made on each tile is useful for placing satelites. In orbital view, the tiles should also be lit up with their resource production icons. This might be an option I haven't looked for during the one day trial though.

The one valid point I will make, though, is that it's really hard to take the Civilization brand into a future that hasn't yet happened.  Playing factions in a futuristic game just doesn't have the resonance of playing factions that are developing through the history we've already experienced.  You don't have that moral quandry of whether you react to the events and technologies of history the same way as our ancestors, or the feel that playing a civilization a certain way is upholding the tradition of that civilization.  That said, very few people play Civ as a roleplaying experience... so this might not even apply to most people.  But it was the most interesting and compelling issue I found.

Aside from that one playstyle quirk, this is a very good Civ game which manages to make combat a bit more dynamic and enjoyable through upgradeable units and the like.  It plays very much like Civ 5... so if you liked Civ 5, you'll probably like this game... and if you didn't like Civ 5, you probably won't like this game.  Once it's had a couple expansions, it may even take its place as my favorite Civ game so far (that spot is currently held by Civ 5).",1439753525,1439801828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw on the Mac App store ( I have a 2015 mac book air) that this game was on sale! I am really into civ 5 and I love futurestic space games so I was really happy. Ok so now to the actual review part. Pros: This was a new way to play the Civ franchise and there are alot of awesome new features like the affintys, alians, upgrades that change the way a unit looks, a nice new tech style called the ""tech Web"" , quest, explorers that actually explore( the conduct expeditions!) and satalites! yes thats right, you have some space units! Cons: for what ever reason the grapics on my computer arn't the best but i can get over that, not many civs to play as, not to many core civ things( religon, great people, etc.).
 
My over all thought: I really enjoy it! This was a really brave step for Civ to take and it is pretty origonal! The grapics on my computer are a liitle let down but the gameplay is smoth and the affintys are really cool! Affintys give you preks and change the way your units look. There is Harmony, Purty, and Supremacy. Harmony is about becoming one the the life of the planet and become friends to the alians. It also makes your units look very organic. Purty is the sad truth. Of what? that we would try to kill off all the alians and turn the world into a new earth. It is very militaristic and looks very blocky and warmongering. Supremacy is integrating tech into humans. Its kinda has the colors of the bad guys from tron and is very robotic. So yah. I recogmend this game to people who are willing to get over the fact that ist not civ 5 and except change. If you like future syci fi games or just stratagie gaes than you should get this. I think I will give thsi 8 out of 10 stars! I recogmend this game. 
 
I hope this has helped.

Mr. Meiers or parties attending to the name.
I am a HUGE fan of your game series as it was near revolutionary when the first installment came out, and kept it's appeal through the years.
but it's been ""DECADES"" and changing the name of the units does not a new game make.
""tsk tsk tsk""
the tech web was a good idea and is the only decent feature of this installment.
but the AI of the other leaders. ""is the pits"".
and though the ""concept"" of being in space is ""new"", the application of that concept was juvenile. 

I would LOVE to have a sit down with your developers and brainstorm, but, seeing as how you're a millionaire company I would have to see some beaucoup dineros.
and yet, knowing that's not going to happen, because you're resting on your past successes,
I'd have to say:

""in a world where corporations have decided to ban together and regurgetate the same narrative through endless 1st person shooters due to risk managers hedging profit margins, the onus falls to you to keep both vigile and balance. This is done by offering a great product with forethought, insight, clarity, and imagination.

where this installment is concerned, I have to break with my fanboy instincts and say,
""FAIL"".

you were headed in the right direction but instead of diving into the deep end you put on swim fins and splashed around in the kiddie pool.

Of course its not going to be like the Civ 5 with all DLCs. It has about 30% new things from Civ5 and I am content with that, it freshes it up without getting rid of the Civ 5 legacy or feel.

In all honesty this should have been a stand alone from the Civilization series perhaps? I don't know but as a person who just enjoys good games this is it. 

Diplomacy Aspect: 5/10 - They didn't make any big changes from the Civ5 Diplomacy. Dissapointed.

Trade Aspect: 7/10 - The same but a good aspect to have.

The technology tree for instance lets u choose your path rather than in civ where u actually need a lot of previous techs to get the one u desire.  

When the players start this game they may have intial judgements of the game, I for one found it a bit boring but only til I started playing it a lot did I really become into it. Remember, compared with civ 5 its hard to make a game based on a  fantasy world rather than Earth. I know a lot of people don't like it becuase it doesnt have a lot of features that are present in similar games but the new expansion looks to bring those into the game. The producers want to make money don't they? so packing in all those features and selling it off at 30 is not good for them. 

Back to the game, I don't think I'd like playing the game if it wasn't similar to civ 5.

There are some good innovations in this; it's certainly not all bad.  Makes one sorry for the binary voting system.  One of these innovations is the usage of the miasma: tiles that you can pass through, but don't want to end your turn on, lest the unit take damage.  Another development to traditional Civ systems that I like is the multi-directional research tree.  I suppose in the base Civ game, such a tree isn't possible because there must be linear progression through the eras.  So there are great aspects to the game.

Let's go over some pros and cons:

Pros:
- Runs great on most systems (Played on my 4 year old laptop at medium settings with no lag)
- Better UI when controlling units
- Quicker loading when talking with other Civs
- Ability to trade ""favors""
- Cities aren't built in one turn


Cons:
- UI is not intuiative, I feel like I have to look for things constantly
- Couldn't find ""Advanced Setup"" option (took me about 30 minutes to find it)
- Unit descriptions are not easy to understand
- No Religion
- Very little diversity with ""barbarians""
- No semi-linar story line (feels like I was just dumped into the game without any story as to how/why I am here)
- Maps are basically remakes of Civ: 5
- No sci-fi implemented; no original ideas with the theme of the game

Civ: BE just feels like a remastered edition of Civ: 5 - only thing different are the look of the cities and units. I much prefer what Civ: 5 has over Civ: BE.

I would NOT buy this game, unless it's less than $10. As this game stands, it feels more like an expansion/remastered edition of Civ: 5.

Right well as you can see not many people seem to like Beyond Earth that much, there are alot of complaints about lack of unit types, uninspired maps and over all just an overhall of Civ 5. All of these complaints about the game hold some truth but that does not mean that it's a bad game. The first time I tried it I didn't like it much, but later on I was confused as to why I didn't like it because before it came out I was super excited for it, so I went back and tried again, you know what it was great fun. The reason for this is that you really need to immerse yourself in the game's premise and setting, when you picture yourself protecting and looking after your fledgling city exploring your surroundings and dealing with the local fauna it really becomes a fun game. The trick is to stop power gaming it like a Civ V game and enjoy it for what it is, not only that I have no doubt that with subsequent DLCs the game will get better, and have more depth than it does now but for the time being we will just have to wait. 

Before I give a rating I feel it only right to point out a few issues that may cause some trouble when playing the first time,  the tech web is a bit of a pain and can be a slightly confusing in comparison to the nice timeline tech tree from Civ V but once you get your head round it you should be fine. Another thing that can be a bit of a pain is finding out what all the different resources are when you play your first game as it takes time to identify what resource is used for what building/unit or if its a luxuary resource. Apart from that the game is good and I recomend it just make sure you have the right mind set going in to play it for the first time.

Gameplay in Civ IV Complete and Civ V Complete is better.

Civ BE's shortfalls relative to the sereis are few but important.

1) No flavor. Considering the work put into animating the rhetoric of factions in Alpha Centauri, and in Civ V, the flat and generic presentation in BE gives the impression that it was viewed as a cash grab, rather than a full product, by the studio. The price, thankfully, reflects that.

2) Balance. Civ BE offers the player options that are patently dumb. I mean to say that the options are not real options in any situation. A good metaphor would be adding a button that makes you lose when you push it. Yes, it's an additional choice, but it adds no value to the game.

3) The game did not dramatically change or improve as is common among Sid Meier's spinoffs and numbered games. The differences between III and IV, or IV and V, for example, are huge. Even the changes in V:GNK, and V:BNW expansions were dramatic and awesome. BE, from the player's perspective, is just a reskin with a new tech tree.

THE BAD

1. The game feels like a skin/mod for Civilization V. It felt all too familiar too soon. I was especially disappointed that the same strategies for Cvilization IV and V still apply to Beyond Earth. This is the core flaw in the game, as it gets boring quickly and thus has no staying power. 

2. The maps are boring. Nothing unique in the alien world, just different names for the same tiles. 

3. The DLC adds components to the game that should have been included at launch. 


THE GOOD 

1. The affinity points are a fresh addition; however, the amount of units are still limited.

I'll start with the good: CIV BE plays on the classic Civilization formula. If you have played and enjoyed a CIV game, and aren't expecting some kind of revolutionary new gameplay, you may be satisfied with BE. Kudos to Firaxis for putting together an excellent User Interface, not-too-obnoxious tutorials, and a very playable experience. 

Firaxis has also supported the modding community, and thanks to the effort of modders, this game kept my interest longer than it could have in the ""vanilla"" version. Thanks to everyone who helped with unofficial patches & adding onto the base game. 

That said, there isn't much new to be had in CIV BE. The affinity system works much like religions/wonders in other CIV-style games. 

I was disappointed with how long it took to fix the launch bugs with BE. First and foremost, users with 120hz/144hz monitors were locked into low resolutions (720p). The official word was that, since this was a minority of users, the issue wasn't a priority. I'm happy to say that the issue seems to be fixed today, but for the three months I played, all of that time was spent at a lower resolution and so I can't endorse the graphics of BE.

Graphics aside, gameplay is pretty ""meh."" If you've played a Civ-style game you have played BE. The affinities are nice, but they are basically the only way to customize units. I would have preferred more in-depth options to specialize my military. 

The quest system is interesting until you realize that most quests are simply A/B choices - and the majority of those have only one right answer. Would you rather have 1 extra trade route at every city forever, or +1 energy from each trade route? Don't worry, the answer will be pretty obvious by the time you start. Unfortunately, the AI will cripple itself by making the bad choices in some quests. 

Units are somewhat bland. Firaxis didn't bother reskinning the units, so each player's armies look identical. Flags next to the unit names are used for identification, but since factions share similar flag icons/colors, scanning through the map could be a pain (Which faction had a star in the flag? Oh right - all of them). Some useful mods will change soldiers' shirt colors so you can tell at a glance who is who.

What I found most disappointing really, was the diplomacy system. All factions share the same dialogue and, based on affiinity, the same strategy. Three affiinities, three playstales, one personality. 

Verdict: CIV BE has the personality of a cardboard cutout. The addition of Quests/Affinities can't substitute for real innovation. If you MUST play CIV in space, there are better alternatives. I could reccomend this game at around $10 - 15 USD price point. 

Some alternatives to try:
Warlock I or II: A fantasy-based CIV clone with a much gentler price point and lots more to do with the military/research(spells). Warlock games also lack in-depth diplomacy systems, but make good with much more interesting battles. Warlock I in particular is a great bargain, as it is not too terribly different from II. 

Endless Legend: Another fantasy-based strategy game, but breaks the mold a little from Civilization titles. Possibly the best strategy game out there right now, and polar opposite of BE: customization galore, interesting quests/objectives, bursting with character. Professional reviews and multiple GOTY awards say more for EL than I ever could. As a nice touch, EL gets frequent updates/bugfixes. 

Endless Space: The debut game from Amplitude, creators of Endless Legend. If a sci-fi setting is your thing, can't go wrong. Endless space is set on a galactic scale, so you are doing away with traditional hexes altogether. Despite this, lovers of the 4X strategy formula will be quite at home with an experience that is both in-depth and easy to learn. The only draw-back for me is that the AI goes off the handle and has a tendency to ""cheat"" in higher difficulties. Look out for Endless Space II coming out possibly in 2016.

I'll start this review with a very important point:

This is ""Sid Meier's CiVilization: Beyond Earth"" (SMC:BE), NOT ""Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri 2"" (SMAC2?).
When I read the announcement for Beyond Earth I was so happy. Finally, I thought, a new SMAC game! How I had waited for this day! Wrong. SMC:BE is not SMAC2. Never has been, never will be.

Obviously, the backbone of SMC:BE is based on Sid Meier's Civilization V, which is a good thing if you liked SMCV. This is also a bit of a flaw, the game is a bit too much like SMCV, and occasionally feels as a DLC rather than a game on its own. The game includes some rather neat mechanics, though, like minor civs spawning during the game (as compared to CiV, where they were as ancient as the major civilizations) and an ""affinity"" system. I really wanted to make a simple pros/cons list here for prospective buyers to look at, but oddly enough realized that many of the features I like is also in some way (in my opinion) flawed.

+Hexagons
I think this is a vast improvement to the squares of Civ I-IV. It might seem like a minor issue, but I like them hexagons!

+/- One unit per tile
This is a difficult one... the stacks of doom from Civ I-IV (and SMAC), was definitely annoying, but maybe it would have been better with two or three units/tile? Artillery becomes very vulnerable, and it does seem weird that you combine your units a bit better. And seriously, how many soldiers do you have in each unit if you can't fit two in one tile? Either the units should be more abstract (artillery as a promotion on a base infantry or mechanized chassis maybe?) or it should be possible with more units on a single tile (although some kind of limit is probably good).

+/- User interface
Ok, although a bit messy at times. Not bad, but Firaxis is a studio with plenty of experience, so I had expected better.

++/- Affinity system
Your colony is defined by the way you treat the planet and your citizens. This is a really neat feature, but mechanically it falls a bit short. You just can't feel how your choices affect the colony, I would have liked to see something more dramatic, seeing the terrain becoming more earthlike for a Purity-type colony would be great. Similarly, getting improved yields from pristine, unchanged, terrain for harmony-type colonies would be cool. Sure, it is a nice feature as implemented, but it could have been better. Your opponents choices also alter their leader appearance in a (too) minor way, which is nice, but it is a bit unfortunate that you can't (as far as I know) look at your own leader.

- Leaders
Not much personality on the leaders, and the factions don't really differ that much. The factions (or sponsors) are tied to geographic regions rather than ideologies (although in-game quotes do point at ideological differences). I would have preferred leaders with a more apparent ideology, but since this is partly decided by player choices along the affinity track it isn't too much of a problem. And if factions are geographic; why is there no North European or Middle East faction? Planned DLCs?

(+) Diplomacy
Somewhat improved from SMCV with the ""favor"" system.

+/- AI
Seems pretty good. Haven't tried too much on the higher difficulties though. A bit annoying when the AI leaders proposes trades that they themself don't accept, but that will probably be solved with a patch. 

+/- Minor civs
Minor colonies appearing during the game is a really nice feature. Unfortunately, the only thing these minor civs are used for is to destroy or trade with. More personality would have been nice.

- Trade
Awfully implemented. Too much unnecessary micromanaging. 

- Terraforming
Ok... seriously, why can't I do this? Is the ""Terrascope"" improvement as good as it gets? At least being able to plant forests would be nice... which brings about another issue: why do forests suck? 

+ Graphics
Nice. Not in any way spectacular, but still nice.

+/- Tilesets and terrain
The game comes with three different tilesets for the planets: ""lush"", ""fungal"" and ""desert"". Some complaints have been raised that within each tileset there is not enough difference between terrain types (e.g. grassland or tundra), and I concur with this, but that is not a major issue. The fact that there are different tilesets is something I find really neat, but just like the affinity system it falls a bit flat. I would have liked each tileset to be a completely different experience, possibly along with different taxa of aliens and different resources. As it is now it stops at nice, but implemented fully it would have been awesome.

- Game ending
In one word: underwhelming. In my first game I won the Supremacy victory. I'm not going to spoil the story, but the after effects should be rather profound, and a short movie prelude to show this would have been nice.

+ Overall playability
While the review might seem a tad negative I still have played 28.8 hours, and must say that I enjoyed it. I'll probably spend at least as many hours again before I'm fed up. Having paid about 30€, I can't really regret my purchase. 30€ for 60h of entertainment isn't bad. The game is OK and I do recommend it, at least if you can get it at a reduced price. It is a bit disappointing that it plays so similar to Civilization V, though, some groundbreaking new feature would have been nice. The affinity system is nice, but Firaxis could have given more depth to it.

With a DLC or two it will probably be really good. Which is a bit tragic, I guess, but that is how most of the gaming companies work today. Some more so than others.

What is the deal with the low user scores then?

Well... the main reason, as I see it, has to do with the point I began the review with. SMAC is awesome, way better than Civ 2 from which it spawned. Way better than CIv 3, 4 and 5 for that matter. And SMAC is... different. It has a well-written world with plenty of personality, leaders you can love or hate (or love to hate). I have spent a hideous amount of hours on SMAC. The bar was set so tremendously high by SMAC (way back in 1999) so the expectations on SMC:BE by the community has been ridiculous. And I think that SMAC has a rather vocal fanbase in the 4x community.

But this is not a review of SMAC2, there is no such game.

If you would like to play a new, modern Civilization game, with a few rather neat features, go ahead: buy SMC:BE, you won't regret it. Compared to SMCV (which I liked), SMC:BE is a good game. Compared to SMAC, well... it is kind of mediocre, but still ok. If you haven't played SMAC, it is available at GOG.com for a meager 4.79€, if you like Sci-fi and Civ-type games you'll love it. Sure, graphics are a bit dated, and the AI is a bit weird at times, but it is still the best 4x game to date.

This review does not include mods.

My first game - Went for the supremacy route lasted 800 turns-ish with normal ai, lost by 3 turns, i was going for a emancipation victory and lost to transcendancy, played well. I only ever notice done bug where strangly in the unit viewer id have 2 units overlapping eatch other in the viewing pane.

I was playing full on, DX 11, all setting son highest. It's a beautiful game, Everything is sharp and vibrant. Only one colour set in both the games i played a murkier green colour but ""dirty terra"" is  the only way i can describe it. 

The art.... oh boy... Units are grossly mis-scaled. Animations are rather short, dull and unvaried. Character art itself is unique and fresh. 

Dialogue - Well except for one or two phrases, most of it seems ripped straight form civ 4 or 5. 10/10 for imagination there firaxis...

Re/Playability - Plays fine encountered nothing game breaking. As for replayability, unless you take it online, once you have won eatch victory type and tried all 3 affinitys there wont be much left you can do unless you start playign with mods. 

My overall rating? id give it 8/10.

Would i reccomend it? Yes and no. I wouldnt reccomend it to civ-rookies or those that never played civ before, wait for the expansions first so you get more of a complete game (as seems to be the Civ way). Civ fans yes id reccomend it to you, theres and exapansion in the works due for release this autumn so you wont have to wait long for missing game ele... sorry... for  new DLC to be available.

The game was fun to play, I get a kick out of terraforming planets and making a new, better earth.  The combat is what you would expect from a Civ game, and there is a lot of meaningful choices as to how and where you build, and how that combines with your affinity.  Enjoyed the removal of religion, I assume it was tied in with the ""Great mistake"".  Also enjoyed having the option of turning the entire planet into an air conditioned wonderland.  

As for the downside, the game made no sense.  Billions of habitable planets, so all the best and brightest decide to take the same one and fight a war...  If the aliens were more powerful I could understand it, an international coalition to secure the future, but the diplomacy system kinda sucks and the aliens aren't much of a threat.  The orbital layer isn't used as much as I think it should be, as having low orbital satellites that scan a different part of the map each turn really does make sense.  On that note, I don't really understand why you would land without at least looking at the planet first.  You really shouldn't sacrifice common sense and logic in the name of game balance.

Obviously it's not Civ V. A lot of things from Civ V is present here in Beyond Earth, but still lacks something to make the game a little more interesting. 
You can have some good fun with this game, the story and the scenario both of them are very well built and very interesting. Maybe this game is going to have the same problem that Civ V had: A lot of people is hating the game right now but when new material is released, the game will turn the table and become loved by the serie's fans! This happens because right now it gives you little new features, not a very large civilization list to choose and, in great part of the time, a boring game (this happens because de AI sucks)! But the way you can manage your units and civilization, the choices that you need to do, not only during the game but in the start, can make it a little more easier in some points and harder in others.
Maybe with some new DLCs, more maps and even some new features (new civilizations, technologies, units from each evolutionary branch) this game can have the same destiny from Civ V and become a great loved one hit, but only time is going to tell us if this is going to happen or not.
If you want to play alone this game, it's a good choice to understand how it works and it's mechanics, but the AI is not going to be a great challenge!

Happyness changed into health, and the lack of luxory resources to affect it, is a nice change becasue it simplifies the dependancy on starting near and aquiring resources to maintain.

The wonder system seems to weigh much less which I appreciate, making wonder spamming not so affective. 

Hovering units helps aid the problems presented by 1 unit per tile. 

The technology web (while at first confusing and convuluted) seems to offer much greater flexebility to how you want to play. 

The culture is also simplified, but also more free to experiment with, as opposed to Civ 5 which kind of locks you into a certain trait. 

The game pace seems to move quicker, and as a whole seems to have cut a lot of the mechanical fluff out of Civ 5, and replaced it with a more solid foundation.

This might sound weird me recommending this game. Why you say? Well I'm sure they'll make some DLC's (I really hope this), that will improve the game. Like they did with Civ 5, cause that game also took  2 dlcs to become good.

Also once you get past the early game the game actually becomes more fun to play. It's like the opposite of civ 5 where end game was just boring but the early game is fun!

- Diverse settings options and different types of ways to influence the world.
- Some good mechanics that reduce player clicking (although worker automation could be better).

Cons
- Diplomacy is too simplistic.
- There should be ways to keep your workers from building whatever improvements they want (EX: prioritize farms, Never build terrascapes... freaken terrascapes).

It inexplicably takes too long for me to do anything when, logically, with advanced technology, everything should be done faster - or at least as fast as it was done in Civ V on Earth.

I would frequently make my cities produce extra resources (money, science, etc.) because I wasn't at war and ran out of structures to build. Choosing to build resources because there's nothing else worth building is bad game design.

Developers, don't artificially delay the game's advancement by adding time to chores and slowing down movement and flooding maps with obstacles that should've been simplified with, you know, the application of future tech. Also, put wonders in the game worth building.

Fuji or... a place with some chitin and a lot of floatstone?

The civilization games never had much story, because it inherited the stories and emotional connections from actual history. That's not to say every 4x tactical game needs to be historically focused, but Civ:BE has almost nothing to replace this narrative framework. Faction diversity is deliberately muted to support the free-form 4x mechanics, resulting in bland rivals. There are no faction-specific units or buildings, and all three ideologies are viable for any faction. In contrast to the similarly-themed Alpha Centuari, every technology or wonder quote is read by the same voice actresses, wasting an avenue to characterize factions or people of Civ:BE. It ends up being very hard to care about anything that's happening, which is a shame because the mechanics are top-notch.

The basic mechanical goal of Civ:BE is to build a 4x game that features same kind of free-form customization seen in games like Skyrim/Path of Exile/The Secret World. To this end, Civ:BE has tweaked the traditional mechanics in a variety of smart ways. Picking a faction now consists of sequential choices to hone in on something that fits your play style. The research ""tree"" is much much broader, and only 3-4 techs deep, allowing for lots diversity with regards to research. Cultural ""Virtues"" give other customizable benefits to your civilization, and their are benefits both for sticking to one area, or for spreading your points around. There's also a wide variety of tile improvements which can be further augmented by launching satellites to give benefits to a whole set of tiles. On the military front, every unit in the game has a purpose, and it's never the case where one unit is strictly better than another. Units are upgraded for free as your ""affinity"" with one of the ideologies increases, which is usually done by researching specific technologies.

It sounds like a lot to take in, and it is. Expect to spend your first 2-3 games learning the intricacies of how various systems fit together. And for my part, it wasn't until I fired up the wiki and cross referenced it with the in-game technology tree that I got a sense of the different roles of terrain improvements. Eventually though, I started getting the hang of things and designing my own custom ""builds"" which played pretty distinctly. It's also worth nothing that I played both at release and recently, and a bunch tech/virtues/faction imbalances have been smoothed out.

There's mechanical depth here to be sure—in fact, I'd even go so far as to say I've never seen a 4x game deliver on this kind of customization. But for as much freedom as you have in planning your planetary empire, executing those plans in the bland world of Civ:BE feels hollow.",1437895275,1437895275,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For years, Civ has been a household name of the gaming industry and probably the most well known TBS ever. And ol' Sid has done it again...IN SPAAAAACE!!!! (Sorry, had to get that out of my system)

[b]The Good:[/b] The game is absolutely beautiful. The terrain, units and UI are all rendered very nicely. Especially the units. Come late game, some of the stuff you can build will make your jaw drop. Gameplay has transitioned nicely too. It still has a similar feel to past Civ's but, as expected, Beyond Earth is much more complex. Delightfully so, at least once you get your head around it. Plus, all the new/redone mechanics like more in-depth espionage and the affinity system give even more strategy options.

[b]The Bad:[/b] The complexity of the game is one of its selling points (not nearly as much as with Europa Universalis) but, to be fair, this is a touch excessive. It doesn't matter if you're a veteran or totally new to Civ, Beyond Earth will kick your ass for a while which I've seen deter a fair few gamers. It doesn't help that the Tech Web (yeah, web) is very daunting and tricky to navigate. The only saving grace, so to speak, is that your ""advisor"" is incredibly helpful though you're still in for some pain regardless.

[b]The Ugly:[/b] Aliens. Those freaking aliens are the only ""ugly"" aspect of the game because their behavior is completely erratic. The only thing that is consistant is that if you start squishing bugs, their pals get mad and try to squish you. But even if you leave them alone for the entire game, some random roach will come along and attack you for no damn reason! Now, if there was a way to control/domesticate the bugs, that would fix this problem. But I suppose that's what expansions are for.

Still a down-vote. It's a neat title with lots of possibility--but the diplomacy is still weak, and the game is still lacking in character or soul or personality. The devs have, themselves, admitted to this, and I think this is one of the things that will be DLCed up in the coming months.

-------Previous Review-------------

Since Civ V was introduce I felt that Firaxis went the wrong way. Yes it is a great game, and I gave spend over 700 hours on it, but they moved away from a great concepts of Civ IV (Like espionage or corporation) to simplyfy the experience. There is nothing wrong with this but this could all be done via the setup menu (Do you want to micro manage espionage? do you want to micro manage trade? etc).

Civ: BE follows that philosophy to a degree. While I just started enjoying it and I know I will spend many a sleeples night on it It does feel a bit like they left too many things to be changed via expansions. 

THERE WILL BE EXPANSIONS! - To utilise more the orbital layer etc. They already are planning to get pore of my miney... 

Having said that the dollar per hour (or pound in may case) is still more satisfying that any other type of game, and definately more satysfying that any action title or MMO in my opinion.

Whatever problems this game might have - get it as this is a different flavour Civ which will give you a lot of fun, and excellent value for money.

After thinking over why this game isnt as engaging I have decided its because of the shortage of civilizations to play as, and the lack of difference and variation between each civilization.

Aside from the colour scheme of each civilization and the name/main character there is virtually no different between each civilization in the rest of the game which isn't an issue the first time to play the game, but becomes a really dull prospect after the first game. Essentially thats the game in a nutshell - interresting the first time you play it but then really really dull there after, especially since the tech-tree and end game objectives seem the same no matter what.

- small stuff that were not fixed since release like CNDR buggy low texture fire animation
- NO constant improvement as it was the case for Civ5 which changed its mechanics ENTIRELY over the years

No realistic rainfull and solar collection in response to the terrain like in Alpha Centauri.

Tackling aliens, even at the easiest of levels, is a bore.  It is often difficult attacking their nest without having your unit nestled in miasma (a toxic green mist) which bascially harms your unit on every turn.  This means that attacking the nest is often not possible and leaves your initial city open to constant attack.  I've played a few times now and not been able to deal with this.

Then, of course, there's the diplomacy...by which I mean the almost complete lack of it. The leaders have absolutely no personality and a lot of what made Civ 5 good is lost.

The AI and balance could also use some work, with explorers happily wandering into death-traps of insects, various creatures easily overwhelming the player making certain play-styles nearly impossible, and worker build choices that would remove or drain resources that were already critically low or negative.

There were a couple of improvements over Civ 5, though.

I had damn good fun with BE for a good while, enjoyed Apollo difficulty thoroughly, but now that I am seeing the Rising Tides expansion, I can't help myself but think that we are being served a 3-course Civ-5-reskin meal.

The Good:
- Sci-fi Civ 5
- New mechanics pertaining to all of the 4 X's
- Beautiful alien world
- friendlier factions
- Aliens!

The Bad:
- It's still civ 5, just with a reskin
- new mechanics that were so botched or easy to exploit that Firaxis had to overhaul most of them
- completely overhauling the faction bonuses just a few months after launch showed us clearly how little 2K/Firaxis invested in playtesting all the aspects of the game
- No variation - quests stay invariably the same, and while that might help min-maxers, it feels like a rigid system
- Not enough leader personality - IMO, there are 3 personalities in this game: Purity, Supremacy and Harmony. The leader's name or mindset doesn't matter at all.
- The aliens are a shortsighted addition - there is so little you can do with them. Granted, they can mess you up, or make your advancements slower, but I expected more from it than adopting an alien next and turning them friendly after half a game, or just plainly exterminating them. Using aliens to mess other players up or having a way to sic a while alien colony at someone else would have been nice (apart from builying around a nest to force the game to spawn a new alien near another player).

The conclusion:
It is obvious that in the end, we will get a complete beyond earth experience, but we will have to wait till 2K/Firaxis launches all the DLC's and all the additions to the game.

Quest are a new feature, although a few of them are broken, the broken ones dont really hurt the game. Another new feature is being able to use ""favors"" in diplomacy. A great concept but it is as of yet to be fully implemented. While the AI can request something from you for a favor, the reverse is not true. If you are owed multiple favors, you cannot redeem more then one at a time. So if the AI owes you 19 favors, you cant ""pressure"" them into compliance because you can only redeem one at a time. You cant select amounts to trade for.. Anyway, lots of little bugs, but nothing game breaking.  As the Civ series has always been, they features will be fixed in time. The AI is still ignorant, the units are still predictably useful. The affinity is a cool new feature...you really have to play a few times to understand what tech you want to go for.

Good - I love the refreshing new units and resources. They look nice and they grab my fancy. They're different planets you can play on, one that has a day and night cycle which I thought was pretty neat. The gameplay is familiar to Civ 5 which I liked personally. Oh and the ""Pods"" and

Bad - Ok. Wtf happened? I feel like the Leaders I go against are lifeless drones with no personality.

In that sense, I think this game (along with Civ Revolution) is a great Civilization Starter for people unfamiliar with this series: it´s simpler, much more coherent, and has tiny bits of scripted events to distract you.

The game takes place on an alien world somewhat after the events of Civilization 5. A chaotic dying Earth is now ruled by corporations. Players are forced to leave Earth and battle it out on an alien world for survival where they eventually progress into the far future. There are many ways to achieve victory and most have not been seen in any other Civilization game. I highly recommend Beyond Earth because it is an awesome game!

PS: I am sure this is a bug that the developers will fix but I have noticed that late in the game things tend to become really slow and then stop working, especially when you create a lot of military units. I am hoping they will fix this because the game basically becomes unplayable in late game right now. I am running Windows 7 Ultimate.

I find them very fun, but I honestly have the strategtic capabilities of a drunken [strike] sailor [/strike] Admiral. Anyways, I own both CiV and Civ:BE, and I simply don't understand why BE gets the flak that it does. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi, but I find this game to be on par with CiV. Plus, with the Rising Tides DLC coming out soon, hopefully Civ:BE will no longer be looked down upon by the community. I mean, seriously. Hardly anyone plays CiV vanilla anymore, and I have a feeling that DLC will work wonders for this game, too.

I'm going to stop writing this review now. It's late and I'm very much surprised I'm still forming coherent sentences.
