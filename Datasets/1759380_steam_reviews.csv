* Fun and cute
* Focus on crafting and quest progression
Cons:
* Bugs galore
* Skill tree is really imbalanced - many skills you unlock require LATER skills in order to use 
* Grindy
* No automation

Summary:
Fun cute game that would be so much better if bugs were fixed and the skill tree rebalanced correctly.

This is NOT what I would consider a slow life ""Stardew Valley"" like game. This game is actually quest progression focused (with the story) and is made up of a lot of crafting to progress.  That's not a bad thing at all - except the lack of automation really starts to become apparent. There's not enough space to create a ""proper"" layout to allow all machines all functionality, so you constantly have to demolish/move/rebuild stations in order to make the crafts needed. This is also on top of having to pick up your home and move it around - often times to gain access to certain auras needed that don't exist in certain zones. This means there's just a ton of time spent prepping just to make things, which is what the game is all about.

There's a ton of display bugs in the skill tree that make progression confusing at times. But that's the least of its problems. The skill tree balance is really bad. There are 4 main ""trees"", and it doesn't take long before you start unlocking skills that require other skills much deeper in the other trees. It's not bad to have related skills, but many of these are behind ""gates"" that are further in the main questline than others. For a simple analogy, it would be like unlocking a level 10 craft that requires a skill you don't unlock until you do a level 20 quest. 

I'm still playing mostly because I'm an insane person that can put up with the frustration, and I generally am having fun with it. But the game would be so much better with just a bit more quality control and balancing of the game.",1709043918,1709043918,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

let me tell you what is not this game:
its not a sit back and relax, not a crafting game(although there are crafting), not farming
not like stardew vally or graveyard keeper, its not what you expect from this genera.
you cant sit back and just craft and there are no automation or ways to make things easier, as you progress crafting only becomes harder and harder with no way to make it enjoyable.

so what is this game?
its a story rich game, full of dialog and every thing you do is for the story, even the crafting is because someone asked you to craft weird things for them, and there are recipes that has no function. a lot of the time you get a quest to go talk to someone or to see something or to party. parting is a main part of the game and its soooo lame, like its straight bad and boring.

finally the story:
its the main part, the game is full of dialog and cut-scenes, the thing is that IT FFING SUCKS, STRAIGH BAD.
its a kids story about friendship and the power of friendship, a typical story about saving the world and proving that i can do it although im the weakest, except its worse.

one more thing: there are no rewards or achievements for doing extra things or finishing the game 100%.

I have played League of Legends since it first came out and did not buy any of the other Riot Forge games. This one appealed to me because I'm an avid fan of farm & crafting sims... plus, just look at it! It's adorable. Overall, I have a lot of criticisms of the game, but honestly - I liked it. I liked being able to play a light hearted game about some of my favorite Yordles and learn a little more about Bandle City. I had fun with the fishing, cooking, and party mini-games, but most of all I had fun trying to break my brain on crafting - since it's not always apparent how to get the appropriate combination of things you need, especially early on. There are some different avenues, that make it a bit puzzle like... for example, should you go to THIS map for THIS aura to help with THAT item, or should you instead craft that other item which gives you that aura, go to this other location to get the thing needed for THAT aura, and well.. you get it. It's an endless rabbit hole, with some twists and turns. I'm not saying it's super complicated, but you will need to use some brain power at times to get a certain craft done. If you enjoy casual, crafting type grindy games, you will definitely enjoy this title.

I will say that if I had no past knowledge of League of Legends... well, I'd still probably buy this - though maybe not for full price.

[h2]VISUALS/CHARACTERS[/h2]
- Again... adorable!
- Environment details are rich and exciting. It feels like a lot of love went into the map designs. They're sprinkled with little creatures, unique plants, and stunning backgrounds.
- Character models are eh... The unique characters from League of Legends look true to their name and are well designed; however, I cannot say the same for the regular townsfolk and the player character. You get to customize your character at the start (and can do so again by visiting your bed), but the options are uninspired and bland. I would have loved more choices (there were only about 4 ear shapes, maybe 8 hair styles, and then the rest of the options are color only). If you are going to give the option to customize your character, please make it count or instead offer us a visually interesting design that cannot be customized. I sometimes find myself losing my character amongst the rest of the NPCs visually. There are a very few NPCs that have a slightly unique hairstyle, facial hair, or height outside of the original League of Legend yordles.
- Even though the visuals for the league characters were on point, I was disappointed in the writing of them. Very little lore seemed tied in, even though there is a plethora of it. Their personalities also just didn't shine through for me, except for maybe Veiger and Lulu slightly.


[h2]MUSIC/Sound[/h2]
- Beautiful music!
- A little lackluster on ambiance sounds
- I wish they'd used some of the voice lines from the league characters to give them more life and personality. I understand this may be something that Riot would not allow them to do.

[h2]GAMEPLAY[/h2]
The game is super chill, relaxing, and cute, but that does come at a price. Repetitiveness. Your days mostly consist of:
- Performing crafting, gathering, or ""event"" type actions until your EXP orbs are full
- Sleeping to consume the EXP orbs and unlock skills within the various skill trees (which typically unlock more crafting, gathering, or ""event"" type actions with some exceptions)
- Rinse & repeat

The crafting itself is not interactive. Check what items and ingredients you need for a quest, check which skills in your tree need to be unlocked to proceed with said crafting, grind experience as needed, craft your item (no mini games for crafting, only cooking, fishing & parties), complete your quest and move to the next one. I will say though, that it hasn't become boring to me yet and for some reason I enjoy the monotony - and, strangely enough, I got super into trying to be as efficient as possible when crafting higher level recipes. For example, you need auras to craft certain things. Sometimes, these only appear on specific maps and you'll need to go there to utilize the aura to craft. Other times, you'll need to craft an item to create the aura you need, in conjunction with a different aura. It's like doing simple quantum physics. OK, well, maybe not exactly like that, but you get my drift hopefully. You can also choose to expend you hard earned stars to acquire some of the materials you'll need, or a specific map might have crafting equipment you can utilize to be even MORE efficient!

I won't go into much detail for the parties, fishing, or cooking - they're simple, fun mini games that you've probably experienced in mobile games at one point. I was actually wondering if they were intending to port this to mobile.

[h2]WRITING[/h2]
Could have been better, but isn't terrible by any means and I truly love the knitting theme. The story mostly makes sense and is easy to follow along to. I feel like the target audience was far younger than I was expecting from a League of Legends based game (and from the creators of Grave Keeper). This threw me off a bit. The writing level goes anywhere from 7/8 year olds to early teens. Being 34 years old, this was a little unsettling at first, but kind of reminded me of Little Big Planet. Its been a wholesome, family friendly ride so far.

[h2]CONTROLS/UI[/h2]
- UI is pretty! But sometimes lacking in detail for player comprehension
- Quests containing linked out words to needed skills is very helpful
- Please... PLEASE give us some more options for utilizing the mouse AND keyboard instead of only the keyboard for much of the game. My left hand gets so tired, and sometimes I want to keep playing while taking a swig of a drink or eating a snack, but I can't, because you can only move & interact with WASD+E, but only click through dialogue with the mouse (that I know of). 
- Speaking of the dialogue... it seems to have no rhyme or reason. It seems to, by default, automatically proceed without the user having to left click; however, sometimes it just stops and never continues on to the next bit of text. There is also no option to TURN OFF auto-dialogue, so I can't like... turn my eyes away from the screen while talking to ANYONE because I'll miss text if I do.
- Give me some flipping way to sort my inventory. For a game with a  massive amount of ingredients and crafts, please give me bigger chests (maybe there are some later? Iunno, I'm 20 hours in right now) and a way to sort my inventory into chests and out of chests. This is a huge pain point for me. I've currently got like 10 chests, no idea what's in what, and I run around just trying to shift click everything in my inventory on every single chest to make some space because MY INVENTORY IS ALWAYS FULL AND I'M A HOARDER.",1709012532,1709012532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's just [i] so much waiting [/i] you do for crafting. You can sleep in game, but it's not much help, since there's just so much stuff to craft, and not a whole lot to do with it. For example, midway through the game, the game wants you to upgrade three different things just to progress through one objective. It does this several times, for the rest of the game. I thought at around the 20 hour mark they were going to finish the plot because of how bad it was getting, and look where we are now.

I'd probably be willing to put up with it, but this is just the entire game. Craft stuff, talk to NPC, NPC says craft more stuff. The cooking and party minigames are fun, but not when they're the only minigames, and you don't even do them that often compared to the rest of the game.

My feelings are overall mixed. Because there is a good game somewhere in this game. Maybe if I played this game at a more reasonable pace, being well aware that I had many hours to go rather then a few, I would have enjoyed. Maybe if the inventory system was more forgiving (or just better), I would have enjoyed it. Maybe if it followed the Stardew formula more rather then having a passing resemblance to it, things would have improved. Maybe once there's enough guides and Reddit posts for particular in-game problems, it'll be better. I do wonder: if Riot didn't kill Riot Forge, would this have been a better game?

First of all, if you are looking for cozy farming sim, there are multiple options (like Stardew Valley), unlike other games Bandle Tale like all of the games from Riot Forge is linear.

Honestly I see no point in customizable MC, when the story is gonna be the same regardless of what you want to do.
Other nitpicks:
Corki - not using updated design. I hate the fact the game sprites use Corki's old design from the times when he wasn't a yordle at all. That helmet sucks. And his copter is still hideous.
Other nitpicks: e-eggs questioning canon(existance of certain items in BC makes problems for the Runeterra's lore - no spoilers).

It starts off strong with a quirky story and cute characters, but it's slowed down with mechanics that are bogged down by too many factors. There's certain 'auras' you have to get to craft different items, many of which can either a) only be found on one island that you either have to teleport too (after throwing a party to get the material to do so each time) or b) walk there yourself.

It isn't clear how to get the 'artifact' for creating the auras yourself besides fishing in the 1 portal spots on each island and hoping for the best. The other reviews aren't wrong when they say that the XP system with diminishing returns doesn't work for this game. You have to constantly find different ways of doing reskins of the same grindy tasks (cooking food for yourself, picking up items, etc) and it's just not worth it. 

Even the cooking system is extremely fast paced and even if you quickly prepare the food, the yordle's wait timer will time out and they leave as soon as you reach them or accidentally throw it away. It's a mix-match of frenzied grindfest that isn't fun in the long run. After the first 2-3 hours I was pretty much over it and could't be bothered anymore.

To make matters worse, there's a cap of what you can place so it becomes a mini strategy game.

I have played this game for almost 24 hours since release and close to the end. It is [b]NOT[/b] a farming sim like stardew valley: it is all about collecting resources to craft things so you can collect more resources. If this is not a genre/game-play loop that you enjoy, then this game is likely not going to be for you. 

[b]TD;LR[/b] this is a very cozy crafting simulator. If you like laid back games with a specific game play loop then this is for you. If you don't like repetition and running around, then don't. The game is good, but it's a very specific genre/style. 

[b]If you are stuck on EXP:[/b] open up your quest menu and do quests. Go to the different islands and do the food stand and parties. This is your main source of gold & EXP. Don't rely on gathering and crafting alone.

[h3]Pros[/h3]
‎ ‎ ◉ The game runs pretty smoothly. There was a few stutters here or there but it didn't impact my experience. 
‎‎  ◉ The pixel art is very beautiful with creative and unique settings. It is very whimsical and fantastical. If you like cozy pixel games then I highly recommend this 
‎‎  ◉ The writing is pretty good with funny jokes and fun characters. I am a League player so I am familiar with the cast, but there is a lot of prominent ""original"" characters to Bandle Tale. I don't think you need to be familiar with the lore since the game explains the setting and plot well enough. 
‎‎  ◉ The quests are very enjoyable! Not too difficult but not too easy.
‎‎  ◉ The game-play loop: it is quite repetitive but I did enjoy the grind. You run around collecting the basic resources so you can craft items necessary for quests or to build new machines. There is a lot to unlock and find which I find enjoyable.
‎‎  ◉ Side-games: I am counting the food stand and the parties as the sort of ""side"" games that you play. You unlock new recipes, parties, and ""furniture"" for both through the skill-tree. They're both fun but I find the food stand more enjoyable as the food recipes get more complex. [b]This is your main source of money and exp[/b].

[h3]Cons[/h3]
‎‎  ◉ The tutorials: some of them aren't as clear as they should be
‎‎  ◉ UI: the readability for the skill tree can be rather confusing. Pair this with just the sheer size of how big it is, it's easy to get lost. I have been stumped 2-3 times because I had no idea what I had to do and there wasn't much clarification.
‎‎  ◉ Running Around: you will have to do this A LOT. I recommend just using the portals, you won't run out of thread easily but it can be tedious when you start running low on sources. 
‎‎  ◉ Item Recipes: it can be so easy to forget what you need to craft and what [i]those[/i] need to be crafted. It would be nice to have a recipe book for craftable items in the menu to remedy this. 
‎‎  ◉ Vending: it isn't really well explained and it takes much longer to generate money through it versus the food stand. It's better to just stick items into it to sell (be careful that they aren't necessary for quests/crafting) and check it periodically.",1708806478,1708806478,True,18,0,0.710580706596374512,0,True,False,False

Some of them complain about the diminishing rewards of the XP system, while curiously the XP system isn't be the main way to level up.
People who get stuck or complain about slow progress didn't figure out the core gameplay yet. The tutorial is barebones, so at some points you will need to stop and think about the mechanics the game offers to you. 
During my playthrough I had a lot of 'Aha' Moments while figuring out untold bits about how the mechanics and minigames work. If you don't mindlessly rush through the game it'll all come together naturally and smoothly. This contributes to the feeling of exploration while getting to know the yordle world.

This is first and foremost a story driven game but it keeps a good balance between story telling and a standard 'crafting game'-trope.
The colorful and cute art used to portray the yordle universe makes traveling very enjoyable. There are so many eye-candies. I very much enjoy the minigames, which are an essential part for making progress through the game. 

I can not recommend the Deluxe Edition unless you are a Poro connoisseur for life or feel a particular need to support the Publisher/Developer. 
Completed the game with all side tasks and quests in about 35 hours (posting this for someone else) while keeping a fast pace. I would buy it again.

There were some reviews here saying that you hit a wall of no progress after a specific point, but that was never the case for me. As long as you don't screw up the parties you throw, you get a bunch of skill XP to get what you need to progress.

I do think that making it so that locking teleportation without your backpack behind stabilizing all the portals is not a good design choice.

I love a cozy, cutesy pixel game and I also love LoL lore. I pre-ordered Bandle Tale because 1) Yordles 2) Adorable pixel art and 3) I've played Lazy Bear Games' Graveyard Keeper and the resource gathering, XP/Skill progression style and saving the town from problems scratches my itch. 
The skill tree style from GK transfers into Bandle Tale which was exciting for me because it gave me a good idea of what to look forward to in this game in terms of progression and game length (cost : gameplay and length - good).

Notes: 
- Good story, can be tedious at times with blabber but at 6.7 hours I've met Lulu, Corki, Veigar, Tristana, and I'm assuming Teemo eventually. There's some jokes sprinkled in that can keep you going as you learn about the different regions of Bandle City to keep you interested but most of the dialogue really highlights the quirkiness of our beloved yordles. There are mentions of Heimerdinger, Gnar, Poppy, and additional elements that include Gragas, Blitzcrank, and more. 

- Super cute pixel art and lots of stylistic customizations for your backpack home which I personally really enjoy switching up time to time (you do have to earn certain materials to unlock them). 

- You have your own Poro, they don't do much, but they're super cute sittin' in the corner of your house. You can pet and feed them, hell yeah. 
 
- Once hitting about 4 or 5 hours in, there is a noticeable decline in XP gathering from resources because your yordle essentially gets ""bored"" at doing the same task repetitively (understandable). It's not unbearable though. I'm expecting as you progress in the story and quests that the new introductions of tools and materials will make up for that, but you still need those base resources that won't give you XP anymore which might feel bad to some. 

- You have to do the quests to progress. There is a lack of freedom and you can get stuck on a quest if you used up skill points that aren't the skill that is required to progress in a quest, so I recommend always having some skill points banked in case you come across that barrier.

In all seriousness, this game starts out really cute. The art style is fun and whimsical, the characters cute, and the game-play feels very cozy and lighthearted. However, this starts to wear off. The story dialogue gets long and tedious, and I find myself just speed clicking to get through it. The crafting isn't entirely intuitive, and I have spent too much time in the menus trying to figure out where the heck the thing I need for the mission is. It feels like I have to unlock multiple things for each quest objective, and to unlock those things you need to sit and grind meaningless days. This was not the case in the beginning, where things felt much faster paced. But now at a bit over 5 hours and being maybe? close to done with the second island everything feels like a chore. Some items take a while to craft, and when you are crafting 5+ things to do everything it gets tiring. The game is starting to feel cluttered as the amount of workbenches needed keep going up, and I am running around to each one trying to find what I need. 

Overall, it is a very cute game with some subpar UI and too much grinding once you get past the beginning. I would still recommend it, but with the forewarning that it will get a bit tedious.",1708708587,1708708587,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Controls are really clunky, the mechanic that you can only hold one thing in your hands is obnoxious and much of the game doesn't get explained properly if at all, this issue is present right from the very very start of it. 
Just a small blurb with a one sentence explanation seems insufficient as an explanation and can't serve to let people know you're deviating from the standard controls for certain actions. Especially when the controls themselves don't get mentioned.

Also got basically stuck in a very early quest on my first playthrough and had to restart as I used most of my Firefly Bulbs for fuel while experimenting with food. After I used 1 of my firefly bulbs I went to buy something from the store, so I spent most of my stars (money) there.  Game then forced me to continue on with quests since it seems more of a story game than anything like a chill crafter with any degree of freedom.

As I continue with the quest I'm tasked with throwing a party, so I throw the first party but fail, because my 2nd Firefly bulb turns off midway through. 
So, we try again, I succesfully complete the party the 2nd go around, so I go to buy the button (goal of the quest). Turns out, the party doesn't give me enough money to be able to afford it, though I would've had enough if I hadn't spent my stars beforehand.

Now I have no more stars, no more firefly bulbs and no way to get new firefly bulbs, this in turn making it impossible to throw another party (dishes require to be cooked), which in turn makes it impossible to make any more money, since it's impossible to make money, it's now impossible for me to progress further into the game since I cannot afford the button which is needed to progress.

As far as i can tell, at the only maps you have access to at the point above, there's no way to collect more firefly bulbs.

Game is gorgeous and looks really cozy and friendly (though Yuumi looks like a nightmare of herself). Conversations are pretty cute but not very diverse.

Corki's plane goes down the first time you ride it, gotta wonder how he keeps it up in the Summoner's rift.

A little dissapointed when coming from the creators of Graveyard keeper combined with the larger than life lore of League of legends and the summoners rift. Especially as graveyard keeper was such an amazing addition to this genre.

would recommend this game at a 15eur price point, I think 25 is too much for the game as it stands.

This isn't what I was expecting. It's an rpg with crafting instead of combat, it is absolutely not a simulator. It's closer to the atelier series than it is to graveyard keeper or punch club. 

That would be fine if it weren't for the fact that the games story seems like it's made for a light weight simulation game. If it was sort of just 'there' existing as a reason for a simulation game to exist, it would be fine, but that's not the case. 

The story is front and center and that ends up putting it in a position that it doesn't feel designed to fulfill. It's not a bad story, but it's very airy and silly, and the dialog is not as witty as I expect from this developer. They're usually a lot better at dialog, and I wonder if maybe riot was making them dial back the sarcastic meta humor. 


The visuals are great, lazy bear has always had phenomenal pixel art, and the yordle setting is really fun. If you're playing the game strictly for the tristana, teemo, and league stuff I'm sure there's a lot to like. 


The game isn't very expensive but, as a fan of this developer and the source material, I honestly don't think it's worth the money unless you're super into yordles. 


All in all, it honestly seems like a big missed opportunity to give people a proper yordle life sim. Absolutely baffling that they didn't do this, especially when the developer is known for making simulators, and the colorful yordle setting would have been the perfect way to do that.

This is not a Stardew Valley clone. This game is much more akin to Wytchwood, with the gameplay loop being picking up quests, having to craft things or unlock new skills to craft things, and completing those tasks then unlocks more quests. It's an RPG, not a sandbox-lite farming simulator. It's sad people are leaving negative reviews here because they thought this was going to be like Stardew or Harvest Moon - take this as your warning that it isn't.

That being said, this is a really great game for what it /actually/ is. The graphics and music are both top-tier, I'm continually awed by how stunning the graphics are. The writing is witty and oozes charm, there are so many moments that have made me smile. I watched my friend play for about 10 hours so far and we've had so many good laughs over the things that have happened thus far.

I wouldn't say the game is grindy, at least not at the part we're at, but it does require paying attention to your resources. Resources don't fall into your lap; you need to go and gather them, which obviously takes time. If you play this game with the understanding that the genre is by nature quite slow and chill, you'll have a better time slowly working through all the tasks. If your goal is to finish the game in 20 hours, you're going to get impatient and burn out. 

For the negatives: the UI is poorly explained and the game desperately needs better tooltips, though it does feel nice to figure stuff out on your own. Playing with a controller feels good, but sometimes movement animations can feel sluggish. I have minor beef with the fact you can't mash A through dialogue because it'll end up repeating the same dialogue choice. That being said, these negatives do not outweigh the positives.

I'm saddened by the fact Riot Forge is closing - it really feels like they didn't market this game properly, as most of the ""cozy game"" fans I know didn't even know this game existed - but I'm glad they're going out with such a great final game.",1708642744,1708642744,True,13,0,0.674588322639465332,0,True,False,False

The game is very cute and chill, but there's no fun in a game that doesn't let you do whatever you want. There is no flexibility, shown by how you are forced to do multiple fetch quests in succession without doing anything actually fun. I was also under the heavy impression that this was going to be Stardew Valley-like, but boy was i wrong. I was bored immediately after everyone got sucked into the party portal and had no motivation to continue playing. The gameplay is really straightforward, which is not a good thing in this sense. I was not excited to keep going because there was no creativity or player decisions you could make on your own. On paper, the game seems really fun and cute, I'll say that!

I also really enjoy cozy farming games, and i was a huge fan of graveyard keeper. I had been looking forward to playing this game since ive learned of its development months ago. So its finally today, the day im gonna get to try out the league of legends universe's take on a cozy farming game. I start up the game and go to make my character...First my name...np....then ""pronouns""?!?!?!... gotta be shitting me man. how does this agenda make its way into my recreational time??
I legit sat in awe for the next two hours trying to decide if i should refund this game or give it a shot. Ive played alot of video games and i think this is the first one ive played that has a pronouns option during character selection. Extremely disappointing to see coming from a company i spend 75% or more of my casual time enjoying the games they have given me. Please dont push your agenda onto us. Please! The fans who are here to play this game could not care any less what your pronouns are, they would sooner call you braindead or worse. 
So i havent even played the game yet and i already have this awful taste in my mouth regretting the purchase at all...
Never once in the history of league of legends has anyone wondered what teemos pronouns are. Because we all fucking KNOW that teemo is a MAN! Never once have i ever looked at a yordle and considered that yordle to be a ""them""....
Its quite clear the gender of a yordle. Just as its quite clear the gender of a human.
I honestly wouldve much prefered had you taken out the option of gender all together. Theres legit no need for it. You could have just addressed my character as ""fucktard"" the whole time and i wouldve been perfectly happy with whatver bullshit riot wanted to sell me. But we have to take a stand somewhere, and i wont have my recreational time be littered with this delusional thought process that there are more than 2 genders. please save that shit for you internet comments. I really really hope not to see this become ""the normal"" in gaming. 

I will play this game tho and probably enjoy it. but this it the first time ive ever left a steam review and i just hope the people at riot will see this. because if it comes to league of legends i dont think the community will be able to survive it, and you will ruin another game thats an easy A, just so you can try to convince us there are more than 2 genders.

Also lazy bear, after playing graveyard keeper for 100+ hrs... i really really expected better from you..
without even playing it, i probably wouldve given this game a positive review just so i could see riot and the league of legends universe come to life more. But im gonna have to give it a negative review, in hopes that the future of gaming can still be preserved. Has nobody learned from the other ""woke"" companys that human beings are not interested in this type of content. We are fully aware of the 2 possible genders and the crusade to to promote mental instability. We see it all the time.
WE JUST DONT WANT TO SEE IT WHILE WE ARE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
There was just no need for it, other than to make a point that pronouns are necessary (your opinion)

Fucktard is the best yordle in the entire world
Fucktard saved the day again.
Fucktard is the hero of bandle city.
Fucktard bakes the best cakes.

The art style is beautiful, and the world is colourful, carefully-constructed, and interesting to explore. Beyond that, though, the game feels a bit soulless. It's like they had a solid vision for the aesthetics and story, but didn't really put the same amount of planning into the actual gameplay.

Gathering is holding a button, and then waiting for it to respawn. Crafting is choosing your wanted item and then holding a button down, or waiting for it to finish. Most quests are craft and/or fetch quests.

Beyond the cute aesthetics, decent sound design, and nods to other titles in the ""LoL Universe,"" I don't think this title has much lasting power, as is, and little to no replay value.

⭬ Unlocking new crafting recipes with ""Emotion"" is the main reason that makes the game grindy, making it difficult to rush.
 
⭬  As a League player, it's been quite interesting to learn more about the yordles and confirm the rumors (?) that existed, like Rumble having a crush on Tristana. 😳

⭬  About the soundtrack: I'm not sure if I wasn't paying attention or if it really isn't memorable, so I'll try to listen more carefully in the future!

!!Don't expect Stardew Valley. you dont have the free will to not to quest if you don't want to, you have to do the quests and its not replayable after you finish the game, unless you wanna just experience the entire story again ( i dont judge, you do you.)

This is how the game is 
it's like this (without spoilers)
-A quest needs materials 
-you run around to gather them (get ""XP"")
-craft them (get ""XP"")
-give it to them
-you level up
-you use your (""XP"" points to  buy level up )
-you are now leveled up, you have access to more materials to craft
and it starts all over again

Your mission is to help the Yordles in anyway you can thats it, thats the basics.

You do not need to know league of legend bandle city lore, but to be honest it does help me enjoy the game wayyy more.

Example:
-There are jokes/mentions of other yordles that are not in here example: Gnar is mentioned as a joke, i found the joke funny because I knew about gnar. 
-The personality of the Yordles who are present in League of legends, I know the way they act so it feels more personal when I read their dialog and I understand them more.
-You'll get material that belongs to the Yordles who are not mentioned here like an item that belongs to Hemindinger or Themed decor that belong to amumu, poppy, gnar etc

Play this game is you love 
-endlessly crafting and gathering.
-veigar!
- yordle foods
-yordle parties 
-having your small house where you can do your crafts and more
-veigar!
-adorable cute graphics you can look at forever,
- learn about the yordle world and embrace the story,
- be a cute yordle who helps other yordles,
-have a great humble sense of humor!, 
-veigar!

It's cute, it's chill, it's calm, and yet, it's a lot of waiting, a lot of material grind, a lot of dialogue that makes no sense, a lot of mediocre writing and a lot of waiting.
There are a lot of good and interesting mechanics and ideas. A lot of enjoyable gameplay and a lot of fun to be had if that's your type of casual saturday game, but it ain't for me, and probably ain't some other players expecting a bit more farming related gameplay rather than ""be an errand boy"" story based experience. 
It's a fun idea, overall 7/10 game if I had to give it a score, but generaly my opinion it's suffering from too slow progression, way too much dialogue, forced mobile game style tutorial (...now press here... and here... and there... there, you made something!) and way too much reliance on pre-established lore (for context, i quit LoL almost a decade ago, I don't care about half the characters and their very shallow single-threaded personalities as portrayed in this game)...
