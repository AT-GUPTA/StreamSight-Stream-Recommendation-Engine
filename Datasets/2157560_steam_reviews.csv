This is the first non-platform fighter I've played that I can actually understand.  Button layout is intuitively mapped to controller (pad) and does [b]wonders[/b] to facilitate a natural learning process.  

[h2] Inputs are simplified and nearly UNIVERSAL across the entire cast [/h2]
If you know the basic controls for one character, you can pick up and play [i] literally any of them.[/i]  No need to spend an hour in training mode learning a command list for moves you'll immediately forget once an opponent starts hitting you.

[h3] Rollback Netcode + Fun Lobby System + Functional Matchmaking 
= Actually FUN Online Experience [/h3]
Even for a newbie like me.  You gradually earn rewards for any character you play just by playing them online or offline.  Daily Missions encourage you to engage with the game's mechanics, are simple to complete, and easily doable in a few minutes.  The game is designed to encourage and reward you for short but consistent practice sessions, which is the best way to learn any new skill.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
If you've ever struggled to make the jump from platform fighters to traditional / anime fighters, this is your game.  
Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising is:
-Free to try
-Fairly priced if you like it
-Filled with beautiful characters
-Simple to pick up
-Fun to play
-Rewarding to learn

If you've always wanted to get into fighting games, this one is great to start with. If you need a new anime fighter, this one has the bases covered.

The most essential mechanic to GBVSR, in my opinion, are Bravery Points. Used defensively, they can get you out of a bad situation and thus make pressure more manageable. Used offensively, they're easy combo extenders for those still coming to grips with timing and execution. While there are pitfalls to these systems, they make both getting into the game and getting into the character much easier as you need less understanding of specific interactions (I.E knowing which moves are negative on block)

Netcode is, as usual for arcsys, pretty solid. I have no trouble finding people with good, wired connections at most hours of the day.

The cast is large, with good coverage of archetypes and aesthetics. Like the edgelords? You're covered. Like cute? Got it in spades. Big gorilla? He even wears a fundoshi. Something more technical? Eustace, Narmaya, and Avatar Belial all have you covered. Picking up a character doesn't take too much effort, so even if you're new and want to learn a tougher character doing so doesn't take 20 hours of training mode. 

Balance feels, to me, better than people give it credit for. Very few characters seem to be truly bottom tier. I haven't personally seen many of the characters people complain about (Seox, Nier, Zeta). Take this with a grain of salt, I'm only A rank and they may be much more popular nearing S++/master ranks. Pick whatever character you want, almost all of them can function in the current meta without having to severely outplay their opponent.

Monetization is SHOCKINGLY GOOD. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's really well done. There's a cosmetic gacha, but you can't spend real money for it to the best of my knowledge. You can buy characters on the free version using currency acquired in game (granted they're expensive, you'll be grinding a while). The one drawback is the character pass is severely overpriced, heavily incentivizing shelling out for the deluxe edition which is not going to be worth it for everyone.

The community is phenomenal. I've encountered maybe 1 toxic player in around 250 matches. They'll help you learn a matchup, they'll support you, they'll make for good friends. It's always heartwarming to see how overall good natured the FGC remains. 

One last thing, the game understands that people need to cool off sometimes, and gives you a number of options for just chilling out for a minute. Claw machine to get cosmetics, jump puzzles in a lobby, granbruise, just chilling at chatting. It's a pretty laid back atmosphere.

I'd highly recommend it. 2B coming out seems to have brought up the player count quite a bit. It's a great time to hop in and learn.",1708492433,1708493040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unreleated to the game itself, as this is an issue with the Deck/Linux compatibility layer,  it works very well on Linux, only thing that need works are the video clips not working  on various parts of the game, which unfortunately cuts you out of some content in story mode and in training, but I have no other grievances really. I hope a future version of Proton will fix this only issue.

Update 20 February 2024 
Now the videos issue with story mode and training videos is fixed on Linux (and Deck I presume)! No more need of waiting for alternative/external versions of Proton, videos just work out of the box!

To all the Australian People who are looking at this game literally stop.

Most your fights are 300+ ping and with a rollback of 5 or higher.
Really wish the devs would include us in any way. Accept having a Asia server (200-300ping) Or the japan server (400-500ping)

And if you think you can VPN the game i have some bad news you can't.
Save your 80 bucks, if you want to test the waters try out the free Version.

But yeah til they add some form of Australia servers look elsewhere like tekkan or something.

And to the devs if you read this comment (which i doubt)
Give us maybe some love since some of us love the series and playing Relink as well.
the world is forever expanding in games and your excuses of lack of serves for a 80 dollar game (i wont include the DLC it may trigger players) is disgusting.

Follow suit in other games and maybe you might get somewhere.

I had a very underwhelming experience with the first Granblue Fantasy Versus, however, I am really liking this one. From the current generation of fighting games, it is my favorite one, even compared with the amazing Street Fighter 6.
I do not understand exactly why I like this game so much after a bad experience with the first one. It just feels good to play. Moving speed could be a little faster, though.

As for content, I think it could have done better single player modes. It is certainly falling behind the likes of SF6 and Tekken 8.",1708336444,1708336444,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I like the graphics and art design. I like the sound effects and music. I like the net code. I like most of the characters.

But, as a casual, the real reason I love this game is the story mode. The story mode is carried over from the original Granblue Fantasy Versus, but they added additional content. The story mode has actual unique bosses not from the roster with attack patterns that provide a decent challenge. It is the most unique story mode in a fighting game I have seen and I love it. I also really love that they took out most of the RPG mechanics from Granblue Fantasy Versus. You no longer have to worry about equipping and upgrading weapons or leveling your character. Instead you just have fixed stats for each mission. This is better because it means the developers could balance the missions better properly as opposed to you being potentially under or over leveled/geared.

HOWEVER... the biggest issue with this game is that they removed cooperative play in the story mode. The original Granblue Fantasy Versus had both online and local cooperative play in story mode, but Rising has neither. I could understand their desire to take out online coop, since they fundamentally changed how the net code works, but they should not have removed local coop. I doubt they will, but I wish they would add local coop back into the game. :(

Another negative is that the Grand Bruise mode can have extremely long queue times. I have spent well over 10 minutes in the queue multiples times only to cancel the queue and just play a different game. This is unfortunate because I like the game mode, but yeah if I can't play it... I can't play it... and that sucks. Don't buy this game strictly for Grand Bruise.

Besides those two major negatives, Gran Blue Fantasy Versus Rising is a great game, and if you are a casual  who wants your fighting games to have good single player content, then Gran Blue Fantasy Versus Rising is currently one of your best options.",1708302314,1708302314,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game being designed and balanced around Simple Inputs (no motion inputs required) has helped me get my foot in the door, play a bunch of ranked games and have a blast. I now better understand the appeal of fighting games and can process what is happening in other games much more easily.

There's a lot of other things that are unique and charming about Granblue as well (like there's a large amount of zoners (like 7 or 8? idk) to choose from, and the mechanics of the game ensure they're not oppressive or universally hated, AND these zoners have interesting options for aggression of their own!). Also the art is gorgeous.

Although I'm well aware that $70 is now the standard price for modern games, niche anime fighting games rarely match this standard. Guilty Gear Strive is only $40, and one of if not the best anime fighters on the market (at least in my opinion,) so the fact that this game costs 10 extra dollars plus the outrageous cost of DLC is kind of unreasonable. 

The only DLC pass at the moment, ""Character Pass 1"" is $30, the exact same price of buying each DLC character separately. Almost every single fighting game I've ever seen gives some sort of discount for buying a pass instead of each character individually. 

Aside from pricing though, the other main issue with the game is that it is remarkably unbalanced. There are a fair bit of characters that are borderline unusable, and others that are so broken they have almost zero counterplay.

Granblue Fantasy Versus and Rising are back-to-basics, simplified approaches to fighting games. However, Rising swings the pendulum way back to the ‚Äòanime‚Äô type, mostly by introducing some new mechanics (staggeringly powerful Ultimate Skills and Raging Strike, which along with some tweaks to the combo system enables much higher average damage). Most of these are genuine good fun ‚Äî while some characters‚Äô Ultimate Skills feel horrifyingly strong (Zeta‚Äôs beam and dive haunt my nightmares) the majority are a good trade-off between meter and utility.

When it all comes together, Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is a blast. The gorgeous visuals, fantastic music and sound and the faster and more frenetic pace of the game really work. The changes to the formula will depend on your specific taste, but the mastery of the audiovisual experience (provided you like anime stuff) can‚Äôt be denied. With a variety of content and a smooth experience whether playing offline, online, with friends or without, I‚Äôd heartily recommend Rising to just about anyone. Interestingly, this new iteration of GBVS even includes a free version ‚Äî so if you‚Äôd rather just see it for yourself you can skip the rest of this and go play that.

While it may not necessarily tickle your funny bone, it's a title that deserves serious attention for its depth and quality.

The character roster is a testament to the developers' commitment to diversity and detail. Each character feels unique, with distinct playstyles and backstories that add layers to the game's world. Whether you prefer a nimble rogue or a mighty sorcerer, there's a character for every taste. The visuals are equally impressive, with stunning animations and meticulously crafted environments that immerse you in the Grandblue Fantasy universe.

Combat in Grandblue Fantasy Rising Versus is where the game truly shines. It's a strategic dance of combos, counters, and special moves that demands skill and precision. The learning curve can be steep, but the rewards are substantial for those willing to put in the effort. It's a game that rewards mastery and keeps you coming back for more, as you discover new techniques and strategies to outmaneuver your opponents.

The story mode, while not groundbreaking, is a solid narrative experience that fleshes out the game's characters and lore. It provides a substantial single-player campaign that offers a glimpse into the rich world of Grandblue Fantasy.

The game is free to play but if you want to support the game and also enjoy everything the game has to offer, purchase the full game. 

Free version is great for any player. You can stick with the main character Gran or you can cycle through different characters through the weekly rotation. They are pretty random and aren't like other F2P games where rotations are scheduled characters. You get access to Grand Bruise Legends which is an amazing mini-game where you control cute ""chibi"" versions of the characters and participate in different obstacle courses. 
With Arksys games, they always have this lobby system where you control an avatar but not much comes out of it. You had a fishing mini-game in Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator 2 but that's not too compelling. To actually have a giant lobby and little actions you can perform with your avatar, is something quite desirable.

The main fighting game itself is packed with mechanics that are great for casual and hardcore fighting game fans alike. The game itself has top-notch visuals and the artwork is stunning.

Highly recommend the game for anybody even slightly interested. As stated, there is a free version!

Though there are a few a bit overpowered characters (such as Nier and Seox), the overall balance of the game is mostly fine. 

Also if you're a fan of Nier Automata, we'll be getting 2B as a playable character 20th of February. (Though you'll need to own the full version of the game and buy her separately).

Overall I'll give the game a solid 9/10 just because I've enjoyed it so much. And the -1 comes mostly from the overpowered characters.",1706968392,1706968392,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Justo como Cagliostro. Si te cansas de buscar la forma de pillar a tu oponente, puedes descansar jugando el Fall Guys que trae incorporado, o conversar un rato en el chat m√°s otaku y demente que he visto alguna vez.

Los controles simples son la base del dise√±o original, pero si no logras sacudirte la caspa de anciano old school igual puedes jugar con controles tradicionales. La interfaz original podr√≠a ser un poco m√°s reducida en mi opini√≥n, pero te acostumbras muy r√°pido y es sumamente c√≥moda, y muy r√°pida.

Los combates son r√°pidos, tensos y espectaculares, f√°ciles de entender pero dif√≠ciles de ganar: ser r√°pido y habil no es suficiente, tambi√©n necesitas ser capaz de leer las intenciones de tu oponente y administrar inteligentemente tus poderes y puntos de osad√≠a.

Los personajes son vibrantes y con much√≠sima personalidad, y sus motivaciones e intereses se integran plenamente en el lore del mundo, bastante cliche, pero a√∫n as√≠ muy interesante de explorar.

Y si a√∫n tienes dudas, puedes jugar el juego gratis todo el rato que quieras, ya sea con el prota Gran, que es un shoto muy, muy competente, o con cualquiera de los tres personajes disponibles en la rotaci√≥n semanal.

Incluye battle pass perfectamente alcanzables con m√∫ltiples premios y un traje bien hecho como trofeo final, por un precio much√≠simo m√°s razonable que la barbaridad que cobran SF6 o MK1,

Absolutamente recomendado, compite codo a codo contra SF6 y GGStrive, y le gana f√°cilmente al MK1.",1706918419,1706918419,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Accessible but deep combat system with each character having unique twists to their style of play, a wealth of single player content, and a very fleshed out crossplay multiplayer system means there's something here for just about anyone and the multiplayer component should survive a long time with a decent sized community.

The characters and world are all so cool, with a unique blend of fantasy, old world, and sci-fi. The animation/graphics are absolutely gorgeous - capturing the anime style almost perfectly, but with real-time 3D using Unreal Engine instead of sprite work. The game is well optimized too, even on my ROG Ally I get 60fps locked solid at max settings 1080p in 15w mode. Soundtrack has some great songs, combat sounds are punchy and satisfying, and the English VA is all pretty good. However the characters mouth movements are not re-synced with the English voices, which is annoying and becoming increasingly inexcusable even for Japanese focused games; especially since this isn't sprite art or anything, I can't imagine it would have taken that many resources given this is Unreal Engine which is built to make these sorts of routine aspects of the game easier to develop. For such a detailed and feature rich game it just seems a dumb thing to not do.

But that that is my biggest complaint says a lot. My only other minor complaints are a lack of ultrawide support (the game has scrolling arenas that would display pretty much perfectly in full at 3440x1440, COME ON!), and the relatively steep price tag if you want to go all in.

It has fun gameplay, optional easy inputs, a big roster with all kinds of characters, fantastic art and even a global 'guestbook' where you can be horny for your favourite boy/girl as long as you can outsmart the wordfilter. Or ask for game advice (???). Other reviews go deeper into the pros. 
Same with the cons: regional pricing, no servers for certain regions, a battlepass (wtf?).

I guess my favourite thing about GBVS/R is just how much love was put into it, as cheesy as it may sound. The animations, the unique intros and sometimes even battle voicelines for each pair of characters, the stages ‚Äî it all really shines through and I've never even played GBF!

This is every character.

On defense, you don't have many options. You can block or you can block cancel.

In summary, the offense is linear, the defense is almost uninteractive, and every match looks the same.

The good news is if you're on offense, you get to feel cool by doing very simple inputs. And the good news for defense is that if you're hit during the one or two interactions that take place during a round, you can set the controller down and have a drink.

Battlepass is especially grimey for a full price game with a premium package and season pass already (which doesn't include all the colors either).

when i get to play it. the servers are just stunningly bad. there have been multiple patches that bricked the servers almost entirely for days at a time, and there is no info on your opponents connection leading often to very laggy games. again, that's IF you find a game, i have spend full half hours between games mashing through error codes. it's super frustrating. this is particularly bad in the lobby, so if you are like myself and enjoy the social side of fighting games, there have been days in which the game is utterly unplayable. i would hope this would probably be fixed at some point, but given how long it took to make strive's lobby even just serviceable, i doubt it will be graceful, so buyer beware.

otherwise an amazing fighting game. a wonderful mixture of unga bunga vs poke threats, the system mechanics are very impactful while also being very understandable, i have constantly felt a distinct sense of learning and improvement throughout playing as someone who never played the original and come from melee and more wacky anime fighters. 9/10 when u can play it. keyword unfortunately being when.",1706317381,1706317381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are several key issues with the game, with lobby servers going down every 30 minutes, to online services being broken entirely at times. Not to mention online is riddled with rage quitters and cheaters, due to the fact that ArcSys has not implemented any form of punishment for this sort of behavior. On top of this, there are some issues with balancing. This is not an issue of its own, but the devs have stated they want to be more laid back with balance patches, meaning we can expect genuine balance patches once every 6 months for characters that are overtuned, which is also somewhat disastrous to the offline scene. We've already been through some updates, none of which addressed the core issues of the game and it's looking like they will also take their sweet time for crucial fixes.

That is my opinion formed after having played various fighting games over decades at this point.  Why do I love this so much?  Its gameplay is deep and satisfying, yet easy to get into.  Also, it has characters and an aesthetic that really appeal to me.  And on top of that, it has the long sought-after ""Rollback"" and ""Crossplay"" features for online competition.  As great as the first GBVS was (I own it and love it), we now have an even more polished experience.

Fighting game newcomers and veterans alike will enjoy what this game has to offer.  For newcomers and others like myself who would prefer to pull off special moves with a special button rather than with motion inputs, you can easily perform any special or even super (Skybound Art) move.  However, unlike Street Fighter 6 (which is also a very nice game), you don't have to choose between Modern and Classic controls.  You can use either variant at any time during a match.  And aside from dealing slightly less damage from neutral, the simple controls yield the same results as the motion controls.  In SF6, some things feel limited in Modern mode, and on the other hand, it can be extremely easy to do a combo into a super just by mashing.  GBVSR doesn't remove technical complexity if you use simple inputs.  Rather, you can do exactly the same things no matter which input method you use, and you can choose how you'd like to input a move at any time, on the fly.  It is also worth noting that another benefit to simple inputs is that you can immediately take up a new character without even having to look at their move list.  Rather than seeing, ""Oh, this one doesn't have any quarter-circle-forward and punch special.  Instead, it's charge-based...  And that other character has 360 motions.  And their super moves are really different to pull off as well"", you will know that the special button does a move, and pressing forward, down, or backward and the special button does the other moves.  And all Skybound Arts and Super Skybound Arts and Brave Counters and many other things can be pulled off in the same exact manner no matter the character.  This is not boring, due to each character's moves being quite varied.  Rather, it gets one's foot in the door with regards to understanding all characters.  After all, I feel that the main challenge should be in utilizing a character's moveset effectively rather than memorizing the differences between how to actually pull off different characters'  various moves.

Veterans should not worry at all, as they can be creative with combos due to many options available to link moves, including new Raging Strikes, which can function as combo-extenders.  And although the combo system is rich, and combos can do real damage, this game is more based on ""footsies"" than extremely long combos.  In this way, it's somewhat more like Street Fighter than some other games where the combos go on and on to the point of provoking boredom and frustration for the ones caught in them (and possibly even for the ones doing them).

Regarding the aesthetic, if you like anime at all, you'll love the way this looks.  Arc System Works never disappoints, but the GBVS series is their best work yet, with a game that truly looks and sounds like you are playing an anime, both in its characters and environments.  On the other hand, SF6 has somewhat realistic characters, but to me, they look ""waxy"" and somewhat grotesque.  That may be a byproduct of the RE Engine, but to me, they look like they could be in a Resident Evil game if somewhat toned down.  So I have to give the nod to GBVS in the aesthetics department.  As for the characters, they are extremely varied, and you are sure to find one or more that you not only love the look of but that you love playing.

Finally, I should mention extras, like the fact that costume colors can be unlocked simply by playing the game (online, at least...I'm not sure about offline), and there are various other things like pieces of artwork and even a diorama maker that allows you to create your own scenes.  Then, there is a story mode, which is kind of like a simple 2D RPG, and on top of that, there is a mini-game called ""Grand Bruise Legends!"" that people say is like ""Fall Guys"" (although I haven't played ""Fall Guys"").  Partially due to the fact that this is an extension of the first GBVS, there is a ton of content, and lots to unlock without paying.  And speaking of not paying, there is a free version with Gran and three other rotating characters.  You can get it if you are really not sure about buying the game, but if you like it, please buy this game to support the developers (and open up a lot more for yourself in the process)!

There is not much to not like about this game.  One thing some people have been complaining about is that you can't currently rank down below A Rank.  So if you barely make it from B to A, you're in A unless the developers decide to change the system and allow you to go back down to B.  This can be an issue if you are truly B-ranked and just got on a bit of a lucky streak to get into A.  On the other hand, each character is ranked separately (up to two letter ranks below your highest-ranked character) and there is also a ""random"" character ""Lunalu"" whom you can use to play your main character one more at lower ranks by choosing only your main character as a choice among the ""random"" selection.  And of course, you can play casual matches that depend less on your rank than the ranked matches.

No matter if you are a fighting game fanatic or someone who is looking for a comfortable introduction to fighting games, this game fits the bill!  Check it out!  You'll be glad you did!",1706070370,1706070370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I tried, I really really tried to like this game, but I just can't. Technically, the PC port has problems on keyboard which make it headache inducing to navigate menus thanks to using a terrible control mapping, not allowing remapping, however showing tooltips relating to the in-battle remappable controls instead of what the actual correct button to use is. And despite rollback playing awfully thanks to how fast startups are in this game, there's no way to ensure matches are playable. The game has no ping-based matchmaking or even a way to see ping before matches so 50%+ of matches don't even run at full speed and there's so many rollback frames it's common to rollback to being unreactably grabbed or hit. There is 'same region only' matchmaking, however there is no Oceanic region (or south american for that matter) despite the game being peer to peer anyway.

Subjectively, there's a lot about the design that I find somewhat baffling, but I can chalk a lot of it up to me being unfamiliar with 2D fighters, as more of a 3D fighter player. 2D fighter players will probably enjoy this if they live in a region that can get consistent matches with good connections. Otherwise, it's a very good game if you enjoy being rolled back from successfully jabbing your opponent to being grabbed by them (despite the fact that a jab input breaks throws in this game). Or rolled back from hitting your opponent who was running in to suddenly being hit by an overhead. Or seeing them teleport from running to already nearly at the peak of their jump in general. Also very fun when you get rolled back so far into a grab that it doesn't even have the particle effect for getting grabbed (normal grabs have a white flash for the first dozen or so frames to make it easy to see and input a throw break). Such is the experience when matches are 200-400 ping and 5-9 rollback frames, in a game where jabs and throws (for some reason) are ~7 frame startup.

Oh and despite it supposedly being fixed, the public lobbies still run at 30fps. I assume this will be *actually* fixed soon, but that's a thing too.",1702890311,1705994908,False,1,1,0.437008917331695557,0,True,False,False

Screw every developer who releases a broken game packed to the gills with microtransactions and DLC on day one.

A seriously fantastic fighting game.
As someone who has always struggled to ""get"" fighting games, I always spent more money than time in my pursuit of one that would work for me.
FighterZ, Tekken 7, Street Fighter 2, Skullgirls, Guilty Gear Strive, Kill La Kill If... None of them did it for me.
As much as I loved the style and idea of fighting games not a single one I tried managed to hook me... Until Granblue.
I picked it up on a whim a couple years ago when it was on sale, as one of the artists I follow had expressed his love for the universe, it's story, and it's characters, that was good enough for me.
I honestly had a great time, the characters were likeable, the music was fantastic ( a vital component for my enjoyment of a game ), and the artstyle was unique amongst the games I'd played before.
Unfortunately, my internet isn't the best, that with the apparent lack of rollback meant that trying to develop any sort of skill was frustrating to say the least.
Then as I was bashing my head against this wall, they went and announced the psudo-sequel GBFVs: Rising and I decided that I'd hold off on trying to get really into the game until then, no sense getting into a game which would soon be completely replaced, even so, I managed to put about 17 hours or so into the first one almost entirely in training and arcade, not a large amount, but far more than I'd ever put into any fighting game before.
I saved up pennies all year so my purchase of yet another fighting game ( that I wasn't going to play ) wouldn't hurt my wallet quite so much, then the game released.

HOOOOO BOY!

Even as someone who barely scratched the surface of the previous game's depth I can easily see just how much they improved upon the gameplay and features of the previous one.
To start, on top of the new characters added to the roster, every single DLC character from the previous game is unlocked right from the get-go, just the characters are valued over $65... But wait, there's more.
Character colors (beyond the basic set) and weapons that used to be locked behind a paywall are now unlockable completely for free simply by playing the game, seriously, just play the game, even losing matches will typically net you a level for your character and the progression system is chock full of credits and those aforementioned colors and weapons, meaning that while I'm decking out my Smol harvin paladin Charlotta in style I'm also gathering enough credits to buy some neat stuff for another character.
A word of advice, unless you're impatient, only spend your credits on the few outfits that can't be unlocked in your characters progression tree, it'll save you later on.
Oh, and while I'm talking about spending credits to unlock cool stuff....
YOU CAN BUY THE DLC WITH IN GAME CURRENCY.
READ THAT AGAIN.
In the year of our Lord 2023-24 you can straight up earn the newest DLC or deluxe edition upgrades completely in-game.
What the actual heck are they thinking?!?
How did that make it past the dark council that is set on destroying gaming?
Sure, they charge a steep 22000 credits to buy the Deluxe upgrade or character DLC, but even after foolishly blowing the entire stock of credits they gave me on half of Cagliostro's outfits (before I realized I could have just earned them) and dumping everything else into the claw machine I still managed to earn almost 5000 with only a week or two of light play, and that's with me only playing two or three characters, if you really wanted to build up your credit bank you could play every character up to a few levels and make that in a day.
This practice needs to be encouraged and supported.
I was on the fence about GBF:Relink, but I'm putting my money where my mouth is and supporting a developer who I feel I can trust not to swipe my wallet and stab my cat the moment I stop watching them like a hawk.
To get back on track, they have the expected arcade, local versus, story ( which has been overhauled and expanded ), and Online, the online has multiple ways to engage with it, either queue up for random matchmaking or hop into a lobby for a whole different experience, where you run around as cute chibi versions of the characters and play a concerningly addictive claw machine game or hop onto little arcade machines to duke it out against the player sitting across from you.
They added a whole fall guys side mode into the game, accessible from either the main menu or the lobby, where you use your lobby avatars to do the fall guys thing, it's not quite as robust as the actual fall guys, but it has it's own progression reward system, and for a side mode in a fighting game it is a fantastic way to shake things up after a session of normal fighting gameplay.

Finally, they recently added in the battle pass, and I'd first like to dollop more praise on them for waiting until they had released the game and made sure it functioned before pushing the battle pass onto us, the next spoonful to dollop on is for the actual battle pass itself, it's not crazy long, only about 60 or so levels, and if you don't manage to complete it before the next one no sweat, you can rollback what battle pass you collect XP for so you don't have to worry about missing out on all the cool stuff if you take a break ( Glares at Splatoon 3 ), which is yet another game choice that must be lauded and shown off to every other game developer.

Oh, and they have a figure photo mode, where you can collect digital figures of all your favorite characters and display them, creating portraits and scenes for you to screenshot and....... I honestly don't know what I'm going to do with all the pictures I've taken... But it's there!

If it hasn't been made obvious, the game is well worth the money, chock full of charm and style, bursting with enough varied gameplay to keep you entertained (for at the very least 28 hours).
These developers deserve your support, the only way we'll ever get good games that don't actively want to screw us is if we put our cash on the line and support games like this one.

Suffice it to say, I have finally found a fighting game to call my own...

You very quickly will get to the knowledge check of gaps in pressure in this game, that can be a turn off because so many moves feel like there is no way they should be plus after using that huge move but press a button after that and there goes 50% of your HP lol.

All fighting games have complaints, I feel like this one does so many good things just outside of the game (free to play mode with rotating characters, skins*, rollback, crossplay) I hope it sticks around long enough to keep its playerbase unlike the first version of the game.

*Weapon skins are awesome and all unlockable just by playing a character, including a secret one for really grinding a character out. Character skins are slowly being released, but are definitely in the game and just look at SF5 for how good skins were for a playerbase.

+ Huge and diverse character cast (28 characters in base game)

+ Free version with Gran and rotating cast of 3 characters 
+ Rollback netcode (for better online connectivity)
+ Simple controls
+ Good music
+ Anime aesthetic
+ Great tools to practice and improve
+ Lighthearted and positive character interactions
+ Low toxicity community (dunno if this is an FGC thing or Granblue thing)
+ Replayable
+ Easy to play with limited time (ex: 15 minutes for three matches?)
+ The ridiculously stupid and funny Fall Guys gamemode
+ Good progression via ""claw machine"" cosmetics (also available to get specifics via rupie shop) and character leveling for leveling-specific cosmetics. It's very apparent you are not intended to collect everything in the game.

- No derank between letterings (A5 can't go to B1). Minor caveat for me so far since lobby and casual modes do exist.
- [b]Cosmetic-only[/b] FOMO with paid battle pass path ($9CAD per 40 days cycle?). 

The partner ""chibi"" system has always been encouraging to have on a win, loss or greeting you to the game, I recommend Vaseraga; if you prefer someone horny, Belial; or, a character ambiguously gaslighting or encouraging you, Nier.

Right now I'm playing as Cagliostro (B2) and Grimnir (C4): Cagliostro has a highly-egoistical nature with cute affront, she has tools for zoning and good normals; while Grimnir has a very dramatic poise to him with unique dashy-floaty movements and planned setplay. 

As a fighting beginner, Arc Systems does a good job implementing ways for people to improve. They provide a good training mode to setup a training dummy to do blocking, jumping, actions after k.o., i.e. There's character guides, a starting combo guide, mechanics guide in there.

Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising is, at its core, just worse Street Fighter. You play an *exciting* game of footsies until someone hits a 66L, then said player gets a combo of unreasonable value from a light (probably counter hit) starter featuring insane meter build, corner carry, around 35-45% damage and oki. The meaty gets blocked? No problem as this game features exactly one (1) defensive mechanic that can be used 3* times (*assuming you want to die to guard crush which is countered by said defensive mechanic and leads to what feels like unscaled damage) and if your opponent doesn't have a DP, hey fuck it just keep cycling through buttons and EX specials. Don't forget to tick throw every now and then for free damage! Oh, your opponent teched the throw? Theres a good chance they late teched which means they're back in -frames and you can go for another exciting hit/throw mixup!

But hey, what if all this is too hard for you? Well, try the new and innovative character Nier! For the low price of your human decency you can play a character designed to be piloted by infants! All the pressure of a character like Carl Clover without that pesky player skill requirement. Don't like Nier? Well try any of the other top tier offerings! Zeta or Six are just as or even more powerful than Nier but unfortunately require at least 50% more effort to reach master rank with.

What a great time for fighting games we are living in right now: Street Fighter 6 is amazing and still has a sizeable following (even though updates have been slow), Guilty Gear Strive is still getting cool new characters and while MK1 was quite disappointing to me, Tekken 8 is on the horizon and looking really good so far.
But the surprise hit was definitely this game: Very big and varied roster (as it is an upgraded version of the original GBVS), gorgeous visuals, snappy controls and an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù input system that actually integrates very well and does not feel as divisive as SF6‚Äôs ‚ÄúModern‚Äù controls. A free-to-play version with a limited, rotating character pool that still allows for complete online play also lowers the barrier of entry by a huge margin.

While it might feel like there are a lot of mechanics at first, after only 2 or 3 matches, you will quickly figure out, what is important in which situation, and that in actual practice, the mental stack is not that high.
Online matchmaking is fast, and there is a lobby system in addition to classic matchmaking, depending on what you are looking for. Crossplay between the PC and console versions also seems very solid.

That does not mean the game is perfect: It is irritating that you do not get any information about your opponent when you are asked to accept an online match. At least a connection quality indicator should be there. While the vast majority of matches run great, every now and then I catch someone with a 500ms ping and the game slows down to super slowmo, or the (otherwise excellent) rollback netcode gives some weird phantom stutter.
I am also not 100% sold on the idea of not being downranked in online ranked matches (at least not out of your overall rank until you reach S or higher). Not a huge problem, but can be slightly annoying when you got pushed up a bit too far through lucky matches and now cannot be pushed down again with that character.

But these are really minor inconveniences that do not detract from the great experience. If you have even a passing interest in the genre or want to to a first dive-in with something slightly faster than SF6 (or if you just prefer the visual style), definitely check this out.

The content is okay. The problem with ArcS*** games is that there is never a connection filter and matchmaking is determined by the regions that players voluntarily enter into. This results in people from random countries deciding to join the NA servers and ruining the gameplay experience for everyone. Since there isn't a connection filter, you do not know if the person you're being matched up with is wifi/hard wired or USA/Brazil until you are IN the match. It makes online a complete mixed bag and a joke.

An easy fix would be how literally every single multiplayer game matchmakes. When someone searches for a match, the game should do its best to find someone else searching for a match that is low ping and similar skill.

For its time, the original was an amazing and high quality game that never got a chance to succeed because it was released before the rollback revolution and the pandemic killed all hope for the game's survival.

For a time, the game fell into obscurity with only a few dedicated players who suffered through delay based netcode.  Arcsys and Cygames knew they had a good game, for a time GBVS went silent after a few updates and a final last character.

Out of nowhere in 2023, Granblue Rising relaunched to everyone's surprise.  They gave us everything.  Crossplay, Rollback, updated graphics, new system mechanics that fixed the overly defensive and slow pace of the original game.  Then they added innovations which included free to play and the fun little fall guys side game.  There are a massive amount of tiny touches added to give the game longevity which include things like the partner system to individual character progression tracks.  This is also the first anime style game that allows for character customization such as new weapons and costumes, all of which are obscenely high quality.

The game fully embraced SF6 modern controls while keeping classic inputs, the game was actually designed around simple inputs which allows players new to fighting games the ability to quickly get in and figure out how to play relatively quickly.  Free to play allows for a consistent playerbase and right now the game is very heavily populated, topping MK1 and trailing just behind SF6 (which is a stagnation period due to ultra slow content drip).  Every major FGC influencer is on this game at the time of this review and have nothing but positive things to say.

The roster is absolutely stacked with personality, quality, and different playstyles.  Anything you can think of is here and guest character like 2B from Nier are on the horizon.  There isn't a single still frame of animation of this game that looks like it wasn't ripped out of a 8k miyazaki movie.  The characters are also so well expressed that you don't need to know anything about the Granblue world to understand what a character is all about, they will show you 10 seconds into their intro.  You have everything from the psychopathic Yandare, to the silent sniper, to literally Siegfried from soul calibur, to the perfect lab created waifu whose formula was perfected to the level of coca cola.

The game's pace is perfect and the BP system added the depth that the original was missing.  This is also not a game about massive combos, it is very fundmentals heavy.  This is good for new players as it teaches them how to play FGs properly.  Every character has universal tools to deal with basic fighting game situations such as brave counter to push enemies off you at a cost, a universal anti-air, and a raging chain high damage combo extender.  The BP system is like a panic system that lets you access the immediate thing you need right away for the situation but it comes at a high cost.  The system is well balanced.

For new players the biggest hurdle is learning defense as offense in this game is very strong.  Most characters have potent ways of getting in and applying pressure.  Just like SF6, the corner in this game is very dangerous and positioning is critical.  All characters have a universal dash normal that grants advantage which makes applying pressure relatively easy.  The dash normal are the highest point of the game's contention as the argument is that they make offense too easy.  However, I personally will take the dash normals over throw loops in SF6.

The characters are very well balanced with the exception of a few, who will be balanced in due time.  However the power gap of these characters is no different than Ken or JP in SF6 and the tier advantage only really starts to apply at very high levels.  Certain characters are much easier to play than others (Gran, Siegfriend, Anila) and will feel strong/difficult at lower ranks but then become more balances as you skill up and learn match ups.

Most importantly, unlike most fighting games the game is a full package with a ton of unlockables, story content, and little tidbits to keep you occupied.  It is well worth the price of entry, and the free edition is there to try out.  The free edition also grants a gracious amount of content and rotates characters every week.

The developers have also been very communicative about their plans and posted a full 2024 roadmap filled with character reveals and content.  GBVS:R is here to stay and has a bright future.  This game will be an EVO mainstay for some time.

I would highly recommend it for anyone that even has a remote interest in fighters.  As a first fighter, this game is a perfect entry point.  For hardened masters, there is more than enough depth here to keep you engaged as the quality matches SF6.  This is the perfect blend of easy to learn, hard to master.

Unanimous recommend.  I would say, next to SF6 this might be one of the best fighters of all time and is definitely 100% the best 2.5 quality anime fighter ever created (unless you are looking for Kusoge, then Strive is your option).",1705671314,1705671314,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Too bad I didn't know that until I learned every character enough to start playing ranked. Refund denied.

Paid Battlepass in full price game. Have to pay for system announcers $20!!!! (normal one is bad enough to turn off)

I would give this game a 2 / 10 for its monetization and a 7 / 10 for gameplay. Just kinda feel bored sometimes, never any ""big"" moments in any fights it feels.

---------------
‚ùåObjective Negatives :
<--------------->
There are a couple glitches currently : One with keyboard inputs on menus being incorrect, one where you get the little chibi avatar partners even after turning them off, and one where Character Strategy Trials show only the name and not the input despite settings stating otherwise.

Also terrible support for keyboards / fightsticks with keyboard based input. (Its not hard to add customization for menu keys) I don't want to have to take my hands off my fightstick to go thru menus.

Can't use mouse + keyboard in lobby while controller plugged in.

Lobby is stuck to 30fps :P If my computer is good I should be able to have it higher, also with players render distance. Walking around to find someone cause I cant teleport to them lol.
<--------------->

---------------
üí¢Personal Negatives:
<--------------->
Combo trials / mechanics trials should be more front in center. Its very easy to miss them from all the menus.

Combo trials should have better shortcuts to go to next / retry etc.

I know its probably for balancing reasons but having to hold forward for the dash attacks to come out is kinda annoying as half the time I will release forward slightly too early. The consistency of double tap forward + button working or not seems very wonky. Just something Ill have to get used to.

Block button nullifying crossups is super weird. Whats the point of crossups then? :P You cant instant block with it, but IB only gives u 1% extra meter.

I'm not a fan of the ""Worse throw break with any attack button"" Just feels kinda annoying. 

Not a fan of the bravery point system. But its whatever I guess. All the resources in this game feel like they were made since they made inputs so easy. Changed the mechanical challenge to a resource monitoring challenge lol. There are just so many weird arbitrary things. 

I personally dont like the skill button. 95% of the time you want to be using it over traditional inputs, there are even some combos that it would be infinitely harder to do the traditional way than more challenging games. My main gripe about it is that I guess the directional input buffer is so big that I constantly get DP / Charge inputs on accident trying to do a qcf etc. I've never had this issue in other games. Also the ergonomics of clicking 1 button with 3 other buttons on a traditional fight stick layout. My hand really doesn't like it; this is also a problem I do not have on other games, even street fighter where there are 5 different button combos to use. (I believe its because all those are in lines and much less common to be chaining together.) I'm going to have to use a very alternative layout I think to make this less hand destroying. It probably works on gamepad super well though.

I wish there were more skins etc unlocked ONLY from character level instead of being able to buy them with the funny coins.(there is a weapon skin variant at level 300 per character and supposedly a character skin at max or somethin?), I do like how much customization they COULD add however. WTB Adorable Charlotta skins pls

Also I wish some things were a little more centralized (such as rounds won on the UI, so I dont have to look around as much, honestly same with cds, but this is just a nitpick.

Leveling in the silly minigame mode takes sooooooo long, and I feel like there isnt enough going on in it for it to keep my attention lol. I hope they add more to it.

If they don't make it so I can unlock system announcers I am going to be so mad. lol

>make awful system announcer (direction issue not va issue)
>charge $ for different system announcers.

‚úÖGood :
<--------------->
Gameplay is fun and pretty easy to learn, probably easier to get friends into. Kinda weeby tho.
F2P version (havn't tried it)
Online is good.
Interesting mixture between SF and Anime games. 75:15 respectively with 10% of unique feeling.
Charlotta and Nier are adorable.
There will presumably be a good little modding scene for it.

I hope they add more cute characters / some cute outfits.

Blazblue, Guilty Gear, Persona 4 Arena, each game I tried out impressed me with their visual style, mechanics, and variety of characters. None of them hooked me enough to play much online or try to improve beyond playing with a few friends at my house every so often. 

Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising is an extensive update to the previous Granblue fighter from Arc Sys, and with this one they've engineered a perfect progression structure that hooked me unlike prior games did. Now I'm playing on ranked, now I'm hopping in public lobbies to play with friends and all the while I'm learning the game better and being rewarded with awesome cosmetics for my favorite characters. 

This reward structure has rendered me totally addicted to this game, I have played for hours with friends and on ranked to get Charlotta and Djeeta to high levels to get more cool colors and weapon skins. It's so satisfying to see your progress measured in new aesthetics for your fighters and I can't express enough how enjoyable it is. However, on top of all of this you get an extensive single player story, robust Arcade mode, impressive gallery with unlockables, the absolute peak of gameplay in Grand Bruise Legends (the Fall Guys style party mode), and this package is incredible. 

For me, I felt like the Deluxe edition was a steal, the base game AND character pass AND additional costumes? I just can't stop playing this game. Download the free version if you're unsure but I was hooked almost immediately. If you're a fighting game enthusiast or someone who is normally intimidated by fighting games, in my opinion this game strikes the best balance between competitive and approachable of any game I've played.

On one hand, Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising is a really good fighting game with a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling. The execution barrier is not as high as other fighting games due to the addition of the guard button and the special button. The special button lets you do special moves without doing any motion inputs and doesn't have much penalty (no cooldown penalty and only does less damage than doing a motion input if done raw/in neutral). The base character roster is big with each character having their own unique play styles. In addition to that, the game has a free edition that lets you try the game out before buying it.

On the other hand, the pricing on the game is nuts. The deluxe edition of the game ist 75 bucks, but if you intended to buy the standard edition and then upgrade to deluxe, you need to pay 50 bucks for the standard edition and ANOTHER 50 bucks for the deluxe pass. There is also a problem with region pricing. The price of the game is too expensive in some parts of the world.

On top of that, the devs just recently introduced a battle pass system to the game that only people who have paid for the game have access to. Through the battle pass system, you can get new cosmetics that, I assume, are added every month, by playing the game and gaining ""battle pass points"" that level up your battle pass. The higher the level of your battle pass is, the more rewards you get. There are premium rewards that you can only get by paying for the premium upgrade for the battle pass. The premium upgrade only lasts for the current battle pass round. That means, if you want the premium rewards of the next battle pass round, you need to pay for the premium upgrade again. As an alternative to playing, you can pay your way through the battle pass progression, adding 10 levels for every 5 bucks you pay.

I personally find battle passes to be bad and predatory. The battle pass system pressures players to spend more time playing the game or pay more to get the cosmetics they want. This is emphasized by the fact that the cosmetics are time-limited and may not appear ever again. Even though on the website it is stated that some set contents for the battle pass can be obtained separately in the in-game Rupie-Shop, it is not very clear, which of those exactly are purchasable. So, the new Narmaya costume in the PREMIUM battle pass round 1 may not see another light of day after the round ends.

Although I love the games from ArcSystemWorks, I find it now hard to continue supporting this game. The business practices made by Cygames have always been predatory, so I should have seen something like this coming.

Why?
- Game has easy inputs
- Crossplay, and a Free Edition (you can try) it will never run out of players to fight with.
- You can use Crystals to Protect you from pressure or use them to extend a combo in a case of need.
- Combos aren't really too long or hard to perform(there is a limit on how long they can be as well)
The pace is somewhere between Slow and Fast, specially if you like SF cause its a slow game or you like anime cause they are faster pace... this game falls right in the middle of both.
- 28Characters to pick from, its more than twice the amount that the 1st game started with!
- 2B from Nier Automata is comming as DLC!

How does this game feel?
- Its feels like Street Fighter, lots of foot work and less about jumping around like a mad lad as in anime games, but slightly faster paced compared to SF.
- Compared to the last version(non-rising), its a bit more faster now, with slightly more options to combo and Get'off'me solutions.
- Cast is very varied and different to play, hard to get bored
- Got bored of fighting? Go play some GrandBruise instead to relax!(if you cant find a match just switch to another server until you find one.
- You can also play solo in a peculiar and unique story mode, up to 2 players on screen co-op couch/online
- Art Style is very good, music is superb and mechanics aren't overwhelming and allow lots of options.

Any good characters to start the game with?
- Grand (ur typical Shoto/Ryu)
- Katalina ( Similar to grand but more Medium range pokes)
- Vira (get a grab or transform and rush down ur enemy in your shiny armor)
- Anila (fluff your opponents to death with your army of little sheeps)",1703997721,1705542647,True,156,1,0.875329911708831787,0,True,False,False

Low and behold after a few rounds i found myself feeling very comfortable with the controls and the over gameplay systems enough so that i just flat out purchased it for the full experience.

So I bought Belial and A.Belial YET again, had no regrets still.

So anyway, main difference from previous game - LOTS of new mechanics. Like a lot - the game finally feels like a proper fighting game.
AND - you can still mash to your heart's content.
There's also secret boss at the end of arcade mode, I guess Story mode have a sequel (Still haven't touched that) AND also Story mode from previous game IS included
But of course - the online - net-code if great+crossplay - hell yeah. I had only one ""bad"" connection (328 ms) and it still felt better than most of the connections from previous installment.

There's also an extra mode - which is basically Fall Guys but Anime
And lots of grinding, farming, dailies - all that.

[h1]What to expect from the game if you're a new[/h1]
Better visauls - same performance - which is good actually. Its still UE4 engine for you.
More music and more stages
About 20+ characters with great design
Pretty okay-ish tutorial but questionable Trials.
Arcade is quite easy.
Online is already filled with guys who have 2k+ games overall. Funny enough - they are on lowest rank mostly.
I guess there is a good plot considering the fanbase and the community.
Lots of Grind

[h1]What was bad[/h1]
[b]THE PRICE[/b]

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
Its anime as f_ck but also newbie friendly, thanks to the community
Very pretty, very stable, pure aesthetic pleasure
Belial is fun - you should try him.

only problems i see with it are, lack of options for those who prefer more technical inputs, or stronger technical inputs. the keyboard rebinding options are glitched and horrible in the menus,, and honestly thats it. maybe you could also say some of the vanilla characters are a little bland compared to newer characters. not that they arent still awesome characters tho. the new ones are just kinda insane. 

im hoping beatrix and the other generic looking dude arent generic and trash tho. 

might update this down the road after my journey to S rank. but until then, this is my current favorite fighting game by a long shot. 9/10",1704791771,1704791771,True,2,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Hostility is akin to love
Thinking of your opponent‚Äôs actions to fight,
Reading your opponent‚Äôs inner thoughts to fight,
Planning attacks that will hit your opponent to fight,
And then transmitting your thoughts with those attacks,
The more you think of your own advantage, at the same time you think of your opponent,
In the instant you mix with your opponent, a passionate feeling arises, and blood boils,
Reality is hurt, and you wound your opponent,
Hostility is akin to love.

This game is designed for simple controls but don't let this fool you, the game still has a lot of depth and enough complexity also for veteran players. There is also a roadmap for 6 DLC characters and plenty other additional content to come out in 2024.

My only gripes with the game are:
1. The wonky matchmaking in ranked and casual online modes that likes to pitch relative beginners against advanced players. Apparently ranked mode only matches based on rank and not on skill rating, and casual mode matches based on skill rating (indicated by a colored gem that is influenced by your recent win or loss streaks) but not rank. Typically your skill rating will decline when you go up in ranks, since this is where better players are. So the next time you go to casual, you will be matched with people below your skill level there, until you can increase your skill rating back up to where it should be. What would be needed is a combination of both rank and skill rating for both ranked and casual modes to find mostly fair matches where either participant has around a 50/50 win chance. Other competitive online game genres like FPS and MOBA have already solved this problem with a hidden matchmaking rating (MMR).

2. The rather barebones replay viewer, which is currently lacking the ability to rewind a few seconds, and also missing the frame data display (which is available only in training mode)

3. The balancing issues in regard to a certain puppet character (Nier) that can far too easily shut down any other character's gameplan and also gets to do wall combos midscreen for some reason, which the rest of the cast cannot do.",1704576190,1704576384,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1st hour - 'what are these cursed controls, how is this playable'
2nd & 3rd hour - adjusting keybinds and trying stuff out in training mode(can barely do inputs)
4th & 5th hour - goofing around with friends but starting to hit our first combos
6th hour - getting rolled by gamers in online lobbies(Nier ragdolled me for 15 seconds to death)
7-10th hours - finally getting some good wins in there against my better friends and getting familiar with the systems, having a blast learning

and all the rest up to the 20th hour have been my most memorable experiences of this year with my friends, can't wait to play more and I fell in love with the game so much that I had to buy it even though it's ridiculously expensive for someone from an underdeveloped country like me

The free version is very generous and has a big chunk of the content unlocked - most locked things are cosmetics, so I'd recommend it to anyone keen on trying out a fighting game and if you like the art/characters then there's even more to enjoy, as all of them are pretty quirky and have fitting(for their character) interactions with everyone else

I really don't care for that aspect as I am not a weeb or whatever people are on about these days, but its extremely fun to play without nearly as many irritating scrubby things like SF6. Its right on the fine line of good and excellent. Just needs a few features added to be above par with other offerings. 

Pros 
- Solid responsive game play / nice art style.
- Super easy to pick up, most characters basically have the same starting combo route for easy learning of game play.
- Even being simple to start, the skill ceiling is limitless and gets intricate pretty quickly.
- Every character pretty much has the same best move in the game 66L. (poor mans drive rush)
- Tons of costumes, weapon skins and lots of content.
- Free to play available to test, that is what got me roped in.
- Modern/simple controls mixed with technical controls are a great addition, especially for new players. I like that I can still by habit use quarter circle motions for everything then when needed I can use a simple button setup for dragon punches, command grabs, and supers.

Things to work on

- Needs latency / connection filters for ranked. High completion rate doesn't filter out inconsistent wifi connections.
- Allow player profile blocking at the post match screen. 
- Fix non working controls for arcade sticks in online lobby/menus.
- Casual matches should be endless re-matching for much longer spar sessions.
- When players rage quit or disconnect the menus take forever to load and disconnect then throw you back to the title screen anyway. So it feels like you get punished for other bad acting players.
- Allow ranked/casual match searching from training.
- Better tutorial presentation and menu selection for combo trails. Currently requires a little digging to discover.
 
None of these things to work on really hamper the game what so ever they would be great QOL features if they were added.",1704502326,1704503026,True,2,0,0.510714292526245117,0,True,False,False

As a fighting game, it's honestly great. Definitely what you would expect from a ArcSys game and it plays pretty well, the game cast is good and diverse so yeah to sum up gameplay-wise : [b] The game is great [/b]

But then your next question would be-
[b] Why is it a negative review and why have you played it so little ?? [/b]

Simply put : the game is user unfriendly.
Before going further into the explanation, I have to state my keyboard is in AZERTY, the French format for kayboards.
And here's the main problem : [b] you cannot change your bindings for menu navigation [/b]

But i'm quite used to it, it's not the first time it happened to me and, although it only seem to originate from big companies, I can still get over it...
But adding to this you have the fact that a part of the menu navigation is tied to in-game bindinqs which YOU CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE (meaning I go from moving is WASD to moving is ZQSD to moving again in character select in WASD, this is just suffering inducing)... anyways this doesn't make any sense.

What ALSO does not make any sense is the fact changing in-game keybinds changed the tab navigation keys, but only the visual (basically to change tabs it's O and P by default, after modification it became U and L but O and P were still the working keybinds...)

Let's not even go over the fact during training mode you can simply not open any sort of menu (in AZERTY) to go back to character selection or whatnot.

After reading all of this most of you will think that i should just have a QWERTY keyboard or smth similar and you would be right, it seems logical. But then why would a game implement keybind configuration for in-game movement, attacks, ... ? That's called being user friendly and this game isn't.

I'm not even gonna mention this game is pretty much a reboot of the previous one because that would not be helping their case.

Anyways...
TL;DR // The game should implement a way to change menu keybinds or at least bind them CORRECTLY to in-game keybinds, especially when you have experience in the industry and when your game recycles a lot of content and assets from the previous iteration. Making the game that much painful to navigate before starting matchmaking removes any intent to play the game for any keyboard (and more precisely non-QWERTY) users...

So yeah that's why it's a negative review although the game (and Katalina) is great.",1704316706,1704316706,False,1,2,0.423820555210113525,0,True,False,False

Simple to get into with a mix of simple inputs and command inputs, but still a standard skill ceiling you'd expect with these games.

I am not a pro at all. I am an absolute casual.

Online Experience: So far gameplay is pretty smooth. My only concern is that in Casual Match you will literally fight with anyone who queued here. My first game in it was against someone with 700+ matches so that's a yikes considering I am just a casual. The good part is that there are people who understands that you're just starting out so they will take it easy on you and that made my Online Casual Experience pretty enjoyable and they will actually play with you instead of just rushing you down. Beware though that there are also people who don't care and will destroy you and move on but that's just how it is. Big respect and thank you to the players that go easy on casuals like me.

Arcade Mode: The typical Fighting Game Arcade Mode on where you fight a gauntlet of CPUs and a final boss in the end. What I like here is that you can select the difficulty of the CPUs to your liking every match so you can start fighting a Normal Difficulty CPU and then you can slowly increase the difficulty up until ""Nightmare"" Difficulty. I did struggle at first since I am still learning the game but when I got the hang of it, Nightmare CPUs aren't that hellish of a struggle anymore. If you're concerned about the final boss being hell like Guilty Gear Strive Stage 8 and 9 bosses, don't worry because its not. I'd say the final boss difficulty would be like Tekken level of final boss.

Story Mode: I have only gone through the first part of it since I didn't like the fighting style of it. Basically it is like a beat 'em up side-scroller like River City Girls so it didn't really clicked on me but I might do it if I get really bored.

There is also a Character Progression system on where when you play a character a lot, you will be rewarded with Additional Color Palettes for that character and items you can use to customize your Profile Card featuring that character.

Final Thoughts: I can pretty much say that even though I am playing this in a very casual way, I still find it very enjoyable! So if you just want to play this casually then by all means go for it. I recommend trying out the free version first as that's what I did and after 2 weeks of playing it, I decided to buy the game because I wanted to play more of the characters. For its price? Well that's why it took me 2 weeks before deciding and I don't regret it. In fact I got to enjoyed it more because I am able to play the characters I want. For me it is worth it.",1704123149,1704123149,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But in the end, it's just not for me. There is so many safe moves that it makes it incredibly hard to determine when it's safe to punish. Add in the lack of defensive options and how varied the tiers are in characters I just, I thought I'd never say this but, I honestly have no idea how to play the game.
Add in the fact that you can't see how good ping is before a matchup and that you're stuck against pink squared players with thousands of games because they're playing a different character is ridiculous.

I really do want to like it, but as it stands now, with how powerful the higher tiers of the cast it and the ridiculous safety of the movelists, I can't right now endorse this game. Knowing the first game received many updates I hope this may happen for this game too, but considering how much would need to be changed, I'm worried that it will not happen.

While the game's unique mechanics and characters' combos may be easier to pick up than other games, GBFVS: Rising is a horrible experience for beginners. Every time you get hit, even by a light attack, you have to watch your character get combo'd for the length of a short film. The combo strings are not that long compared to some fighting games, but the attacks and animation are more sluggish, making it feel much longer. Combine this with the fact that there are also very limited defensive options in GBFVS: Rising's mechanics, and the feeling of helplessness only increases. 

The only objectively unfun part of fighting games is watching your character get juggled. The genre's appeal is the learning curve and the number of decisions the player has to make at any given time. There is nothing to be learned and no decisions to be made while watching a cutscene. Thus, fighting game devs should Strive to NOT make this part of the game take up the majority of gameplay time. However, it seems like Arc System Works went out of their way to make the learning portion of this game miserable. This is surprising, because they also developed Guilty Gear: Strive, and that game has a MUCH better experience for beginners. I enjoyed playing Strive and stuck with the game long enough, on and off Steam, to get to the point where I could win some matches. That will be the fighting game I return to.

[*]Crossplay between PC and Console
[*]20+ colors for each character along with multiple weapon skins

[*]Training mode is good and has some frame data in it, but I'm spoiled by Street Fighter 6's frame meter.
[*]I wish they would tell me how many frames of invincibility a special move has.
[*]The combo trials are hidden in a tab in training mode.
[*]They stripped almost almost all the RPG elements from the previous games story mode.¬†Some people didn't like it so now it's more streamlined.¬†Cutscene -> Battle -> Cutscene -> Battle etc.

[*]They took out the online coop from the story mode
[*]The arcade mode ending for each character is lackluster.¬†You are rewarded with just 2 pieces of artwork. (1 for normal ending, 1 for true ending)
[*]Online lobby is locked at 30 fps.¬†Not really sure why.
[*]No regional pricing makes the game very expensive in certain areas of the world

the bravery points bring a lot of depth with their different uses: they can offensively used as a combo extender or guard crush, passively as a pseudo burst. spending or saving them affects your damage income, so that brings another aspect into the game.
the ultimate skills are a great addition, where you could spend meter before basically on the super dash or supers only, spending 50 meter on these ultimate skills opens up the game for a lot of additional possibilities. they are very unique and cover a lot of uses, full screen whiff punishing, combo extending and ending or mixing up to name a few. 
the base roster includes every DLC from the previous game, which makes 28 characters. if you compare that to like strives base roster, i think that is a huge improvement. framedata has been adjusted, no big reworks in the sense of an archetype change though.
the skill button opens up a lot of possibilities and makes the game accesible without taking away complexity. im even thinking about playing a charge character.
the training mode is great, the online lobby is working, private rooms are working.

The ""neutral based gameplay"" some people talk about it a lie, it's 66L and full screen ultimate move, the game.

The skill buttons breaks the rules of some moves, allowing things that are physically impossible using technical inputs; meaning you have to use it even if you don't want to.

Ultimate skills are busted, a lot of them go full screen and are fully invincible, also refunds meter on hit so just spam it.

Balance is terrible, dominated by 6 or so characters while the bottom half of the cast is near unplayable.

I played a decent amount of the original Granblue Fantasy Versus, and it was some of the most fun I had playing a fighting game.

I have not played or watched anything Granblue related before, but even so, the characters grew on me very quickly, in no small part from Arcsys' characteristic eye-popping animations during battles.

Good for new players! This game has both auto-combos and simplified inputs.

As expected, the input reader can feel kinda weird due to the simultaneous inclusion of both traditional and simplified inputs. And it might feel even more weird to some people because the input buffer is smaller than that of some other modern fighting games.

The ""Fall Guys"" mode is a fun value add. I think SonicSol said something to the effect of: ""You get tight playing the actual game. And then you go play the Fall Guys mode for a bit to cool off. And then you go back to playing the game."" And I think that's a valid and compelling approach to tackling online matches in this game.

If you're looking for a fun, visually stunning animuuu fighter with more ""grounded-based neutral"" than most other animuuu fighting games, then you might consider trying out the free version of this game. You get Gran and a rotating cast of 3 other characters per week. And if you decide that you enjoy the game, then you can consider picking up a paid version of the game.

It was an absolute shame that the original game released near the advent of covid, actively killing the competitive scene for many a player who saw immense promise. I think that is what makes this game's release all the more sweeter, we're seeing a resurgence of a fanbase with renewed vigor. This was the game we all wanted and then some!

for one, the online lobby has been radically updated with new modes to boot. As an active final fantasy player I couldn't tell you the joy I felt when I learned that there was a leap of faith mode in the form of Grand Bruise! The customizability made me so happy, the moment I saw the alternate costumes characters have now made me really excited for more (for those who play the mobile game, you know). And I haven't even approached the topic of the revamped battle mechanics! The game is faster, crisper, and it has taken a much more offensive turn what with the new brave point mechanic. yeah, this may be a bit more simple in scale compared to other mainline fighting games on the market, BUT it makes up for in the ways you can play the game. the mind games are real in thus game.

As far as ""entry"" fighting games go this is up there with SF6 thanks to the ""simplified inputs"" (direction + the ability button). However it is still a fighting game and yes there are some real nasty combos in this game too, especially in the corner.

Thankfully with Rising, we were given some new tools in the 'raging' universal abilities (meaning all characters has access to them with the same inputs). One break block (can be countered with same move if you react) and the other pushes an enemy comboing you away (if you're blocking, wont trigger if you're being hit). We also got a new upgraded version of the characters 4 basic skills costing 50% meter and does different things.

Some of those are really nice, Ladiva's headbutt becomes unblockable and gives guard, Vaseraga's charge has invulnerability on start up. 

And if pvp scares you but you still want to play fighting game. There's Arcade (fight a couple of characters, beat the Arcade boss, see how much points you got and if you win you get a unique picture for each character). There's a rather hefty story mode for a fighting game. Mainly characters talking and then you're thrown into a fight in-between. Idk how long it is as I haven't finished it myself yet.

And for those interested in actually learning fighting games. The game has a lot of features in the training section. Both simple and more advanced combos for different situation (corner combos, dash combo, combo after an anti-air hit, standard combos that works anywhere and so on). Of course, these are not the best of the best combos, those are found out by the players. But if you're just starting, these are a good starting point to get an idea what you can combo into at what situation with your character of choice.

For now, the multiplayer is in a good spot. Sure, we have laggy matches when people insist on being on wi-fi and slow internet speed. I've played a bit over a hundred matches and the laggy ones, while memorable, has been less than 10 people.
The lobby system is the best one I've seen in a fighting game so far. Plenty of arcades to jump and play casual matches with strangers or friends with. There's soccer, a jump puzzle if you're familiar with Final Fantasy 14 ones, and those claw machines where you can get random cosmetic stuff like optional colors or stuff for the 'gallery' mode.

Rupies is the freemium currency you get for doing stuff, mainly by playing online matches and leveling up characters (online matches gives best exp, by a mile). You can use rupies to unlock colors, weapon skins and some unique skins for characters. Currently for Gran, Djeeta (in their Eternal skin mode, blue glowy hair) and Siegfried (helmet on).

There's also Grand Bruise, aka Fall Guys mode. It's pretty fun when as a every now and then thing to break from the intense 1v1ing of the main game mode.
It's a very simplified Fall Guys, don't have too high expectations. With a slice of Mario Kart with the power-up/weapon pick ups.

I enjoyed GBVS (the original)  but had to take a break due to wrist injury lasting for months. And by then the game had dwindled, due to the announcement of GBVS:R coming with the rollback netcode and the lack of crossplay keeping everyone limited to their PC/Console of choice community. 

Now, we have both rollback (I think SF6's rollback is better, as I've had less frequent lagfests at higher delayed frames than here. But its still good enough for a majority of matches even against people across the atlantic) and crossplay! Crossplay definitely is a big thing to help the community stay healthy and friends able to play with each other.

The roster feels very varied. You have the major archtypes represented. And less common archtypes getting representation too now like puppeteer (although it's more like Persona 4 Arena kind of puppet than Blazblue's Carl). I think they're doing a good work making sure each character got something to make them stick out.

Of course, some characters are better than others at the highest competitive level. This is the nature of any fighting game. But honestly don't stress about that. And if you are playing at that level, you already know what characters to practice anyway. Tier lists are for sheep anyway (no offence Anila).

The game got a lot of characters coming onwards, including 2B (who hopefully will not inflict the Nier Automata crossover curse on GBVS:R). So I think for 2024 this is a safe bet to get if you like fighting games or want to get into one for the first time.",1703640603,1703640603,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Super accessible, there's lots of 1-2 button shortcuts that make picking up the game, as well as recommending it to friends who aren't already into fighting games very easy. And it makes the game a lot easier on the hands, I haven't had issues with multiple hour grind sessions like I have in other fighting games.

Free version makes it incredibly easy to recommend to friends, please tell your friends to try this one out. I do hope they increase the functionality & lift some existing restrictions in the free version, though.

Rollback netcode is a must these days, and it's pretty good here.

GrandBruise is the pinnacle of gaming, and the online lobbies are fun to mess around in.

The claw machine here is the only claw machine in existence that isn't a scam.

Game is gorgeous visually, the arcade and story modes elevate just how pretty this game is, and it has some of the best super animations in any fighting game.

This is my first Granblue game, and every character design is very charming and likable.

My favorite to play as is Zooey, but when I play with friends who just picked up the game or free version, or just with friends in general, I like to take a break from her and rotate around the cast, and the accessible input system makes it really easy to pick up unfamiliar characters and have tons of fun without having to really practice or play them beforehand.

The game has its issues, though. There are occasional bugs in the menus and lobbies, that have shown both players' cards as the default, taking out some of the fun of the card customization when what I put together often doesn't matter anyways, locking me out of selecting rematch or return to lobby unless I open match stats, and a weird but rare black screen error that's kicked me out of GrandBruise before. I have faith these will be fixed given that ArcSys is fairly reliable when it comes to fixing bugs and glitches, even if it's taken a while in the past with their other games.

I also feel like it's a bummer to not have a way to queue with friends in GrandBruise. You just have to queue at the same time as someone, and hope you both get into the same match.

When i first saw this game, i thought to myself ''meh, generic anime characters''. I don't even watch anime, so interest already wasn't that high

But hey, there's a free version... Why not try it

It just clicked pretty fast, and after a friend bought it i caved in as well

I can now say that this is one of the most complete products i've bought on launch, and it feels like it was built from the ground up with raw quality

No seriously, gacha games must be making bank because this game is just... Truly something else. I guess it was probably built off the backbone of the previous title, but as a newcomer i have no context for that

The game has probably the most visually impressive graphics for any anime game out there, character models ingame are often more visually appealing than their illustrations, expressive and emotive personalities, lots of vocals everywhere during battle, good and diverse soundtracks, clean and no overcomplicated menu or redundant buttons, good lobby systems and private room features, cute chibi avatar, and there's so many of ''the little things'' that improve the experience

This isn't a ''raw'' looking game, or a ''mechanical'' feeling one. There's always glitter on the screen and pleasing visuals, the game feels and flows good, it's just... Very nice. Not rough around the edges anywhere

There's also tons of collectibles and other stuff, and you lvl up fairly quick, while having lots of levels, which is great for consistent unlockables and keeping dopamine going

Story mode is sort of a visual novel with some 2D arcade-style gameplay. It's not just you versus some character, there are knights to fight and giant bosses with multiple health bars and mechanics. Don't get too sold on this, it's not super fancy and repetitive, but it still holds good polish, and the visual novel is animated with 3D models and fully voice acted

Also, the game offers full voice acting in english as well

This game allows you to use both simple and technical (or modern/classic, or however you want to call it) inputs, and i've come to GREATLY appreciate this system, because i like to mix and match the two as i'm learning. It's easy to input technicals in training mode, but hard to clutch it live

The only three faults with the game i can really find is training mode is worse than Street Fighter but provides the necessary features you'd need, there is no indication of connection quality to whom you fight (don't care, i'm european and out of nearing 300 matches i only had two laggers), and also you currently can't derank unless you are S-rank (or A, don't remember) which is fairly high, and leaves many people stuck

Whether this games' fighting style will appeal to you or not is not easy to articulate in a written review and you're better off watching content online to make your mind on that

But you are actually in denial if you think this isn't a high-quality product. Whether that quality is to your taste or not is another thing. I cannot understate how impressed i am with this game just as a product on its own",1703462877,1703463303,True,41,0,0.770164310932159424,3,True,False,False

I mainly played hero shooters as well as other FPS games, though I had a lot of experience playing fighting games thanks to Dragon Ball FighterZ and Street Fighters. I found both of these quite enjoyable, though some matches were intense.

I decided to give this game a try thanks to a friend recommending it to me. He helped me with the basics and some more advanced stuff in the free version, yet once I tried online matches, the matchmaking put me against people more skilled; they usually had between 1000 and 2000 games while I had more or less 5. I struggled through about 20 games, getting 2 wins, most of them being complete stomps for the other person. That is why I believe this game is unsuitable for new players.

I tend to prefer keeping to myself, but their is an issue with Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising that I didn't see get mentioned in the other reviews I looked at. Though I'm sure that is partially due to how it seems most fighting game fans aren't into fighters for the story and because this is more likely an exclusive to the English version.

This will be an issue for people that can be just as anal as I am, so it is worth mentioning. The English dialogue is awful. They are parts that fit better, but a lot of internet slang is used. If English isn't your first language, you aren't going to understand what they are saying, since it's basically nonsense. I'm in my 30s and just want to escape the harsh reality that life causes, hearing and reading these obnoxious phrases is immersion destroying and makes walking into the ocean sound like more fun. I could go into the divide currently on going, regarding localisation vs accurate translation, but this review already risks being too long while somehow talking about very little, so perhaps not?

It's truly a shame because the game is still fun and action packed. Though the censorship was also a red flag. Of course, if you mention that, you'll get gaslit into being this or that or blahblahblah. I just find it strange that it's mostly men making these choices. It's just like they did over one hundred years ago, back when women couldn't vote and were expected to stay in the kitchen, men dictated what they could and couldn't wear back then too. Are we really moving forward as a species? Unlike others, I understand that some woman like to express themselves through their clothes and other woman usually hate them for it. Probably out of jealousy. You're not going to learn anything about Japanese culture through the localisation, instead getting obnoxious western slag shoved in your face, despite trying to avoid it in my free time.
What does this have to do with GFV:R? Probably nothing, though these issues have wormed their way into a video game. I just had to refund it, the whole thing just activated my depression, leading into the opposite effect of why I even play games in the first place...

You can't bypass the localizers and import it on PS4 or 5 either, since it doesn't have a physical release. Oh well...guess I'll keep my money then...",1703201866,1703201866,False,4,7,0.328571289777755737,0,True,False,False

There needs to be a wifi indicator.
There needs to be a benchmark before being allowed to play online with others.

If you have friends its extremely fun to play. The game is exceptionally beautiful to look at. The sounds and music are fairly nice as well. 

Unfortunately if you want to play online/ranked its completely insufferable. You will have frequent unplayable matches because players have either awful connections or horrible computers, and its complete unfair and unfun. The game essentially slows down to a single digit fps crawl and any sane individual would alt-f4. There is no safeguard against this, blocking people is a huge hassle and may not even work.

 It happens enough that I felt compelled to write a review.

That this game exists at all is proof that the people who made it love it dearly. 

As a sequel to a delay-based netcode fighter released days before Covid killed the planet, I can't imagine ""return on investment"" was the primary motivator to put out version 2.0. Plus you get oodles of new art, mechanics, visual updates, a whole new game mode and 4 characters (one of which sparking some playful creativity from players with the move list and name of Terry Bogard.)

Love is far from absent in the Sky Realms, but despite its abundance, it doesn't come cheap.

[h3]That Price Tag[/h3]
Let's get this Con out of the way. If you owned the first game, you're paying full price to make it playable online with the aforementioned oodles. As a newcomer, even if you can justify the buy in, another $50 for a character DLC pack might Jewel Resort Screwdriver your patience through a stage transition.

While the free version is there to try, the rotating cast and lack of micro transaction options means at some point, you'll either need to launch your EVO career as a Gran main or scrounge up fifty-ish regionally unmodified US dollars to venture into the skies.

[h3]What Gets Me Rising[/h3]
- Gorgeous art, animation and soundtrack.
- Huge, mechanically distinct and charismatic roster.
- Quick to pick up. Plenty to master.
- Love the little touches like super outros, stage transitions and dioramas. 
- Grand Bruise is a fun destressor after matches.

[h3]What's Got Me Whinging?[/h3]
- Long wait times, even in full lobbies.
- Weak single player offerings. Story mode too easy.
- Your free friends can't join your room. Limited to lobbies with set match criteria.
- Can't de-rank from your initial selection. If you choose to dive off the tallest tower, you'll be left to flounder until you learn to fly.

[h3]Recommend To:[/h3]
- The new fighting game player who is already picking out their homestead in the online lobby.
- The veteran fighting game player with slow hands but a quick mind.
- The Granblue Fantasy Versus player with deep pockets.
- The horny pick player. You are spoiled for choice.

[h3]But You May Instead Prefer:[/h3]
[b]Street Fighter 6:[/b] Another game designed with the neophyte in mind, but with a far superior onboarding package and single player offering via World Tour. Will likely outlive Granblue due to its popularity and pedigree, making it a preferable choice for anyone uncomfortable with using Discord in lieu of in game matchmaking.

[b]Guilty Gear Strive:[/b] If you find Granblue too slow and stilted (or, you know, too expensive), this is an excellent parallel graphically, audiably and stylishly. You lose Titty Bogard but you do get Aggret-Elphelt. You will also never get ""Disaster of Passion"" out of your brain, nor will you ever wish to.

This is largely what I wanted Granblue Fantasy Versus to be in 2020 and it saddens me that many will be priced out of sharing the experience with me. Cygames sales on Steam come few and far between generally, so if that price tag is the barrier blocking you from starting your fighting game journey, keep an eye on my alternatives for their next sale.

It's an incredibly fun and satisfying fighting game to play, fairly easy to pick up as a newcomer but with tons of room for mastery as most fighting games tend to have. A much easier to learn combo chaining system and extremely powerful anti-air on every character keep the game focused on grounded gameplay with an emphasis on fast close-combat, with lots of dodge mechanics and guard breaks to give you plenty of options to deal with your opponent. The art style is gorgeous, the animations and effects are flashy as hell, great sound design gives everything much more impact and presence, the music is stellar as expected from ASW, character levelling and reward tracks that include colors, costumes, weapon skins, and profile customizations mean even a loss still gets you stuff and the more you play no matter the outcome the more you get, the ranking system won't de-rank you until you get to the highest tiers meaning that the game focuses much more heavily on rewarding you for your wins and lessens the impact of a loss, and rollback + crossplay will keep the game populated for a long time to come.

most of the bosses got nerfed and are easy as hell, Hard mode is less relevant now since you don't get drops anymore,
the new story mode was not enjoyable.

 the limited character selection in  the new story missions is another issue you only get to pick gran 85% of the time, 
 skills are also useless now,  what is the point on adding 999 new skills ? if there is no point in grinding story mode anymore

I think just about everybody was under the impression that Grand Bruise Legends (the legally distinct Fall Guys mode) would be a lobby in and of itself while queued up for matchmaking. It's not. It's just its own mode separate from the rest of the game, so I reckon once the initial appeal settles down, the lobbies for Grand Bruise will be incredibly dead. The easiest way to fix this is to just do what people assumed, and add a way to play Grand Bruise while you queue for casual/ranked matches, and only be in Grand Bruise lobbies with other people who are queued. That way, people who [b] just [/b] want to play Grand Bruise can be queued with other people who want to only play it, and people who are queued for casual/ranked matches will only be in lobbies with other people doing the same.

Now to the real kicker. Once again, like the original game, there is a ""Character Pass"". Not a Season Pass, a ""Character Pass"". And like the original game, this will not include new stages, if they add any. Those will likely have to be purchase separately. This was one of the original game's grossest monetization issues. It gets worse though. This character pass is a full $50 for 6 characters that have not even been announced yet besides the first. Worse yet, if the leaks are to be believed, every single one of these characters is male. Which like, whatever, it's not [b] that [/b] deep (even though it actually is) but it feels pretty disingenuous to make the entire [strike] season [/strike] character pass just men in a game based on a series most widely known for its female characters. You can feel however you want, but this in any game is a colossal punch to the face to all of the women who play games and want to see themselves better represented. Should be an even 50/50 split of men and women in this ""character pass"".

But it gets worse. The character pass includes an [b] avatar [/b] of Vikala, the 5th-voted most-wanted character for the original Granblue Versus. Just the avatar. A $50 avatar, a colossal punch to the face to everyone who wants Vikala in the game, because once again, if the (so far true) leaks are to be believed, she is not in the character pass. This is not just wrong, it's borderline deceptive. It would almost imply that she will be in the character pass, especially seeing as she was voted as more popular than Anila and Nier who both made it into the base roster, and 2 other characters who are allegedly part of the character pass. Let me say that again. $50 avatar, not a playable character, just the avatar, and despite being one of the player-voted most wanted characters, likely will not be a playable character in this pass. Rethink your priorities, ArcSys and CyGames.

Further, this game still handles inputs in pretty backwards ways. Just like the original, the technical inputs for fireballs and dragon punches get jumbled up often, and often times trying to walk forward and dragon punch will give you a fireball instead and vice verse. But only sometimes. It feels very inconsistent and random. Sometimes buffering in a dragon punch like you would in any other 2D fighting game will instead give you an accidental super. And I understand that apparently the game now no longer penalizes you for using the simple inputs during combos (raw simple inputs still suffer a 10% damage penalty, which like whatever, nobody really uses simple inputs raw besides for reactive dragon punches or quick fireball pressure), but it's still just what most people who've been playing fighting games for longer than a year or two are just used to, it's muscle memory, it's just second nature, and feels more like the ""core"" fighting game experience to want to use technical inputs; they are synonymous with fighting games regardless of how many devs are trying to shift the trend, and I understand that if removing technical inputs altogether made all fighting games sell mainstream numbers, than every dev would do it in a heartbeat. It's still how I want to play.

The only other combat issue I have is how inconsistent close-hit-confirming is. You can half a pixel off and it will give you a long hit instead of a close hit confirm, completely messing up the inputs you're already dialing in (because if you close hit and you're not already dialing in your auto combo into your special cancel, it will drop by the time you can actually react to whether or not it's a close or far hit). It feels incredibly bad to think ""I am literally right up against the other player"" and then not get the close-hit-confirm and get punished while buffering in the close hit combo. You [b] can [/b] cancel into special from a far hit confirm, but generally speaking you don't have the time to react like that especially when again, it is [b] so [/b] unbelievably inconsistent to the point where sometimes you can be quite literally snug against the other player and still get a far hit instead.

Lastly, the game lacks an online connection indicator, meaning it will not tell you if a player is on wifi or ethernet, nor does it tell you how strong their internet connection is, nor will it offer you a way to only matchmake with people of a certain connection strength or higher, nor will it offer you a way to filter out wifi players entirely.

Anyways, Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising does a lot to fix the original game's issues, and the F2P model is something every single fighter should have, but I still can't full recommend this game until they fix these core issues and the gross monetization of a borderline sexist season pass.",1703112094,1703112206,False,7,4,0.485253781080245972,0,True,False,False

[h3]Q:[/h3] Is the netcode better now that rollback has released?
[h3]A:[/h3] Overall, yes. However, during queue for matches you CANNOT choose a connectivity quality range nor do you see your opponents connectivity quality before accepting a match. You're rolling the dice every time you accept a match and eventually you wind up playing those same laggy ass matches you did in 2020 but this time you'll have a rollback indicator that displays 10f of rollback and 200 ping :)

[h3]Q:[/h3] Are the new mechanics fun?
[h3]A:[/h3] GB was always a pretty simple game with gameplans for most of the cast that anyone could follow, this was one of the things that made the game accessible. On the flipside this also made the game feel one dimensional and stale. 

Welp they added a universal mechanic that took away any nuance this game had, 66L. 66L is a forward moving, +2 on block, hit confirmable normal that's typically 8F and stuffs any attempt to play neutral. Cant get in? 66L. Opponent blocking too much? 66L. Havent labbed a good meaty for that knockdown yet? 66L. Poor offense? 66L. Opponent dodging your normals in neutral? Just 66L, you'll recover first anyway. Just did 66L? Do it again. 

The other big mechanic change is Bravery points. Basically just a rock paper scissors-like mechanic that requires you to spend Bravery as a currency to participate in and you only have 3 Bravery points per round. As these points deplete you run out defensive options, offensive options, damage/combo extenders, and you take more damage. 

So to answer the question, no, the new mechanics are not fun. They enable turning off your brain which isn't my idea of fun.

[h3]Q:[/h3] Is the game as a whole fun?
[h3]A:[/h3] Kinda? Its fun in the sense that you can put this game down and pick it up a year later without skipping a beat, but just like GBVS, GBVSR gets really stale really quickly. Game just feels like you're going through the motions rather than actually having fun playing against a player.

[h3]Q:[/h3] Should you buy this game if you bought GBVS in 2020?
[h3]A:[/h3] Unless you're going to play the HELL out if it, probably not. Another 50 dollars for a game we bought almost 4 years ago with a little more content feels like robbery. I felt bad for them when they released during the pandemic and couldn't have tournaments or garner hype but not sure packaging the same game up with some changes for 50 dollars was the answer.

As a 2020 owner I rate this game a 5/10, if this were a new game for me id rate it a 7.5/10. I personally don't recommend this game to 2020 owners.",1703098638,1703100040,False,4,2,0.418652594089508057,0,True,False,False

By building upon its predecessor, Rising comes as a big, complete package, with lots of requested or just cool features : rollback netcode, lots of content and modes for both solo and multiplayer, a ""per character"" ladder rank (why don't more games do this?!), additional game mechanics that make the game more strategic, new ways to spend your meter outside of using your super move, and LOTS of characters.

If you didn't get into this new fighting game franchise before, now is the perfect time to do it, as you'll get all the content and work that Arcsys has built up in 4 years. All in one neat package.

If you enjoy fighting games, the ""AAA game price"" of Rising is pretty much the only thing that might make you hesitate, especialy considering we know battle passes will be coming for fancy skins. But on the other hand, the game also has a free version that can allow to play it MOBA style with a character rotation. And, seen through that lens, it's not that bad.

GBVS to me is a great fighter to learn as a first/second fighter. Lack of movement forces more footsies/frame knowledge, the simple skill button lets you ease into learning special commands easier (though I recommend you learn the technical commands in time because that is a transferable skill you'll need in all other fighters without a simple skill button/layout) and the fairly simple combo formula helps to pickup most characters somewhat quicker. However, there is a bit of depth to the simplicity which allows GBVS to shine as a fighter, rewarding fundamentals and general FG knowledge but also giving reward to those who truly navigate the game mechanics unique to GBVS.

Overall, definitely recommend as a fighter in the rotation or as a main, and if you're on the fence the Free version is worth it alone!

MORE EXPENSIVE ON STEAM FOR LATAM

[strike]The game is good (although I still like the original more, and [/strike] 66L being + is pretty much a free drive rush which is kinda dumb), online is great, lobbies are laggy as hell, but the real culprit here is the pricing. There's no regional pricing on steam, for Brazil at least. The Deluxe version on Nuuvem is the same price as the regular one on steam.  The regular version here is R$265, while there it's R$180. That's pretty significant, shame it only dropped after I had played for 6 hours. Cygames dropped the ball on this one, and dropped it HARD. This isn't a nice way to treat your playerbase.

Edit: After 15h, I retract my statement that the game is good. As a huge fan and former high level player of GBVS I HATE this game. Neutral is 66L, period. It's a pain in the ass to deal with, and not very fun to do yourself, it's pretty braindead, but the air game is super weak, with insanely strong AA conversions, so you are forced to play that ""neutral"". It's the most UNFUN fighting game I've played since....I think ever.

Plus, it's got roll back, cross play, unlockables, a full story mode and even a completely separate mode for folks to mess around when they get tired of taking a beating (or give the beating online).",1703045035,1703045035,True,19,0,0.674729526042938232,0,True,False,False

I want to respond to negative reviews that complain about the season pass price.  Yeah, the price is crazy.  But why do you even care?  In the base game you get 28 characters, of which 25 are very unique (3 are variations of typical shoto).  Ignore the season pass, wait for the unreleased characters to be on sale and then buy them at that time - if you even care about them.  Heck, SF6 launched with 18 characters with 3 shotos and Dee Jay/Guile playing basically the same and releasing one every 3 months as they are it'll take them 2 years to reach the 28 you get in this game.

OK back to the actual review.  There's so much to love here.  Most anime style games are insanely complicated, but GBFV:R is very beginner friendly.  There are easy inputs for all the moves, and even the motion inputs aren't particularly difficult.  The game is very grounded an neutral focused, meaning there's a lot of opportunity to reset.  There are combos, but again the combos aren't terribly complicated and they don't go on forever the way they do in some games.  There are a bunch of interesting gameplay mechanics that change the dynamics of getting caught in the corner and dealing with zoning as well.

The graphics are amazing.  ARC Systems has absolutely nailed the anime style and brought it to life.  Yeah, a lot of the women have big bouncing boobs, but what can you do - that's how they are in the anime, too.  Blame the source material.

The're a bunch of additional content - a couple single player modes, good training material (although the frame data display in SF6 is way better than here) .  

The rollback netcode should be table stakes for a fighting game these days, but it's still worth noting that this game has it.

I can't wait to lose more hours to it.  Speaking of which, Zooey's dragon is getting hungry so I need to go feed it.",1703002465,1703002465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ease of Access:
‚Äê--------------------------
In terms of gameplay it's both easy and nuanced. There are easy inputs that are essentially just as effective as you don't suffer any penalty when using then in a combo, that being said there are SO MANY MECHANICS and as a result SO MANY BUTTONS that you have to remember so it becomes difficulty not in terms of an individuals ability to execute commands but to remember them. As a 10+ year fighting game player I can definitely say this game has a difficulty curve, but it's probably one that more people are okay with. EG: Not getting a combo because you can't remember all the inputs doesn't feel as bad as not getting it because you can't I suppose. Unlike games like SF6 I feel very comfortable playing several characters at a similarly high level because there is a lot of crossover so long as you understand the foundational stuff which makes learning that much more rewarding (imo). At the higher level there are a lot of knowledge checks and things you have to learn in order to play the game well so it can definitely have a steep learning curve over all, though I don't think it's as frustrating as some other games. It's pretty easy to go into training mode after a loss, set the dummy to the thing you were getting hit by and test what options you have.

Balance:
--------------------------------
It's far too early to say anything relevant on balance with all the characters and changes but it's definitely safe to say that any character can win and they all have very strong tools now, with many characters flaws being resolved to at least some extent.


Non-Fighting Game Content
--‚Äê-------------------------------
This game has so many different cool things to do. You can play fall guys with guns, play crane games for prizes, do the entire story mode co-op with a friend to unlock stuff for the main fighting game. Not only that but the devs are adding new modes to the game as well as more maps for the fall guys mode so it has at least for now long term support in mind. It's all very cool and fun and makes the price tag that much more worth it if you don't play the game on a serious enough level. (You can do fall guys in the free version too).

Overall Verdict: 9/10
----------------------------------
Whether you are casual or competitive I think this is a really good first version of the game, the devs have a lot of planned support for all modes. Every character has crazy options that feel fun to use, whether you hit someone full screen with Zeta, or you just never let someone breathe with Seox each character has some crazy tools and the general gameplay is just insane! It's very rewarding to learn matchups and there are tons of things to do outside the main fighting game content. 

I think that some mechanics need tweaking (Dash attack) but overall it's an amazing game with hopefully a bright future!

They are trying to run this as a live service game and is extremely stingy with the in game currency.
You need rupees to do 10 pulls of weapon and buy other cosmetics/collectables. 
The catch is at the moment of writing this review, you only get 150 a day if you do the 3 daily quests.
To do a 10 pull on weapons, it's 500 rupees.

At the time of writing this review there is NO OTHER way of getting these and they are kept server side by the look of things. 

Do I recommend the game? 
Yes...

 It's a solid fighter that is extremely friendly to new comers and rewards the veteran too. 
It does this by having extremely simple input option, but if you input things the traditional way, you get an extra 10% damage. 

The 'fall guy' game mode is also top notch and fun. Sadly, even grinding that won't give you many rupees.

The game play is solid, art is really nice but locked behind rupees...

The handful of matches I've played online were flawless with lag, so that's a massive issue from the original fixed. The other problem, the lack of cross platform multiplayer, was also fixed.

The Grand Bruise mode, which is basically Fall Guys with Mario Kart items, has some abnormally long load times, but is overall rather enjoyable.

The regional pricing seems weird, but as someone in the US, the only pricing that is too weird is that the first character pass is the same price as the game. That's.. a choice.

My biggest issue is that the Story mode was gutted, the RPG mechanics like the weapon grid, leveling up, and the like are completely gone, instead you just select a cutscene or boss fight, and the coop seems to be entirely removed from it. I'm really curious why they would do such a thing.

Overall, while I don't plan on playing online very much, I do quite enjoy the game, and love the cast. I quite highly recommend it, especially if you didn't play the first Versus.

Also, it's really, really scummy that we don't get the mobile game codes, and Cygames only response to that is 'no comment', which is really suspicious.

This is an anomaly, an experience that was somehow violently changed just months before launch and yet came out as a complete experience for both new and seasoned fighting game players. 

What is GBVSR as a whole? it's worth your time. 

Somewhere a board of investors must be fuming, as tons of hard fought gacha money was snagged from their company bank account by the GBVSR devs whilst they made it rain all over a room of artists, coders, and system administrators. And while some of those dollars may have been used to ingest adderall in a crushed up form, all of those dollars ended up as fuel for this love letter to the fighting game community.

GBVS (not rising) released on February 6th, 2020, which is also known as the worst time in history to develop a game that relies on local multiplayer, and that game had no chance due to netcode that could barely provide a solid experience for someone in the same state. Now I can play my UK homies and talk about how I leave my tea bags in my cup for the entire time I am drinking it, while I seamlessly get teabagged by them with the power of perfect netcode. 

But how does it play? To those new to fighting games you may want to grab a ladder as the skill floor to enjoy this game is actually below you. 

The best part of a fighting game is when the player becomes the character. When you can press a button off of instinct and the masterpiece of your character punching stuff occurs in front of you. This flow state is usually something that requires hundreds of hours with one character, and if you end up not vibing after that then you have to retrain habits which is even harder than learning in the first place. 

Not. This. Game. 

Auto-combos, simple inputs, and common routes put every character at your fingertips. While this is a huge improvement for the new player experience, the most insane thing is how much depth there still is for seasoned players. Mind games, extensive defensive options, and new universal bravery point systems add the needed layers to raise the skill ceiling where we would all expect a fighting ceiling to be- way higher where I can reach, and that's OK. 

In only months the developers were able to fine tune lists of major complaints from the betas, and they completely overhauled major universal systems. Despite major scope changes late in the dev cycle, this game has still released in amazing shape so I feel comfortable saying this is only the beginning for this game, and it is absolutely awesome.

The game is a large step up in core gameplay compared to the first but a step down in certain other areas:
Upgrades:
>Superior mechanics
>Slightly better graphics and effects
>New side mode for online
>New unlockables

and some more general stuff I probably can't think of, however then comes the few downsides, to jump to the point: These only really apply to people who aren't gonna play heavily into the Online content

Downgrades:
>RPG mode is gone entirely
>The character exp system is skewed
>Lack of solo replayability and unlockability
>rupees/gold is screwed entirely


To get down to it: Story mode is pretty much like a Guilty Gear mode now as it's basically just one big movie but with only about 4 or so cinematic cutscenes while the rest is just character models and dialogue boxes, long spanning conversations with very little between especially in the final, NEW, addition to it(for now, DLC may add more). There are only a few actual fights in the new section and the ability to play anyone in missions has been basically removed because RPG mode was removed as well. The solo experience has been shot in the foot while all online and multiplayer has been buffed; normally this isn't a bad thing since this is a fighting game after all but in my case and a small crowds RPG mode and solo replayability was a big selling point to the first game since RPG mode not only had co-op but also allowed you the chance to unlock tons of stuff really fast. Rising sorta lacks all of that. Story mode fights are also kinda pointless now since there are no rewards to the challenges, completing it gives you nothing and even if you lose fights it doesn't seem to matter since the game seems to progress either way(I can only speak for the first fight in chapter 3 but I lost and the story kept moving, I didn't lose any other but I feel the game possibly doesn't care weather you win or lose since it offers the ability to just skip fights anyway.)

Rupies/Gold are basically impossible to get in any fast method as the only way to get any is character levels(listed on each in game chart when) and dailies(maxing out at 150 for 3, each only rewards 50) meaning using the rupie shop is basically a non option outside of times where the devs give free bonus coins in the gift box. This kneecapping results in the only way to viably get ANY if not all of the unlockables that aren't locked to the crane game in lobbies; next up the the level system, it's just kinda fucked if you don't feel like playing majority online. Local matches give no exp, arcade exclusively only gives you 10 exp per fight no matter the level and, since RPG mode is gone, there's no other options to get exp than hop online. Now with Online exp you cap out at 2 outcomes: 300 exp for a win, 150 exp for a loss. These do no change even if you go on ranked. 

Now it's more of a foresight thing but this means stuff like character weapons and colors REQUIRES you to play EVERY character separately to level them all up individually because weapons cost 1000+ rupies in shop and there is no quick way to get even 500 rupies quickly.

Again, none of these are major issues since most people are here for the online, really nice by the way, but for people like me that liked all the solo options in the first game it's kinda a hard loss of content because nothing took it's place and unlocking things is now more or less a tedious game of learn basically every character and then as many online fights as possible just to scrape close to max out(the level 500 reward isn't even attainable in any other way like other weapons), no to mention stuff like rupies and the rupie shop and tickets are tied to the server meaning when they go down those features all go dead as well.

Honestly, I'd almost hope they just give out an option to pay to unlock all cosmetics since that's almost preferable to having to try and grind out EVERY SINGLE character just to have all customization options.

To reiterate: The main aspects of the game are fine if not great, but the solo that used to be there is gone and dead as far as things are concerned now. 

Essentially the process of unlocking is a matter of get gud or hope for opponents weaker then you so you can get your 300 exp to unlock the colors and weapons because rupies aren't viable to rely on and there's no way to get them otherwise, lock in or fail to get the most out of the game pretty much.",1702846675,1702847219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

poor regional pricing

Now, you're probably thinking : ""Why do you care about PvE content in a fighting game?"" and my answer would be ""And why would I not?"". This is 2023, not the 90'. Many fighting games have solid PvE content; and Cygames isn't exactly a small company either.

[h2]The good :[/h2]

- Rollback netcode. This was a highly requested feature, and we're glad they listened.

- Big roster of heroes from the get-go.

- A free to play mode for people who want to play the game without spending dosh, albeit with many limitations, of course.

- New ""Fall Guys""-like mode to relax besides the fighting part.

- New story chapters.

- Lots of unlockables to grind for.

[h2]The bad :[/h2]

- Gutted PvE content. All coop content has been removed (story, essentially), and the weapon system as well. I understand the weapon mode was not very popular, but why remove the coop? It was so much fun, I spent dozens of hours with people and I had a blast. The code was already there with the previous game, why gut it out? Now it's basically some story and nothing else. Absolutely unoriginal, especially when compared to the game it originated from, and also from the previous iteration.

- Doing anything is slow af : Connecting to the server is slow, finding/loading a Grand Bruise game is slow, starting a fight is slow (seriously, there literally no assets to load, why the fuck is this taking so much time even on an NVMe?).

- Lots of cosmetics to obtain, but the grind is AWFUL. Like, capital-letters kind of awful. Maxing a character to get all their unlockables requires way over a hundred hours and THOUSANDS of fights. And, mind you, online fights. Because a PvP win gives you 300xp and a loss 150xp, whereas a PvE win gives you 10xp and 0xp for a loss. Yes, you read that right, that's a 30 times difference. Cygames is actively sabotaging/punishing their players by telling them ""Go play PvP matches or gtfo"". I get that PvP is the lifeline of the game, but that's probably not going to work out like Cygames expects it to be.

- Rupies, a currency used to buy cosmetics, is awfully slow to collect, as it's mostly time-gated. And some stuff requires [i]a lot[/i] of rupies to unlock.

- Some DLCs are awfully priced. 20 bucks for alternative system voices is an absolute scam. It should cost way less than that. Hell, I'd even dare to say it should've been free. What the fuck Cygames?
The UmaMusume DLC is also super expensive. Cygames is preying on their fans, and I'm honestly pretty disappointed as it's not what I've known the company for during those many years playing their games... way before GBVS was even a thing. 


[h2]Conclusion :[/h2]

If you're here for the PvP, and I imagine a lot of you are, you'll be satisfied with this iteration. Whether or not you find the grind and loading awful is something you'll have to experience for yourself. Try out the free mode first, obviously.
If you're somebody who enjoyed the PvE content in the previous iteration... this game, at least in its current state, should be a [i]hard pass[/i] for you. Big time pass.
Cygames wants you online, but is this gonna play out like they expect it to be? Many, many people are just here for the serial codes coming with the PS editions in order to get juicy freebies in the original gacha game. These people are never going to touch your game anyway. And to top that off, you alienate your PvE playerbase too? Yeah, sorry but I'm not sure it's gonna play out that well.
But the game just came out, there's still hope for redemption in the future.


[b]Verdict :[/b] If you're a PvP fighting game fan, I'd say go for it. You can't go wrong, especially with a F2P mode included. If you're a PvE player, wait for a big sale (no less than 50%).",1702817110,1702817110,False,33,4,0.534346461296081543,0,True,False,False

The last fighting game I played a lot was Marvel Vs Capcom 2. I thought my days enjoying fighters were over when i developed carpal tunnel in my left wrist, but this game has allowed me to enjoy fighting games again. I don't know much about the Granblue characters or lore, but I do know that I haven't had this much fun playing a fighting game in a very long time. The simplified inputs have allowed me to enjoy the strategy, mindgames, and competition again. The arcade mode, story mode, and party game mode ""Grand Bruise"" are all fun additions to the core online versus mode. I'm also very impressed at how smoothly it plays online even with 100+ millisecond ping differences between opponents. In about 200 matches I've only encountered one or two noticeable instances of lag. As a programmer myself that's quite a technical accomplishment. The developers should be very proud of what they've achieved here.

As with any FG, i recommend to start with a friend if you are new but is in no way necessary if you don't mind losing while you grasp the basics.

Going off of first impressions i would highly recommend this game as a fighting game that has many bonuses for those who don't enjoy fighting online and even some features disconnected from the fighting game in general. Although this review will primarily cover the fighting game as its my preferred aspect, i will briefly mention some activities i'm aware of. As it's my first impressions as a casual player on launch day i might get some things wrong and will try to update the review if i do.

Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising is a 2d anime fighting game with a strong focus on ground based neutral. The tutorial in this game is honestly great and teaches you the basics of fighting games and the game itself quite well while giving an overview of the mechanics, some but not all of which il go over below to help you decide if you wanna give it a try.

To overview some mechanics here:
Characters in this game have your usual light medium and heavy attack which chain into themself for a 3 hit combo, while special moves use a cooldown system in this game, where the cooldown duration is based on if you used the light, medium or Ex version of the attack (besides on Nier my beloved). Due to this managing your cooldowns well while keeping an eye on your opponent gives it a different kind of skill expression then your traditional fg while making it easier to see openings especially for those who are new to the ganre, however this managing is only required as you keep playing and plays mostly a minor role unless you spam EX moves. The game has a built in combo limit to reinforce the neutral by preventing overly long combos, however the combos are still decently long enough to feel satisfying to practice and pull off. You can block jumping attacks while in the air, but not attacks from a grounded character. Meter gain in this game is quite high especially on offense. Moving forward, especially walking grants extra meter as well. 

The community:
As with any community review, its anecdotal but what i will say is the game IP originates from a gatcha, hence many characters but definitely not all are designed to be sexually appealing, sometimes even comedically and such the community is what you would expect in that environment but is otherwise very wholesome. So far my experience with this community has been very positive and friendly so i only have positives to give it.

Art style & animation:
The art style of this game is similar to other games like strive or DNF duel, in terms of a 3dish anime look while playing entirely 2d. 
The stages and especially the moves in this game are stunning and have a consistent style that really sells the character they are apart of, from animations to battle effects, it makes most of the roster really pop out in a unique way. 
The supers in this game are especially well done, most having wonderfully looking animations with a really heavy impact, while also being varied in length, they are just short enough where they are not tedious even on repeat viewing while being long enough to give a good feeling and are in my opinion perfectly done.

Customization & progression:
GBFVR features a unique character progression system, where playing online matches with friends or strangers online lets you level up the character you play, letting you unlock new cosmetics and in game profile customization's. While the rewards are a bit lacking and some are acquirable in different ways like buying them with the currency you get by just playing, its nice to see a fighting game give a sense of progression to dedicating to a character and the ability to express that.
The Grand bruise aka the fall guys like minigames also feature a separate progression system to give a sense of progression even outside of playing the characters in the fighting game.
The character customization ranges from the usual color change to the ability to change weapons. Seeing as some characters do not have weapons, they instead get to equip alternative headpieces like Belial wearing sunglasses. Overall quite expressive for a fighting game, especially 2d anime fighting games but not really comparable to Tekken or the like.

Free to Play:
GBFVR has taken a similar approach to some other fighting games such as DOA allowing you to play and try the game for free, and honestly this free to play version is quite charitable. It is important to note that the game does not aim to follow a free to play model and the free version is more intended to give you a good taste of the full game, which it does very well, allowing a good collection of hours of content in the f2p version alone.

In the free to play version you will have access to...

-Gran, a good shoto character with a strong and easy to understand kit for a new player. As well as 3 rotating characters to try
- Casual, Ranked quickplay and Online lobbies, letting you play with strangers or friends online, including cross platform.
- Part 1 of the 3 from the Story mode letting you see if the story is your hook on the game.
- Arcade mode and training mode with some minor limitations letting you practice to your hearts content.
- The Grand bruise mode aka Fall guys like game mode, letting you enjoy the fighting game without the fighting game.

There are limitations however as again, you are intended to buy the game eventually, some to note...

- Default customization for the avatar and in game profile.
- Partners that act like a coach that gives commentary being limited to gran, vyrn and lyria
- No Private room matches (though this is unnecessary anyway in my opinion with online lobbies allowing the same and more functions)
- Character level capped at 80, while legend level is capped at 40

The free version really lets you enjoy all aspects of the game at a reasonable pace with the character rotation as well as the high quantity and quality of content the experience provides. It really is generous, and if you are gran main it outright spoils you by giving you the fighting game experience for free.

While some might consider the fact that most of the cast is locked behind the paid version a negative, please again consider that the game is intended to be bought and the free version is more intended as a demo. Granblue fantasy versus rising holds a somewhat niche IP outside the east while also being an anime fighting game, which can be quite a niche ganre as well so making the game entirely free to play with just paid cosmetics would not be realistically sustainable for the level of polish budget and quality given game like other modern free to play live service games outside the ganre, which hold much less risk and have a wider audience.

To original owners:
If you played the original game like myself, i will say that this game to be worth overhaul to get with far more then enough in the game to justify the re-release considering the player count of the original and the fact it went as low as 2$ on various occasions, a free upgrade would not have been possible. I genuinely hate the trend fighting games follow with re-releasing at full price like Xrd>rev2 or the entire blazblue franchises business model, however this is one of the few times i feel its justifiable and done mostly right with the proper addition and tweaking of the mechanics, visuals and game modes.


Conclusion:
If you have gotten this far into the review, i believe you should give the game, if just the free version a try. The community is nice and the game is a fantastic entry for new players and very fun with friends. 
Thank you very much for reading my review, and i hope to play against you in the game. With all that said, Nier please step on me, i beg.",1702757302,1702757302,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I think the devs went well beyond with providing content for this one, there's all kinds of little details in the game that make it stand out like actually well done & intuitive training mode options (so even a lazy ass like me can finally learn some combos and punishes), lots of things to unlock, photo modes & lobby characters & artwork, and if you feel like chilling there's even a Fall Guys mode. Even the lobbies are fully 3D with...platforming and flying and crane games? And there's a guestbook. And avatars that comment on your matches. It's insane. Plus the OST is apparently partly composed by Nobuo Uematsu and totally rocks. Naturally there's quick casual & ranked queues so you can just sit in training mode as well. Both English & Japanese dubs are solid.

The netcode is also some of the best I've seen, if the connection is stable, you can even play 200ms matches no problem and so far I've encountered zero problems with it, not even disconnects. Another thing the game does well is adding simple inputs as the main way to play, while you can still do technical inputs aka motion inputs (and most of the time I still do them), it makes playing the game way more lenient and less likely to cause hand cramps. And there's still a damage reward for doing technical inputs in neutral which they should keep at least, I wouldn't mind if even combos benefited from technical inputs, but at the moment I think it's a nice balance of both, you can mix technical & simple inputs as you want and it feels really convenient without taking away motion inputs completely.

People complain about the price tag, but I feel it's justified for what it is given that there's a free version; it would be nice if they could fix the regional pricing however. Still, I hope it doesn't ruin something that is otherwise a chef's kiss fighting game and a great comeback for GBVS.",1702744804,1702744929,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Pro
+more deep combat than its prequel 
+rollback netcode (played on JP server with 110+ ping rarely notice the difference)
+Fallguy mode to relax
+Character skin not just color (altho only Gran and Djeeta atm.)

Mid
-+Overhead attack removed which i used a lot in prequel game (instead it's a run button now lol)
-+Story Mode remove grid system from prequel which i like it, removing it make the story mode feel quick to clear (I cleared chapter 3 in like 2hrs with reading all dialogue)

Con
-Free version can't play Room Match with your friend
-Expensive game price for some region if compared to prequel.
-Very expensive Deluxe Character Pass in every region excet JP, check steamdb.com and change currency to Japanese Yen. In my region Character Pass = Base game price which is bs.

Can't remember, brain tormented

Isolated, lost in my senses

Desecrated‚Äìaching, my spirit

Never, ever no‚Äìforever, this endless war

And yet, I bet, no regret, I could handle more

 

""Destroy it all...""

 

That call... So defined, so specific; carved on my mind, hieroglyphics

Ahhh... I get it. It's proof of the truth, the darkest pact

No excuse to ensue, better chew‚Äìon that; the chronic track inflicting naked fact

 

 

It is what it is, but where are we?

World in my hand, palm of the damned

Chaos unleased, the fall of man

Fallen belief‚Äìdeceased, demon's command

Infernal, inferno, infamous malevolence

So evil, medieval, meticulous irreverence

 

""Destroy it all...""

 

You crawl with no vision; soul burned, cruel ambition imprisoned

But I'm proud to present my ascent, your torment: the dark prince

Ruler and ruled, king of delusion; mock me mortal? Final conclusion

 

 

Let me feel the power that could rip me to shreds

Can't last one more hour, how soon will I meet my end?

I can't return to those days that I've forgotten

But the memories fade, leaving me thinking...

 

How many times will my world revolve, future resolved, lost child in eternity, darkness evolved?

 

Doesn't matter much, deception: fated, anxiety: clutch

Clutch more souls‚ÄìA few thousands to live, a few million's enough

'Nough. To become, to succumb, to crumble, to plunge, to feel the hatred

To grow numb

If you have not bought the previous Granblue Versus game this is great value and a great game.

Rollback runs great, ASW doing their visual wizardry, featuring some of the best tracks from the original gacha, the new mechanics add a fun new layer to the fighting itself, a healthily sized roster of character, the new online is very charming etc.

I am more ambivalent than actually negative. But the main things to criticize are:
[list]
[*]The coop rpg mode from the first game got completely stripped out and I was very much looking forward to playing that with a friend and there is only very minimal amounts of new content in the new story mode so it cant be that it was ""too much effort"" to keep it going. Big shame that that is gone. It offered a great way to get familiar with some aspects of the game while having its own challenges and time sinks.
[*]Unlocking skins/colors in the game takes an absurd amount of time through arcade mode. It takes 3 full playthroughs of arcade (difficulty doesn't change anything) to get even past level 1 unlock (out of 100+) on a single character.
[*]The price (outside of no regional pricing) is abysmal for people who have supported the previous game and even worse for people who bought the dlcs. Outside of rollback and the visual overhaul there would only be 4 characters and a pittance of solo content that is new for those people. There were no minor discounts or rewards for moving over.
[*]Season pass.

Rising strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and complexity, having developed the ""easy input or complex input"" system that SF6 uses today, but GBF was doing it 3 years ago, and it's even better in Rising.  

Pros:
- Highly accessible to people new to the genre.  Specials can be input using a single button press, which the game expects you to do. You aren't punished for doing it, either, except with a 10% damage reduction to the special. 
- The cooldown system for specials has been revamped. Using easy inputs no longer incurs a higher cooldown on the move, now the cooldowns only come from using the strongest version of the move, which is a good balance given their strength. 
- The Single Player Content!!! If you played Tekken 3 back in the day, or Mortal Kombat in the 3D era, you remember what it was like to unlock tons of content just by playing single player, without having to micro-transaction everything. This game offers that experience, including a Fall Guy style online game. There's a TON of good unlocks and you can do them all through gameplay.  There's story modes, arcade modes, mini games, all of it.
- The combat, while accessible, is still very deep. There's a *lot* of systems to keep track of and interact.  It's overwhelming at first, but if you watch a couple videos about the game and then go through training it will all click.  It'll take some time before it's second nature (things like Bravery are extremely important, for example) but it's not a barrier to entry for new players.  
- If you just want to mash buttons with the homies, this is the game to do it. 
- Rollback netcode.
-Crossplay.
- HUGE roster, and if you get the $75 version then you get all of this *and* 6 more characters in the future. 
-It is the most beautiful game ArcSys has ever made, which means it's the most beautiful fighting game on the market, bar none. 


CONS: 
-Controller mapping is odd.  It sometimes sense if you're using a PS5 controller but sometimes it doesn't, giving you the Xbox control configuration even when not using an Xbox controller. 
-I noticed a tiny bit of stuttering and tearing on guard breaks, I'm not sure if that's a me problem or a game problem.  The performance is otherwise perfect.
-I'm sure there's people (like me) who played the original GBFV and are salty about this being a re-release. I promise that there is a ton of new here, both in terms of mechanics and content, but I can definitely see someone being annoyed they have to buy it all over again. The plus side is that the $50 gets you everything you originally had, you don't need to rebuy Seox, for example, it's the full roster. 

Overall, this is an easy 10/10.  I can't imagine what complaints anyone could have with the gameplay, art, or roster.  Everything is bigger, better, and prettier.

Has multiple modes that even non-fighting game players would enjoy; highly recommended to play this if you want to get into the genre. Cosmetics in-game are all unlockable for free without needing microtransactions, so that's good.

From the looks of it, the devs actually pay attention to community feedback.

Biggest complaint is that there is no regional pricing. Other than that, it's a great game.
It has a free version too which has access to lobbies, ranked, and the story mode from the first game. Go play that one if you want to try it first (or if you're a Gran main).",1702630452,1702642154,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is little penalty for simple inputs, no 5-minute combos, where you can start a game and get some tea while your opponent is doing stuff. I wish there was some feedback that the game would give me. Currently, it is very unclear to me when it is my turn to press a button or what would be the time to mash back, but overall, it is probably the most responsive fighter I have tried.

The single-player mode is where things fall apart, though. If you had a previous game you are already 90% done with a story and it was so good originally that it had something like 5% completion rate. Plot density of the average anime beach episode. Never played Fall Guys, so no interest there as well. And it would be fine, if they would have OK bots to train with, but the difficulty goes.

I love that they made it so you can go platform around the islands and there are cabinets stashed away. The chibi avatars are great and have a lot of character, much thanks to the fact that the designs are based off Gran Blues, a web-comic that Cygames runs that gives a more humorous side of the Granblue world. I'm glad they stuck with that over something like Strive's lobby system.

Gran Bruise is a fun minigame, but I wonder how long it will last compared to the fighting format. 

The gutting of the RPG mode is a letdown, as that was one of the most unique features for the series, and I felt it would help give it more variety a la like Street Fighter 6 did with its World Tour mode. Sure, those modes are short lived for most of the FGC players, but they help to bring in players that would otherwise find the whole thing too daunting. The Single player mode still serves as a decent beat 'em up with VN-like cutscenes in between the brawls. If you are new to the franchise, and are curious about the Granblue main story, then the story mode does a decent job of giving you a quick look at the earlier chapters (and the new chapter gives the Granblue vets something quite surprising). 

Training mode: The UI feels a little cluttered in those mode, but it's not too bad. I enjoy that the game has somewhat of a built in system that gives information on frames. It's not as robust as SF6's training mode's frame info, but it's a welcome addition. The combo tutorials are a little cumbersome, there's no option to advance to another combo once you complete one, and you have to bring the menu back up to move on.

There's a Figurine mode for those like to mess around with the character models and other objects. It's pretty in-depth too, but not really my cup of tea. 

The guestbook feature reminds me of the Miiverse posts. I hope they don't filter it too much, as the stupidity of the posts is great entertainment for me. 

Fighting gameplay wise? It's simplistic but has some depth. For newcomers, Arcsys does a good job of allowing things like autocombos on normals, and the new simplified controls makes all special input moves to be done at the touch of a button. Unlike the last game, where using the simple input meant the move would go on a longer cooldown compared to the classic, technical input, the only difference now is that technical inputs do roughly 10% more damage, and cooldowns are now the same. I think it's very much easier to try this game because of these features, but don't be surprised that vets of the genre are still dominant. The controls are just the tip of the iceberg.

 It's not going to overshadow something like SF6 in technical play, but it doesn't go too hard like other anime fighters where characters are giving Dante from Devil May Cry a run for his money on combos. The game play is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. It's surprisingly grounded, despite the chaos of all the animations and effects going on. Is it balanced? Are the new mechanics busted? I dunno, the game has been out for two days, but I'm not pulling my hair out yet. 

If you're a fan of Granblue and fighting games similar to Streets, I recommend this game a lot. If you're on one side of the spectrum of being only a fan of Granblue or being a hardcore fighting game player, I think it's a tougher sale for sure. For Granblue vets, there's Relink just a month or so away. For FGC players, well, I don't think it's going to win over the Street Fighter crowd anytime soon, and most other anime fighters may find the game too grounded for their tastes.",1702628618,1702628618,True,2,0,0.536784708499908447,0,True,False,False

The lobby system is gotdamn beautiful. queue up into ranked or casual, explore the islands for hidden cabs to play on, PLAY FUTBOL with your player avatars, etc. The crane to unlock character colors, player badges, digital figures, etc. is neat and no premium currency that I know of. Coins and xp that you earn in single player modes (outside of story) could use some bumping up though.

The game's OOZING with fun, weeby characters with tons of personality, lots of character-specific dialogue pre- and post-match, each character has a progression pass to help you unlock colors and things for your favorite characters, AND YOU GET A PARTNER AVATAR OF ONE OF THE GRANBLUE CHARACTERS TO BE YOUR COACH DURING YOUR GAMES.

THIS GAME HAS CROSS PLAY SUPPORT AND ROLLBACK NETCODE (the good kind for my non-FGC friends).

The Granblue community, whether it be thru their mobile gacha, or GBVS previously, has been very kind and accepting to newer players and the game IS graspable to attain a level of skill that you'd be content with if you're coming into this game as a newer player.

It's training mode is great for both lab monsters and new players alike. if you want frame data, you've got it. if you want combo trials that let you freely practice to your heart's content, you've got it. If you want to learn how to punish a particular character's move, there's a real possibility the game has a lesson for it. If you want to learn your character's gameplan, the game has a lesson for it. 

The game also has a Fall Guys mode using your player avatars, AND a visual novel/side-scroller beat'em up/fighting game/RPG story mode, so even if you're not big into the fighting game aspect, there are several other ways to enjoy the systems in the game on your terms. THESE MODES ARE (MOSTLY) AVAILABLE TO PLAYERS WHO ALSO PLAY THE FREE VERSION OF THE GAME (you only have access to the first of 3 chapters in story mode though.)

Namely:
- No Connection filter for Casual Ranked play. As someone from Australia, I am being lumped in with players for SEA, Korea, Japan and other regions with a general ballpark of 300-400 ping meaning that they are a slideshow and next to unplayable.
- While the lobbies are fine, they seem to have some performance issues even on strong systems so perhaps an option to turn down the number of players visible, similar to what Street Fighter 6 did to reduce the load on PCs. 
- Speaking of lobbies, it would be amazing if we could get some for our specific region (Oceania), It boggles my mind why it was a thing in the earlier Granblue but not in Rising and is a giant oversight.
- Needs a better guide to basic functions in the game, not the tutorial/character tutorials they're fine I mean having to go looking to turn off the in game partner, look up my character's level and things like that were a pain in the neck because it wasn't explained anywhere.

Inputs can be simple or you can choose to add a bit of complexity to them if you want a bit more control.
Story mode is solid for a fighting game.

But the one thing I want to REALLY praise is the built in explanations of each characters moves, which explains in detail what every move does, if its an overhead and any special things about it, and the cherry on top is the inclusion of a multitude of combos you can just load up in training mode and really get you started with understanding the mechanics of your character and give you some knowledge before you go play online, REALLY helped me win my first few games.

The new features added to this title are:
„Éª4 new characters, each with unique intro and outro with all other characters in the game
„ÉªA new partner system where you can pick ANY of the playable character as commentary and they'll encourage/trash talk you. (btw, that is A LOT of new voice recording to be done, and the Japanese VAs for this game are all extremely expensive)
„ÉªNew mechanism with Raging Strike + Raging Chain, and the Brave Point system means the overall pacing and game plan would be drastically different. With new mechanism comes with new things to watch out for, new ways you can extend combo, and new mind games to bait opponent into wasting BP, etc.
„ÉªMost characters (with a couple of exceptions) get 4 brand new ultimate version of their specials, which can be comboed into or out of, drastically changing up combo route options. Plus all characters get 3 new dash attacks as an universal mechanism, and all characters can do the new auto combo finisher (the high/low mix 3rd hit)
„ÉªBrand new lobby featuring new party game mode akin to Mario Party/Fall Guys
„ÉªA brand new act for the story mode (voice acted, and even featured a new original character)
„ÉªA new photo mode where you can pose characters with various prop and effect placement
„ÉªOf course, the much requested rollback netcode as well as crossplay

My only real gripe with it is that they significantly simplified the ""RPG Mode"" that was in the original. Now it's just called the Story Mode and it lost all of the JRPG elements. No more gearing and loot farming, and you don't level up characters in this mode for more stats anymore. Presumably, this is to reduce grinding and focus just on the narrative but imo, this is a big miss. It lost most of the features that made the RPG mode so unique in the original GBVS. They even removed local co-op, which is a huge shame.

It's quite clear all the development focus went into the online modes, which are in fact fantastic. If you're looking to buy this for the core fighting game experience, it's still an easy recommendation.

The game even provides practical combos to practice in training mode.

For me personally, these are development efforts worth paying for, but your mileage will vary based on your region‚Äôs pricing and personal taste.

It would‚Äôve been a really nice gesture to give discounts to original GBVS players, particularly if they invested in DLC.

The main reason I wanted to write this review, however, is RPG Mode and co-op - or rather, the removal of these.

Co-op is straight up gone - online and local - which sucks, as [i]any[/i] cooperative modes are extremely rare in fighting games. Why not occasionally put all these awesome combat mechanics to use [i]with[/i] your friends instead of against them? Switch things up after a few rounds of sparring before calling it a night?

As for the rest of RPG Mode, it has been paired down to the story segments, cool boss fights, and a select few ‚Äúbeat ‚Äòem up‚Äù common enemy segments. I actually don‚Äôt mind this, as IMO it puts a better emphasis on the highlights of the original RPG Mode. Level-based stats and weapon grids also bite the dust, which I don‚Äôt mind either - the bosses now feel much more balanced and enjoyable to fight with fixed stats, especially on Hard Mode. The more interesting abilities remain, allowing you to choose between various heals, buffs, and debuffs as before, which is great.

Honestly, I feel like most of the contentious changes to RPG Mode could‚Äôve been mitigated if they improved - or even just kept - the 100-floor Tower of Babyl from GBVS. Imagine how difficult that would get without your level-up stats and weapon grids? What if it was improved to be a randomized climb - with denser enemy groups, frequent character bosses, and sharply increasing difficulty - just to see how far you could get for fun? For high scores shown on your in-game profile? [i]What if you could do that co-op with a friend[/i] after beating the snot out of each other in lobby matches?? If someone from Cygames or Arksys is for some reason reading English reviews on Steam, please try this in a dev jam or something!

Another critique that comes to mind is that the menus and overall presentation feel less unique than the original. Gone are the beautiful main screens (and RPG Mode interface), replaced instead by a tabbed interface much closer to Strive. I‚Äôm all for function over fashion, it‚Äôs just a bummer some of the original‚Äôs flair is gone.

Overall, I still give Rising a thumbs up, because at the end of the day it‚Äôs a fun, richly featured fighter that deserves some time in the spotlight. I just wish it capitalized on the strengths of the original‚Äôs unique co-op mode. That could really set it apart!

[h3]Good: [/h3]
GBVS:R is a significant improvement over the original GBVS with an engine overhaul and the addition of rollback** and crossplay alongside all of the GBVS DLC characters are included in the new base roster. The gameplay mechanic changes are interesting and add a bit more depth to what was previously a very simple and straightforward game. The expanded lobby system and mini-games breathe more life by providing filler and side content.

**Contrary to some public opinions, rollback is very expensive to add retroactively. NRS said it costed them ~8 man-hour-years when they did it for MKX, or in other words, a full team of engineers worked on it for 9 months. Even after that, it required some engineers to continue working part-time. I can understand why they launched GBVS:R as a new game; if it were an optional DLC update, then players would be divided between those with the update and those without for online play. It would be near impossible to justify the financial cost of a free update when expending likely a year+ of development resources on the engine rework plus additional characters and add-ons. While adding rollback can be cheaper for PC only games and significantly easier for games from past generation hardware that do not need to run on said hardware, it's very different in cases like this.

Altogether, this makes GBVS:R a more attractive buy than the original, with significantly more content, a more expansive roster, and playable online in geographically separated regions (finally). 

On top of that, the free edition is [b]huge[/b]. Letting people try the game and test all of the systems, use online lobbies, etc. is very generous of them and allows anyone to try the game before buying. That helps, given the game is not cheap. It also doesn't have restrictions on playtime so if someone is on a budget, they could play indefinitely in the free edition until the game goes on sale. It's great for getting friends to give the game a shot for a session or two as well. I did see a complaint that the download is separate from the actual game if you buy it, but honestly I don't think that's a huge drawback given the download is ""only"" 21 GB and again, it's literally free. 

Minor note, but the lead composers for Granblue also worked on Final Fantasy and Xenoblade. Insane.

[h3]Bad: [/h3]
Unfortunately, while a full price tag is ""fine"" for a complete game, it does feel bad for supporters of the original GBVS who are paying twice over. There also seems to be mixed reception involving the lack of regional pricing. I am also not a fan of the filter or bloom they use in character intros and outros. 

As a keyboard player, I haven't experienced any major issues that are being reported in other reviews, although I did notice that the wrong button is indicated to ""Play Sample"" in combo trials. I don't mind small issues like that as long as they get worked out relatively quickly. 

[h3] Day 1 Take: [/h3]
The game is enjoyable and much more playable online than the original GBVS. It's significantly better value as well, albeit with the caveat of no regional pricing for those whom that affects. I would tentatively recommend GBVS:R to anyone who is a fan of fighting games, especially novices and beginners due to the accessibility of this game. The free edition is a very low-commitment way of dipping anyone's toes (especially friends for a non-committal game night) into the genre and trying before you buy, or as a way to play while waiting for sales.

Considering how the original GBVS received multiple DLC passes and fairly sizable seasonal tournaments in Japan despite releasing at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic without rollback netcode, I look forward to what GBVS:R will get over the coming years. Hopefully they are able to react to the current issues facing them and forge out a solid nook in the community.",1702583074,1702584000,True,4,0,0.524048388004302979,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Rollback and crossplay (so thats nice...as long as the game stays alive)
Combat is slightly more in-depth
A little bit more cosmetics (you can change outfits now...but for only 2 characters)

Cons:
Pricing (This product should at most be a 30 dollar dlc for the last game)
Only 4 new chars (SO YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GET THE SEASON PASS FOR EXTRA CHARS!! YAY...AND IT ONLY COST AS MUCH AS THE GAME)
Artificial progression (you'll now have to start maining every char to lvl 300 to unlock all the old cosmetics and a few new ones, the new ones are at the end of the cosmetic staircase)

Other:
You should be able to change to the og GBFV artstyle in settings (the new artstyle's bloom is quite heavy, this is just personal preference)
You should be able to choose technical inputs for Djeeta's SBA

The game is deep but very accessible and boasts beautiful anime graphics.
Netcode seems stable and smooth, but I've only played against friends.
The game is more on the slower and more grounded side, compared to traditional ""anime fighting games"", which I personally very much enjoy (with SF4 being my all time favorite fighting game for now).

Can't say anything about the singleplayer content since I'm an online sweatlord. For people like me, this game could be very much worth it.

Don't mind most of the chinese reviews. The regional pricing for this game seems weird, and the game is pretty expensive there.

I'm still not sure how the meta will evolve and if I'll dislike the game in 6 months or so (since I don't like SF6 as much anymore with the drive rush meta and balance). But this remains to be seen.

It has a lot of characters, a story mode and arcade mode, rollback and crossplay online, and a variety of colours and weapon skins for all characters. It seems pretty typical fighting game content to me.

probably the best 2D fighter i've played in a long time

[b]PRICING:[/b]
- Base price is around 30% lower than the first game (in my country). But still too expensive for what it is. I noticed the Deluxe Character Pass is the same price as the base game. That's BS. Also colors should not be paid DLC, that stuff takes like 2 minutes to make.

- Free version is great, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem of the full version forcing people to pay for a bunch of characters they'll probably never use. I'd be perfectly happy if I could just buy the one or two characters I care about.


[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]
- It's a fighting game but it doesn't really feel like one. There's a big difference between classic fighters like SF2 and more recent fighters like Guilty Gear. In recent fighters it doesn't really feel like the characters are exchanging hits, and their movements are so clunky and floaty with barely a semblance of gravity weight. That said, the feel of jumping/gravity in this is way better than other recent fighters, with the obvious exception of Melty.

- On the same note, I can't help but shake the feeling that this is one of those fighters that was made by light users who don't actually play fighting games. You know, people who played Street Fighter to see the endings and never figured out how to do any special moves. It's completely different from a fighter like Melty.

- Fall Guys mode is great, but feels unpolished. Lacks basic features such as queueing with friends and displaying how many are waiting in queue.


[/b]NETPLAY:[/b]
- This game's netplay support should be THE standard for ALL fighting games. Crossplay and rollback are MASSIVE pluses. It also does not block you from playing with other countries, unlike Melty. All I think when I play this is ""I wish Melty had decent netplay like this"", but Type-Moon or French Bread seem hell-bent on ensuring people can't enjoy their game.

- Tried the netplay in the beta with a friend on the other side of the world and aside from a few occasional brief freezes, we had no problems.

- I've seen other people have server dropout issues because there are too many people playing and the server can't handle it.


[b]VISUALS/AUDIO/PRESENTATION:[/b]
- Overall presentation is very nice. But maybe a little overcomplicated or intimidating. The main menu has so many options.

- Inconsistent animation frame rate is jarring. For example, some animations are very fluid, and then suddenly the character will do a 4fps pose or something. Lobby is especially ugly because it looks like it runs at 10fps.

- The music just sounds like background noise to me. Like most fighting games nowadays. A friend showed me that this game uses remixes of the original game's music. But it still doesn't sound like good fighting game remixes to me. Look at RAITO's remixes of visual novel character music into fighting game music. That's how you do it. RAITO is THE best at that.


[b]LOCALIZATION:[/b]
- EN translations are sometimes correct, but often extremely incorrect. They often write something completely different from what's being said. For example: Djeeta vs Gran, the JP convo is ""Don't worry, we're us because we're us!"" ""I'm with you!"" but the EN version is ""This is some kind of trick!"" ""A dumb one at that!"" or when Djeeta wins, the trio say something like ""Let's keep it up!"" but the EN sub just says ""Hooray!"" and when the trio say ""Yay!"" the EN sub says nothing.


[b]FEATURES/MISC:[/b]
- Friend told me RPG mode is basically non-existent compared to the first game, to the point that it's not even an RPG mode anymore. They are very sad about it. I see several people complaining on the Steam forums too.

- Can't disable audio turning off when alt-tabbing.

- Can't display Playstation button icons.

- No character color customization. That kind of thing is super easy to implement, yet so many games lack it.

- AI at nightmare mode is extremely easy. I beat it first try, losing maybe 2 rounds, even though I don't know how to play at all.

- If you changed your Windows interface size, you need to edit the executable properties to allow for proper screen scaling. Common problem with all Unreal Engine games.

- Sometimes freezes for a brief second for seemingly no reason, even in offline. I have an 5900X and RTX4090 with everything set on max.


[b]CONCLUSION:[/b]

I'd say it's probably best to stick to the free version, until a decent sale. Unless you intend to pay the price of two full AAA games, just to play a few characters that you actually care about.

I mean, seriously. I doubt anyone who buys this game actually cares about every single character in it. So most people aren't getting their money's worth. And before anyone says, ""the price of a game isn't just the characters"", I'm going by their logic of charging high prices for characters.",1702550655,1702550655,True,5,0,0.498082906007766724,0,True,False,False

If anything it was held back by the fact that it's online would just SLOG with anyone not even in the same city, more less state with you, and if one pal was on PS4/5 and another on PC, you'd have to double dip or just not play together. Rising in turn is this games second lease on life and it for sure ensures to solve these two major issues outright. Though it's not -perfect- and in many ways things where lost between revisions.

To start off Cross-play and rollback are both here, and both work extremely well at that. I've played with people all over the globe doing the Open Beta, and even with the little bit I got to do after obtaining this and writing the review, it's only stayed as solid at that. The few times it really can't hold a connection the game does it's best to still be playable instead of a river of lag, and for that it just makes for a far better player experience.  Lobbies are now a snap to make, more less the larger scale lobby has far more to do in it then just que up for best of 3's. Add in some new features that make the pacing of fights far more faster in turn, and the game feels like it's gotten quite the glow up indeed. Then we start talking about the offerings for single player/co-op and the hammer falls...

Long and short, a lot of the hours I put into the first revision of the game was in due part of it's RPG Story mode. Unlock characters, use them in beat-em-up side scrolling stages and get gear that in turn became both cosmetics for the vs. mode experience along with items that where used to enhance your stats doing said RPG Mode. It all fed into each other quite well and progress in RPG never felt like it wasn't rewarding you with something that also carried over to normal gameplay. You even could co-op with a friend online to beat epic scaled bosses and it gave you a way to play with a friend that wasn't just about beating each others faces in. Come Rising though, this mode has been greatly downsized into a very barebones story crawl with some story fights, but you no longer can use 'anyone' for these fights, hard locked to key characters at that. Yet the greatest sin is that for all of the work you do in this mode, nothing but achievement clears matter in the full game. All of the gear is from the gatcha in online lobbies, all of the other stuff is via character progression by playing online vs. matches. IMO this much of an axe cut towards this mode felt like a concession to try to make it just 'easier' to see the story w/o the gear and grind gimmicks of before, yet as a result it feels vastly more lukewarm and it's only passable story can't carry the experience.

Does losing out on a far more robust story mode suck? Yeah, it really does. Is it worth going back to the more slower paced base game for this mode? That's where I still have to give Rising the thumbs up as for this major loss, it still refines what was there and does so much -right- it's going to kill me to ever go back to base ever again. So I could still vote this as a wonderful 'entry' fighting game with a LOT more spice to go around learning and getting used towards, and things you learn/master here can springboard into the large pool of other fighters out in the sea of games. Yet as a single player/co-op game, I feel like this ends up more of the same you'll see in so many other fighters and as a result can leave you waning. What I can suggest is give the F2P trial a go, and see how it feels to play and if you enjoy what you see, go for it.",1702549790,1702549790,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Custom Illustrations
   * You can choose character select portraits from the previous game.
      * They're right next to costumes, which us anime fighter fans aren't used to having!
 
- Grand Bruise Legends!
   * Mario party/Fall Guys-esque chaos.
     * This means players have reason to get on even if they don't wanna sweat. Cooling off on things like this can make players decide to then grind again while already on, creating potentially new fighting game players.

- GuestBook
   * Cursed community posts. If you know you know. Haha

- Free to play option
   * Grand Bruise Legends!
   * Includes a bit of its RPG Story
   * Online versus mode 
   * 4 rotating characters

- Lobby Mini-Games

- Partners! 
  * Your waifu/husbando/oshi shall cheer you on between rounds (or L's)

- Prismatic Weapons for Mastery points (much shiny)

- RPG Story Mode
  * The RPG aspect has been reduced in the update, but it's no less a lovely experience that pairs well with the previous story. It is super unique and I'm glad there's something like this in a fighting game.
  * Brand new character that doesn't exist in the gacha, Rein. Imo she'll be DLC, as she serves as an extra funnel for curious gacha players. It reminds me of DBFZ getting Android 21!

All in all this game is really making a comeback. They could've just stopped at rollback/crossplay, the things they were previously ridiculed for,  but they're putting so much into this game that it really feels like a dream fighter. 

The SFX/VFX are satisfying, combos have been expanded, yet it isn't 20+ inputs or something. GBVSR has it's own niche in the anime fighter genre of being more more grounded, fundamentals experience. Think of it like the ""Street Fighter"" of anime fighters.

Things like Under-night, Melty Blood are more chaotic, and about zipping around like a fly with absurd hitboxes. I love those games to death, but they're just different and Granblue has created it's own fee, you know? There's space for both! 

It's obvious that I highly, highly recommend this game. It even has a free version, so why not try it out? I'd say it's literally the perfect game to get your friends into who maybe aren't familiar with the genre! Andd guess what?

There's more Grand Bruise and Lobby mini-games are confirmed in the future, as well as DLC character news confirmed at Granblue Fes on December 23rd!

Great aesthetics, fun combos, and engaging gameplay with excellent Arcsys netcode make GBVSR a perfect fighting game to add to any gamer's lineup alongside whatever else they play. Most of the roster is really cool, too, and tempts experimentation on alternate characters in a way that most fighting games cannot match.

The default keys are WASD to navigate and some combination of UIOPJKL and semicolon to select things in the menu.
You're just supposed to know this from playing other arcsys games.
These cannot ever be changed, although there is a bug where the UI will change depending on what you put in your settings.

Modern fighting games have made tons of changes to the gameplay to bring in new audiences, but arcsys is still stuck in a mentality where they expect 100% of players buy a fightstick or controller to play.

If you're just picking this up to try out and haven't bought a console controller, it's painfully clear from the very first second that you are a second class citizen who the devs don't care about and cant bother testing for.",1702536872,1702536872,False,95,66,0.373903721570968628,1,True,False,False
